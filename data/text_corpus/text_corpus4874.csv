24370,the article presents a study of the system of indicators characterizing the forest industry and the reproduction of forest resources of territories a hierarchical classification of the subjects of the volga federal district of the russian federation by indicators characterizing the resource potential of logging regions and organizations the results of logging organizations the state of forest resources and environment has been performed the classification of the system of indicators of timber industry from the position of cluster analysis was first performed clusters with high medium and low levels of forestry development and reforestation have been identified regions are set for the selected clusters the formation of clusters will make it possible to more efficiently use the forest resources of the district will contribute to interregional cooperation obtaining a larger total income combining experience and efforts in the field of forest resources reproduction much attention is paid to the reproduction of forest resources regions of the volga federal district are characterized by better indicators of reforestation reproduction of forest resources their safety compared to the value of indicators of the russian federation in the regions of cluster 1 where forest lands occupy a significant share of the area less grain is produced per capita than in other clusters or average in the district and across russia the highest value of grain per capita is produced in the regions of cluster 2 the regions of cluster 3 are characterized by the average level of crop and livestock production per capita quite developed agriculture total contribution of agriculture and forestry to gross regional product in the regions of this cluster is the highest 9 6 which exceeds the average level both for the district and for russia as a whole the regions of cluster 3 also have the largest share of investments in fixed capital by economic activity agriculture forestry and fishing in total investments it is also partly the result of the fact that in this cluster the largest share of intramural current expenditures on r d on agricultural sciences 6 74 of total intramural current expenditures on r d this result confirms the hypotheses put forward about the need for a scientifically grounded approach to the processes of reforestation agriculture and forestry attracting investments in fixed capital of this type of economic activity the formation of clusters will make it possible to more efficiently use the forest resources of the district will contribute to interregional cooperation obtaining a larger total income combining experience and efforts in the field of forest resources reproduction keywords timber industry reproduction of forest resources multiple classification cluster forestry and logging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests cover 31 of the global land area but are not equally distributed around the globe the total forest area is 4 06 billion hectares more than half of the world s forests are found in only five countries russian federation 20 of the world s forests brazil 12 canada 9 united states of america 8 and china 5 of the world s forests forests supply water mitigate climate change and provide habitats for many pollinators which are essential for sustainable food production in absolute terms the global forest area decreased by 178 million hectares between 1990 and 2020 the rate of forest loss is decreasing globally and solutions that balance conservation and sustainable use of forest biodiversity do exist to turn the tide on deforestation and biodiversity loss urgently need to see these solutions being scaled up as well as instill transformational change in the way produce and consume food also need to conserve and manage forests and trees within an integrated landscape approach and reverse the damage done through forest restoration efforts fao and unep 2020 russian federation which has the largest share of the world s forests organizes the processes of rational forest use and the corresponding reproduction of forest resources affects the state of forests and makes a significant contribution to the conservation of forests on a global scale the area of forest land in russian federation is 870 7 million hectares or 50 8 of the total area of the country 2019 total timber resources are 82 8 billion cubic meters federal state statistics service of the russian federation n d this allows the country to occupy a leading position in the production and world trade of forest products however natural resources and especially forests are currently underestimated as a resource that can form the development potential of the country and its regions having a rich forest sector at different levels of use and management neither the population of the country nor the business structure nor the enterprises of the timber industry complex nor the authorities and local self government are able to competently use and develop it in order to increase and at the same time efficient use in the long term dynamics the total timber resources of russia decreased from 83 4 billion cubic meters in 2010 to 82 8 billion cubic meters in 2018 burnt forest land increased from 1962 thousand hectares in 2010 to 7408 thousand hectares in 2018 at the same time the volume of export of wood pulp and paper products from the country is increasing from 9574 million us dollars 2 4 of total exports in 2010 to 13 911 million us dollars 3 1 of total exports in 2018 federal state statistics service of the russian federation n d thus the challenge of time is to ensure the reproduction of forest resources corresponding to the consumption gul et al 2019 note that one of the main tasks in forest reproduction is timely and high quality reforestation including artificial forest regeneration using innovative technologies the problems of depletion of forests and their restoration are found in many countries of the world gustavo zarrilli 2016 frey et al 2018 what about new knowledge it should be noted that in the study of agriculture and forestry various economic mathematical and statistical methods and models are widely used optimization models make it possible to calculate the rational parameters of equipment operation the effectiveness of types of work both in the timber industry complex and in the reproduction of forest resources khasanov et al 2020 factor analysis and time series analysis are used in studies of the sustainable development of certain sectors of agriculture and forestry in particular beekeeping as an industry that can develop in the presence of forests sultanova et al 2019 interdependencies analysis is applied to assess the potential of urban forests to capture urban air emissions to understand the potential for climate change mitigation elliot et al 2020 a discrete choice experiment allowed analyzing the preferences of spanish society for operational programs for the breeding and conservation of forests solino et al 2020 these facts confirm the relevance of scientific research in the field of forestry forest management and reforestation a feature of forest resource studies is the need to use long time series this is due to the biological characteristics of trees which take many years to grow to an adult state thus the process of forest reproduction is also a rather long term process most investigations are limited to approximately 25 years of fao forest cover data and most feature sets of developing countries these are short time series for a resource like forests the paucity of evidence from developed countries is another weakness caravaggio 2020 the importance of the availability of information over a long period is emphasized by various studies with specific applied results so the study of the time series of the availability and reproduction of forest resources scots pine pinussylvestris l showed that adaption to new climatic conditions it is optimal to increase the number of standing trees and to reduce the age of the logged trees the failure to adapt the management regime has clear implications on the profitability of forests javier mur et al 2014 the study of dynamics is applied to different types of forests birch plantations ferm 1993 quercus sober forests carrico et al 2018 all this indicates the relevance of the study of forests the development of production of the timber industry complex piazza and roy 2020 studied reforestation on land used for other economic activities this introduces some irreversibility in the process of deforestation modeled the effect of such irreversibility reforestation cost on the efficiency of forest conservation in a general model of optimal forest management where trees are classified in age classes and land has alternative economic use in the form of use under agricultural land for industrial and civil construction for roads etc adding a profit function to forest economics will be a major step forward in advancing the disciplinary instruction in determining the optimal volume and the concomitant net present worth of timber production li et al 2020 methods of dynamic and static analysis of the effectiveness of tax administration in forest management are used of the research on tax administration in the forest management system lazhentsevet al 2020 daigneault et al 2020 analyzed the impact of us tax reform on forest resources based on a dynamic global forest model increased tax rates faced by forest owners are causing forest assets to be revalued downward resulting in significant reductions in both recovery and management timber resources decrease over time and reflect a decrease in investment forest insurance issues are reflected in the research of loisel et al 2020 cluster analysis was used to compute the economic contribution of multiple sectors of the commercial logging forestry products pulp and paper mills and paper products for us states jolley et al 2020 there is experience in application a two period timber and amenity production model to assess the hardwood harvesting choices of different forest owner groups at the stand level by utilizing usda forest service forest inventory analysis fia data for nine southern states sun and zhang 2020 the underestimation of forests as a natural resource that is significant for the health of population forest resources as production resources the need for numerous different studies modeling the economy of forest use and reforestation gave rise to this study the cluster analysis method will allow to analyze the homogeneity of the observed regions determined by a set of indicators characterizing their behavior in the daily practice of forestry the choice of the volga federal district is due to the fact that in all regions of this district there are forest lands forest industry enterprises operate while various types of economic activities are widely developed this makes regions of the district typical for most territories of the globe with different natural and climatic conditions the timber industry complex was among the industries most affected by sanctions restrictions this is due to the fact that a significant proportion of its products primarily plywood was export oriented to western europe which introduced a complete ban on supplies from russia hence the main problem is the loss of developed markets and well established supply chains it was exacerbated by the strengthening of the ruble and the corresponding decrease in foreign exchange earnings of exporters negative trends are growing in the domestic timber market due to falling prices and sales uncertainty a common problem for enterprises of all levels of the timber industry from logging to furniture was the lack of imported materials machinery equipment and spare parts there was a real threat of bankruptcy of many enterprises and unemployment now there is a shortage of oak veneer it is needed for the production of valuable furniture at the same time measures are being taken to protect forests from fires the fire fighting budget has grown in 2022 the staff has been increased by 1 4 thousand to 4 5 thousand people there are more special equipment we can involve 72 5 thousand units in extinguishing last year there were 65 9 it is possible to harvest 600 million cubic meters per year in russia without damage to forests in reality only 220 m3 are harvested there is a reserve it is necessary that the turnover of wood be controlled and understandable since january 1 2022 any movement of wood across the country is accompanied by electronic documents and this is pushing the so called black loggers into at least a gray zone balances are visible almost in real time a database of genetic data of the main forest forming species the level of their biological stability and genetic variability is being formed this data can be used to combat illegal logging the federal state information system of the forestry complex is being created the system consolidates all industry data and will become the basis for the implementation of public services and functions in the field of forestry it will allow receiving processing storing and visualizing on forest maps information about the state of the forest fund including quantitative and qualitative characteristics of forests as well as information about their use protection protection and reproduction a space survey of forests is being carried out this is a modern innovation in forestry work the main advantage of this method is a large scale diagnostics of the state of forest plantations which is difficult to organize on the ground satellite images make it possible to assess the state of forests over a large area with high efficiency and at the lowest cost the purpose of this study is to cluster the regions of the volga federal district of the russian federation according to indicators characterizing the activities of organizations of forestry and timber industry complex to identify patterns and prospects for further development in accordance with the purpose the objectives of the study are to develop a scorecard for analysis today there are scattered data on the state of forests which often do not provide reliable information therefore a system of indicators is required to assess and model the scenario and prospects for the development of forestry to identify the proportions in the development of the forestry economy and the processes of reforestation based on the allocation of clusters to determine the relationship between the values of indicators for identify the mechanisms that form processes in forestry the innovation of our work is in the application of multidimensional classification methods to the study of the economics of forestry forest management and reforestation it is impossible to change the location of forests territorially but it is possible to form clusters from the standpoint of principles and approaches to the organization of forestry to develop the application of experience in successful forestry management the clusters made it possible to identify the main patterns in the economics of forestry the influence of factors on the indicators of forest management and reforestation federal forestry agency 2022 2 materials and methods a multidimensional grouping of the regions of the volga federal district of the russian federation was carry out using the cluster analysis method to study the level of the activities of logging organizations and reforestation cluster analysis allows to create scientifically grounded groups clusters and to identify internal connections in the regions of the federal district the classification is carry out for all indicators at the same time cluster analysis allows to take into account many different factors select groups with the inclusion of all indicators we want to unite different areas in the study of forests in their significance for society and the economy therefore we decided to apply the cluster analysis method cluster analysis is one of the most interesting fashionable modern methods of classification it allows you to work with a variety of observations and a variety of indicators of different directions cluster analysis is closest in terms of concepts and its essence to the system approach a systematic approach allows you to critically analyze problem situations and develop an action strategy we presented the idea and sequence of cluster analysis fig 1 the sources of information were the data of official statistics on the type of activity agriculture forestry and fishing to build clusters according to indicators characterizing the activities of logging organizations indicators used by region in 2018 indicators are present in the publications of the federal state statistics service of the russian federation n d 12 indicators were selected from statistical indicators characterizing the forestry economy of the regions all indicators are relative values this allows comparing regions of different sizes based on the study of the literature these indicators conventionally combined into three groups table 1 cluster analysis was performed using the program statistica 6 0 the classification used standardized coefficients hierarchical dendrogram built for 14 regions of the volga federal district the most stable results were obtained using the full coupling method the euclidean distance metric 3 results separation of the regions of the volga federal district into three clusters was obtained as a result of the study fig 2 groups are presented in table 2 the first cluster is represented by 3 regions which is 21 4 of the total number of the studied totality the second cluster contains 3 regions 21 4 the third cluster is the most representative and contains 8 regions 57 1 of the total number of the studied totality the regions in clusters are territorially rather scattered the characteristics and values of the indicators of clusters by region are shown in table 3 the indicators in the clusters take on very different values cluster 1 is characterized by the largest share of forest land in the total area of the region but the smallest timber resources per one logging organization this is a consequence of the fact that a large number of small enterprises operate in the regions of this cluster with an average annual number of employees per one organization 6 people 14 2 thousand dense timber cubic meters of untreated wood is produced per one enterprise which is the smallest indicator among the clusters however the most untreated wood is produced per employee the smallest value of export and import of timber from the regions of the cluster indicates the developed processing of timber within the regions the use of timber within the regions for their own needs having the smallest timber resources enterprises use their resources quite intensively as a result of which per 1 hectare of reforestation area the volume of timber produced is the largest among clusters 256 0 m3 however must pay tribute to the regions of this cluster the area of reforestation in percent of the area of forest land is the largest among the clusters 0 73 expenditures on environmental protection is 1 05 of gross regional product the regions of cluster 1 have the smallest number of forest fires respectively the smallest burnt forest land in relative terms cluster 2 is characterized by the smallest share of forest land in the total area of the region and the activity of a small number of large logging organization most of the timber resources per one organization is located in the regions of this cluster however enterprises are not sufficiently engaged in the processes of reforestation reforestation area is 0 17 of forest land area the lowest value expenditures on environmental protection are 0 79 of gross regional product also the lowest value among clusters burnt forest land takes the greatest value 0 15 forest land area the regions of cluster 2 are strongly encouraged to strengthen the processes of reforestation protection of the state of forest areas more rational use of the available timber resources forest resources and introduce effective technologies for wood processing cluster 3 the most numerous is characterized by average indicators of resource potential average size of logging organizations average timber resources at the same time the share of the type of economic activity agriculture forestry and fishing is the largest in this cluster 9 6 in gross value added the enterprises of this cluster are actively engaged in international cooperation carry out the largest export of wood pulp and paper products per one logging organization reforestation processes in this cluster are at an average level in the district managers of logging organizations in the regions of this cluster have found the most optimal solutions in the field of management of available resources their reproduction sales of manufactured products in general regions of the volga federal district are characterized by better indicators of reforestation reproduction of forest resources their safety compared to the value of indicators of the russian federation this indicates the interest of the regions in rational use of available forest resources area of which in relative terms is smaller than in russia as a whole which make it possible to form a significant share of gross regional product we will additionally characterize the identified clusters with some indicators for the purpose of their complex analysis within the framework and directions indicated in this study food production science health of population of territory table 4 in the regions of cluster 1 where forest lands occupy a significant share of the area less grain is produced per capita than in other clusters or average in the district and across russia the highest value of grain per capita is produced in the regions of cluster 2 earlier it was recommended to these regions to strengthen the processes of reforestation protection of the state of forests which is confirmed by more intensive agricultural production the regions of cluster 3 are characterized by the average level of crop and livestock production per capita quite developed agriculture total contribution of agriculture and forestry to gross regional product in the regions of this cluster is the highest 9 6 which exceeds the average level both for the district and for russia as a whole the regions of cluster 3 also have the largest share of investments in fixed capital by economic activity agriculture forestry and fishing in total investments it is also partly the result of the fact that in this cluster the largest share of intramural current expenditures on r d on agricultural sciences 6 74 of total intramural current expenditures on r d this result confirms the hypotheses put forward about the need for a scientifically grounded approach to the processes of reforestation agriculture and forestry attracting investments in fixed capital of this type of economic activity the highest value of the volume index of environmental protection costs is observed in the regions of cluster 3 112 8 of previous year which indicates intensified actions for environmental protection the lowest morbidity by main classes is observed in this cluster 810 per 1000 population at the same time the largest share of organizations engaged in innovation providing better environmental safety in the production of goods works and services 14 4 of the total number of organizations engaged in environmental innovation is observed in the regions of cluster 2 as a result of cluster analysis groups of regions of the federal district were identified according to several indicators which made it possible to take them into account on an equal footing in the distribution to combine the most similar regions to identify trends and patterns in the organization of forestry and reforestation cluster analysis in the economy of forest management and reproduction of forest resources on the example of the regions of the volga federal district was carried out for the first time analysis has pushed the boundaries of statistical science the analysis made it possible to formulate specific recommendations for the regions to improve the efficiency of forestry and forest conservation 4 discussion critical to implementing sustainable forest management and reforestation models are effective governance policy alignment between sectors and administrative levels land tenure security respect for the rights and knowledge of local communities and indigenous peoples enhanced capacity for monitoring of biodiversity outcomes and by no means least innovative financing modalities fao and unep 2020 research results show and confirm conclusions about the innovative views of necessity of creation and development of essentially new kinds of business in the sphere of forestry involving businessmen as full subjects of carrying out scientific researches within the frames of the sustainable development and reproduction business concept considering them as a potential reserve of scientific and pedagogical staff of educational establishments preshkinandpreshkina 2014 forest management and reforestation processes must be scientifically based forest resources are an element of the national wealth of the country the ecological situation and the health of the population depend on their availability and condition at the same time reforestation is a long term process covering tens and hundreds of years that is why for the sake of a healthy life for today s and future generations for the sake of nature conservation the use and restoration of forest resources should take into account both the interests of forest users and national interests these conclusions are confirmed by the results of our present study now the value assessment of wood resources is underestimated because of unreal value in use that leads to decrease of the wood income insufficient interest of the state structures to an estimation of potential competence of forest engineers for realizations of professional activity because of considerable presence of not profile scientific and pedagogical staff for training of engineers for forest industries of economy is observed preshkinandpreshkina 2014 kovalenko et al 2019 note that in relation to forest land the owner has the right to sell all or part of it in accordance with the procedures and rules established by law society is willing to pay for research in these directions above all research on greater resistance to biotic risks solino et al 2020 this proves our assumptions that today research in the field of forest resources reforestation is necessary and financially justified it is necessary to use innovative technologies for forest growing at the present stage of development of forestry in russia based on the results of the investment analysis positive effects of the processes of building forest selection and seed centers on the processes of reforestation have been found management of reforestation processes with the use of innovative technologies allows solving the tasks of mass production of forest seedlings and reproduction of forests in a short time the necessity of building forest selection seed centers in the regions of russia has been proved ivanova et al 2018 the obtained results are the basis for solving practical problems of integrated management of forest resources svyntukh 2015 based on the example of studies of walnut forests in the silk road countries it can be seen that conducive economic policies well funded national walnut breeding programs and economic incentive schemes could effectively promote the establishment of walnut plantations which both considerably contribute to the reclamation and rehabilitation of degraded lands and the diversification of farming systems at the same time further efforts are needed in walnut research and practice to improve existing value chain arrangements develop novel products from j regia and other underutilized forest species and to more effectively monitor resources and enforce existing legal frameworks shigaevaanddarr 2020 these measures are also applicable to the selected groups of regions for the further development of the timber industry complex the search for new industries high cost of reforestation discourages expansion of forests but at the same time makes it optimal to conserve a minimal forested area in the long run in particular it is optimal to maintain a forested area above a critical size if the initial forest cover lies above it while forests that are initially smaller than the critical level are optimally managed at constant size piazza and roy 2020 characterize the exact condition under which it is optimal to avoid total deforestation the extent of irreversibility does not matter for this our study also shows that with an average degree of forest exploitation with proper management it is possible to organize effective reforestation forest industry and institutional timberland owners are more likely to do partial harvests than non industrial private forest landowners all owners are less likely to harvest if there is a high possibility of generating revenues from amenities sun and zhang 2020 thus there is an understanding of the importance of preserving forests the possibility of alternative use of forests arrangement of forest lands in modern society some research shows how communities which are differentially integrated into the global economy are excluded from natural resources through complex means gabitov et al 2019 sugdenand punch 2014 the study of the economics of forest management and reforestation is associated with the social issues of society plantation forests provide numerous benefits to local communities that regularly interact with them local communities mainly plant and grow plantation forests for fuelwood construction materials source of fodder and income generation the determinant factors predicting the dependencies of local communities on plantation forests and their levels of participation on management activities are study by the example of ethiopia to collect data a survey questionnaire was developed by considering demographic socioeconomic bio physical and institutional factors descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression models were applied to analyze and interpret the data the multiple linear regression models revealed that several independent variables derived from demographic i e sex age and family size socioeconomic i e level of education annual income livestock ownership want to keep more livestock than they have at present length of residence in the area have the plan to stay in the area in the future and have enough labor to manage the tree seedlings planted in their landholdings bio physical i e distance between the nearby access road and the land of the respondents where they planted and grew trees and institutional i e have planted trees in their landholdings get incentives to plant and grow trees in their landholdings and have sufficient market to sell their plantation forest products obtained from their landholdings factors significantly affected and predicted the two groups of the dependent variables i e the dependencies of local communities on plantation forests 49 variance explained and their levels of participation on management activities 53 variance explained these models can help policy and decision makers land use planners environmental analysts conservation and forest management experts to take into account the factors that influence the dependence of local communities on afforestation and their level of participation in economic activities tadesse andteketay 2020 andersson and lidestav 2016 and bergsten et al 2020 look at gender aspects of forest management and forestry mann 2001 research the forestry labor market need to transform food systems to halt deforestation and the loss of biodiversity the biggest transformational change is needed in the way in which produce and consume food must move away from the current situation where the demand for food is resulting in inappropriate agricultural practices that drive large scale conversion of forests to agricultural production and the loss of forest related biodiversity agribusinesses must meet their commitments to deforestation free commodity chains and companies that have not made zero deforestation commitments should do so commodity investors should adopt business models that are environmentally and socially responsible these actions will in many cases require a revision of current policies in particular fiscal policies and regulatory frameworks fao and unep 2020 it is necessary to highlight the special role of tax administration in forest management in forestry development programs ways of improving tax administration of the forest usage in the northern territories based on the introduction of information technologies state and public control over forest usage and support services for taxpayers are being developed lazhentsev et al 2020 when analyzing the issues of pricing it is noted that the final timber yield is more elastic in price and income than partial for all owners both at the stand level and at the aggregate level khasanov et al 2020 at the methodological level it is noted that adding a profit function to forest economics will be a major step forward in advancing the disciplinary instruction in determining the optimal volume and the concomitant net present worth of timber production li et al 2020 forest restoration when implemented appropriately helps restore habitats and ecosystems create jobs and income and is an effective nature based solution to climate change the united nations decade on ecosystem restoration 2021 2030 announced in march 2019 aims to accelerate ecosystem restoration action worldwide forests are increasingly recognized for their role as a nature based solution to many sustainable development challenges as manifest in strengthened political will and a series of commitments to reduce rates of deforestation and to restore degraded forest ecosystems fao andunep 2020 albers et al 2020 our research has contributed to the study of forest economics on the basis of a clear system of indicators groups of regions were identified and the challenges facing the industry were identified 5 conclusions 12 indicators were selected from statistical indicators characterizing the forestry economy of the regions these indicators are conventionally combined into three groups indicators characterizing the resource potential of logging regions and organizations indicators characterizing the results of logging organizations indicators characterizing the state of forest resources and environment the classification of the system of indicators of timber industry from the position of cluster analysis was first performed the formation of clusters will make it possible to more efficiently use the forest resources of the district will contribute to interregional cooperation obtaining a larger total income combining experience and efforts in the field of forest resources reproduction cluster analysis is a rather informative method for studying the economic development of the timber industry complex of regions the cluster approach and the functioning of the forestry clusters the joint work of universities enterprises and the state are capable of ensuring the development of enterprises and the preservation of forests as a national treasure the practical significance of the study consists in the development of specific recommendations for the regions of a particular cluster in the possibility of their systematic interaction with each other the limits of the application of the method are associated with the territorial location of the regions with the limited information base of the analysis the development of statistical monitoring in the field of forestry will contribute to the development of research ensuring the conservation of forest land forest resources and timber resources both for domestic use and for exports further development of the research methodology is seen in the construction of an integral indicator of forest use and reforestation the use of multiple regression models to analyze the factors affecting the profitability and efficiency of enterprises therefore their ability and motivation for more intensive reforestation emergence of covid 19 joins a collection of evidence that local and global health are influenced by human interactions with the natural environment environment resource and development economists are called to develop and analyze empirically grounded models of people s decisions about interacting with the environment integrating the decisions that drive human environment interactions with ecological and epidemiological research in an interdisciplinary approach to understanding pathogen transmission will inform policy needed to improve both conservation and disease spread outcomes these scientific areas are also an area for further development in cooperation with scientists in the field of medicine which is currently being carried out by the authors of this study full reforestation is needed for effective work a forest management plan should be prepared not for a year but for 10 years the main organizational difficulty is caring for the planted forest due to the fact that the process stretches for decades reforestation today may be hindered by a significant increase in prices for planting material within the framework of a public private partnership it is necessary to address the issues of import substitution of equipment for growing seedlings as well as provide for subsidizing part of the costs of forest users when using planting material with a closed root system one of the significant measures will be the reimbursement of part of the costs for the construction of forest selection and seed centers to tenants the task is to raise wages and improve working conditions in forestry the tree was and remains a valuable resource one of the areas of development is wooden housing construction after the entry into force of the export ban the development of processing is one of the key areas measures to mitigate the negative consequences of the imposed sanctions support for enterprises implementing priority investment projects stimulation of demand in the domestic market assistance in organizing exports to other countries we must be prepared for the fact that russian forests will be considered the worst and most unnecessary forests in the world we must act proactively not defend ourselves not make excuses but more insistently demand recognition of our real absorbing abilities it is green diplomacy that can become the basis for restoring relations with a number of countries at present there is not enough systematic and extensive data on the russian forest in particular in order to reasonably conduct a dialog with other countries with the attention of the world community focused on the issue of climate change markets are becoming increasingly sensitive to the environmental agenda business can be helped by the implementation of climate projects aimed at protecting forests from fires protecting them from pests reforestation and afforestation and the introduction of intensive forestry technologies in order to increase the openness of data on forests it is proposed to strengthen control over regional forest management bodies in terms of the completeness and quality of posting the data provided for by law on websites publish materials of the state forest inventory in full including primary data develop and implement a digital form of a forest pathological survey report as well as ensure the mandatory indefinite storage of all acts in a centralized

24370,the article presents a study of the system of indicators characterizing the forest industry and the reproduction of forest resources of territories a hierarchical classification of the subjects of the volga federal district of the russian federation by indicators characterizing the resource potential of logging regions and organizations the results of logging organizations the state of forest resources and environment has been performed the classification of the system of indicators of timber industry from the position of cluster analysis was first performed clusters with high medium and low levels of forestry development and reforestation have been identified regions are set for the selected clusters the formation of clusters will make it possible to more efficiently use the forest resources of the district will contribute to interregional cooperation obtaining a larger total income combining experience and efforts in the field of forest resources reproduction much attention is paid to the reproduction of forest resources regions of the volga federal district are characterized by better indicators of reforestation reproduction of forest resources their safety compared to the value of indicators of the russian federation in the regions of cluster 1 where forest lands occupy a significant share of the area less grain is produced per capita than in other clusters or average in the district and across russia the highest value of grain per capita is produced in the regions of cluster 2 the regions of cluster 3 are characterized by the average level of crop and livestock production per capita quite developed agriculture total contribution of agriculture and forestry to gross regional product in the regions of this cluster is the highest 9 6 which exceeds the average level both for the district and for russia as a whole the regions of cluster 3 also have the largest share of investments in fixed capital by economic activity agriculture forestry and fishing in total investments it is also partly the result of the fact that in this cluster the largest share of intramural current expenditures on r d on agricultural sciences 6 74 of total intramural current expenditures on r d this result confirms the hypotheses put forward about the need for a scientifically grounded approach to the processes of reforestation agriculture and forestry attracting investments in fixed capital of this type of economic activity the formation of clusters will make it possible to more efficiently use the forest resources of the district will contribute to interregional cooperation obtaining a larger total income combining experience and efforts in the field of forest resources reproduction keywords timber industry reproduction of forest resources multiple classification cluster forestry and logging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests cover 31 of the global land area but are not equally distributed around the globe the total forest area is 4 06 billion hectares more than half of the world s forests are found in only five countries russian federation 20 of the world s forests brazil 12 canada 9 united states of america 8 and china 5 of the world s forests forests supply water mitigate climate change and provide habitats for many pollinators which are essential for sustainable food production in absolute terms the global forest area decreased by 178 million hectares between 1990 and 2020 the rate of forest loss is decreasing globally and solutions that balance conservation and sustainable use of forest biodiversity do exist to turn the tide on deforestation and biodiversity loss urgently need to see these solutions being scaled up as well as instill transformational change in the way produce and consume food also need to conserve and manage forests and trees within an integrated landscape approach and reverse the damage done through forest restoration efforts fao and unep 2020 russian federation which has the largest share of the world s forests organizes the processes of rational forest use and the corresponding reproduction of forest resources affects the state of forests and makes a significant contribution to the conservation of forests on a global scale the area of forest land in russian federation is 870 7 million hectares or 50 8 of the total area of the country 2019 total timber resources are 82 8 billion cubic meters federal state statistics service of the russian federation n d this allows the country to occupy a leading position in the production and world trade of forest products however natural resources and especially forests are currently underestimated as a resource that can form the development potential of the country and its regions having a rich forest sector at different levels of use and management neither the population of the country nor the business structure nor the enterprises of the timber industry complex nor the authorities and local self government are able to competently use and develop it in order to increase and at the same time efficient use in the long term dynamics the total timber resources of russia decreased from 83 4 billion cubic meters in 2010 to 82 8 billion cubic meters in 2018 burnt forest land increased from 1962 thousand hectares in 2010 to 7408 thousand hectares in 2018 at the same time the volume of export of wood pulp and paper products from the country is increasing from 9574 million us dollars 2 4 of total exports in 2010 to 13 911 million us dollars 3 1 of total exports in 2018 federal state statistics service of the russian federation n d thus the challenge of time is to ensure the reproduction of forest resources corresponding to the consumption gul et al 2019 note that one of the main tasks in forest reproduction is timely and high quality reforestation including artificial forest regeneration using innovative technologies the problems of depletion of forests and their restoration are found in many countries of the world gustavo zarrilli 2016 frey et al 2018 what about new knowledge it should be noted that in the study of agriculture and forestry various economic mathematical and statistical methods and models are widely used optimization models make it possible to calculate the rational parameters of equipment operation the effectiveness of types of work both in the timber industry complex and in the reproduction of forest resources khasanov et al 2020 factor analysis and time series analysis are used in studies of the sustainable development of certain sectors of agriculture and forestry in particular beekeeping as an industry that can develop in the presence of forests sultanova et al 2019 interdependencies analysis is applied to assess the potential of urban forests to capture urban air emissions to understand the potential for climate change mitigation elliot et al 2020 a discrete choice experiment allowed analyzing the preferences of spanish society for operational programs for the breeding and conservation of forests solino et al 2020 these facts confirm the relevance of scientific research in the field of forestry forest management and reforestation a feature of forest resource studies is the need to use long time series this is due to the biological characteristics of trees which take many years to grow to an adult state thus the process of forest reproduction is also a rather long term process most investigations are limited to approximately 25 years of fao forest cover data and most feature sets of developing countries these are short time series for a resource like forests the paucity of evidence from developed countries is another weakness caravaggio 2020 the importance of the availability of information over a long period is emphasized by various studies with specific applied results so the study of the time series of the availability and reproduction of forest resources scots pine pinussylvestris l showed that adaption to new climatic conditions it is optimal to increase the number of standing trees and to reduce the age of the logged trees the failure to adapt the management regime has clear implications on the profitability of forests javier mur et al 2014 the study of dynamics is applied to different types of forests birch plantations ferm 1993 quercus sober forests carrico et al 2018 all this indicates the relevance of the study of forests the development of production of the timber industry complex piazza and roy 2020 studied reforestation on land used for other economic activities this introduces some irreversibility in the process of deforestation modeled the effect of such irreversibility reforestation cost on the efficiency of forest conservation in a general model of optimal forest management where trees are classified in age classes and land has alternative economic use in the form of use under agricultural land for industrial and civil construction for roads etc adding a profit function to forest economics will be a major step forward in advancing the disciplinary instruction in determining the optimal volume and the concomitant net present worth of timber production li et al 2020 methods of dynamic and static analysis of the effectiveness of tax administration in forest management are used of the research on tax administration in the forest management system lazhentsevet al 2020 daigneault et al 2020 analyzed the impact of us tax reform on forest resources based on a dynamic global forest model increased tax rates faced by forest owners are causing forest assets to be revalued downward resulting in significant reductions in both recovery and management timber resources decrease over time and reflect a decrease in investment forest insurance issues are reflected in the research of loisel et al 2020 cluster analysis was used to compute the economic contribution of multiple sectors of the commercial logging forestry products pulp and paper mills and paper products for us states jolley et al 2020 there is experience in application a two period timber and amenity production model to assess the hardwood harvesting choices of different forest owner groups at the stand level by utilizing usda forest service forest inventory analysis fia data for nine southern states sun and zhang 2020 the underestimation of forests as a natural resource that is significant for the health of population forest resources as production resources the need for numerous different studies modeling the economy of forest use and reforestation gave rise to this study the cluster analysis method will allow to analyze the homogeneity of the observed regions determined by a set of indicators characterizing their behavior in the daily practice of forestry the choice of the volga federal district is due to the fact that in all regions of this district there are forest lands forest industry enterprises operate while various types of economic activities are widely developed this makes regions of the district typical for most territories of the globe with different natural and climatic conditions the timber industry complex was among the industries most affected by sanctions restrictions this is due to the fact that a significant proportion of its products primarily plywood was export oriented to western europe which introduced a complete ban on supplies from russia hence the main problem is the loss of developed markets and well established supply chains it was exacerbated by the strengthening of the ruble and the corresponding decrease in foreign exchange earnings of exporters negative trends are growing in the domestic timber market due to falling prices and sales uncertainty a common problem for enterprises of all levels of the timber industry from logging to furniture was the lack of imported materials machinery equipment and spare parts there was a real threat of bankruptcy of many enterprises and unemployment now there is a shortage of oak veneer it is needed for the production of valuable furniture at the same time measures are being taken to protect forests from fires the fire fighting budget has grown in 2022 the staff has been increased by 1 4 thousand to 4 5 thousand people there are more special equipment we can involve 72 5 thousand units in extinguishing last year there were 65 9 it is possible to harvest 600 million cubic meters per year in russia without damage to forests in reality only 220 m3 are harvested there is a reserve it is necessary that the turnover of wood be controlled and understandable since january 1 2022 any movement of wood across the country is accompanied by electronic documents and this is pushing the so called black loggers into at least a gray zone balances are visible almost in real time a database of genetic data of the main forest forming species the level of their biological stability and genetic variability is being formed this data can be used to combat illegal logging the federal state information system of the forestry complex is being created the system consolidates all industry data and will become the basis for the implementation of public services and functions in the field of forestry it will allow receiving processing storing and visualizing on forest maps information about the state of the forest fund including quantitative and qualitative characteristics of forests as well as information about their use protection protection and reproduction a space survey of forests is being carried out this is a modern innovation in forestry work the main advantage of this method is a large scale diagnostics of the state of forest plantations which is difficult to organize on the ground satellite images make it possible to assess the state of forests over a large area with high efficiency and at the lowest cost the purpose of this study is to cluster the regions of the volga federal district of the russian federation according to indicators characterizing the activities of organizations of forestry and timber industry complex to identify patterns and prospects for further development in accordance with the purpose the objectives of the study are to develop a scorecard for analysis today there are scattered data on the state of forests which often do not provide reliable information therefore a system of indicators is required to assess and model the scenario and prospects for the development of forestry to identify the proportions in the development of the forestry economy and the processes of reforestation based on the allocation of clusters to determine the relationship between the values of indicators for identify the mechanisms that form processes in forestry the innovation of our work is in the application of multidimensional classification methods to the study of the economics of forestry forest management and reforestation it is impossible to change the location of forests territorially but it is possible to form clusters from the standpoint of principles and approaches to the organization of forestry to develop the application of experience in successful forestry management the clusters made it possible to identify the main patterns in the economics of forestry the influence of factors on the indicators of forest management and reforestation federal forestry agency 2022 2 materials and methods a multidimensional grouping of the regions of the volga federal district of the russian federation was carry out using the cluster analysis method to study the level of the activities of logging organizations and reforestation cluster analysis allows to create scientifically grounded groups clusters and to identify internal connections in the regions of the federal district the classification is carry out for all indicators at the same time cluster analysis allows to take into account many different factors select groups with the inclusion of all indicators we want to unite different areas in the study of forests in their significance for society and the economy therefore we decided to apply the cluster analysis method cluster analysis is one of the most interesting fashionable modern methods of classification it allows you to work with a variety of observations and a variety of indicators of different directions cluster analysis is closest in terms of concepts and its essence to the system approach a systematic approach allows you to critically analyze problem situations and develop an action strategy we presented the idea and sequence of cluster analysis fig 1 the sources of information were the data of official statistics on the type of activity agriculture forestry and fishing to build clusters according to indicators characterizing the activities of logging organizations indicators used by region in 2018 indicators are present in the publications of the federal state statistics service of the russian federation n d 12 indicators were selected from statistical indicators characterizing the forestry economy of the regions all indicators are relative values this allows comparing regions of different sizes based on the study of the literature these indicators conventionally combined into three groups table 1 cluster analysis was performed using the program statistica 6 0 the classification used standardized coefficients hierarchical dendrogram built for 14 regions of the volga federal district the most stable results were obtained using the full coupling method the euclidean distance metric 3 results separation of the regions of the volga federal district into three clusters was obtained as a result of the study fig 2 groups are presented in table 2 the first cluster is represented by 3 regions which is 21 4 of the total number of the studied totality the second cluster contains 3 regions 21 4 the third cluster is the most representative and contains 8 regions 57 1 of the total number of the studied totality the regions in clusters are territorially rather scattered the characteristics and values of the indicators of clusters by region are shown in table 3 the indicators in the clusters take on very different values cluster 1 is characterized by the largest share of forest land in the total area of the region but the smallest timber resources per one logging organization this is a consequence of the fact that a large number of small enterprises operate in the regions of this cluster with an average annual number of employees per one organization 6 people 14 2 thousand dense timber cubic meters of untreated wood is produced per one enterprise which is the smallest indicator among the clusters however the most untreated wood is produced per employee the smallest value of export and import of timber from the regions of the cluster indicates the developed processing of timber within the regions the use of timber within the regions for their own needs having the smallest timber resources enterprises use their resources quite intensively as a result of which per 1 hectare of reforestation area the volume of timber produced is the largest among clusters 256 0 m3 however must pay tribute to the regions of this cluster the area of reforestation in percent of the area of forest land is the largest among the clusters 0 73 expenditures on environmental protection is 1 05 of gross regional product the regions of cluster 1 have the smallest number of forest fires respectively the smallest burnt forest land in relative terms cluster 2 is characterized by the smallest share of forest land in the total area of the region and the activity of a small number of large logging organization most of the timber resources per one organization is located in the regions of this cluster however enterprises are not sufficiently engaged in the processes of reforestation reforestation area is 0 17 of forest land area the lowest value expenditures on environmental protection are 0 79 of gross regional product also the lowest value among clusters burnt forest land takes the greatest value 0 15 forest land area the regions of cluster 2 are strongly encouraged to strengthen the processes of reforestation protection of the state of forest areas more rational use of the available timber resources forest resources and introduce effective technologies for wood processing cluster 3 the most numerous is characterized by average indicators of resource potential average size of logging organizations average timber resources at the same time the share of the type of economic activity agriculture forestry and fishing is the largest in this cluster 9 6 in gross value added the enterprises of this cluster are actively engaged in international cooperation carry out the largest export of wood pulp and paper products per one logging organization reforestation processes in this cluster are at an average level in the district managers of logging organizations in the regions of this cluster have found the most optimal solutions in the field of management of available resources their reproduction sales of manufactured products in general regions of the volga federal district are characterized by better indicators of reforestation reproduction of forest resources their safety compared to the value of indicators of the russian federation this indicates the interest of the regions in rational use of available forest resources area of which in relative terms is smaller than in russia as a whole which make it possible to form a significant share of gross regional product we will additionally characterize the identified clusters with some indicators for the purpose of their complex analysis within the framework and directions indicated in this study food production science health of population of territory table 4 in the regions of cluster 1 where forest lands occupy a significant share of the area less grain is produced per capita than in other clusters or average in the district and across russia the highest value of grain per capita is produced in the regions of cluster 2 earlier it was recommended to these regions to strengthen the processes of reforestation protection of the state of forests which is confirmed by more intensive agricultural production the regions of cluster 3 are characterized by the average level of crop and livestock production per capita quite developed agriculture total contribution of agriculture and forestry to gross regional product in the regions of this cluster is the highest 9 6 which exceeds the average level both for the district and for russia as a whole the regions of cluster 3 also have the largest share of investments in fixed capital by economic activity agriculture forestry and fishing in total investments it is also partly the result of the fact that in this cluster the largest share of intramural current expenditures on r d on agricultural sciences 6 74 of total intramural current expenditures on r d this result confirms the hypotheses put forward about the need for a scientifically grounded approach to the processes of reforestation agriculture and forestry attracting investments in fixed capital of this type of economic activity the highest value of the volume index of environmental protection costs is observed in the regions of cluster 3 112 8 of previous year which indicates intensified actions for environmental protection the lowest morbidity by main classes is observed in this cluster 810 per 1000 population at the same time the largest share of organizations engaged in innovation providing better environmental safety in the production of goods works and services 14 4 of the total number of organizations engaged in environmental innovation is observed in the regions of cluster 2 as a result of cluster analysis groups of regions of the federal district were identified according to several indicators which made it possible to take them into account on an equal footing in the distribution to combine the most similar regions to identify trends and patterns in the organization of forestry and reforestation cluster analysis in the economy of forest management and reproduction of forest resources on the example of the regions of the volga federal district was carried out for the first time analysis has pushed the boundaries of statistical science the analysis made it possible to formulate specific recommendations for the regions to improve the efficiency of forestry and forest conservation 4 discussion critical to implementing sustainable forest management and reforestation models are effective governance policy alignment between sectors and administrative levels land tenure security respect for the rights and knowledge of local communities and indigenous peoples enhanced capacity for monitoring of biodiversity outcomes and by no means least innovative financing modalities fao and unep 2020 research results show and confirm conclusions about the innovative views of necessity of creation and development of essentially new kinds of business in the sphere of forestry involving businessmen as full subjects of carrying out scientific researches within the frames of the sustainable development and reproduction business concept considering them as a potential reserve of scientific and pedagogical staff of educational establishments preshkinandpreshkina 2014 forest management and reforestation processes must be scientifically based forest resources are an element of the national wealth of the country the ecological situation and the health of the population depend on their availability and condition at the same time reforestation is a long term process covering tens and hundreds of years that is why for the sake of a healthy life for today s and future generations for the sake of nature conservation the use and restoration of forest resources should take into account both the interests of forest users and national interests these conclusions are confirmed by the results of our present study now the value assessment of wood resources is underestimated because of unreal value in use that leads to decrease of the wood income insufficient interest of the state structures to an estimation of potential competence of forest engineers for realizations of professional activity because of considerable presence of not profile scientific and pedagogical staff for training of engineers for forest industries of economy is observed preshkinandpreshkina 2014 kovalenko et al 2019 note that in relation to forest land the owner has the right to sell all or part of it in accordance with the procedures and rules established by law society is willing to pay for research in these directions above all research on greater resistance to biotic risks solino et al 2020 this proves our assumptions that today research in the field of forest resources reforestation is necessary and financially justified it is necessary to use innovative technologies for forest growing at the present stage of development of forestry in russia based on the results of the investment analysis positive effects of the processes of building forest selection and seed centers on the processes of reforestation have been found management of reforestation processes with the use of innovative technologies allows solving the tasks of mass production of forest seedlings and reproduction of forests in a short time the necessity of building forest selection seed centers in the regions of russia has been proved ivanova et al 2018 the obtained results are the basis for solving practical problems of integrated management of forest resources svyntukh 2015 based on the example of studies of walnut forests in the silk road countries it can be seen that conducive economic policies well funded national walnut breeding programs and economic incentive schemes could effectively promote the establishment of walnut plantations which both considerably contribute to the reclamation and rehabilitation of degraded lands and the diversification of farming systems at the same time further efforts are needed in walnut research and practice to improve existing value chain arrangements develop novel products from j regia and other underutilized forest species and to more effectively monitor resources and enforce existing legal frameworks shigaevaanddarr 2020 these measures are also applicable to the selected groups of regions for the further development of the timber industry complex the search for new industries high cost of reforestation discourages expansion of forests but at the same time makes it optimal to conserve a minimal forested area in the long run in particular it is optimal to maintain a forested area above a critical size if the initial forest cover lies above it while forests that are initially smaller than the critical level are optimally managed at constant size piazza and roy 2020 characterize the exact condition under which it is optimal to avoid total deforestation the extent of irreversibility does not matter for this our study also shows that with an average degree of forest exploitation with proper management it is possible to organize effective reforestation forest industry and institutional timberland owners are more likely to do partial harvests than non industrial private forest landowners all owners are less likely to harvest if there is a high possibility of generating revenues from amenities sun and zhang 2020 thus there is an understanding of the importance of preserving forests the possibility of alternative use of forests arrangement of forest lands in modern society some research shows how communities which are differentially integrated into the global economy are excluded from natural resources through complex means gabitov et al 2019 sugdenand punch 2014 the study of the economics of forest management and reforestation is associated with the social issues of society plantation forests provide numerous benefits to local communities that regularly interact with them local communities mainly plant and grow plantation forests for fuelwood construction materials source of fodder and income generation the determinant factors predicting the dependencies of local communities on plantation forests and their levels of participation on management activities are study by the example of ethiopia to collect data a survey questionnaire was developed by considering demographic socioeconomic bio physical and institutional factors descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression models were applied to analyze and interpret the data the multiple linear regression models revealed that several independent variables derived from demographic i e sex age and family size socioeconomic i e level of education annual income livestock ownership want to keep more livestock than they have at present length of residence in the area have the plan to stay in the area in the future and have enough labor to manage the tree seedlings planted in their landholdings bio physical i e distance between the nearby access road and the land of the respondents where they planted and grew trees and institutional i e have planted trees in their landholdings get incentives to plant and grow trees in their landholdings and have sufficient market to sell their plantation forest products obtained from their landholdings factors significantly affected and predicted the two groups of the dependent variables i e the dependencies of local communities on plantation forests 49 variance explained and their levels of participation on management activities 53 variance explained these models can help policy and decision makers land use planners environmental analysts conservation and forest management experts to take into account the factors that influence the dependence of local communities on afforestation and their level of participation in economic activities tadesse andteketay 2020 andersson and lidestav 2016 and bergsten et al 2020 look at gender aspects of forest management and forestry mann 2001 research the forestry labor market need to transform food systems to halt deforestation and the loss of biodiversity the biggest transformational change is needed in the way in which produce and consume food must move away from the current situation where the demand for food is resulting in inappropriate agricultural practices that drive large scale conversion of forests to agricultural production and the loss of forest related biodiversity agribusinesses must meet their commitments to deforestation free commodity chains and companies that have not made zero deforestation commitments should do so commodity investors should adopt business models that are environmentally and socially responsible these actions will in many cases require a revision of current policies in particular fiscal policies and regulatory frameworks fao and unep 2020 it is necessary to highlight the special role of tax administration in forest management in forestry development programs ways of improving tax administration of the forest usage in the northern territories based on the introduction of information technologies state and public control over forest usage and support services for taxpayers are being developed lazhentsev et al 2020 when analyzing the issues of pricing it is noted that the final timber yield is more elastic in price and income than partial for all owners both at the stand level and at the aggregate level khasanov et al 2020 at the methodological level it is noted that adding a profit function to forest economics will be a major step forward in advancing the disciplinary instruction in determining the optimal volume and the concomitant net present worth of timber production li et al 2020 forest restoration when implemented appropriately helps restore habitats and ecosystems create jobs and income and is an effective nature based solution to climate change the united nations decade on ecosystem restoration 2021 2030 announced in march 2019 aims to accelerate ecosystem restoration action worldwide forests are increasingly recognized for their role as a nature based solution to many sustainable development challenges as manifest in strengthened political will and a series of commitments to reduce rates of deforestation and to restore degraded forest ecosystems fao andunep 2020 albers et al 2020 our research has contributed to the study of forest economics on the basis of a clear system of indicators groups of regions were identified and the challenges facing the industry were identified 5 conclusions 12 indicators were selected from statistical indicators characterizing the forestry economy of the regions these indicators are conventionally combined into three groups indicators characterizing the resource potential of logging regions and organizations indicators characterizing the results of logging organizations indicators characterizing the state of forest resources and environment the classification of the system of indicators of timber industry from the position of cluster analysis was first performed the formation of clusters will make it possible to more efficiently use the forest resources of the district will contribute to interregional cooperation obtaining a larger total income combining experience and efforts in the field of forest resources reproduction cluster analysis is a rather informative method for studying the economic development of the timber industry complex of regions the cluster approach and the functioning of the forestry clusters the joint work of universities enterprises and the state are capable of ensuring the development of enterprises and the preservation of forests as a national treasure the practical significance of the study consists in the development of specific recommendations for the regions of a particular cluster in the possibility of their systematic interaction with each other the limits of the application of the method are associated with the territorial location of the regions with the limited information base of the analysis the development of statistical monitoring in the field of forestry will contribute to the development of research ensuring the conservation of forest land forest resources and timber resources both for domestic use and for exports further development of the research methodology is seen in the construction of an integral indicator of forest use and reforestation the use of multiple regression models to analyze the factors affecting the profitability and efficiency of enterprises therefore their ability and motivation for more intensive reforestation emergence of covid 19 joins a collection of evidence that local and global health are influenced by human interactions with the natural environment environment resource and development economists are called to develop and analyze empirically grounded models of people s decisions about interacting with the environment integrating the decisions that drive human environment interactions with ecological and epidemiological research in an interdisciplinary approach to understanding pathogen transmission will inform policy needed to improve both conservation and disease spread outcomes these scientific areas are also an area for further development in cooperation with scientists in the field of medicine which is currently being carried out by the authors of this study full reforestation is needed for effective work a forest management plan should be prepared not for a year but for 10 years the main organizational difficulty is caring for the planted forest due to the fact that the process stretches for decades reforestation today may be hindered by a significant increase in prices for planting material within the framework of a public private partnership it is necessary to address the issues of import substitution of equipment for growing seedlings as well as provide for subsidizing part of the costs of forest users when using planting material with a closed root system one of the significant measures will be the reimbursement of part of the costs for the construction of forest selection and seed centers to tenants the task is to raise wages and improve working conditions in forestry the tree was and remains a valuable resource one of the areas of development is wooden housing construction after the entry into force of the export ban the development of processing is one of the key areas measures to mitigate the negative consequences of the imposed sanctions support for enterprises implementing priority investment projects stimulation of demand in the domestic market assistance in organizing exports to other countries we must be prepared for the fact that russian forests will be considered the worst and most unnecessary forests in the world we must act proactively not defend ourselves not make excuses but more insistently demand recognition of our real absorbing abilities it is green diplomacy that can become the basis for restoring relations with a number of countries at present there is not enough systematic and extensive data on the russian forest in particular in order to reasonably conduct a dialog with other countries with the attention of the world community focused on the issue of climate change markets are becoming increasingly sensitive to the environmental agenda business can be helped by the implementation of climate projects aimed at protecting forests from fires protecting them from pests reforestation and afforestation and the introduction of intensive forestry technologies in order to increase the openness of data on forests it is proposed to strengthen control over regional forest management bodies in terms of the completeness and quality of posting the data provided for by law on websites publish materials of the state forest inventory in full including primary data develop and implement a digital form of a forest pathological survey report as well as ensure the mandatory indefinite storage of all acts in a centralized

24371,emergy analysis provided us with an opportunity to compare the sustainability of three different sugar beet production systems in lorestan province iran in 2019 2020 emergy allows us to quantify the qualitative characteristics of sustainability by analyzing the production structure and calculating emergy indices the total inputs of emergy for sugar beet production related to the spring direct seeding system were respectively 24 and 69 higher than the systems used for summer seedling and autumn direct seeding in other words the emergy flow density efd sej m 2 was highest in the spring direct seeding system indicating the higher stress exerted by this system on the environment and its lower sustainability all the emergy indices except for the emergy index of product safety revealed more favorable sustainability of the autumn seeding system because of its lower efd compared with the other two systems according to the economic ecological index environmental benefit density the autumn direct cultivation system provided more than twice the environmental benefits per unit area therefore replacing the spring direct seeding and summer seedling systems with the autumn direct seeding system is recommended for suitable climates in future studies the sustainability of the autumn sugar beet seedling system should be evaluated keywords sustainability biothermodynamic analysis environmental benefit summer seedling planting of sugar beet autumn direct seeding of sugar beet environmental load data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are many ways to assess the economic and environmental performance of agricultural ecosystems and express their relative advantages nicholls et al 2020 including their sustainability flexibilities soil conditions biodiversity levels etc achieving a sustainable food supply and ensuring food security for a growing population along with environmental protection are the major priorities for sustainable agricultural development among these priorities crop production systems have been given special attention in terms of food production daily calorie supply and food security jaggard et al 2010 making an effort to maximize crop production despite limited production resources including water has led to different environmental effects cawma 2007 therefore identifying agricultural ecosystems based on optimal methods in terms of controlling resource constraints and the necessity that production approaches be economical on the one hand and adopt ecologically sustainable ways of environmental protection on the other hand would be a step to replace non optimal and unsustainable systems with environmentally friendly systems that have good economic performance identification of ecosystems with economic justification and environmental sustainability requires assessments with appropriate methods given the complex nature of agricultural systems it is important to take an efficient measurement approach over the last 30 years the results of studies of many biological systems despite their complexities have been based on comprehensive emergy analyses brown and ulgiati 2016 for example numerous studies have been conducted by researchers around the world with the aim of evaluating the performance of agricultural production systems by examining the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems using emergy analysis methods chen et al 2017 amiri et al 2021 used 14 different indices with the ability to measure ecological economic and market dimensions as well as crop quality to compare three cropping systems for shallot production e g mechanized traditional and conservational cropping in its natural habitat they introduced the conservational cropping of its production as the most optimal and sustainable system to replace the existing systems in iran the results of emergy analyses and calculations of thermodynamic indices for four greenhouse production systems for cucumber tomato pepper and eggplant in jiroft iran indicated the higher sustainability of the cucumber production system compared to the other three systems asgharipour et al 2020 also the results of assessing producers social status in the afore mentioned study showed that cucumber farmers satisfied more favorable socio technical indicators including a high level of production compared to the other three categories of producers to provide appropriate strategies for rapeseed development sustainability enhancement and productivity amiri et al 2020 compared the livelihood and commercial systems of rapeseed production using energy and emergy analyses in the two rapeseed production models studied higher environmental sustainability a higher percentage input of renewable energy and a lower environmental burden were attributed as benefits of the livelihood system while a high emergy exchange fraction and greater environmental sustainability resulting from market impacts ecological economic sustainability a lower amount of emergy spent for the production of each unit of output higher emergy efficiency and higher productivity relevant to the total factors of production were ascribed as benefits of the commercial system sugar beet beta vulgaris is one of the industrial products of the agricultural sector that plays an important role in providing sugar to the household food basket in iran sugar is one of the most important sources of energy in the national diet sugar beet also has many by products like sugar beet molasses which is used in agriculture e g in livestock and poultry feeding and in the biotechnology industry for producing materials of high economic value therefore the sustainability of this strategic product is of great importance for ensuring its supply and the partial sustainability of iran s food security through reducing the foreign exchange costs of importing sugar to serve as a raw material for various factories in iran mohammadi et al 2012 the area under cultivation and the amount of sugar beet production in iran during the 2018 crop year were reported to be 87 692 hectares and 4901 592 t respectively fao 2018 the areas under sugar beet cultivation in lorestan province and in the two cities of kuhdasht and boroujerd where this research was conducted were 6550 1500 and 700 ha respectively with an average production of 55 tons of sugar beets per hectare ghanbari shirsavar 1399 restriction of irrigation water supply sources in many areas on the agricultural plains of iran occurrence of frequent droughts and over harvesting of groundwater resources excessive use of pesticides the occurrence of diseases and weeds when cultivating sugar beets with conventional methods and coincidence of the water requirement for sugar beet plants with the peak period of hot and dry weather in conventional agriculture have all led to the search for more efficient solutions for sugar beet production through the application of various approaches one of the methods that has been widely studied and promoted in recent years as an alternative solution to reduce water consumption and the use of chemical toxins per unit of production and to enhance sugar beet yield is sugar beet seedling cultivation in open air nurseries and the subsequent transfer of these seedlings to the field for planting at the appropriate time yousefabadi 2017 in comparison with conventional agriculture planting sugar beet seedlings produces a 65 savings in seed consumption 45 savings in water consumption and a reduction of 40 50 in the use of chemical pesticides yousefabadi 2017 in warmer regions autumn cultivation of sugar beet has been considered instead of conventional spring cultivation with the goal of optimizing use of rainfall during the growing season and improving water use efficiency sharifi et al 2002 in studies conducted in the united states autumn cultivation of sugar beet as a suitable crop has been mentioned in discussions of sustainable agriculture kaffka 1996 also developing autumn sugar beet crops in appropriate areas in europe has been considered while autumn cultivation of sugar beets is already well developed in the mediterranean regions of europe and africa e g southwestern spain portugal morocco tunisia etc jaggard and werker 1999 a review of the literature showed that so far there have been no comprehensive studies aimed at comparing the sustainability of different sugar beet production systems by using economic and environmental indices to replace the conventional methods of sugar beet culture used in iran and other parts of the world the growing restrictions on resources and the inputs required for production as well as environmental threats caused by agricultural ecosystems redouble the need to assess the sustainability of agricultural systems with comprehensive methods for managing them and making wise and prudent decisions recently the two systems of spring seedling cultivation and autumn cultivation have been considered with the aims of ameliorating sustainability lowering environmental adverse effects and augmenting the profitability of sugar beet production in this research emergy analyses of three different systems including spring direct seeding the conventional method and summer seedling cultivations of sugar beet in boroujerd city and the direct seeding cultivation in kuhdasht city in autumn the aim of the present research was to determine and compare the required amounts of emergy used identify the shares of renewable non renewable environmental and market inputs in the resource mix and evaluate the ecological and economic sustainability of the sugar beet production grown in spring and autumn direct seeding and in the summer seedling cultivation systems in kuhdasht and boroujerd cities of iran the methods of analysis and the sugar beet systems examined in this study are genrerally valid and resultes of this study should be applicable to similar systems throughout the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 research location the current study was conducted on two summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems in two adjacent farms in the shirvan region of boroujerd city in 2019 and an autumn direct seeding system in the grab region of kuhdasht city in the 2019 2020 crop year management operations for the sugar beet production systems are shown in table 1 boroujerd and kuhdasht are two of the eleven cities in lorestan province which is located in western iran the geographical coordinates of the first two mentioned regions are e 48 48 39 48 8108 and n 33 45 40 33 7611 with an altitude of 1481 m above sea level and those of the third region are e 47 19 33 47 3257 and n 33 27 18 33 4549 with an altitude of 1138 m above sea level in other words the system situated in kuhdasht city was located at a lower latitude and altitude compared to those of the systems located in boroujerd city the nearest synoptic meteorological station to the two studied agroecosystems located in boroujerd city reported an average annual rainfall of 452 6 mm a minimum absolute temperature of 21 4 c a maximum absolute temperature of 41 4 c and an average temperature of 14 8 c over a period of 30 years 1985 2016 the type of climate in boroujerd city is semi humid with mild hot summers rather cold winters and a dry period of 154 days from june to november also the nearest synoptic station to the studied ecosystem located in kuhdasht city has reported an average annual rainfall of 365 8 mm a minimum absolute temperature of 20 6 c a maximum absolute temperature of 44 6 c and an average temperature of 16 0 c over a period of 30 years 1985 2016 the type of climate in kuhdasht city is semi humid with hot summers and mild winters and a dry period of 185 days from may to november lorestan province statistical yearbook 2016 the soil samples taken from the surface horizons 0 30 cm of all three studied sites had common characteristics including calcareous soil clay loam texture acidity ph of about 7 50 and an average soil electrical conductivity of 0 925 ds m 1 the soil organic matter changes in the studied sites during the production process are presented for each system in table 1 2 2 data collection the inputs and outputs of the studied systems were measured or estimated through continuous monitoring during the production period before planting time and after harvest based on the relationships presented in the appendix and tables 4 the meteorological departments of the two cities where the research was conducted provided us with laboratory analyses of the soils field visits and registration of field data prices of the purchased inputs were calculated based on daily prices from the market sugar beet has a purchase price guaranteed by the government and thus the reports issued by the pertinent sugar factory based on the amount payable per unit weight of the delivered product were taken into account for calculating the profits from the product sales 2 3 emergy analysis the present research was performed using the emergy analysis method odum 2000 brown and ulgiati 2004 the different types of matter and energy flows are expressed with the same units solar emjoules which represent both the quantity and quality of the flows this is the unique advantage of the emergy analysis methodology brown et al 2016 emergy analysis is able to determine the degree of sustainability of ecological and economic systems taking this approach increases our understanding of ecological and economic systems and how they interact with each other emergy indices provide an effective tool for integrating ecological economic systems and make it possible to measure and compare all aspects of ecosystems since agriculture consumes both natural and economic resources the contributions of both sources must be considered in the calculation and evaluation of ecosystems campbell 1998 emergy analysis measures both the environmental and economic costs for achieving sustainability chen and chen 2012 the first step in an emergy analysis is to determine the spatial and temporal boundaries odum 2000 for this purpose an energy systems language odum 1994 diagram that displays the main components of a system their interrelationships and the energy material and economic flows of the system is drawn the diagrams of the energy flows for our sugar beet production systems are presented in figs 1 and 2 the resources required for the sugar beet production systems were divided into renewable environmental resources r including solar radiation rain wind and evapotranspiration non renewable environmental resources n and n0 renewable resources being used faster than their replacement rates including soil erosion groundwater use and groundwater evapotranspiration renewable market resources fr encompassing 50 of the seed energy 10 of the seedling energy 10 of the labor force and 8 of the electricity jafari et al 2018 amiri et al 2021 and purchased non renewable market resources fn consisting of chemical fertilizers chemical toxins machine energy fossil fuels 50 of seeds 90 of seedling inputs 90 of the labor force and 92 of electricity amiri et al 2021 asgharipour et al 2019 the input flows u in this study included joules grams rials and emjoules which were converted into integrated solar emjoules with the help of relevant conversion coefficients according to the factors or transformities sej j or sej unit compiled in the emergy methods the output flow y in all 3 processes of sugar beet production consists of 3 parts the first is sugar beet tubers which are the economic part of the crop the second is the aerial parts of the plant which includes sugar beet crowns and leaves and the third is exudates which increase soil organic matter in addition to the direct application of the emergy structure in the analyses of these systems emergy indices with extensive capabilities for analyzing varied dimensions of a system can be calculated based on different mathematical relationships between the structural components to compare the sugar beet production systems in the current research more than 16 different rankings were established between the 3 systems for classification by using the indices presented in table 2 and their calculated values given in table 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 the structure of the emergy evaluation tables 3 and 4 respectively depict the environmental free and market input flows supporting the sugar beet seedling production system and the three sugar beet production systems examined in this study planting summer seedlings spring direct seeding and autumn direct seeding transplantation was one of the inputs used in the summer seedling system due to the unavailability of a suitable coefficient to assess this item the structure of the emergy system application of the seedling production system was examined in a separate study to enhance the accuracy of the analyses all the inputs to the three studied sugar beet production systems represented in table 4 are presented in table 5 by expressing the related coefficients in terms of emergy the supporting emergy values of the sugar beet production systems in the three ecosystems summer seedling cultivation spring direct seeding most common method and autumn direct seeding were calculated to be 5 55e 16 6 86e 16 and 4 06e 16 sej ha 1 respectively fig 3 displays the input structures of the three systems studied comparison of the calculated emergy values of the three systems studied in this research demonstrated that the total input emergy of the spring direct seeding system was respectively 24 and 69 higher than the summer seedling and autumn direct seeding systems the higher supporting emergy rate of production in the spring direct seeding system compared to the other two systems was indicative of a high emergy flow density efd and environmental stress exerted by that system on the environment as well as a lower sustainability of this system pizzigallo et al 2008 table 6 3 1 1 renewable environmental flows r the renewable environmental flows of the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems for sugar beet production included sunlight wind rain and evapotranspiration the renewable environmental flows of wind and rain directly originate from sunlight energy therefore to avoid double counting the largest of them in addition to the solar energy used in photosynthesis par were considered as the total emergy of the renewable environmental flows asgharipour et al 2018 the emergy of renewable environmental flows for the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems for sugar beet production were estimated to be 1 93e 14 6 47e 14 and 8 15e 14 sej ha 1 respectively table 5 the renewable environmental flows in the summer seedling ecosystem were obtained from the sum of the emergy of sunlight and wind inputs and those of the spring and autumn direct seeding systems were calculated as the sum of the emergy of sunlight and rain inputs the higher input of renewable environmental flows in the autumn direct seeding system compared to the other two systems was due to the use of autumn and winter rainfall during the growing season of the sugar beet plant in fact one of the main goals of planning to change the sugar beet planting time from spring to autumn was to match its growth period with the regional rainfall period which augmented the benefits and efficiency of rainfall and water use the renewable environmental flows in the three systems summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively accounted for 0 35 0 94 and 2 01 of the total input emergy to each system in comparison the r values in the three breeding systems lotus lotus shrimp and lotus fish were reported to be 2 78e 15 sej ha 1 which accounted for about 3 4 of the total inputs to these ecosystems lu et al 2017 3 1 2 non renewable environmental flows n0 the non renewable environmental flows in the studied systems included groundwater evapotranspiration and soil erosion these flows would be renewable flows if not used faster than their replacement rates the renewable environmental flows used in a nonrenewable manner for the three systems of summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding were estimated to be 49 62 and 50 of the total input of emergy flow to these systems table 5 the higher share of n0 compared to all the inputs in the spring direct seeding system was related to its high share of the groundwater input in this system 42 of the total inputs belonged to the groundwater input alone the reason for the high groundwater input in the spring direct seeding system was the high water requirement of the sugar beet plant on the one hand shahabifar 2007 and its planting time on the other hand the method of sugar beet cultivation in the spring direct seeding was carried out in a way that only 43 days less than a quarter of its 198 day growing season coincided with the rainy season table 1 which left 155 days occurring within the hot and dry months of the year in the region therefore it was certain that in such a system water consumption for irrigating sugar beet fields will be high in comparison in the study conducted by zhang et al 2012 the groundwater input to the spring direct corn production system in mapo located in the northeast of weishan china was estimated to be 5 6e 14 sej ha 1 accounting for only 4 of all the inputs needed for growth in the present study the lowest water consumption from the underground source was during the autumn direct seeding water inputs from the groundwater source in the summer seedling and the spring direct seeding ecosystems were respectively about 2 and 3 66 times higher than the consumption of this non renewable input in the autumn direct seeding ecosystem however the benefit that the autumn direct seeding system obtained from rainfall as a renewable source was more than that of the other two systems in the context of iran s water scarcity challenge in which water input threatens the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems blum 2009 rahimi et al 2012 low water consumption from a nonrenewable groundwater source is considered a significant advantage alishiri et al 2014 accordingly it can be said that the first step for managing sustainable production of agricultural products is to choose appropriate seasons to impose resource requirements based on the growth periods of the plants adaptation of the plant growth periods with the cold seasons according to the existing climatic conditions facilities and restrictions would lead to the proper use of renewable resources and save on the consumption of non renewable resources barzegar et al 2004 3 1 3 market emergy flows fr fn the values of market inputs in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were estimated to be 2 80e 16 2 57e 16 and 1 94e 16 sej ha 1 respectively comparison of the market inputs of the three studied ecosystems revealed higher dependence of the summer seedling system on purchased inputs compared to the other two systems in all three studied ecosystems the largest share of market inputs was related to the use of chemical fertilizers especially those incorporating a nitrogen source in the summer seedling system the market input of the seedlings after chemical fertilizers had been removed was the next largest share of the purchased market inputs the entry for pesticides in the springdirect seeding system was respectively 112 and 240 higher than those for the summer seedling and autumn direct seeding systems in a study carried out on chemical fertilizer treated maize in guyana the input amounts of toxins and chemical fertilizers were reported to be 7 53e 15 and 3 49e 15 sej ha 1 respectively moonilall et al 2020 in the study performed by moonilall et al 2020 the trend of using pesticides and chemical fertilizers was found to be different from the use of these inputs in our three studied systems because pesticide consumption 7 53e 15 sej ha 1 was much more 50 200x that of the use of chemical pesticides on sugar beets in contrast their use of chemical fertilizers 3 49e 15 sej ha 1 was much less 19 to 25 than that of the present study the total chemical fertilizers utilized in our summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were estimated to be 1 38e 16 1 84e 16 and 1 38e 16 sej ha 1 respectively 3 2 emergy indices the emergy indices calculated will reflect the differences in the studied systems based on the management methods applied each index depicts varied economic conditions and environmental parameters as well as human interventions in the natural environment that occur during production activities the process of determining product health and other ecosystem variables tables 2 and 7 present different emergy and economic indices for comparing the three sugar beet production systems the values of the calculated emergy indices helped to evaluate the sustainability of the studied systems also by comparing and interpreting each index scientifically the differences in the production methods used in the different the systems were shown 3 2 1 transformity and specific emergy spe each joule of solar emergy used per joule of the produced product sej j 1 is called the solar transformity of the item and each joule of solar emergy per gram of the produced product sej g 1 is called the specific emergy spe or the quality factor for emergy brown and ulgiati 1997 the higher the transformity of the materials and the energy used in the production of the product the greater the environmental activity required to support the production process brown and ulgiati 1997 based on the views of odum 1996 and brown et al 2000 on the description of the higher efficiency of systems with lower inputs of emergy in terms of sej to produce each equivalent output unit in this study the autumn direct seeding system would be considered to be more efficient tables 4 and 5 the output values of the three studied sugar beet production systems included economic performance measures sugar beet tubers aerial parts leaves petioles and crown and increased soil organic matter which are presented in terms of j and g in table 4 accordingly transformity and spe were calculated separately for the three production systems table 7 which led to enhanced accuracy in calculations shrestha et al 2021 in the research conducted by fonseca et al 2019 the total supporting emergy of the studied farm and the total output were reported to be 4 56e 17 sej y 1 and 2 86e 11 j y 1 respectively comparison of the transformity and spe values in the systems indicated that there was a lower input emergy flow for producing each unit a joule or a gram respectively in the autumn direct seeding system compared to the summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems in the autumn direct seeding system the values of free environmental inputs with lower transformity were higher than those of the other two systems while the free flow rates of non renewable environmental inputs like groundwater and market inputs such as chemical toxins which have higher transformities were less therefore the choice of the autumn direct production method where more inputs are associated with lower transformity and less total consumption of inputs are accompanied by higher transformity improved the unit emergy value uev and spe index in comparison to the other two systems since transformity is an indicator of the contribution of the past environment to the creation of a resource and consequently the future environmental burden of that resource on the environment brown and ulgiati 1997 it could be said that the autumn direct sugar beet seeding system had used flows with a lower share of the environmental burden according to table 7 the trend of transformity and spe indices in terms of the outputs of the economic and aerial parts in all the three studied systems is as follows spring direct seeding common summer seedling autumn direct seeding but the related trend in terms of the output increasing soil organic matter is as follows summer seedling spring direct seeding common autumn direct seeding the difference between the amounts of aerial parts and increased soil organic matter in the summer seedling case compared to the spring direct seeding system was greater than the difference in the input emergy to these two systems in other words the input emergy to the spring direct seeding system was only 24 higher however the amounts of the aerial parts and increased soil organic matter respectively were 60 and 50 higher in the spring direct seeding compared to the summer seedling system in the study performed by zhang et al 2012 on the spring direct corn production system in weishan county northeast china the transformity for the economic production sector was 9 74e 04 sej j 1 in an emergy analysis of autumn rapeseed production in iran the transformity for the economic sector grain production in both commercial and traditional production systems were reported to be 2 60e 05 and 8 02e 05 sej j 1 respectively also the spe values of grain production for autumn rapeseed in the mentioned systems were reported as 7 24e 09 and 2 25e 10 sej g 1 respectively amiri et al 2019 3 2 2 emergy renewability percentage index r careful design and management of agricultural systems can improve economic productivity and augment sustainability altieri et al 2017 berthet et al 2019 the ratio of the use of renewable energy to the total energy consumption in production systems depends on the system management approach strategies to increase the share of free environmental renewable inputs in the production of products while taking into account environmental considerations would ameliorate the economic dimension of production lefroy and rydberg 2003 the small percentage of renewable emergy consumption in all three systems is clearly evident the low r in this study occurred with high values of the inputs included in the free environmental non renewable list i e potentially renewable resources used in a nonrenewable manner n0 in the three summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively 49 19 61 68 and 50 04 of the total input emergy to the studied systems was accounted for by n0 here characterized as non renewable environmental inputs therefore adjusting the non renewable environmental inputs was an important strategy because of their significant impacts on r reducing the consumption of non renewable environmental inputs to ecosystems requires a management perspective that takes a land management approach groundwater consumption which is used in a non renewable way in sugar beet production was reported to be 1 46e 16 2 91e6 16 and 7 95e 15 sej j 1 in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively the low amount of groundwater input to the autumn direct seeding system was due to the change in the growth period of the sugar beet plant based on its conventional cultivation calendar in the spring direct seeding conventional system and summer seedling agriculture the growth period of the plant coincided with the dry months of the year thus resulting in maximum evapotranspiration coinciding with the regional peak heat on the other hand with the choice of autumn direct sugar beet cultivation the plant s growth period coincided with a temperate period in terms of temperature period of precipitation and minimal evapotranspiration therefore it was certain that water consumption from a non renewable source groundwater in the autumn direct seeding system was about 283 and 84 less than in the spring direct seeding and the summer seedling systems respectively however managing the soil erosion component which was on the list of free environmental non renewable inputs to the studied systems was much more difficult than managing the reduction of groundwater input and evapotranspiration in sugar beet cultivation as shown in table 5 the value of this component is the same in all three systems and is estimated to be 1 20e 16 sej j 1 one of the key methods in reducing soil erosion in agricultural lands is to use low tillage however in the cultivation of sugar beet tubers plowing the soil is necessary and lack of tillage causes a significant reduction in yield javadi et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to take other measures like plowing only on the cultivation lines to addresss this issue in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems r values were estimated to be 2 41 2 43 and 4 52 respectively table 7 comparison of the percentage of renewable emergy in the studied systems revealed the better condition of the autumn direct seeding system compared to the other two systems such that its value of r was 1 88 and 1 86 times higher than those of the summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems respectively the main reasons for the better r in the autumn direct seeding system were the greater use of free renewable environmental inputs especially rain and reduced groundwater input as well as the lower shares of chemical fertilizer and toxins used table 5 the recycle of water for maize was reported to range from 5 in the study of martin et al 2006 in kansas to 63 24 in the research of diemont et al 2006 in mexico based on conventional agriculture 3 2 3 emergy yield ratio eyr higher values of eyr indicate a higher return in terms of the emergy invested chen et al 2006 in the three treatments summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems eyr values were calculated respectively to be 2 008 2 676 and 1 845 table 7 comparison of eyr values of the three studied systems revealed the superiority of the spring direct seeding system in returning more emergy per the amount of emergy invested from the purchased inputs in other words the eyr value of the spring direct seeding system displayed the ability of this treatment to utilize free environmental resources more effectively based on the amount of purchased resources used by performing a purely economic analysis it can be said that the higher eyr value has an economic interpretation in that there was a lower whole cost of the production process although zhan et al 2020 considered a greater eyr value to be more indicative of higher system sustainability the higher eyr amount calculated for the spring direct seeding system compared to the other two systems in our study was due to the higher share of free non renewable environmental inputs used since the magnitude of eyr can be related to either the small sum of the purchased market inputs or the larger magnitude of the emergy output of the system or both based on the mathematical relationship its higher value in our spring direct seeding compared to the summer seedling system was due to the lower emergy of the market inputs used and a greater total emergy output while its higher value compared to the autumn direct seeded system was mainly attributed to its magnitude which was 1 69 times that of the total output of emergy from the autumn system and not its small market input of emergy in contrast the higher eyr value in the autumn direct seeding system compared to the summer seedling system was mainly due to its smaller use of market inputs amiri et al 2021 showed that the highest eyr value was related to the natural habitat system for shallot production the reason for the large eyr value of the natural habitat system compared to the three studied shallot systems was the significantly smaller size of the market inputs also in the research of lu et al 2010 the higher eyr value of the rice production system in comparison with the two production systems for vegetables and rice vegetables was mainly due to the smaller size of the market inputs in the study of amiri et al 2019 eyr of a commercial rapeseed system was estimated to be higher than that of a traditional rapeseed production system despite the larger size of market inputs to that system the main reason for the large eyr value of the commercial system was that it had a higher emergy of non renewable environmental inputs than that of the traditional rapeseed production system table 8 shows a comparison of the eyrs for several different production systems 3 2 4 emergy investment ratios standard eir and modified eir for a certain amount of emergy obtained from an economic production process a lower value of the emergy investment ratio table 2 indicates that a greater amount of emergy flow from the environment is consumed in the production of economic products these flows are provided by free renewable or non renewable environmental sources and in fact the production process in the system is associated with less economic costs thus being considered more economical le corre 2016 the eir values in the present research were calculated as 0 992 0 596 and 1 184 for the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively table 7 according to its mathematical formula the eir index is directly related to the sum of market input flows and inversely related to the sum of environmental flows the total environmental flow of the spring direct seeding system was 1 57 times higher than that of the summer seedling system and 2 04 times higher than that of the autumn direct seeding system whereas the total market input was about 1 32 times higher than that of the autumn direct seeding system table 5 therefore the eir value of the spring direct seeding system suggested that the larger share of emergy spent on product production was due to market resources the emergy related to the seedling input in the summer seedling system was the main difference in the corresponding inputs compared to the other two systems in this study the seedlings and their planting method caused the use of more machinery and fossil fuels compared to the other two systems without reducing the labor input or benefiting more from the free environmental inputs this production method was found to be more costly than that used in the other two systems based on the eir index the net profit of the summer seedling system was lower due to the lower amount of economic production and more costly method of managing inputs table 1 therefore the main reason for the increase in the eir value in the summer seedling system was the increase in the purchased inputs because of the use of seedlings instead of seeds on the other hand due to the short length of the growth period and the delay in planting the seedlings the benefits of seedling cultivation were not exploited fully the reduction of the production potential caused by a lower utilization of free environmental and market inputs per week of planting delay has been reported to be significant gholami qajloo et al 2015 however in our seedling system the planting date of seedlings differed from the planting date of seeds in the other two systems by about 13 weeks whereas the maximum difference between the direct seeding and seedling planting dates has been recommended to be 8 weeks yousefabadi 2017 the reason for the greater eir value of the autumn direct seeding compared to the spring direct seeding system was the lower r share of the total input flow into the autumn direct seeding system due to the lower groundwater input from a non renewable source compared to the other two systems therefore based on the modified eir version i e eir amiri et al 2019 the autumn direct seeding system was found to be less unsustainable and economical than the other two systems examined in this study also the net profit from the production systems presented in table 1 confirmed the analysis that the autumn direct seeding system was more economical in this research in the research of xi and qin 2009 on two different agricultural systems the comparison of eir values showed more economic efficiency of the organic system of rice and duck production with an eir value of 1 71 compared to the rice wheat system with an eir value of 4 26 in another study the eir values for commercial and traditional rapeseed production systems were reported to be 0 76 and 1 86 and the eir values where the effects of renewable resources used nonrenewably were removed these values were 9 00 and 8 94 respectively amiri et al 2019 comparison of the eir values presented in table 8 with the eir values calculated in the current study indicated the relatively favorable status of the eirs in the three studied systems 3 2 5 environmental load ratios standard elr and modified elr the environmental pressure caused by the intensity of the utilization of environmental services can be expressed by the environmental load ratio elr barros et al 2009 for agricultural systems the elr index which is calculated from the ratio of total non renewable environmental and market inputs to renewable environmental and market inputs shows the renewability of the system during agricultural production processes dalzotto artuzo et al 2021 in this research the elr values in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were respectively 254 99 167 37 and 58 83 table 7 the high share of market inputs and non renewable environmental inputs compared to the free environmental renewable inputs led to an increase in the elr value in comparison to those obtained by the other five studies presented in table 8 the elr values of the summer seedling spring and autumn direct seeding systems were respectively 48 328 47 095 and 22 790 generally elr values of more than 10 indicate severe pressure on the environment zhan et al 2020 in this investigation the higher share of non renewable compared to renewable market inputs and the higher share of free environmental non renewable compared with renewable inputs resulted in a large elr value of course the trends between the elrs of the three studied systems could be estimated from the trend of the r index presented in table 7 in fact the small value of the r index can indicate large elr values the small value of r and the large values of elr were alarming in causing the ecological unsustainability of all three methods of sugar beet production based on the elr values in this study the environmental pressure created by the summer seedling system was 2 7 and 6 8 times higher than that of the spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively also according to the elr index the environmental pressures in the two systems of summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems respectively were approximately equal to and almost twice as high as that of the autumn direct seeding system lu et al 2017 stated that by comparing the elr values of three different lotus systems the values were reported to change within the range of 2 8 2 3 in the research conducted by amiri et al 2021 elr values in the studied systems of shallot production ranged from 2 87 to 5 15 3 2 6 environmental sustainability index standard esi and modified esi maximization of a system s emergy yield is associated with declining environmental loads based on the esi index as an indicator of sustainability almeida et al 2020 the larger the esi value the greater the emergy yield that the load on the environment will allow ulgiati and brown 1998 the ideal and best esi relationship occurs based on the economical status of the production flow through enhancing the eyr along with environmental adaptation through reducing the elr rotolo et al 2007 although the eyr values of other studies mentioned in table 7 were not very different from those of this study extremely small esi values compared to those of the other studies were achieved because the elr values of this study were clearly different from other values reported in table 8 according to the views of ulgiati and brown 1998 and hu et al 2010 who provide the classification of sustainable esi 5 semi sustainable esi 1 5 and unsustainable esi 1 systems thus all three systems in the present study were found to be far from sustainability the esi values of the spring direct seeding and summer seedling systems were respectively 94 and 287 lower than those found in the autumn direct seeding system the elr index shows that the pressure exerted on the environment by the fall seeding system was 4 33 times lower than the summer seedling system and 2 84 times lower than the spring seeding system decreased market inputs especially reduced fn as well as an increased share of r among the inputs to each system lead to enhanced esi values as can be seen in table 4 both the aforementioned inputs to the summer seedling system are contrary to the trends of the other two systems the higher esi induced by its higher eyr can be interpreted as economic sustainability in terms of a lower whole cost associated with the production process 3 2 7 emergy exchange ratio eer when exchanging goods at the macroeconomic level e g between two countries an indicator called the emergy money ratio emr 1 1 emr is the ratio of the total emergy supporting a country s production as a macroeconomic system of production to its gross domestic product gdp this ratio can be used to estimate the emergy associated with the monetary values of the final products produced in that country i e sej money unit is taken into account to establish an approximate equivalence between the economic and emergy flows of the system in a trade between two different countries the country with the lower emr value is known as the developed country compared to the country with the higher emr value where a monetary unit spent will buy more emergy so more emergy can be obtained abroad with the money of the developing country cuadra and rydberg 2006 the eer index can be defined between the producer as a seller on the market and the buyer in the market in order to examine the status of commercial advantage and fairness of a product exchange within the market currencies and production systems cavalett and ortega 2009 since the fairest state of emergy exchange is equivalent to an eer value of 1 if the eer value is less than 1 the seller manufacturer will have a gerater chance of winning in the exchange and vice versa agostinho et al 2008 in this study the eer values calculated in all the three systems summer seedling 0 174 spring direct seeding 0 224 and autumn direct seeding 0 105 systems were lower than 1 table 7 in other words during the exchange of sugar beet products with the market i e sugar and lump sugar factories the producers or factory owners gained more advantage over sugar beet buyers in terms of the emergy exchange in the summer seedling system an emergy amount of 4 95e 16 sej ha 1 was spent for production while the amount of emergy received by the farmers from the buyers in the market was 2 84e 16 sej ha 1 or 50 of the intial investment in the spring direct seeding system the emergy flow spent for producing the product was 6 86e 16 sej ha 1 of which only 3 08e 16 sej ha 1 was received for the exchange on the market also in the autumn direct seeding system the emergy flow consumed in the production process was 3 59e 16 sej ha 1 of which the amount 3 41e 16 sej ha 1 was returned during the market transaction or 83 3 of the initil investment the eer values demonstrate a fairness in trade advantage of the autumn direct seeding system over the other two systems during the emergy exchange on the market the spring direct seeding convential system achieved an amount 3 86e 16 sej ha 1 less than the emergy flow consumed in the production process or 44 of the initial investment it was thus identified as the least fair production system in the study table 8 compares the eer values presented in 4 different studies 3 2 8 emergy index for sustainable development eisd emergy index for sustainable development eisd is obtained by modifying the esi index with the eer index lu and campbell 2009 since the dependence of the eisd index is equally on the market and the environmental inputs the impact it receives from costly purchased inputs on the one hand bastianoni et al 2007 and the effect of the emr or ym component due to taking into account the eer index on the other hand would lead to an increase in the strength of the eisd compared to the esi index in the development of various dimensions of sustainability because it reflects both the ecological and economic factors determining sustainability the eisd values calculated in the current study for the summer seedling spring and autumn direct seeding systems were 1 37e 03 3 34e 03 and 1 16e 03 respectively table 7 as a result the following is the sustainability trend in the three sugar beet production systems the summer seedling system the spring direct seeding system the autumn direct seeding system although the esi value of the spring direct seeding system was 7 times that of the summer seedling system and twice that of the fall direct seeding system the eisd of the spring direct seeding system was about 4 times that of the summer seedling system and nearly equal to that of the autumn direct seeding system the eisd is an excellent index for evaluating systems the calculation of the eer index the price of the product is considered as a constant component while the other components utilized in computing the eisd are changeable in addition sugar beet is an agricultural commodity that is produced on a contractual basis between the manufacturer and the farmer and its price is determined annually by the government therefore the braiding and interactions between the three indicators eyr eer with direct impact and elr with reverse impact lead to the establishment of an extraordinary index eisd table 8 presents the calculated eisd values of two other systems for comparison with those of our studied systems the eisd values reported in the study of lu et al 2018 were calculated with the inverse effect of the eer index on the eisd index because their eer calculation method was the opposite of the approach taken in this research 3 2 9 emergy index of product safety eips the eips index is applied to evaluate the effects of fertilizers and chemical toxins on a product the higher the value of this index the greater the safety of the manufactured products will be guan et al 2016 since the relationship between the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in agricultural products and their adverse effects on human health and their threat to human immunity has been proven leong et al 2020 the eips index can identify an alarming situation before announcing the laboratory results of a product indicating the potential impact of the product s safety on health the eips of the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were respectively 0 387 0 219 and 0 219 hence the production safety in the summer seedling process was about twice as high as that of the other two systems the safety of agricultural products such as sugar beets is dependent not only on the quantity of fertilizers and chemicals used but also on their residual levels in the products however eips does not account for residuals and only indicates the total amount of fertilizers and chemicals used during production when using the eips index to compare the safety of different items with varying chemical responses extreme caution is required yousefabadi 2017 also reported a saving of 30 50 in the use of herbicides pesticides and chemical fertilizers in sugar beet seedling plantings compared to its direct cultivation table 8 shows the calculated eips values of two additional studies the eips values in the study of xi and qin 2009 have been recalculated and now fall in the range from 0 34 1 00 3 2 10 emergy investment per unit of net profit einrp einrp is the amount of supporting emergy per unit of net income generated in a system zhang et al 2011 2012 this can suggest an advantage of higher ecological sustainability in the production process especially when the share of renewable flows is high in the present research the highest value of the einrp index occurred during the spring direct seeding followed by the summer seedling system table 7 the autumn direct seeding system with the lowest einrp was recognized as the best system according to this index in the study of zhang et al 2011 the most intensive system showed the highest amount of einrp because of this large investment moreover in their study done in 2012 the lowest amount of einrp was found in the corn production system overall in their research animal breeding systems fish and duck provided a larger amount of einrp compared to those of the agricultural and mushroom breeding systems due to the need for more capital 3 2 11 economic indices of output input o i and net benefit density nbd based on money and em value to analyze the economic conditions of our three studied systems two economic indices including the output input o i ratio and the net benefit density nbd were employed furthermore for simultaneous evaluation of the ecological and economic dimensions of the process em value was utilized in the form of the two indicators of o iemv and nbdemv table 7 generally economic flows based on emergy evaluation flows are different from monetary flows nonetheless monetary flows and interests based on the market value of money do not reflect the value and environmental benefits of a product and thus the market price does not reflect the real price of a product xi and qin 2009 therefore em value as real wealth is both based on the emergy unit sej and depicts currency estimation and conversion bastianoni et al 2007 calculation of em value based indices can eliminate the need for separate emergy and economic value assessments bastianoni et al 2007 for calculating o iemv in our study first the em value of the economic product as the output was calculated by multiplying the produced amount of sugar beet tubers j of each system by the sugar beet transformity 8 49e 04 sej j 1 reported by ulgiati et al 1994 and then by dividing the result by the amount of em rials or emrs reported for the iranian currency 6 76e 07 sej rial 1 based on 2017 data expressed by asgharipour et al 2020 also the em value of the inputs was calculated by dividing the total emergy of the inputs by the calculated emr value for iran in addition nbds represented the net profit based on the market price and em value per hectare in this study the uev value from a reliable source was utilized to compute the o iem however the calculation based on the result of a single case study has a limitation because the o iem is sensitive to the uev chosen for the calculation since em value represents the economic environmental contribution of production as a whole subtraction of the economic market value from it once converted to emmoney would approximate the amount of environmental contribution therefore the difference between nbdm and nbdemv can be considered as a reflection of the environmental benefit or disadvantage of the production process such that the higher value of nbdm compared to nbdemv demonstrates the environmental disadvantage of the process and a larger value of nbdemv compared to nbdm indicates its environmental benefit as long as the value of nbdemv is higher than nbdm the subtraction would be positive indicating the environmental benefits of the process while a negative value demonstrates environmental loss in the process in the present study the emergy difference between nbdemv and nbdm has been called the environmental benefit density ebd the values of the o i and nbd indices based on the market currency value and em value are presented in table 7 the o im values are the economic returns calculated based on the market currency values in the autumn direct seeding 2 61 spring direct seeding 1 86 summer seedling 1 70 also the o iemv values for the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were reported to be 9 00e 06 6 70e 06 and 1 39e 07 respectively the efficiency values of the systems in terms of em value o iemv indicated better economic environmental performance of the autumn direct seeding system compared to the other two systems the spring direct seeding system also revealed the lowest economic environmental efficiency compared to the other two systems the nbdm and nbdemv values had the same trend and indicated superiority of the autumn direct seeding system over the other two systems table 7 the calculated ebd value also demonstrated the environmental benefits of all the three systems according to the trend autumn direct seeding system summer seedling system spring direct seeding system comparing the economic ecological sustainability of three cattle breeding systems in iran o im values represented superiority of economic returns based on the market value in the open cattle breeding system however the o iemv values showed an advantage of the semi compact system of production based on the economic environmental contribution compared to the other two systems in the mentioned study the net benefit nbemv values in both open and closed cattle breeding systems were found to be negative numbers which were indicative of the greater economic environmental contribution of the inputs compared to the outputs in this system amiri et al man in the organic rice duck production system and in the traditional rice wheat rotation system in xi and qin 2009 the o im and nbdm indices were reported to be 1 46 and 1 70 and 571 us m 2 and 889 us m 2 respectively unlike o im o iemv displayed the advantage of the organic rice duck system over the traditional rice wheat rotation system moreover the higher net economic benefit based on em value nbdemv in the organic rice duck system compared to the traditional rice wheat rotation system was further emphasized xi and qin 2009 attributed the differences in o im o iemv nbdm and nbdemv trends among their studied systems to the combined reflection of economic and environmental statuses further highlighted by em value rather than market price indices xi and qin 2009 4 conclusion and policy implications the issue that sustainability is an important factor for choosing efficient agricultural systems and in developing the future agricultural sector has been agreed upon by many researchers sands and podmore 2000 bockstaller et al 2009 artuzoet al 2021 the application of the concept of sustainability has been useful in identifying the differences between varied agricultural systems and in replacing environmentally unsustainable systems with less unsustainable ones in other words highlighting the components of sustainability in the production process has led to innovations in introducing adaptive agricultural systems of course if sustainability analysis is performed through a thermodynamic approach and uses a reliable emergy method it will be able to highlight the causes of a system s incompatibilities and present an alternative solution for decreasing unsustainability because sugar beets are grown in varied climates throughout iran and because the crop is produced in the legal form of a contract between the sugar mill and the farmer with fixed input and output pricing the findings of this study can be applied to the entire country the situation governing sugar beet production in three different production systems was investigated in this study the cost or price of each kilogram of product produced in the summer seedling spring and autumn direct seeding systems were determined to be 3528 50 3753 80 and 2797 00 rials respectively in terms of emergy structure the values of the emergy indicators and the cost price per unit of production the spring direct seeding system was deemed to be unsustainable autumn direct seeding on the other hand was deemed less unsustainable than the other two sugar beet production methods both in terms of cost per unit of production and emergy components 19 of the 23 indicators evaluated in this study indicated that autumn direct seeding was more sustainable than the other two systems the diminution of the eyr and consequently the eisd is also attributable to the diminutive size of nonrenewable environmental inputs n0 due to the nonrenewability and environmental burden of these inputs the lower n0 content in autumn direct seeding is regarded as a sign of sustainability in terms of its emergy structure in addition out of the 23 indicators listed in table 7 spring direct seeding is superior to the summer seedling system in terms of six indicators trom speom percent r elr esi and esi and is superior to the other two systems in terms of three indicators eir eyr and eisd given that out of 23 calculated indices 19 indices supported the sustainability of the autumn direc seeding system and due to the continuation of the drought phenomenon and the forecasting of more water crises in most parts of iran the lowest level of dependence on groundwater in the autumn system the government is compelled to develop and promote autumn cultivation of sugar beet as opposed to spring and summer cultivation due to the greater sustainability of the autumn direct seeding system as well as the significant advantage of seedling cultivation for providing a significant reduction in the use of chemical pesticides further studies on the sustainability of the autumn seeding and spring sugar beet seedling systems are recommended credit authorship contribution statement zahra amiri conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation resources data curation

24371,emergy analysis provided us with an opportunity to compare the sustainability of three different sugar beet production systems in lorestan province iran in 2019 2020 emergy allows us to quantify the qualitative characteristics of sustainability by analyzing the production structure and calculating emergy indices the total inputs of emergy for sugar beet production related to the spring direct seeding system were respectively 24 and 69 higher than the systems used for summer seedling and autumn direct seeding in other words the emergy flow density efd sej m 2 was highest in the spring direct seeding system indicating the higher stress exerted by this system on the environment and its lower sustainability all the emergy indices except for the emergy index of product safety revealed more favorable sustainability of the autumn seeding system because of its lower efd compared with the other two systems according to the economic ecological index environmental benefit density the autumn direct cultivation system provided more than twice the environmental benefits per unit area therefore replacing the spring direct seeding and summer seedling systems with the autumn direct seeding system is recommended for suitable climates in future studies the sustainability of the autumn sugar beet seedling system should be evaluated keywords sustainability biothermodynamic analysis environmental benefit summer seedling planting of sugar beet autumn direct seeding of sugar beet environmental load data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there are many ways to assess the economic and environmental performance of agricultural ecosystems and express their relative advantages nicholls et al 2020 including their sustainability flexibilities soil conditions biodiversity levels etc achieving a sustainable food supply and ensuring food security for a growing population along with environmental protection are the major priorities for sustainable agricultural development among these priorities crop production systems have been given special attention in terms of food production daily calorie supply and food security jaggard et al 2010 making an effort to maximize crop production despite limited production resources including water has led to different environmental effects cawma 2007 therefore identifying agricultural ecosystems based on optimal methods in terms of controlling resource constraints and the necessity that production approaches be economical on the one hand and adopt ecologically sustainable ways of environmental protection on the other hand would be a step to replace non optimal and unsustainable systems with environmentally friendly systems that have good economic performance identification of ecosystems with economic justification and environmental sustainability requires assessments with appropriate methods given the complex nature of agricultural systems it is important to take an efficient measurement approach over the last 30 years the results of studies of many biological systems despite their complexities have been based on comprehensive emergy analyses brown and ulgiati 2016 for example numerous studies have been conducted by researchers around the world with the aim of evaluating the performance of agricultural production systems by examining the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems using emergy analysis methods chen et al 2017 amiri et al 2021 used 14 different indices with the ability to measure ecological economic and market dimensions as well as crop quality to compare three cropping systems for shallot production e g mechanized traditional and conservational cropping in its natural habitat they introduced the conservational cropping of its production as the most optimal and sustainable system to replace the existing systems in iran the results of emergy analyses and calculations of thermodynamic indices for four greenhouse production systems for cucumber tomato pepper and eggplant in jiroft iran indicated the higher sustainability of the cucumber production system compared to the other three systems asgharipour et al 2020 also the results of assessing producers social status in the afore mentioned study showed that cucumber farmers satisfied more favorable socio technical indicators including a high level of production compared to the other three categories of producers to provide appropriate strategies for rapeseed development sustainability enhancement and productivity amiri et al 2020 compared the livelihood and commercial systems of rapeseed production using energy and emergy analyses in the two rapeseed production models studied higher environmental sustainability a higher percentage input of renewable energy and a lower environmental burden were attributed as benefits of the livelihood system while a high emergy exchange fraction and greater environmental sustainability resulting from market impacts ecological economic sustainability a lower amount of emergy spent for the production of each unit of output higher emergy efficiency and higher productivity relevant to the total factors of production were ascribed as benefits of the commercial system sugar beet beta vulgaris is one of the industrial products of the agricultural sector that plays an important role in providing sugar to the household food basket in iran sugar is one of the most important sources of energy in the national diet sugar beet also has many by products like sugar beet molasses which is used in agriculture e g in livestock and poultry feeding and in the biotechnology industry for producing materials of high economic value therefore the sustainability of this strategic product is of great importance for ensuring its supply and the partial sustainability of iran s food security through reducing the foreign exchange costs of importing sugar to serve as a raw material for various factories in iran mohammadi et al 2012 the area under cultivation and the amount of sugar beet production in iran during the 2018 crop year were reported to be 87 692 hectares and 4901 592 t respectively fao 2018 the areas under sugar beet cultivation in lorestan province and in the two cities of kuhdasht and boroujerd where this research was conducted were 6550 1500 and 700 ha respectively with an average production of 55 tons of sugar beets per hectare ghanbari shirsavar 1399 restriction of irrigation water supply sources in many areas on the agricultural plains of iran occurrence of frequent droughts and over harvesting of groundwater resources excessive use of pesticides the occurrence of diseases and weeds when cultivating sugar beets with conventional methods and coincidence of the water requirement for sugar beet plants with the peak period of hot and dry weather in conventional agriculture have all led to the search for more efficient solutions for sugar beet production through the application of various approaches one of the methods that has been widely studied and promoted in recent years as an alternative solution to reduce water consumption and the use of chemical toxins per unit of production and to enhance sugar beet yield is sugar beet seedling cultivation in open air nurseries and the subsequent transfer of these seedlings to the field for planting at the appropriate time yousefabadi 2017 in comparison with conventional agriculture planting sugar beet seedlings produces a 65 savings in seed consumption 45 savings in water consumption and a reduction of 40 50 in the use of chemical pesticides yousefabadi 2017 in warmer regions autumn cultivation of sugar beet has been considered instead of conventional spring cultivation with the goal of optimizing use of rainfall during the growing season and improving water use efficiency sharifi et al 2002 in studies conducted in the united states autumn cultivation of sugar beet as a suitable crop has been mentioned in discussions of sustainable agriculture kaffka 1996 also developing autumn sugar beet crops in appropriate areas in europe has been considered while autumn cultivation of sugar beets is already well developed in the mediterranean regions of europe and africa e g southwestern spain portugal morocco tunisia etc jaggard and werker 1999 a review of the literature showed that so far there have been no comprehensive studies aimed at comparing the sustainability of different sugar beet production systems by using economic and environmental indices to replace the conventional methods of sugar beet culture used in iran and other parts of the world the growing restrictions on resources and the inputs required for production as well as environmental threats caused by agricultural ecosystems redouble the need to assess the sustainability of agricultural systems with comprehensive methods for managing them and making wise and prudent decisions recently the two systems of spring seedling cultivation and autumn cultivation have been considered with the aims of ameliorating sustainability lowering environmental adverse effects and augmenting the profitability of sugar beet production in this research emergy analyses of three different systems including spring direct seeding the conventional method and summer seedling cultivations of sugar beet in boroujerd city and the direct seeding cultivation in kuhdasht city in autumn the aim of the present research was to determine and compare the required amounts of emergy used identify the shares of renewable non renewable environmental and market inputs in the resource mix and evaluate the ecological and economic sustainability of the sugar beet production grown in spring and autumn direct seeding and in the summer seedling cultivation systems in kuhdasht and boroujerd cities of iran the methods of analysis and the sugar beet systems examined in this study are genrerally valid and resultes of this study should be applicable to similar systems throughout the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 research location the current study was conducted on two summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems in two adjacent farms in the shirvan region of boroujerd city in 2019 and an autumn direct seeding system in the grab region of kuhdasht city in the 2019 2020 crop year management operations for the sugar beet production systems are shown in table 1 boroujerd and kuhdasht are two of the eleven cities in lorestan province which is located in western iran the geographical coordinates of the first two mentioned regions are e 48 48 39 48 8108 and n 33 45 40 33 7611 with an altitude of 1481 m above sea level and those of the third region are e 47 19 33 47 3257 and n 33 27 18 33 4549 with an altitude of 1138 m above sea level in other words the system situated in kuhdasht city was located at a lower latitude and altitude compared to those of the systems located in boroujerd city the nearest synoptic meteorological station to the two studied agroecosystems located in boroujerd city reported an average annual rainfall of 452 6 mm a minimum absolute temperature of 21 4 c a maximum absolute temperature of 41 4 c and an average temperature of 14 8 c over a period of 30 years 1985 2016 the type of climate in boroujerd city is semi humid with mild hot summers rather cold winters and a dry period of 154 days from june to november also the nearest synoptic station to the studied ecosystem located in kuhdasht city has reported an average annual rainfall of 365 8 mm a minimum absolute temperature of 20 6 c a maximum absolute temperature of 44 6 c and an average temperature of 16 0 c over a period of 30 years 1985 2016 the type of climate in kuhdasht city is semi humid with hot summers and mild winters and a dry period of 185 days from may to november lorestan province statistical yearbook 2016 the soil samples taken from the surface horizons 0 30 cm of all three studied sites had common characteristics including calcareous soil clay loam texture acidity ph of about 7 50 and an average soil electrical conductivity of 0 925 ds m 1 the soil organic matter changes in the studied sites during the production process are presented for each system in table 1 2 2 data collection the inputs and outputs of the studied systems were measured or estimated through continuous monitoring during the production period before planting time and after harvest based on the relationships presented in the appendix and tables 4 the meteorological departments of the two cities where the research was conducted provided us with laboratory analyses of the soils field visits and registration of field data prices of the purchased inputs were calculated based on daily prices from the market sugar beet has a purchase price guaranteed by the government and thus the reports issued by the pertinent sugar factory based on the amount payable per unit weight of the delivered product were taken into account for calculating the profits from the product sales 2 3 emergy analysis the present research was performed using the emergy analysis method odum 2000 brown and ulgiati 2004 the different types of matter and energy flows are expressed with the same units solar emjoules which represent both the quantity and quality of the flows this is the unique advantage of the emergy analysis methodology brown et al 2016 emergy analysis is able to determine the degree of sustainability of ecological and economic systems taking this approach increases our understanding of ecological and economic systems and how they interact with each other emergy indices provide an effective tool for integrating ecological economic systems and make it possible to measure and compare all aspects of ecosystems since agriculture consumes both natural and economic resources the contributions of both sources must be considered in the calculation and evaluation of ecosystems campbell 1998 emergy analysis measures both the environmental and economic costs for achieving sustainability chen and chen 2012 the first step in an emergy analysis is to determine the spatial and temporal boundaries odum 2000 for this purpose an energy systems language odum 1994 diagram that displays the main components of a system their interrelationships and the energy material and economic flows of the system is drawn the diagrams of the energy flows for our sugar beet production systems are presented in figs 1 and 2 the resources required for the sugar beet production systems were divided into renewable environmental resources r including solar radiation rain wind and evapotranspiration non renewable environmental resources n and n0 renewable resources being used faster than their replacement rates including soil erosion groundwater use and groundwater evapotranspiration renewable market resources fr encompassing 50 of the seed energy 10 of the seedling energy 10 of the labor force and 8 of the electricity jafari et al 2018 amiri et al 2021 and purchased non renewable market resources fn consisting of chemical fertilizers chemical toxins machine energy fossil fuels 50 of seeds 90 of seedling inputs 90 of the labor force and 92 of electricity amiri et al 2021 asgharipour et al 2019 the input flows u in this study included joules grams rials and emjoules which were converted into integrated solar emjoules with the help of relevant conversion coefficients according to the factors or transformities sej j or sej unit compiled in the emergy methods the output flow y in all 3 processes of sugar beet production consists of 3 parts the first is sugar beet tubers which are the economic part of the crop the second is the aerial parts of the plant which includes sugar beet crowns and leaves and the third is exudates which increase soil organic matter in addition to the direct application of the emergy structure in the analyses of these systems emergy indices with extensive capabilities for analyzing varied dimensions of a system can be calculated based on different mathematical relationships between the structural components to compare the sugar beet production systems in the current research more than 16 different rankings were established between the 3 systems for classification by using the indices presented in table 2 and their calculated values given in table 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 the structure of the emergy evaluation tables 3 and 4 respectively depict the environmental free and market input flows supporting the sugar beet seedling production system and the three sugar beet production systems examined in this study planting summer seedlings spring direct seeding and autumn direct seeding transplantation was one of the inputs used in the summer seedling system due to the unavailability of a suitable coefficient to assess this item the structure of the emergy system application of the seedling production system was examined in a separate study to enhance the accuracy of the analyses all the inputs to the three studied sugar beet production systems represented in table 4 are presented in table 5 by expressing the related coefficients in terms of emergy the supporting emergy values of the sugar beet production systems in the three ecosystems summer seedling cultivation spring direct seeding most common method and autumn direct seeding were calculated to be 5 55e 16 6 86e 16 and 4 06e 16 sej ha 1 respectively fig 3 displays the input structures of the three systems studied comparison of the calculated emergy values of the three systems studied in this research demonstrated that the total input emergy of the spring direct seeding system was respectively 24 and 69 higher than the summer seedling and autumn direct seeding systems the higher supporting emergy rate of production in the spring direct seeding system compared to the other two systems was indicative of a high emergy flow density efd and environmental stress exerted by that system on the environment as well as a lower sustainability of this system pizzigallo et al 2008 table 6 3 1 1 renewable environmental flows r the renewable environmental flows of the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems for sugar beet production included sunlight wind rain and evapotranspiration the renewable environmental flows of wind and rain directly originate from sunlight energy therefore to avoid double counting the largest of them in addition to the solar energy used in photosynthesis par were considered as the total emergy of the renewable environmental flows asgharipour et al 2018 the emergy of renewable environmental flows for the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems for sugar beet production were estimated to be 1 93e 14 6 47e 14 and 8 15e 14 sej ha 1 respectively table 5 the renewable environmental flows in the summer seedling ecosystem were obtained from the sum of the emergy of sunlight and wind inputs and those of the spring and autumn direct seeding systems were calculated as the sum of the emergy of sunlight and rain inputs the higher input of renewable environmental flows in the autumn direct seeding system compared to the other two systems was due to the use of autumn and winter rainfall during the growing season of the sugar beet plant in fact one of the main goals of planning to change the sugar beet planting time from spring to autumn was to match its growth period with the regional rainfall period which augmented the benefits and efficiency of rainfall and water use the renewable environmental flows in the three systems summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively accounted for 0 35 0 94 and 2 01 of the total input emergy to each system in comparison the r values in the three breeding systems lotus lotus shrimp and lotus fish were reported to be 2 78e 15 sej ha 1 which accounted for about 3 4 of the total inputs to these ecosystems lu et al 2017 3 1 2 non renewable environmental flows n0 the non renewable environmental flows in the studied systems included groundwater evapotranspiration and soil erosion these flows would be renewable flows if not used faster than their replacement rates the renewable environmental flows used in a nonrenewable manner for the three systems of summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding were estimated to be 49 62 and 50 of the total input of emergy flow to these systems table 5 the higher share of n0 compared to all the inputs in the spring direct seeding system was related to its high share of the groundwater input in this system 42 of the total inputs belonged to the groundwater input alone the reason for the high groundwater input in the spring direct seeding system was the high water requirement of the sugar beet plant on the one hand shahabifar 2007 and its planting time on the other hand the method of sugar beet cultivation in the spring direct seeding was carried out in a way that only 43 days less than a quarter of its 198 day growing season coincided with the rainy season table 1 which left 155 days occurring within the hot and dry months of the year in the region therefore it was certain that in such a system water consumption for irrigating sugar beet fields will be high in comparison in the study conducted by zhang et al 2012 the groundwater input to the spring direct corn production system in mapo located in the northeast of weishan china was estimated to be 5 6e 14 sej ha 1 accounting for only 4 of all the inputs needed for growth in the present study the lowest water consumption from the underground source was during the autumn direct seeding water inputs from the groundwater source in the summer seedling and the spring direct seeding ecosystems were respectively about 2 and 3 66 times higher than the consumption of this non renewable input in the autumn direct seeding ecosystem however the benefit that the autumn direct seeding system obtained from rainfall as a renewable source was more than that of the other two systems in the context of iran s water scarcity challenge in which water input threatens the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems blum 2009 rahimi et al 2012 low water consumption from a nonrenewable groundwater source is considered a significant advantage alishiri et al 2014 accordingly it can be said that the first step for managing sustainable production of agricultural products is to choose appropriate seasons to impose resource requirements based on the growth periods of the plants adaptation of the plant growth periods with the cold seasons according to the existing climatic conditions facilities and restrictions would lead to the proper use of renewable resources and save on the consumption of non renewable resources barzegar et al 2004 3 1 3 market emergy flows fr fn the values of market inputs in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were estimated to be 2 80e 16 2 57e 16 and 1 94e 16 sej ha 1 respectively comparison of the market inputs of the three studied ecosystems revealed higher dependence of the summer seedling system on purchased inputs compared to the other two systems in all three studied ecosystems the largest share of market inputs was related to the use of chemical fertilizers especially those incorporating a nitrogen source in the summer seedling system the market input of the seedlings after chemical fertilizers had been removed was the next largest share of the purchased market inputs the entry for pesticides in the springdirect seeding system was respectively 112 and 240 higher than those for the summer seedling and autumn direct seeding systems in a study carried out on chemical fertilizer treated maize in guyana the input amounts of toxins and chemical fertilizers were reported to be 7 53e 15 and 3 49e 15 sej ha 1 respectively moonilall et al 2020 in the study performed by moonilall et al 2020 the trend of using pesticides and chemical fertilizers was found to be different from the use of these inputs in our three studied systems because pesticide consumption 7 53e 15 sej ha 1 was much more 50 200x that of the use of chemical pesticides on sugar beets in contrast their use of chemical fertilizers 3 49e 15 sej ha 1 was much less 19 to 25 than that of the present study the total chemical fertilizers utilized in our summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were estimated to be 1 38e 16 1 84e 16 and 1 38e 16 sej ha 1 respectively 3 2 emergy indices the emergy indices calculated will reflect the differences in the studied systems based on the management methods applied each index depicts varied economic conditions and environmental parameters as well as human interventions in the natural environment that occur during production activities the process of determining product health and other ecosystem variables tables 2 and 7 present different emergy and economic indices for comparing the three sugar beet production systems the values of the calculated emergy indices helped to evaluate the sustainability of the studied systems also by comparing and interpreting each index scientifically the differences in the production methods used in the different the systems were shown 3 2 1 transformity and specific emergy spe each joule of solar emergy used per joule of the produced product sej j 1 is called the solar transformity of the item and each joule of solar emergy per gram of the produced product sej g 1 is called the specific emergy spe or the quality factor for emergy brown and ulgiati 1997 the higher the transformity of the materials and the energy used in the production of the product the greater the environmental activity required to support the production process brown and ulgiati 1997 based on the views of odum 1996 and brown et al 2000 on the description of the higher efficiency of systems with lower inputs of emergy in terms of sej to produce each equivalent output unit in this study the autumn direct seeding system would be considered to be more efficient tables 4 and 5 the output values of the three studied sugar beet production systems included economic performance measures sugar beet tubers aerial parts leaves petioles and crown and increased soil organic matter which are presented in terms of j and g in table 4 accordingly transformity and spe were calculated separately for the three production systems table 7 which led to enhanced accuracy in calculations shrestha et al 2021 in the research conducted by fonseca et al 2019 the total supporting emergy of the studied farm and the total output were reported to be 4 56e 17 sej y 1 and 2 86e 11 j y 1 respectively comparison of the transformity and spe values in the systems indicated that there was a lower input emergy flow for producing each unit a joule or a gram respectively in the autumn direct seeding system compared to the summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems in the autumn direct seeding system the values of free environmental inputs with lower transformity were higher than those of the other two systems while the free flow rates of non renewable environmental inputs like groundwater and market inputs such as chemical toxins which have higher transformities were less therefore the choice of the autumn direct production method where more inputs are associated with lower transformity and less total consumption of inputs are accompanied by higher transformity improved the unit emergy value uev and spe index in comparison to the other two systems since transformity is an indicator of the contribution of the past environment to the creation of a resource and consequently the future environmental burden of that resource on the environment brown and ulgiati 1997 it could be said that the autumn direct sugar beet seeding system had used flows with a lower share of the environmental burden according to table 7 the trend of transformity and spe indices in terms of the outputs of the economic and aerial parts in all the three studied systems is as follows spring direct seeding common summer seedling autumn direct seeding but the related trend in terms of the output increasing soil organic matter is as follows summer seedling spring direct seeding common autumn direct seeding the difference between the amounts of aerial parts and increased soil organic matter in the summer seedling case compared to the spring direct seeding system was greater than the difference in the input emergy to these two systems in other words the input emergy to the spring direct seeding system was only 24 higher however the amounts of the aerial parts and increased soil organic matter respectively were 60 and 50 higher in the spring direct seeding compared to the summer seedling system in the study performed by zhang et al 2012 on the spring direct corn production system in weishan county northeast china the transformity for the economic production sector was 9 74e 04 sej j 1 in an emergy analysis of autumn rapeseed production in iran the transformity for the economic sector grain production in both commercial and traditional production systems were reported to be 2 60e 05 and 8 02e 05 sej j 1 respectively also the spe values of grain production for autumn rapeseed in the mentioned systems were reported as 7 24e 09 and 2 25e 10 sej g 1 respectively amiri et al 2019 3 2 2 emergy renewability percentage index r careful design and management of agricultural systems can improve economic productivity and augment sustainability altieri et al 2017 berthet et al 2019 the ratio of the use of renewable energy to the total energy consumption in production systems depends on the system management approach strategies to increase the share of free environmental renewable inputs in the production of products while taking into account environmental considerations would ameliorate the economic dimension of production lefroy and rydberg 2003 the small percentage of renewable emergy consumption in all three systems is clearly evident the low r in this study occurred with high values of the inputs included in the free environmental non renewable list i e potentially renewable resources used in a nonrenewable manner n0 in the three summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively 49 19 61 68 and 50 04 of the total input emergy to the studied systems was accounted for by n0 here characterized as non renewable environmental inputs therefore adjusting the non renewable environmental inputs was an important strategy because of their significant impacts on r reducing the consumption of non renewable environmental inputs to ecosystems requires a management perspective that takes a land management approach groundwater consumption which is used in a non renewable way in sugar beet production was reported to be 1 46e 16 2 91e6 16 and 7 95e 15 sej j 1 in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively the low amount of groundwater input to the autumn direct seeding system was due to the change in the growth period of the sugar beet plant based on its conventional cultivation calendar in the spring direct seeding conventional system and summer seedling agriculture the growth period of the plant coincided with the dry months of the year thus resulting in maximum evapotranspiration coinciding with the regional peak heat on the other hand with the choice of autumn direct sugar beet cultivation the plant s growth period coincided with a temperate period in terms of temperature period of precipitation and minimal evapotranspiration therefore it was certain that water consumption from a non renewable source groundwater in the autumn direct seeding system was about 283 and 84 less than in the spring direct seeding and the summer seedling systems respectively however managing the soil erosion component which was on the list of free environmental non renewable inputs to the studied systems was much more difficult than managing the reduction of groundwater input and evapotranspiration in sugar beet cultivation as shown in table 5 the value of this component is the same in all three systems and is estimated to be 1 20e 16 sej j 1 one of the key methods in reducing soil erosion in agricultural lands is to use low tillage however in the cultivation of sugar beet tubers plowing the soil is necessary and lack of tillage causes a significant reduction in yield javadi et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to take other measures like plowing only on the cultivation lines to addresss this issue in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems r values were estimated to be 2 41 2 43 and 4 52 respectively table 7 comparison of the percentage of renewable emergy in the studied systems revealed the better condition of the autumn direct seeding system compared to the other two systems such that its value of r was 1 88 and 1 86 times higher than those of the summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems respectively the main reasons for the better r in the autumn direct seeding system were the greater use of free renewable environmental inputs especially rain and reduced groundwater input as well as the lower shares of chemical fertilizer and toxins used table 5 the recycle of water for maize was reported to range from 5 in the study of martin et al 2006 in kansas to 63 24 in the research of diemont et al 2006 in mexico based on conventional agriculture 3 2 3 emergy yield ratio eyr higher values of eyr indicate a higher return in terms of the emergy invested chen et al 2006 in the three treatments summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems eyr values were calculated respectively to be 2 008 2 676 and 1 845 table 7 comparison of eyr values of the three studied systems revealed the superiority of the spring direct seeding system in returning more emergy per the amount of emergy invested from the purchased inputs in other words the eyr value of the spring direct seeding system displayed the ability of this treatment to utilize free environmental resources more effectively based on the amount of purchased resources used by performing a purely economic analysis it can be said that the higher eyr value has an economic interpretation in that there was a lower whole cost of the production process although zhan et al 2020 considered a greater eyr value to be more indicative of higher system sustainability the higher eyr amount calculated for the spring direct seeding system compared to the other two systems in our study was due to the higher share of free non renewable environmental inputs used since the magnitude of eyr can be related to either the small sum of the purchased market inputs or the larger magnitude of the emergy output of the system or both based on the mathematical relationship its higher value in our spring direct seeding compared to the summer seedling system was due to the lower emergy of the market inputs used and a greater total emergy output while its higher value compared to the autumn direct seeded system was mainly attributed to its magnitude which was 1 69 times that of the total output of emergy from the autumn system and not its small market input of emergy in contrast the higher eyr value in the autumn direct seeding system compared to the summer seedling system was mainly due to its smaller use of market inputs amiri et al 2021 showed that the highest eyr value was related to the natural habitat system for shallot production the reason for the large eyr value of the natural habitat system compared to the three studied shallot systems was the significantly smaller size of the market inputs also in the research of lu et al 2010 the higher eyr value of the rice production system in comparison with the two production systems for vegetables and rice vegetables was mainly due to the smaller size of the market inputs in the study of amiri et al 2019 eyr of a commercial rapeseed system was estimated to be higher than that of a traditional rapeseed production system despite the larger size of market inputs to that system the main reason for the large eyr value of the commercial system was that it had a higher emergy of non renewable environmental inputs than that of the traditional rapeseed production system table 8 shows a comparison of the eyrs for several different production systems 3 2 4 emergy investment ratios standard eir and modified eir for a certain amount of emergy obtained from an economic production process a lower value of the emergy investment ratio table 2 indicates that a greater amount of emergy flow from the environment is consumed in the production of economic products these flows are provided by free renewable or non renewable environmental sources and in fact the production process in the system is associated with less economic costs thus being considered more economical le corre 2016 the eir values in the present research were calculated as 0 992 0 596 and 1 184 for the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively table 7 according to its mathematical formula the eir index is directly related to the sum of market input flows and inversely related to the sum of environmental flows the total environmental flow of the spring direct seeding system was 1 57 times higher than that of the summer seedling system and 2 04 times higher than that of the autumn direct seeding system whereas the total market input was about 1 32 times higher than that of the autumn direct seeding system table 5 therefore the eir value of the spring direct seeding system suggested that the larger share of emergy spent on product production was due to market resources the emergy related to the seedling input in the summer seedling system was the main difference in the corresponding inputs compared to the other two systems in this study the seedlings and their planting method caused the use of more machinery and fossil fuels compared to the other two systems without reducing the labor input or benefiting more from the free environmental inputs this production method was found to be more costly than that used in the other two systems based on the eir index the net profit of the summer seedling system was lower due to the lower amount of economic production and more costly method of managing inputs table 1 therefore the main reason for the increase in the eir value in the summer seedling system was the increase in the purchased inputs because of the use of seedlings instead of seeds on the other hand due to the short length of the growth period and the delay in planting the seedlings the benefits of seedling cultivation were not exploited fully the reduction of the production potential caused by a lower utilization of free environmental and market inputs per week of planting delay has been reported to be significant gholami qajloo et al 2015 however in our seedling system the planting date of seedlings differed from the planting date of seeds in the other two systems by about 13 weeks whereas the maximum difference between the direct seeding and seedling planting dates has been recommended to be 8 weeks yousefabadi 2017 the reason for the greater eir value of the autumn direct seeding compared to the spring direct seeding system was the lower r share of the total input flow into the autumn direct seeding system due to the lower groundwater input from a non renewable source compared to the other two systems therefore based on the modified eir version i e eir amiri et al 2019 the autumn direct seeding system was found to be less unsustainable and economical than the other two systems examined in this study also the net profit from the production systems presented in table 1 confirmed the analysis that the autumn direct seeding system was more economical in this research in the research of xi and qin 2009 on two different agricultural systems the comparison of eir values showed more economic efficiency of the organic system of rice and duck production with an eir value of 1 71 compared to the rice wheat system with an eir value of 4 26 in another study the eir values for commercial and traditional rapeseed production systems were reported to be 0 76 and 1 86 and the eir values where the effects of renewable resources used nonrenewably were removed these values were 9 00 and 8 94 respectively amiri et al 2019 comparison of the eir values presented in table 8 with the eir values calculated in the current study indicated the relatively favorable status of the eirs in the three studied systems 3 2 5 environmental load ratios standard elr and modified elr the environmental pressure caused by the intensity of the utilization of environmental services can be expressed by the environmental load ratio elr barros et al 2009 for agricultural systems the elr index which is calculated from the ratio of total non renewable environmental and market inputs to renewable environmental and market inputs shows the renewability of the system during agricultural production processes dalzotto artuzo et al 2021 in this research the elr values in the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were respectively 254 99 167 37 and 58 83 table 7 the high share of market inputs and non renewable environmental inputs compared to the free environmental renewable inputs led to an increase in the elr value in comparison to those obtained by the other five studies presented in table 8 the elr values of the summer seedling spring and autumn direct seeding systems were respectively 48 328 47 095 and 22 790 generally elr values of more than 10 indicate severe pressure on the environment zhan et al 2020 in this investigation the higher share of non renewable compared to renewable market inputs and the higher share of free environmental non renewable compared with renewable inputs resulted in a large elr value of course the trends between the elrs of the three studied systems could be estimated from the trend of the r index presented in table 7 in fact the small value of the r index can indicate large elr values the small value of r and the large values of elr were alarming in causing the ecological unsustainability of all three methods of sugar beet production based on the elr values in this study the environmental pressure created by the summer seedling system was 2 7 and 6 8 times higher than that of the spring and autumn direct seeding systems respectively also according to the elr index the environmental pressures in the two systems of summer seedling and spring direct seeding systems respectively were approximately equal to and almost twice as high as that of the autumn direct seeding system lu et al 2017 stated that by comparing the elr values of three different lotus systems the values were reported to change within the range of 2 8 2 3 in the research conducted by amiri et al 2021 elr values in the studied systems of shallot production ranged from 2 87 to 5 15 3 2 6 environmental sustainability index standard esi and modified esi maximization of a system s emergy yield is associated with declining environmental loads based on the esi index as an indicator of sustainability almeida et al 2020 the larger the esi value the greater the emergy yield that the load on the environment will allow ulgiati and brown 1998 the ideal and best esi relationship occurs based on the economical status of the production flow through enhancing the eyr along with environmental adaptation through reducing the elr rotolo et al 2007 although the eyr values of other studies mentioned in table 7 were not very different from those of this study extremely small esi values compared to those of the other studies were achieved because the elr values of this study were clearly different from other values reported in table 8 according to the views of ulgiati and brown 1998 and hu et al 2010 who provide the classification of sustainable esi 5 semi sustainable esi 1 5 and unsustainable esi 1 systems thus all three systems in the present study were found to be far from sustainability the esi values of the spring direct seeding and summer seedling systems were respectively 94 and 287 lower than those found in the autumn direct seeding system the elr index shows that the pressure exerted on the environment by the fall seeding system was 4 33 times lower than the summer seedling system and 2 84 times lower than the spring seeding system decreased market inputs especially reduced fn as well as an increased share of r among the inputs to each system lead to enhanced esi values as can be seen in table 4 both the aforementioned inputs to the summer seedling system are contrary to the trends of the other two systems the higher esi induced by its higher eyr can be interpreted as economic sustainability in terms of a lower whole cost associated with the production process 3 2 7 emergy exchange ratio eer when exchanging goods at the macroeconomic level e g between two countries an indicator called the emergy money ratio emr 1 1 emr is the ratio of the total emergy supporting a country s production as a macroeconomic system of production to its gross domestic product gdp this ratio can be used to estimate the emergy associated with the monetary values of the final products produced in that country i e sej money unit is taken into account to establish an approximate equivalence between the economic and emergy flows of the system in a trade between two different countries the country with the lower emr value is known as the developed country compared to the country with the higher emr value where a monetary unit spent will buy more emergy so more emergy can be obtained abroad with the money of the developing country cuadra and rydberg 2006 the eer index can be defined between the producer as a seller on the market and the buyer in the market in order to examine the status of commercial advantage and fairness of a product exchange within the market currencies and production systems cavalett and ortega 2009 since the fairest state of emergy exchange is equivalent to an eer value of 1 if the eer value is less than 1 the seller manufacturer will have a gerater chance of winning in the exchange and vice versa agostinho et al 2008 in this study the eer values calculated in all the three systems summer seedling 0 174 spring direct seeding 0 224 and autumn direct seeding 0 105 systems were lower than 1 table 7 in other words during the exchange of sugar beet products with the market i e sugar and lump sugar factories the producers or factory owners gained more advantage over sugar beet buyers in terms of the emergy exchange in the summer seedling system an emergy amount of 4 95e 16 sej ha 1 was spent for production while the amount of emergy received by the farmers from the buyers in the market was 2 84e 16 sej ha 1 or 50 of the intial investment in the spring direct seeding system the emergy flow spent for producing the product was 6 86e 16 sej ha 1 of which only 3 08e 16 sej ha 1 was received for the exchange on the market also in the autumn direct seeding system the emergy flow consumed in the production process was 3 59e 16 sej ha 1 of which the amount 3 41e 16 sej ha 1 was returned during the market transaction or 83 3 of the initil investment the eer values demonstrate a fairness in trade advantage of the autumn direct seeding system over the other two systems during the emergy exchange on the market the spring direct seeding convential system achieved an amount 3 86e 16 sej ha 1 less than the emergy flow consumed in the production process or 44 of the initial investment it was thus identified as the least fair production system in the study table 8 compares the eer values presented in 4 different studies 3 2 8 emergy index for sustainable development eisd emergy index for sustainable development eisd is obtained by modifying the esi index with the eer index lu and campbell 2009 since the dependence of the eisd index is equally on the market and the environmental inputs the impact it receives from costly purchased inputs on the one hand bastianoni et al 2007 and the effect of the emr or ym component due to taking into account the eer index on the other hand would lead to an increase in the strength of the eisd compared to the esi index in the development of various dimensions of sustainability because it reflects both the ecological and economic factors determining sustainability the eisd values calculated in the current study for the summer seedling spring and autumn direct seeding systems were 1 37e 03 3 34e 03 and 1 16e 03 respectively table 7 as a result the following is the sustainability trend in the three sugar beet production systems the summer seedling system the spring direct seeding system the autumn direct seeding system although the esi value of the spring direct seeding system was 7 times that of the summer seedling system and twice that of the fall direct seeding system the eisd of the spring direct seeding system was about 4 times that of the summer seedling system and nearly equal to that of the autumn direct seeding system the eisd is an excellent index for evaluating systems the calculation of the eer index the price of the product is considered as a constant component while the other components utilized in computing the eisd are changeable in addition sugar beet is an agricultural commodity that is produced on a contractual basis between the manufacturer and the farmer and its price is determined annually by the government therefore the braiding and interactions between the three indicators eyr eer with direct impact and elr with reverse impact lead to the establishment of an extraordinary index eisd table 8 presents the calculated eisd values of two other systems for comparison with those of our studied systems the eisd values reported in the study of lu et al 2018 were calculated with the inverse effect of the eer index on the eisd index because their eer calculation method was the opposite of the approach taken in this research 3 2 9 emergy index of product safety eips the eips index is applied to evaluate the effects of fertilizers and chemical toxins on a product the higher the value of this index the greater the safety of the manufactured products will be guan et al 2016 since the relationship between the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in agricultural products and their adverse effects on human health and their threat to human immunity has been proven leong et al 2020 the eips index can identify an alarming situation before announcing the laboratory results of a product indicating the potential impact of the product s safety on health the eips of the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were respectively 0 387 0 219 and 0 219 hence the production safety in the summer seedling process was about twice as high as that of the other two systems the safety of agricultural products such as sugar beets is dependent not only on the quantity of fertilizers and chemicals used but also on their residual levels in the products however eips does not account for residuals and only indicates the total amount of fertilizers and chemicals used during production when using the eips index to compare the safety of different items with varying chemical responses extreme caution is required yousefabadi 2017 also reported a saving of 30 50 in the use of herbicides pesticides and chemical fertilizers in sugar beet seedling plantings compared to its direct cultivation table 8 shows the calculated eips values of two additional studies the eips values in the study of xi and qin 2009 have been recalculated and now fall in the range from 0 34 1 00 3 2 10 emergy investment per unit of net profit einrp einrp is the amount of supporting emergy per unit of net income generated in a system zhang et al 2011 2012 this can suggest an advantage of higher ecological sustainability in the production process especially when the share of renewable flows is high in the present research the highest value of the einrp index occurred during the spring direct seeding followed by the summer seedling system table 7 the autumn direct seeding system with the lowest einrp was recognized as the best system according to this index in the study of zhang et al 2011 the most intensive system showed the highest amount of einrp because of this large investment moreover in their study done in 2012 the lowest amount of einrp was found in the corn production system overall in their research animal breeding systems fish and duck provided a larger amount of einrp compared to those of the agricultural and mushroom breeding systems due to the need for more capital 3 2 11 economic indices of output input o i and net benefit density nbd based on money and em value to analyze the economic conditions of our three studied systems two economic indices including the output input o i ratio and the net benefit density nbd were employed furthermore for simultaneous evaluation of the ecological and economic dimensions of the process em value was utilized in the form of the two indicators of o iemv and nbdemv table 7 generally economic flows based on emergy evaluation flows are different from monetary flows nonetheless monetary flows and interests based on the market value of money do not reflect the value and environmental benefits of a product and thus the market price does not reflect the real price of a product xi and qin 2009 therefore em value as real wealth is both based on the emergy unit sej and depicts currency estimation and conversion bastianoni et al 2007 calculation of em value based indices can eliminate the need for separate emergy and economic value assessments bastianoni et al 2007 for calculating o iemv in our study first the em value of the economic product as the output was calculated by multiplying the produced amount of sugar beet tubers j of each system by the sugar beet transformity 8 49e 04 sej j 1 reported by ulgiati et al 1994 and then by dividing the result by the amount of em rials or emrs reported for the iranian currency 6 76e 07 sej rial 1 based on 2017 data expressed by asgharipour et al 2020 also the em value of the inputs was calculated by dividing the total emergy of the inputs by the calculated emr value for iran in addition nbds represented the net profit based on the market price and em value per hectare in this study the uev value from a reliable source was utilized to compute the o iem however the calculation based on the result of a single case study has a limitation because the o iem is sensitive to the uev chosen for the calculation since em value represents the economic environmental contribution of production as a whole subtraction of the economic market value from it once converted to emmoney would approximate the amount of environmental contribution therefore the difference between nbdm and nbdemv can be considered as a reflection of the environmental benefit or disadvantage of the production process such that the higher value of nbdm compared to nbdemv demonstrates the environmental disadvantage of the process and a larger value of nbdemv compared to nbdm indicates its environmental benefit as long as the value of nbdemv is higher than nbdm the subtraction would be positive indicating the environmental benefits of the process while a negative value demonstrates environmental loss in the process in the present study the emergy difference between nbdemv and nbdm has been called the environmental benefit density ebd the values of the o i and nbd indices based on the market currency value and em value are presented in table 7 the o im values are the economic returns calculated based on the market currency values in the autumn direct seeding 2 61 spring direct seeding 1 86 summer seedling 1 70 also the o iemv values for the summer seedling and spring and autumn direct seeding systems were reported to be 9 00e 06 6 70e 06 and 1 39e 07 respectively the efficiency values of the systems in terms of em value o iemv indicated better economic environmental performance of the autumn direct seeding system compared to the other two systems the spring direct seeding system also revealed the lowest economic environmental efficiency compared to the other two systems the nbdm and nbdemv values had the same trend and indicated superiority of the autumn direct seeding system over the other two systems table 7 the calculated ebd value also demonstrated the environmental benefits of all the three systems according to the trend autumn direct seeding system summer seedling system spring direct seeding system comparing the economic ecological sustainability of three cattle breeding systems in iran o im values represented superiority of economic returns based on the market value in the open cattle breeding system however the o iemv values showed an advantage of the semi compact system of production based on the economic environmental contribution compared to the other two systems in the mentioned study the net benefit nbemv values in both open and closed cattle breeding systems were found to be negative numbers which were indicative of the greater economic environmental contribution of the inputs compared to the outputs in this system amiri et al man in the organic rice duck production system and in the traditional rice wheat rotation system in xi and qin 2009 the o im and nbdm indices were reported to be 1 46 and 1 70 and 571 us m 2 and 889 us m 2 respectively unlike o im o iemv displayed the advantage of the organic rice duck system over the traditional rice wheat rotation system moreover the higher net economic benefit based on em value nbdemv in the organic rice duck system compared to the traditional rice wheat rotation system was further emphasized xi and qin 2009 attributed the differences in o im o iemv nbdm and nbdemv trends among their studied systems to the combined reflection of economic and environmental statuses further highlighted by em value rather than market price indices xi and qin 2009 4 conclusion and policy implications the issue that sustainability is an important factor for choosing efficient agricultural systems and in developing the future agricultural sector has been agreed upon by many researchers sands and podmore 2000 bockstaller et al 2009 artuzoet al 2021 the application of the concept of sustainability has been useful in identifying the differences between varied agricultural systems and in replacing environmentally unsustainable systems with less unsustainable ones in other words highlighting the components of sustainability in the production process has led to innovations in introducing adaptive agricultural systems of course if sustainability analysis is performed through a thermodynamic approach and uses a reliable emergy method it will be able to highlight the causes of a system s incompatibilities and present an alternative solution for decreasing unsustainability because sugar beets are grown in varied climates throughout iran and because the crop is produced in the legal form of a contract between the sugar mill and the farmer with fixed input and output pricing the findings of this study can be applied to the entire country the situation governing sugar beet production in three different production systems was investigated in this study the cost or price of each kilogram of product produced in the summer seedling spring and autumn direct seeding systems were determined to be 3528 50 3753 80 and 2797 00 rials respectively in terms of emergy structure the values of the emergy indicators and the cost price per unit of production the spring direct seeding system was deemed to be unsustainable autumn direct seeding on the other hand was deemed less unsustainable than the other two sugar beet production methods both in terms of cost per unit of production and emergy components 19 of the 23 indicators evaluated in this study indicated that autumn direct seeding was more sustainable than the other two systems the diminution of the eyr and consequently the eisd is also attributable to the diminutive size of nonrenewable environmental inputs n0 due to the nonrenewability and environmental burden of these inputs the lower n0 content in autumn direct seeding is regarded as a sign of sustainability in terms of its emergy structure in addition out of the 23 indicators listed in table 7 spring direct seeding is superior to the summer seedling system in terms of six indicators trom speom percent r elr esi and esi and is superior to the other two systems in terms of three indicators eir eyr and eisd given that out of 23 calculated indices 19 indices supported the sustainability of the autumn direc seeding system and due to the continuation of the drought phenomenon and the forecasting of more water crises in most parts of iran the lowest level of dependence on groundwater in the autumn system the government is compelled to develop and promote autumn cultivation of sugar beet as opposed to spring and summer cultivation due to the greater sustainability of the autumn direct seeding system as well as the significant advantage of seedling cultivation for providing a significant reduction in the use of chemical pesticides further studies on the sustainability of the autumn seeding and spring sugar beet seedling systems are recommended credit authorship contribution statement zahra amiri conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation resources data curation

24372,human appropriation of net primary production hanpp is nearly 25 of global potential npp and above 40 in europe plutzar et al 2015 simultaneously land use change and intensification are two major threats to biodiversity flynn et al 2009 pereira et al 2012 yet the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem s productivity is highly context dependent and the global impacts of land use intensity despite its increasing relevance are still poorly understood we assess the impacts of land use intensity as a component of hanpp on ecological stability through an ecological network model with two trophic levels we compare the impacts of harvest intensity and distribution on three metrics of ecosystem s stability namely asymptotic stability biomass variability and species persistence i e structural robustness relating those to the ecosystem s capacity to sustain provisioning services e g total yields we found that increasing land use intensity drives a decrease in all metrics of ecological stability also affecting the ecosystem s productivity in a non monotonous way moreover these impacts severity depend primarily on the community s richness and the harvest s distribution this study advances knowledge on the ecological impacts of land use intensity revealing how it affects distinct metrics of ecological stability how these relate to the sustenance of ecosystem processes and the role of disturbances magnitude and distribution our results suggest that more biodiverse agricultural systems and homogeneous harvest distributions e g through polycultures could

induced by human societies navarro and pereira 2012 pereira et al 2012 studies show that intensive agriculture is mostly confined to areas of high net primary productivity npp luck 2007 with croplands and pastures covering approximately 40 of global land surface foley et al 2005 and humans appropriating about 30 of global above ground npp miko and storch 2015 as a major driver of biodiversity change ma 2005 pereira et al 2012 land use change and intensification are greatly reducing species richness and ecosystem functioning affecting global carbon nutrients and hydrological cycles flynn et al 2009 green et al 2005 haberl et al 2004 2014 kleijn et al 2009 koellner and geyer 2013 nelson et al 2009 souza et al 2013 nowadays land use intensity predicts biodiversity patterns so well as environmental factors kehoe et al 2016 and as the importance of land use change declines land use intensity becomes the most important driver of human appropriation of npp hanpp kastner et al 2021 yet our understanding of how land use intensity changes may impact biodiversity and ecosystem processes including provision and regulation services remains limited kastner et al 2021 miko and storch 2015 hanpp sums the productivity changes arising from land use conversion and harvest haberl et al 2007 such that it offers an indicator of land use intensity haberl et al 2014 kastner et al 2021 krausmann et al 2013 both in terms of output intensity i e harvest per unit area and at systemic level i e hanpp as percentage of potential npp this study focus on the hanpp component linked to harvest intensity land use change accounts for 40 of global hanpp haberl et al 2014 and seize 20 of global potential npp weinzettel et al 2019 driving habitat loss and fragmentation along with major biodiversity changes pereira et al 2012 marques et al 2019 conversely harvest accounts for 60 of global hanpp haberl et al 2014 in the last century hanpp doubled from 13 to 25 of global potential npp krausmann et al 2013 with land use intensification more than land conversion playing an increasing role shaping land use patterns kastner et al 2021 this rise in agricultural efficiency i e output intensity is linked to high dependency on external inputs e g water energy and nitrogen and significant ecological costs leading to water and soil degradation krausmann et al 2013 declines in plant species richness begon et al 2009 kleijn et al 2009 and reduced ecosystem s capacity to sustain fundamental services such as food production climate and pest regulation foley et al 2005 hanpp is directly linked to human impacts in hydrological cycles and ecosystem s carbon and nutrients flows haberl et al 2014 but the full consequences of removing npp to biodiversity and ecological processes remain elusive haberl et al 2014 kastner et al 2021 miko and storch 2015 the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem services supply is highly context dependent haines young 2009 and influenced by potential trade offs between intensive food production regulation services and biodiversity begon et al 2009 kandziora et al 2012 maes et al 2012 nelson et al 2009 through the species energy hypothesis hanpp is predicted to decrease species richness begon et al 2009 bonn et al 2004 costanza et al 2007 hurlbert and jetz 2010 jetz and fine 2012 as ecosystem productivity correlates with a wider range of resources available resulting in an increasing number of species along the global energy gradient bonn et al 2004 hurlbert and jetz 2010 luck 2007 this relates to the notion of an environmental carrying capacity describing the balance between consumed and available resources e g świąder et al 2020 however as productivity is affected by multiple interdependent factors such as energy and water availability begon et al 2009 jetz and fine 2012 the exact species energy relationship might exhibit different shapes and is still widely debated hurlbert and jetz 2010 haberl et al 2014 miko and storch 2015 still the few studies that explored the relation of species richness with remaining npp i e available npp after harvest found a monotonous relationship with species richness haberl et al 2014 simultaneously our understanding of how major environmental pressures such as hanpp impact the stability of ecological processes remains remarkably limited donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 since may s work 1972 the relationship between ecological complexity and stability is highly debated allesina et al 2015 ives and carpenter 2007 johnson et al 1996 montoya et al 2006 plitzko et al 2012 pimm 1984 and the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem s stability remain unclear feng and bailey 2018 montoya et al 2018 meanwhile environmental sciences shifted focus from maintaining stability per se to embrace the importance of ecological change ladle and gilson 2009 and avoid catastrophic regime shifts montoya et al 2018 however most research still focus on single components of stability complexity and disturbances rather than considering their multidimensional and interdependent nature donohue et al 2013 2016 feng and bailey 2018 kéfi et al 2019 moreover despite the importance of sustaining ecological functions and derived ecosystem services e g díaz et al 2018 few studies address the impacts on stability of major drivers of global change e g spatial land pressures explore the effects of press disturbances and their magnitude or focus on the asymptotic stability resilience and resistance of ecological processes donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 the study of ecological networks aims to understand how the complexity observed in nature persists and how it affects ecosystems functioning bascompte 2009 montoya et al 2006 pilosof et al 2017 proulx et al 2005 central attention has been given to identify common topologies linked to robust properties kharrazi et al 2013 pimm et al 1991 scheffer 2009 scheffer et al 2012 predict the structural properties of empirical networks allesina et al 2008 2015 montoya and solé 2002 williams and martinez 2000 and explore how perturbations impact the network s structure and dynamics bascompte 2009 2010 ives and carpenter 2007 the network s topological characteristics are major determinants of its internal dynamics allesina et al 2008 costa et al 2005 williams 2008 with empirical networks often presenting small world properties bascompte 2009 ings et al 2009 montoya et al 2006 proulx et al 2005 and the distribution of links even more than the interactions magnitude being considered one of the most important aspects linked to stability allesina et al 2015 ings et al 2009 scheffer et al 2012 yet understanding ecological stability requires acknowledging its multidimensionality whose components include resilience resistance robustness variability and persistence donohue et al 2013 montoya et al 2018 pimm 1984 therefore with most studies focusing on single aspects of stability addressed in isolation and in the absence of any perturbation donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 research risks underestimating significantly the ecological impacts of disturbances the present work aims to explore the impacts on ecosystem s stability productivity and diversity of increasing land use intensity represented by the hanpp s harvest component erb et al 2009 haberl et al 2007 we use an ecological network model with two trophic levels modified from allesina et al 2008 to assess impacts upon three distinct metrics of ecological stability 1 local stability analysis as an indicator of the ecosystem s overall integrity 2 total biomass variability as temporal changes in the community s overall densities and 3 species persistence or structural robustness as the proportion of species driven to extinction and remaining biodiversity the human driven ecosystem disturbance is defined by hanpp along a gradient of harvest intensity based on the number of species harvested and the proportion of biomass removed we compare results for ecological networks with low and high species richness relating impacts with the ecosystem s capacity to sustain provisioning services measured as the total yield obtained along a hanpp gradient finally we test the hypothesis that a biomimetic principle in food production systems defined by high species richness and evenly distributed harvest intensities could reduce trade offs between biodiversity and agricultural yields in farmlands assuming that ecological communities tend to form nested structures with relatively large subsets of species linked through diverse weak links generalist species ings et al 2009 may 1972 montoya et al 2006 the model is inspired in and broadly valid for agroecological systems including croplands pastures and agroforestry systems or any other system where harvest is restricted to primary producers results may apply to monocultures e g croplands whenever only one producer species is harvested and to polycultures e g croplands and agroforestry when more than one or all producer species are harvested despite the presence of other producers e g weeds grazing may be considered as harvesting of producers by livestock with the harvest intensity being proportional to the stocking rate and harvested species the preferred livestock diet to focus on hanpp impacts the model does not consider the use of herbicides nor pesticides which are common in intensive agricultural systems and would artificially lower non harvested species abundances in any case general species abundances and constant harvest rates are but first approximations to real agroecological systems which depending on their management may not always be in a stable equilibrium prior to harvest an assumption made to primarily explore hanpp impacts on ecosystem s stability 2 materials and methods the ecological network modelled is a global asymmetric multipartite structure composed by asymmetric interactions defined by a direction and strength each node represents a group of individuals of a specific species which belong to one of two trophic levels primary producers and consumers two types of interactions are considered i competition between producers species and ii trophic between consumers and producers species interactions are distributed according to the limiting similarity principle in the case of competition hughes and roughgarden 2000 and the minimum potential niche model for trophic links allesina et al 2008 thus the network is characterized by i the number of species s ii the network s connectance c and iii the probability of forbidden links f the first two parameters are associated with the system s complexity and have been widely related with the network s stability bascompte 2009 may 1972 montoya et al 2006 the connectance is a measure of the relative number of connections defined here by the general form c l s2 where l is the actual number of connections and s2 is the total number of possible connections pascual and dunne 2005 the probability of forbidden links accounts for potential gaps in the observed range of species diet which arise from considering multidimensional niche axis through the overlap of several species traits allesina et al 2008 hanpp is modelled as an external perturbation constant over time defined by the proportion of biomass harvested per species on the interval 0 1 r and by the set of species harvested on the interval 1 n n where n is the number of producer s species we generate communities with total species richness between 3 and 13 species and for each richness we estimate the frequency of locally stable communities across 1000 sample networks this sample defines the probability of local equilibria stability mougi and kondoh 2012 we select the subset of positive locally stable communities and introduce harvest as a constant press perturbation our results are restricted to this subset on which we test varying harvest intensities and subsequently reassess the system s dynamics the model run over 10 times to test the consistency of results the dynamics follow the generalized lotka volterra equations case 2000 and are analysed through the generation of a time series with t 2000 iterations for each hanpp scenario the hanpp scenarios cover a gradient of harvest intensity based on the proportion of biomass and the set of species harvested the initial condition is defined at the local stable equilibrium of the unperturbed community and harvest is introduced after a time t 10 therefore we assume the species densities were initially in equilibrium and that a constant rate of resource s exploitation was performed since then moving the system out of the original equilibrium the ecosystem s dynamics are then assessed through i local stability analysis ii total biomass variability iii proportion of species extinctions and iv mean total yield obtained over time 2 1 ecological network the network dynamics are modelled according to the generalized lotka volterra equations case 2000 where producers grow logistically and consumers have a type i functional response given the species density vector y with size s the intrinsic growth rates vector k and the adjacency matrix m with dimensions sxs the system is represented in the general form by 2 1 d y dt k m y y eq 2 1 have a unique solution if and only if all columns lines of matrix m are linearly independent to guarantee this condition the number of primary producers n and the number of consumer species m must satisfy n m case 2000 so here consumers are defined as ¾ the number of producers and rounded to the nearest lower integer pascual and dunne 2005 then for example for s 3 there are two producers and one consumer harvest is introduced in eq 2 1 through a vector h with size n and components h i 0 1 different from zero only if species i is harvested the elements hi represent the proportion of biomass removed from each species and in each scenario are identical for all species harvested h hi then if the vectors p and c represent respectively the densities of primary producers and consumers species with the respective size equal to n and m eq 2 1 can be written as the system of equations roughgarden 1998 2 2 d p dt d c dt r d r α k a b a t 0 p c h 0 p c where the vector r is the intrinsic growth rate of primary producers d the death rate of consumers and k the vector of carrying capacities of each producer s species the matrix α with elements α i j and dimension nxn describe competitive interactions between producers species i and j the matrix a with elements aij and dimension mxn represents the encounter rate between consumer j and producer i whereas b is a matrix mxn which describes the effect of each preyed species on a specific consumer growth also known as the consumer s conversion efficiency in this context hanpp is defined by the average proportion of biomass removed from each producer s species hanpp i 1 n h h p i i 1 n p i such that each hanpp scenario is characterized by the parameters h proportion of biomass harvested and nh number of species harvested 2 1 1 predation the trophic network is based on the minimum potential niche model allesina et al 2008 modified by constraining the diet center to impose a specific trophic structure nxm a niche position ηi is assign to each species from a continuous uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 species are sorted in the one dimensional niche axis according to their ηi value such that for any species with i j ηi ηj the first n species are ascribed as primary producers and the remaining as consumers an independent diet interval i j is assigned to each consumer species j determining a vector of potential preys composed by all species for which η i i j the first and last elements of this vector are selected as the diet of consumer j with other species in the diet interval being ascribed through a binomial distribution with probability 1 f the procedure is repeated for any consumer with an empty diet or any two identical diets the diet interval is given by i j c j rd j 2 c j rd j 2 where rd j is the diet range and c j the diet center the diet range is defined by r d j x η j where x is a random variable with a beta distribution such that x b 1 β thus β is species independent and given by 2 3 β 1 2 c t 1 where ct is the target connectance of the trophic network this will be higher than the actual connectance due to possible gaps on the diet range but we will ignore the difference as it favours the community s stability may 1972 the center of the diet interval is taken from a continuous uniform distribution of the niche axis sub region such that 2 4 c j u r d j 2 η j r d j 2 i f η j r d j 0 the condition is necessarily true as the maximum value of rd j is η j in which case c j will be equal to η j 2 moreover to maintain the proportion in trophic levels the diet of species j must be constrained to species i for which η i η j so eq 2 2 remains valid 2 1 2 competition we assume a limiting similarity principle hughes and roughgarden 2000 to model the competition network where producer species compete with their most similar species overlapping in resource use by α with its two nearest neighbours species on the niche axis to build the competition network the community is assumed to be circular the first and last species in the niche axis compete with each other hughes and roughgarden 2000 thus the resulting adjacency matrix is given by 2 5 α 1 α 12 0 α 1 n α 21 1 α 23 0 0 α 32 1 α n 1 n α n 1 0 0 1 2 1 3 parameters and average interaction strength the average interaction strength δ is chosen so it meets the condition δ s c 1 2 this ensures the adjacency matrix m has a high probability of being stable may 1972 however the relative width of the transition region from stability to instability scales with s 2 3 for s 1 may 1972 so in order to guarantee that the average interaction strength remains in the stability region we define δ s c 1 2 s 2 3 the default values for all model parameters are listed in appendix a from eq 2 2 assuming all interactions have the same average value α a b the mean square interaction strength of the non null elements of m is assumed to be δ α 2 in practice as r k 1 s and b i j 1 i j these parameters imply a change which carry δ further into the stability region not compromising the previous assumption see appendix b then the elements of the adjacency matrix m corresponding to matrixes α a and b are estimated by a random variable x from a normal distribution with mean μ 0 and standard deviation σ e x μ 2 δ α α the type of interaction is defined using the absolute value of x 2 2 ecosystem analysis to evaluate the system s local stability we consider the lyapunov definition of asymptotic stability where stability is defined in a local neighbourhood of the equilibrium from eq 2 1 the existence of a positive interior equilibrium solution y is given by 2 6 d y d t 0 y m 1 h k the density of producers and consumers species in the interior equilibrium assuming the same average interaction strength for all interactions α a b is given by the solution s vectors p and c 2 7 d p dt 0 d c dt 0 p α 2 d c α 1 r 1 α 1 r k α 1 h we look for equilibria solutions where all species co exist so we exclude all trivial solutions where species have a null density then to assess the local stability of the equilibria we calculate the jacobian matrix j at the fixed point 2 7 and obtain the i 1 s eigenvalues λ i 1 2 of the matrix j 2 8 λ i 1 2 α 1 r d 2 k α 2 r d 2 k 2 d r h α 1 r d 2 k the equilibrium is locally stable if all eigenvalues have a negative real part ℜ λ i 1 2 0 thus if the term δ inside the square root of eq 2 8 is negative the eigenvalues are complex conjugated with real part r λ i 1 r λ i 2 α 1 r d 2 k and the equilibrium is stable whenever all parameters are positive the condition for δ 0 is mathematically equivalent to the condition for having positive species densities at equilibria see appendix c therefore equilibria with δ 0 have no ecological meaning we assess the biomass variability by obtaining the standard deviation of the community s total biomass over time where the total biomass is the sum of all individual species densities the total yield obtained is given by the sum of the biomass harvested from each producer species after running the simulation for t 2000 iterations species with densities below 0 01 are considered to be extinct as we assume that densities below this critical value are not viable for the species survival in the long term roughgarden 1998 3 results as expected when increasing the species richness the frequency of locally stable equilibria decreases and the frequency of unstable equilibria increases fig 1 may 1972 however for non random ecological networks we also found that the frequency of positive equilibria decreases with the species richness and that as a consequence of eq 2 2 positive equilibria are locally stable the frequency of locally stable equilibria decreases with hanpp fig 2 nonetheless when all producer s species are harvested communities keep their stability for a wider range of harvest intensities this result is independent of their species richness additionally communities with lower richness also tend to remain stable for higher hanpp values independently of how many species are harvested as expected whenever any species is completely harvested ecological communities lose their local stability we found that biomass variability as the median standard deviation of total biomass across all communities increases with hanpp fig 3 communities with high species richness as well as those for which all producer species are harvested present the highest biomass variability yet when only one species is harvested the biomass variability exhibits wider heterogeneity across communities under the same conditions regardless their richness wider inter percentile range in fig 3 increasing hanpp triggers a decrease in species persistence through an increased proportion of species extinctions on a raising proportion of communities fig 4 which reflects a decrease in the communities structural robustness as expected for high hanpp values when all producer s species are harvested all communities suffer extinctions yet communities with lower species richness present the highest rate of extinctions and also the highest rate of species lost at the lowest harvest intensities similarly when only one species is harvested both the proportion of species extinctions and communities facing extinctions is highest even at low harvest intensities however in this case at the highest harvest intensity just half of those communities lose species independently of their richness the total yield obtained presents a maximum for intermediate hanpp values fig 5 the total yield obtained is higher when all producers species are harvested communities with high species richness also provide the highest yield both when one or all producers species are harvested regardless the community s richness the total yield s variability across communities is also higher when only one species is harvested 4 discussion this study advances evidence that increasing land use intensity decreases the ecosystem s stability in terms of asymptotic stability biomass variability and species persistence or the community s structural robustness the results support that ecological complexity as measured by the number and strength of interactions within an ecosystem determine its probability to have a stable configuration may 1971 1972 under our model assumptions we found that the frequency of stable communities is determined by the existence of positive equilibria with these being necessarily stable but not the opposite in addition supporting the importance of the interactions distribution for ecological stability bascompte 2009 mougi and kondoh 2012 pascual and dunne 2005 we showed that the distribution and magnitude of disturbances determines the extent of impacts on the community s stability across the three metrics examined the removal of biomass in particular the harvest intensity is known to impose changes in the number and stability of equilibria hirsch et al 2004 roughgarden 1998 our results are consistent with these previous studies specifically showing that the frequency of locally stable equilibria decreases with hanpp moreover we show that the distribution of harvest among producer species determines its impacts on the community s asymptotic stability a homogeneous harvest distribution among producer species preserves the interactions relative strength and symmetry of the unperturbed system minimizing the stability s impacts of hanpp regardless of the community s richness still more complex communities may suffer higher impacts this advances previous studies on the stability s effects of perturbations donohue et al 2016 loreau and mazancourt 2013 kéfi et al 2019 while in accordance with previous studies the patterns found highlight the relevance of the network s topology as the distribution and connectance of interactions types for determining its ecological dynamics bascompte 2009 2010 may 1972 pascual and dunne 2005 this study shows that increasing land use intensity triggers a steady augment in total biomass variability supporting previous studies on the importance of considering biomass variability for understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function hughes and roughgarden 2000 ives et al 1999 the introduction of harvest takes the system out of its previous equilibrium inducing fluctuations in species densities which may or may not lead the system to a new equilibrium case 2000 hirsch et al 2004 these induced biomass fluctuations are often periodic resulting from limit cycles in predator prey dynamics case 2000 roughgarden 1998 although may also occur as occasional sudden fluctuations usually preceding a regime shift and the extinction of species scheffer et al 2012 in accordance our results suggest a positive relationship between stability metrics namely asymptotic stability and biomass variability donohue et al 2013 more biodiverse ecosystems present higher biomass variability regardless the number of species harvested suggesting a negative relation between complexity and stability hughes and roughgarden 2000 montoya et al 2006 yet the way impacts propagate through the network depends on its specific structure and again along with the disturbance s magnitude our results reveal the relevance of the perturbation s distribution in triggering different ecological responses with communities presenting wider heterogenous responses when only one species is harvested the dynamics present a regime shift when harvest is introduced and as the frequency of interior equilibria decreases with hanpp we observe a decrease in species persistence and communities structural robustness increasing both the rate of species extinctions and communities suffering extinctions these results are consistent with previous theoretical and empirical studies on the species energy relationship begon et al 2009 bonn et al 2004 hurlbert and jetz 2010 and particularly those where hanpp has been identified as a driver of biodiversity loss haberl et al 2004 2005 2014 kehoe et al 2016 in our study less biodiverse ecosystems and those where only one species is harvested exhibit lower species persistence and structural robustness even at low harvest intensities in addition increasing harvest above half of the available npp may drive a significant decrease in species persistence also on communities with an even harvest distribution as the reduction in resources availability may force a decrease in consumer s density but also occasionally reduce the competition for the same resources case 2000 roughgarden 1998 the distribution of interactions and disturbances determine the emergence of positive or negative feedback loops bascompte 2009 case 2000 montoya et al 2006 roughgarden 1998 which may eventually trigger a cascade effect on species extinctions finally our results support a total yield higher in both more biodiverse communities and when all producer s species are harvested therefore compared to monocultures biodiverse agricultural systems e g polycultures may enhance the total yield obtained while reducing land use impacts on the communities asymptotic stability and structural robustness our results also suggest such systems could reduce food insecurity arising from uncertainty in yields higher when one species is harvested in communities with lower biodiversity as such this study presents evidence of a positive relation between polycultures and provisioning ecosystem services in agreement with the species energy hypothesis begon et al 2009 hurlbert and jetz 2010 jetz and fine 2012 and empirical evidence of a positive biodiversity s role in agricultural systems altieri 1999 altieri and nicholls 2012 these results contrast with earlier studies suggesting a negative trade off between biodiversity and provisioning services which are mostly based on intensive monoculture sites kandziora et al 2012 maes et al 2012 nelson et al 2009 where yields enhanced through artificial inputs drive known negative impacts on ecosystems processes giller et al 1997 robertson and vitousek 2009 instead our results suggest a potential over yielding effect in polycultures loreau and mazancourt 2013 and highlight the relevance of considering how distinct agricultural practices shape the ecological impacts of land use intensity e g altieri and nicholls 2012 the present study contributes to advance knowledge on the ecological impacts of land use intensity haberl et al 2014 kastner et al 2021 miko and storch 2015 as well as the effects of major environmental pressures on ecological stability donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 montoya et al 2018 including 1 how distinct metrics of stability are affected by harvest intensity and distribution namely asymptotic stability biomass variability and species persistence donohue et al 2013 feng and bailey 2018 montoya et al 2018 2 how these metrics relate to ecosystem processes and to each other donohue et al 2013 kéfi et al 2019 and 3 how those impacts depend on the distribution and magnitude of perturbations i e a press perturbation such as harvest donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 in particular this study suggests that agricultural sites with high biodiversity planned for specific structural and functional traits e g through polycultures and allelopathic combinations could support multiple environmental benefits by enhancing both ecosystems productivity altieri 1999 and regulation services burkhard et al 2009 kandziora et al 2012 including soil fertility and pest control altieri 1999 giller et al 1997 still conclusions drawn from these results are limited by the model simplifying assumptions first the ecosystem s complexity is simplified to an ecological network with a known number of species and constant interactions strength whose dynamics do not depend on broader ecological settings nor changing environmental conditions second using generalized lotka volterra equations assumes a homogeneous environment with no species adaptation where 1 producers grow exponentially if undisturbed and 2 consumers have a limitless appetite share the same conversion efficiency and don t seek food elsewhere such assumptions have been widely applied as reasonable approximations in theoretical ecology roughgarden 1998 case 2000 yet we shall not forget that actual ecosystems follow complex adaptive dynamics scheffer 2009 dependent on multiple changing environmental variables e g seasonal conditions which add spatial temporal complexity and elicits questioning ecosystem s stability as the desirable state finally while modeling agroecological systems we assume there s no external control of species abundance e g with herbicides and the ecosystems are in equilibrium prior to harvest despite a reasonable simplification to highlight hanpp impacts these conditions are unlikely considering the extent of human intervention in most agricultural systems further work is needed to meet both sustainable food production and biodiversity conservation goals while the ecological modeling of agroecological practices e g biomimetic polycultures could offer insights for the optimization of communities topologies harvest rates and the integration of complex socioeconomic dynamics furthermore improved data availability for diverse agroecological systems would allow real yields and ecological impacts comparisons while providing empirical insights on best practices to implement and manage those 5 conclusions increasing land use intensity negatively impacts three metrics of ecological stability including the community s asymptotic stability total biomass variability and structural robustness i e species persistence moreover besides land use intensity we show that the harvest distribution and the community s species richness determine the extent of hanpp impacts as such this study supports that more biodiverse ecosystems and homogeneous harvest distributions among species e g through biomimetic polycultures may reduce hanpp impacts on ecological stability biomass variability and species persistence while increasing total yields and reducing their uncertainty embracing the relevance of ecological change ladle and gillson 2009 may support a debate on what type of ecological stability is desirable to enhance food production

major threats to biodiversity flynn et al 2009 pereira et al 2012 yet the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem s productivity is highly context dependent and the global impacts of land use

environmental factors kehoe et al 2016 and as the importance of land use change declines land use intensity becomes the most important driver of human appropriation of npp hanpp kastner et al 2021 yet

hypothesis hanpp is predicted to decrease species richness begon et al 2009 bonn et al 2004 costanza et al 2007 hurlbert and jetz 2010 jetz and fine 2012 as ecosystem productivity correlates with a wider range of resources available resulting in an increasing number of species along the global energy gradient bonn et al 2004 hurlbert and jetz 2010 luck 2007 this relates to the notion of an environmental carrying capacity describing the balance between consumed and available resources e g świąder et al 2020 however as productivity is affected by multiple interdependent factors such as

2014 miko and storch 2015 still the few studies that explored the relation of species richness with remaining npp i e available npp after harvest found a monotonous relationship with species richness haberl et al 2014 simultaneously our understanding of how major environmental pressures such as hanpp impact the stability of ecological processes remains remarkably limited donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 since may s work 1972 the relationship between ecological complexity and stability is highly debated allesina et al 2015 ives and carpenter 2007 johnson et al 1996 montoya et al 2006 plitzko et al 2012 pimm 1984 and the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem s stability remain unclear feng and bailey 2018 montoya et al 2018 meanwhile environmental sciences shifted focus from maintaining stability per se to embrace the importance of ecological change ladle and gilson 2009 and avoid catastrophic regime shifts montoya et al 2018 however most research still focus on single components of stability complexity and disturbances rather than considering their multidimensional and interdependent nature donohue et al 2013 2016 feng and bailey 2018 kéfi et al 2019 moreover despite the importance of sustaining ecological functions and derived ecosystem services e g díaz et al 2018 few studies address the impacts on stability of major drivers of global change e g spatial land pressures explore the effects of press disturbances and their magnitude or focus on the asymptotic stability resilience and resistance of ecological processes donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 the study of ecological networks aims to understand how the complexity observed in nature persists and how it affects ecosystems functioning bascompte 2009 montoya et al 2006 pilosof et al 2017 proulx

presenting small world properties bascompte 2009 ings et al 2009 montoya et al 2006 proulx et al 2005 and the distribution of links even more than the interactions magnitude being considered one of the most important aspects linked to stability allesina et al 2015 ings et al 2009 scheffer et al 2012 yet understanding ecological stability requires acknowledging its multidimensionality whose components include resilience resistance robustness variability and persistence donohue et al 2013 montoya et al 2018 pimm 1984 therefore with most studies focusing on single aspects of stability addressed in isolation and in the absence of any perturbation donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 research risks underestimating significantly the ecological impacts of disturbances the present work aims to explore the impacts on ecosystem s stability productivity and diversity of increasing land use intensity represented by the hanpp s harvest component erb et al 2009 haberl et al 2007 we use an ecological network model with two trophic levels modified from allesina et al 2008 to assess impacts upon three distinct metrics of ecological stability 1 local stability analysis as an indicator of the ecosystem s overall integrity 2 total biomass variability as temporal changes in the community s overall densities and 3 species persistence or structural robustness as the proportion of species driven to extinction and remaining biodiversity the human driven ecosystem disturbance is defined by hanpp along a gradient of harvest intensity based on the number of species harvested and the proportion of biomass removed we compare results for ecological networks with low and high species richness relating impacts with the ecosystem s capacity to sustain provisioning services measured as the total yield obtained along a hanpp gradient finally we test the hypothesis that a biomimetic principle in food production systems defined by high species richness and evenly distributed harvest intensities could reduce trade offs between biodiversity and agricultural yields in farmlands assuming that ecological communities tend to form nested structures with relatively large subsets of species linked through diverse weak links generalist species ings et al 2009 may 1972 montoya et al 2006 the model is inspired in and broadly valid for agroecological systems including croplands pastures and agroforestry systems or any other system where harvest is restricted to primary producers results may apply to monocultures e g croplands whenever only one producer species is harvested and to polycultures e g croplands and agroforestry when more than one or all producer species are harvested despite the presence of other producers e g weeds grazing may be considered as harvesting of producers by livestock with the harvest intensity being proportional to the stocking rate and harvested species the preferred livestock diet to focus on hanpp impacts the model does not consider the use of herbicides nor pesticides which are common in intensive agricultural systems and would artificially lower non harvested species abundances in any case general species abundances and constant harvest rates are but first approximations to real agroecological systems which depending on their management may not always be in a stable equilibrium prior to harvest an assumption made to primarily explore hanpp impacts on ecosystem s stability 2 materials and methods the ecological network modelled is a global asymmetric multipartite structure composed by asymmetric interactions defined by a direction and strength each node represents a group of individuals of a specific species which belong to one of two trophic levels primary producers and consumers two types of interactions are considered i competition between producers species and ii trophic between consumers and producers species interactions are distributed according to the limiting similarity principle in the case of competition hughes and roughgarden 2000 and the minimum potential niche model for trophic links allesina et al 2008 thus the network is characterized by i the number of species s ii the network s connectance c and iii the probability of forbidden links f the first two parameters are associated with the system s complexity and have been widely related with the network s stability bascompte 2009 may 1972 montoya et al 2006 the connectance is a measure of the relative number of connections defined here by the general form c l s2 where l is the actual number of connections and s2 is the total number of possible connections pascual and dunne 2005 the probability of forbidden links accounts for potential gaps in the observed range of species diet which arise from considering multidimensional niche axis through the overlap of several species traits allesina et al 2008 hanpp is modelled as an external perturbation constant over time defined by the proportion of biomass harvested per species on the interval 0 1 r and by the set of species harvested on the interval 1 n n where n is the number of producer s species we generate communities with total species richness between 3 and 13 species and for each richness we estimate the frequency of locally stable communities across 1000 sample networks this sample defines the probability of local equilibria stability mougi and kondoh 2012 we select the subset of positive locally stable communities and introduce harvest as a constant press perturbation our results are restricted to this subset on which we test varying harvest intensities and subsequently reassess the system s dynamics the model run over 10 times to test the consistency of results the dynamics follow the generalized lotka volterra equations case 2000 and are analysed through the generation of a time series with t 2000 iterations for each hanpp scenario the hanpp scenarios cover a gradient of harvest intensity based on the proportion of biomass and the set of species harvested the initial condition is defined at the local stable equilibrium of the unperturbed community and harvest is introduced after a time t 10 therefore we assume the species densities were initially in equilibrium and that a constant rate of resource s exploitation was performed since then moving the system out of the original equilibrium the ecosystem s dynamics are then assessed through i local stability analysis ii total biomass variability iii proportion of species extinctions and iv mean total yield obtained over time 2 1 ecological network the network dynamics are modelled according to the generalized lotka volterra equations case 2000 where producers grow logistically and consumers have a type i functional response given the species density vector y with size s the intrinsic growth rates vector k and the adjacency matrix m with dimensions sxs the system is represented in the general form by 2 1 d y dt k m y y eq 2 1 have a unique solution if and only if all columns lines of matrix m are linearly independent to guarantee this condition the number of primary producers n and the number of consumer species m must satisfy n m case 2000 so here consumers are defined as ¾ the number of producers and rounded to the nearest lower integer pascual and dunne 2005 then for example for s 3 there are two producers and one consumer harvest is introduced in eq 2 1 through a vector h with size n and components h i 0 1 different from zero only if species i is harvested the elements hi represent the proportion of biomass removed from each species and in each scenario are identical for all species harvested h hi then if the vectors p and c represent respectively the densities of primary producers and consumers species with the respective size equal to n and m eq 2 1 can be written as the system of equations roughgarden 1998 2 2 d p dt d c dt r d r α k a b a t 0 p c h 0 p c where the vector r is the intrinsic growth rate of primary producers d the death rate of consumers and k the vector of carrying capacities of each producer s species the matrix α with elements α i j and dimension nxn describe competitive interactions between producers species i and j the matrix a with elements aij and dimension mxn represents the encounter rate between consumer j and producer i whereas b is a matrix mxn which describes the effect of each preyed species on a specific consumer growth also known as the consumer s conversion efficiency in this context hanpp is defined by the average proportion of biomass removed from each producer s species hanpp i 1 n h h p i i 1 n p i such that each hanpp scenario is characterized by the parameters h proportion of biomass harvested and nh number of species harvested 2 1 1 predation the trophic network is based on the minimum potential niche model allesina et al 2008 modified by constraining the diet center to impose a specific trophic structure nxm a niche position ηi is assign to each species from a continuous uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 species are sorted in the one dimensional niche axis according to their ηi value such that for any species with i j ηi ηj the first n species are ascribed as primary producers and the remaining as consumers an independent diet interval i j is assigned to each consumer species j determining a vector of potential preys composed by all species for which η i i j the first and last elements of this vector are selected as the diet of consumer j with other species in the diet interval being ascribed through a binomial distribution with probability 1 f the procedure is repeated for any consumer with an empty diet or any two identical diets the diet interval is given by i j c j rd j 2 c j rd j 2 where rd j is the diet range and c j the diet center the diet range is defined by r d j x η j where x is a random variable with a beta distribution such that x b 1 β thus β is species independent and given by 2 3 β 1 2 c t 1 where ct is the target connectance of the trophic network this will be higher than the actual connectance due to possible gaps on the diet range but we will ignore the difference as it favours the community s stability may 1972 the center of the diet interval is taken from a continuous uniform distribution of the niche axis sub region such that 2 4 c j u r d j 2 η j r d j 2 i f η j r d j 0 the condition is necessarily true as the maximum value of rd j is η j in which case c j will be equal to η j 2 moreover to maintain the proportion in trophic levels the diet of species j must be constrained to species i for which η i η j so eq 2 2 remains valid 2 1 2 competition we assume a limiting similarity principle hughes and roughgarden 2000 to model the competition network where producer species compete with their most similar species overlapping in resource use by α with its two nearest neighbours species on the niche axis to build the competition network the community is assumed to be circular the first and last species in the niche axis compete with each other hughes and roughgarden 2000 thus the resulting adjacency matrix is given by 2 5 α 1 α 12 0 α 1 n α 21 1 α 23 0 0 α 32 1 α n 1 n α n 1 0 0 1 2 1 3 parameters and average interaction strength the average interaction strength δ is chosen so it meets the condition δ s c 1 2 this ensures the adjacency matrix m has a high probability of being stable may 1972 however the relative width of the transition region from stability to instability scales with s 2 3 for s 1 may 1972 so in order to guarantee that the average interaction strength remains in the stability region we define δ s c 1 2 s 2 3 the default values for all model parameters are listed in appendix a from eq 2 2 assuming all interactions have the same average value α a b the mean square interaction strength of the non null elements of m is assumed to be δ α 2 in practice as r k 1 s and b i j 1 i j these parameters imply a change which carry δ further into the stability region not compromising the previous assumption see appendix b then the elements of the adjacency matrix m corresponding to matrixes α a and b are estimated by a random variable x from a normal distribution with mean μ 0 and standard deviation σ e x μ 2 δ α α the type of interaction is defined using the absolute value of x 2 2 ecosystem analysis to evaluate the system s local stability we consider the lyapunov definition of asymptotic stability where stability is defined in a local neighbourhood of the equilibrium from eq 2 1 the existence of a positive interior equilibrium solution y is given by 2 6 d y d t 0 y m 1 h k the density of producers and consumers species in the interior equilibrium assuming the same average interaction strength for all interactions α a b is given by the solution s vectors p and c 2 7 d p dt 0 d c dt 0 p α 2 d c α 1 r 1 α 1 r k α 1 h we look for equilibria solutions where all species co exist so we exclude all trivial solutions where species have a null density then to assess the local stability of the equilibria we calculate the jacobian matrix j at the fixed point 2 7 and obtain the i 1 s eigenvalues λ i 1 2 of the matrix j 2 8 λ i 1 2 α 1 r d 2 k α 2 r d 2 k 2 d r h α 1 r d 2 k the equilibrium is locally stable if all eigenvalues have a negative real part ℜ λ i 1 2 0 thus if the term δ inside the square root of eq 2 8 is negative the eigenvalues are complex conjugated with real part r λ i 1 r λ i 2 α 1 r d 2 k and the equilibrium is stable whenever all parameters are positive the condition for δ 0 is mathematically equivalent to the condition for having positive species densities at equilibria see appendix c therefore equilibria with δ 0 have no ecological meaning we assess the biomass variability by obtaining the standard deviation of the community s total biomass over time where the total biomass is the sum of all individual species densities the total yield obtained is given by the sum of the biomass harvested from each producer species after running the simulation for t 2000 iterations species with densities below 0 01 are considered to be extinct as we assume that densities below this critical value are not viable for the species survival in the long term roughgarden 1998 3 results as expected when increasing the species richness the frequency of locally stable equilibria decreases and the frequency of unstable equilibria increases fig 1 may 1972 however for non random ecological networks we also found that the frequency of positive equilibria decreases with the species richness and that as a consequence of eq 2 2 positive equilibria are locally stable the frequency of locally stable equilibria decreases with hanpp fig 2 nonetheless when all producer s species are harvested communities keep their stability for a wider range of harvest intensities this result is independent of their species richness additionally communities with lower richness also tend to remain stable for higher hanpp values independently of how many species are harvested as expected whenever any species is completely harvested ecological communities lose their local stability we found that biomass variability as the median standard deviation of total biomass across all communities increases with hanpp fig 3 communities with high species richness as well as those for which all producer species are harvested present the highest biomass variability yet when only one species is harvested the biomass variability exhibits wider heterogeneity across communities under the same conditions regardless their richness wider inter percentile range in fig 3 increasing hanpp triggers a decrease in species persistence through an increased proportion of species extinctions on a raising proportion of communities fig 4 which reflects a decrease in the communities structural robustness as expected for high hanpp values when all producer s species are harvested all communities suffer extinctions yet communities with lower species richness present the highest rate of extinctions and also the highest rate of species lost at the lowest harvest intensities similarly when only one species is harvested both the proportion of species extinctions and communities facing extinctions is highest even at low harvest intensities however in this case at the highest harvest intensity just half of those communities lose species independently of their richness the total yield obtained presents a maximum for intermediate hanpp values fig 5 the total yield obtained is higher when all producers species are harvested communities with high species richness also provide the highest yield both when one or all producers species are harvested regardless the community s richness the total yield s variability across communities is also higher when only one species is harvested 4 discussion this study advances evidence that increasing land use intensity decreases the ecosystem s stability in terms of asymptotic stability biomass variability and species persistence or the community s structural robustness the results support that ecological complexity as measured by the number and strength of interactions within an ecosystem determine its probability to have a stable configuration may 1971 1972 under our model assumptions we found that the frequency of stable communities is determined by the existence of positive equilibria with these being necessarily stable but not the opposite in addition supporting the importance of the interactions distribution for ecological stability bascompte 2009 mougi and kondoh 2012 pascual and dunne 2005 we showed that the distribution and magnitude of disturbances determines the extent of impacts on the community s stability across the three metrics examined the removal of biomass in particular the harvest intensity is known to impose changes in the number and stability of equilibria hirsch et al 2004 roughgarden 1998 our results are consistent with these previous studies specifically showing that the frequency of locally stable equilibria decreases with hanpp moreover we show that the distribution of harvest among producer species determines its impacts on the community s asymptotic stability a homogeneous harvest distribution among producer species preserves the interactions relative strength and symmetry of the unperturbed system minimizing the stability s impacts of hanpp regardless of the community s richness still more complex communities may suffer higher impacts this advances previous studies on the stability s effects of perturbations donohue et al 2016 loreau and mazancourt 2013 kéfi et al 2019 while in accordance with previous studies the patterns found highlight the relevance of the network s topology as the distribution and connectance of interactions types for determining its ecological dynamics bascompte 2009 2010 may 1972 pascual and dunne 2005 this study shows that increasing land use intensity triggers a steady augment in total biomass variability supporting previous studies on the importance of considering biomass variability for understanding the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function hughes and roughgarden 2000 ives et al 1999 the introduction of harvest takes the system out of its previous equilibrium inducing fluctuations in species densities which may or may not lead the system to a new equilibrium case 2000 hirsch et al 2004 these induced biomass fluctuations are often periodic resulting from limit cycles in predator prey dynamics case 2000 roughgarden 1998 although may also occur as occasional sudden fluctuations usually preceding a regime shift and the extinction of species scheffer et al 2012 in accordance our results suggest a positive relationship between stability metrics namely asymptotic stability and biomass variability donohue et al 2013 more biodiverse ecosystems present higher biomass variability regardless the number of species harvested suggesting a negative relation between complexity and stability hughes and roughgarden 2000 montoya et al 2006 yet the way impacts propagate through the network depends on its specific structure and again along with the disturbance s magnitude our results reveal the relevance of the perturbation s distribution in triggering different ecological responses with communities presenting wider heterogenous responses when only one species is harvested the dynamics present a regime shift when harvest is introduced and as the frequency of interior equilibria decreases with hanpp we observe a decrease in species persistence and communities structural robustness increasing both the rate of species extinctions and communities suffering extinctions these results are consistent with previous theoretical and empirical studies on the species energy relationship begon et al 2009 bonn et al 2004 hurlbert and jetz 2010 and particularly those where hanpp has been identified as a driver of biodiversity loss haberl et al 2004 2005 2014 kehoe et al 2016 in our study less biodiverse ecosystems and those where only one species is harvested exhibit lower species persistence and structural robustness even at low harvest intensities in addition increasing harvest above half of the available npp may drive a significant decrease in species persistence also on communities with an even harvest distribution as the reduction in resources availability may force a decrease in consumer s density but also occasionally reduce the competition for the same resources case 2000 roughgarden 1998 the distribution of interactions and disturbances determine the emergence of positive or negative feedback loops bascompte 2009 case 2000 montoya et al 2006 roughgarden 1998 which may eventually trigger a cascade effect on species extinctions finally our results support a total yield higher in both more biodiverse communities and when all producer s species are harvested therefore compared to monocultures biodiverse agricultural systems e g polycultures may enhance the total yield obtained while reducing land use impacts on the communities asymptotic stability and structural robustness our results also suggest such systems could reduce food insecurity arising from uncertainty in yields higher when one species is harvested in communities with lower biodiversity as such this study presents evidence of a positive relation between polycultures and provisioning ecosystem services in agreement with the species energy hypothesis begon et al 2009 hurlbert and jetz 2010 jetz and fine 2012 and empirical evidence of a positive biodiversity s role in agricultural systems altieri 1999 altieri and nicholls 2012 these results contrast with earlier studies suggesting a negative trade off between biodiversity and provisioning services which are mostly based on intensive monoculture sites kandziora et al 2012 maes et al 2012 nelson et al 2009 where yields enhanced through artificial inputs drive known negative impacts on ecosystems processes giller et al 1997 robertson and vitousek 2009 instead our results suggest a potential over yielding effect in polycultures loreau and mazancourt 2013 and highlight the relevance of considering how distinct agricultural practices shape the ecological impacts of land use intensity e g altieri and nicholls 2012 the present study contributes to advance knowledge on the ecological impacts of land use intensity haberl et al 2014 kastner et al 2021 miko and storch 2015 as well as the effects of major environmental pressures on ecological stability donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 montoya et al 2018 including 1 how distinct metrics of stability are affected by harvest intensity and distribution namely asymptotic stability biomass variability and species persistence donohue et al 2013 feng and bailey 2018 montoya et al 2018 2 how these metrics relate to ecosystem processes and to each other donohue et al 2013 kéfi et al 2019 and 3 how those impacts depend on the distribution and magnitude of perturbations i e a press perturbation such as harvest donohue et al 2016 kéfi et al 2019 in particular this study suggests that agricultural sites with high biodiversity planned for specific structural and functional traits e g through polycultures and allelopathic combinations could support multiple environmental benefits by enhancing both ecosystems productivity altieri 1999 and regulation services burkhard et al 2009 kandziora et al 2012 including soil fertility and pest control altieri 1999 giller et al 1997 still conclusions drawn from these results are limited by the model simplifying assumptions first the ecosystem s complexity is simplified to an ecological network with a known number of species and constant interactions strength whose dynamics do not depend on broader ecological settings nor changing environmental conditions second using generalized lotka volterra equations assumes a homogeneous environment with no species adaptation where 1 producers grow exponentially if undisturbed and 2 consumers have a limitless appetite share the same conversion efficiency and don t seek food elsewhere such assumptions have been widely applied as reasonable approximations in theoretical ecology roughgarden 1998 case 2000 yet we shall not forget that actual ecosystems follow complex adaptive dynamics scheffer 2009 dependent on multiple changing environmental variables e g seasonal conditions which add spatial temporal complexity and elicits questioning ecosystem s stability as the desirable state finally while modeling agroecological systems we assume there s no external control of species abundance e g with herbicides and the ecosystems are in equilibrium prior to harvest despite a reasonable simplification to highlight hanpp impacts these conditions are unlikely considering the extent of human intervention in most agricultural systems further work is needed to meet both sustainable food production and biodiversity conservation goals while the ecological modeling of agroecological practices e g biomimetic polycultures could offer insights for the optimization of communities topologies harvest rates and the integration of complex socioeconomic dynamics furthermore improved data availability for diverse agroecological systems would allow real yields and ecological impacts comparisons while providing empirical insights on best practices to implement and manage those 5 conclusions increasing land use intensity negatively impacts three metrics of ecological stability including the community s asymptotic stability total biomass variability and structural robustness i e species persistence moreover besides land use intensity we show that the harvest distribution and the community s species richness determine the extent of hanpp impacts as such this study supports that more biodiverse ecosystems and homogeneous harvest distributions among species e g through biomimetic polycultures may reduce hanpp impacts on ecological stability biomass variability and species persistence while increasing total yields and reducing their uncertainty embracing the relevance of ecological change ladle and gillson 2009 may support a debate on what type of ecological stability is desirable to enhance food production

24373,conventional approaches to assessing the ecological impact of chemicals face uncertainty when extrapolating from single species toxicity data to community level effects on real ecosystems ecological models may be a useful tool to reduce that uncertainty because they enable a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of chemicals on species assemblages at the ecosystem level here a case study was developed in aquatox 3 1 to simulate the effects of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on baiyangdian byd lake in northern china the model consisted of 12 groups of species two phytoplankton one macrophyte three zooplankton four benthic macroinvertebrates one omnivorous fish and one piscivorous fish a simulation of a perturbed or baseline scenario over 1 year showed satisfactory calibration on annual average biomasses compared with a control scenario the overall average biomass relative variation v decreases by 4 02 the relative variation of eco exergy v e x decreases by 5 64 and the ratio of gross primary productivity to community respiration p r increases by 5 58 these results indicate that one third of the species are remarkably affected of which the biomass differences are larger than 20 however indirect effects due to ecological interactions simulated by the byd model can either amplify or mitigate the effect of direct toxicity leading to significant changes for some organisms responses to chemicals in real ecosystems the case study demonstrates that the byd model has the potential to be an effective and useful tool to evaluate the toxicity effects of organic pollutants at an ecosystem level some suggestions are put forward to improve the model s accuracy including 1 more monitoring and testing data for biological and toxicological parameters 2 a step by step strategy for model calibration and 3 sensitivity analysis before calibrating the parameters keywords ecological model toxicity effects polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs ecosystem level baiyangdian lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are persistent organic pollutants that have long existed in aquatic sediments sandro et al 2018 owing to their low solubility and hydrophobic nature pahs tend to be associated with fine particles they are introduced into lakes by runoff and atmospheric fallout and lakes often act as a trap for pahs zhang et al 2018 pahs remain the most widely distributed toxic pollutant causing a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms including endocrine alteration growth reduction dna damage and malformations of embryos and larvae behera et al 2018 moreover the transfer of pahs from sediments into benthic organisms is a risk to higher trophic levels due to the consumption of contaminated benthic organisms khairy et al 2014 eventually the adverse impact of pahs extends to the whole ecosystem through the transmission bioaccumulation and biomagnification effects of the food chain therefore it is crucial to understand and evaluate the ecological impacts of pahs on lake ecosystems in order to guide management and inform policy towards the mitigation of their threat ecological impact assessments describe and forecast ecological impacts from human activities mainly focusing on the change in the structure and function of ecosystem processes and analyzing impacts at the ecosystem level in the long term liu et al 2015 however conventional approaches to ecological impact assessments of pahs are based on ecotoxicological studies for a few test species corresponding to three classes of organisms algae invertebrates and fish yan et al 2015 ikenaka et al 2013 with little significance in relation to the structures and functions of the ecosystems an assessment factor af method is applied to the lowest toxicity value lc50 or ec50 of a species in an ecosystem to derive predicted no effect concentrations pnecs that are considered safe for ecosystems lombardo et al 2015 pnecs can also be derived using a statistical approach based on the species sensitivity distribution ssd method gredelj et al 2018 which is also based on the toxicities of multiple species however population dynamics in polluted environments are not only driven by the direct toxicity effects of chemicals on single species but also by ecological interactions caused by competition and predation between species and by the influence of abiotic factors de laender et al 2007 therefore community and ecosystem level assessments can provide better indications of how species respond to chemicals than individual level ones there is a strong need for alternative approaches to extrapolating single species effects to ecosystem level responses to address different aspects of ecological realism lombardo et al 2015 ecological models can be applied to simulate both abiotic and biotic processes as well as direct toxicities and indirect toxicant effects propagated through food webs park and choi 2008 among these ecological models aquatox 3 1 is an integrated fate and effects model that combines water quality food web chemical fate and ecotoxicological processes a few case studies based on aquatox 3 1 have demonstrated its value as a useful tool to assess the impact of chemicals on the structure and function of an aquatic ecosystem zhang et al 2013 however the ecological impact of pahs on the structure and function of baiyangdian byd lake in northern china has not been evaluated until now byd is a typical plant dominated shallow freshwater lake consisting of about 143 lake parks distributed across 36 villages with 67 km2 of reed marshes zeng et al 2021 as a sink for nine upstream rivers with much human activity in the surrounding villages byd lake has a moderate level of pahs pollution in surface sediment compared with other chinese lakes guo et al 2011 hu et al 2009 pahs were also detected in the water in pelagic and benthic organisms and in fish zheng et al 2016 pahs exist widely and persistently in environmental media such as lake water suspended solids and sediment and they are bioaccumulated and transmitted in aquatic organisms leading to cumulative amplified and long term ecological risks assessing the ecological impact of pahs on byd lake is urgently needed before taking the next step therefore the aims of this study are to 1 develop a byd lake ecological model of pahs pollution based on aquatox 3 1 2 parameterize calibrate and analyze the sensitivity of the parameters of the byd lake model and 3 evaluate the ecological impact of pahs on the byd lake ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area byd lake e 115 75 116 12 n 38 73 38 98 has an area of approximately 366 km2 it is located in anxin county near the city of baoding in hebei province fig 1 the water depth varies from 2 m to 6 m and the lake is surrounded by 143 lake parks adjacent to 36 villages zhang et al 2020 as a famous tourist resort in china byd lake receives more than 850 000 tourists every year with many diesel boats serving as transportation guo et al 2011 the lake has been subjected to moderate pahs pollution due to increasing energy consumption from biomass fuel and coal combustion in villages and exhaust gas from boats and vehicle emissions in nearby areas zhou et al 2008 previous studies found that the average total pahs concentration 16 kinds of priority control monomer compounds defined by usepa in the surface sediment ranged from 353 0 to 755 6 ng g dry weight dw between 2007 and 2009 zhou et al 2008 hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2009a qin et al 2018 thirty two sediment water and macrophyte samples were collected and tested for pahs concentrations in april 2021 the average concentrations are given in table s1 because polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a mixture the toxic equivalency factor tef approach proposed by nisbet and lagoy 1992 was applied to estimate the overall impact of pahs the concentration of individual pahs was expressed as bap equivalents by toxicity comparisons and these bap equivalent values were added together to yield the toxicity equivalent concentration of total pahs table s1 the formula for this calculation is given in eq s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 the aquatox model in this study aquatox 3 1 was utilized to predict the ecological impact of pahs on byd lake aquatox 3 1 is a mechanistic model suitable to assess the effects of several stressors environmental variables nutrients and chemical pollutants at the ecosystem level as it accounts for the cause effect mechanisms between biological response and chemical toxicity through the trophic level relationships from primary producers to fish martins et al 2019 a powerful feature of aquatox 3 1 is that it can run paired simulations the model runs twice with and without chemical interference with other settings unchanged for perturbed and control conditions and specify the differences between these two types of runs to derive the ecological effects of a chemical clough 2018 the fundamental equations used in aquatox 3 1 include simulating the changes of biomass of each species and predicting the fate of a chemical partitioned into water sediment particulate and biota detailed descriptions of the equations used in the model can be found in the technical reference guide for the model park and clough 2018 2 2 1 data sources aquatox 3 1 requires selecting the type of aquatic system being modeled pond lake stream or estuary defining the set of site specific parameters providing the variation of the forcing functions e g temperature dissolved oxygen nutrients and organic pollutants selecting the food web constituents and parameterizing trophic relationships inputting the biodynamic parameters of each species inputting chemical properties and toxicity parameters and finally predicting the biomass over time of each trophic level and the partitioning of a chemical between the water sediment and biota therefore ample data are needed to allow the user to specify key process rates and characteristics lombardo et al al 2015 the types specifications and sources of the data used by the byd lake model are shown in table s2 of the supplementary material thirty two sediment water and macrophyte samples were collected and tested for pahs concentrations in april 2021 fourteen biomass samples including 12 species in each sample were seasonally monitored from april to november 2018 the locations of these samples are shown in fig 1 the monitoring results show that the average total pahs concentration in sediment water macrophyte was 411 12 ng g dw 78 ng l and 230 45 ng g wet respectively as shown in table s1 only three sampling dates april june and november were used as observed values to calibrate the model due to budget and time constraints although the lack of sufficient observations might bring uncertainty to the interpretation of seasonal trends it will not prevent us from using the ecosystem approach to model the impact of a toxicant in terms of the application of the method and the formation of the program flow with more monitoring data the ecological model will be more accurate than conventional methods based on single species toxicity the improvement will lead to the establishment of adequate protection levels for species and the implementation of effective ecosystem management more importantly it provides a new tool for understanding the complex effects of toxicants on the structure and functions of specific ecosystems 2 2 2 parameterization 2 2 2 1 physicochemical parameters of the byd lake model basic morphological hydrologic and meteorological parameters of the byd lake model were collected from time series routine monitoring data provided by the local government and previous literature input data were constant or variable over time depending on data availability and model requirements main morphological meteorological and physical data used by byd lake model are compiled and summarized in table s3 chemical data of the inflow loadings are summarized in table s4 2 2 2 2 biological parameters of the byd lake model in aquatox 3 1 biological parameters are employed to construct a food web model which includes the selection of representative species imputing initial biomass and kinetic parameters and building a diet matrix in the diet matrix predators and prey are defined according to the food relationship the user indicates the potential prey preferences of each predator in terms of the mass percentage and defines the egestion coefficients of each predator the species of byd lake were chosen based on zeng et al 2021 who reclassified the species into 12 species two microalgae one macrophyte three zooplankton four benthic animals and two fish the prey preferences of each modeled species were revised from zeng et al 2021 and the egestion coefficients came from values of similar species described by lombardo et al 2015 as shown in table 1 for each modeled species the initial values of biomass were taken from biomonitoring data in april 2018 the starting values of the kinetic parameters came from previous literature or the default values of the most similar species in the aquatox 3 1 library the best parameters of each species after calibration are presented in tables 2 and 3 2 2 2 3 parameters of pahs for the byd lake model the input parameters of pahs include physicochemical properties toxicokinetic parameters toxicological parameters initial concentrations and loadings the loads of pahs in the inflow were very low so they were ignored previous research results showed that pahs pollution mainly came from the atmospheric deposition of local human activities such as fuel combustion traffic exhaust emission and biomass combustion zhou et al 2008 hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2009a as a result only the loads of atmospheric deposition were considered pahs rarely consist of a single compound instead they are usually a mixture of compounds however simulations in aquatox 3 1 are typically based on single compound a method of converting a mixture into a single compound is thus required toxic equivalency factors tefs of each pah which are derived from a pairwise comparison with the toxicity of bap were employed to convert other compounds into bap by this means the concentration of pahs was replaced by a cumulative concentration of bap table s1 the main physicochemical properties and single species toxicity data of bap were summarized from previous literature and the ecotox database as listed in tables 4 and 5 lethal and sublethal toxicity were computed on the basis of the internal concentration derived from the bioconcentration factor bcf the latter was calculated by the octanol water partition coefficient kow the fraction of biomass killed by a given internal concentration of a toxicant was estimated using a weibull distribution with a default shape factor value of 0 33 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out to examine the relative contribution of parameters to the biomass or internal concentration of the bap equivalent for each species sensitive parameters were then used to refine the estimation of parameters and improve the efficiency of the model calibration the sensitivity index was calculated by the following expression 1 s e n s i t i v i t y r e s u l t p o s r e s u l t b a s e l i n e r e s u l t n e g r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 2 r e s u l t b a s e l

pctchanged is the percentage by which an input parameter changed e g a value of 20 means that the percentage of a parameter varies by 10 a larger value of the sensitivity index means a greater contribution of the parameter 2 2 4 calibration strategy since historical monitoring data from march 1 2018 to march 1 2019 showed the results under the influence of pahs pollution the perturbed ecosystem was calibrated over a period of 1 year the calibration was done manually as follows first eutrophic variables including dissolved oxygen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and phosphate were calibrated by modifying the default remineralization parameters and reaeration rate then phytoplankton zooplankton benthic organisms and fish were calibrated successively by modifying the default sensitive parameters suggested by the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis such as the optimal temperature temperature response slope maximum photosynthetic rate saturating light morality rate maximum consumption minimum prey for feeding etc the goal of calibration was to quantitatively match averaged simulated biomass with averaged observed values in april june and november 2018 this can be mathematically expressed by the average relative variation between averaged observed value for the ith species in the jth month b o i j g dry m2 and averaged simulated value for the ith species in the jth month b s i j g dry m2 2 ε i j 1 3 b o i j b s i j b o i j 3 100 3 ε i 1 12 ε i 12 100 where ε is the overall average biomass relative variation ε i is the average biomass relative variation for the ith species the subscript i denotes the number of species from 1 to 12 and j takes a value of 1 2 or 3 representing april june or november respectively 2 3 ecosystem impact indicators one of the key challenges of this study is to find a suitable methodology to assess the ecological impact of pahs on byd lake at a system level the proposed methodology compared the results between the control and the perturbed scenarios in terms of the defined systematic indicators these indicators include three categories such as the compartment or overall average biomass relative variation grechi et al 2016 in which the relative variation reflects the different degree of average biomass between the perturbed and control scenarios suter and mabrey 1994 used a 20 reduction in population biomass as the endpoint by which to establish toxicological benchmarks of potential contaminants for aquatic biota this is because 20 is the minimum detectable difference in population characteristics in the field the biomass difference of the ith compartment v i is calculated using eq 4 and the overall biomass difference for all compartments v is calculated with eq 5 4 v i b p i b c i b c i 100 5 v 1 n i 1 n b p i b c i b c i 100 where b p i is the average biomass for a given compartment i during the perturbed simulation g m 2 d r y and b c i is the average biomass for a given compartment i during the control simulation g m 2 d r y another category pertains to ecosystem metrics which are measurable indicators of the structure and function of ecological systems such as the gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp community respiration r ratio of gpp to community respiration p r and turnover time p b ratio of gpp to biomass in days park and clough 2018 here p r is selected to evaluate the state of an ecosystem and is calculated as follows 6 p r g p p r where gpp is the gross primary production go2 m2d and r is the community respiration go2 m2d a mature ecosystem tends to have a p r value of almost 1 values far higher or lower than 1 are thought to be those of an immature ecosystem or an unhealthy ecosystem eco exergy e x has a solid theoretical basis in thermodynamics and can be used as a holistic indicator of ecosystem development and health jørgensen et al 2005 the value of exergy is equal to the weighted sum of the biomass of all species in an ecosystem higher trophic levels such as zooplankton and fish have larger weights than phytoplankton or macrophytes because they have a higher number of information genes the general equation proposed by jørgensen 1995a 1995b is as follows 7 e x i 1 n β i c i where β i is the weighting factor of the ith compartment that accounts for the information that the organisms carried the determination of β for various organisms is based on the number of coding and non coding genes and more precise values of β are given in table 8 further c i is the average annual biomass of the ith compartment or the average annual concentration of the ith component and n is the total number of compartments the eco exergy difference v e x can be calculated as the relative variation between the eco exergy under the perturbed simulation e x p and the eco exergy under the control simulation e x c 8 v e x e x p e x c e x c 100 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the top three parameters that contributed most to the biomass of the species are listed in table 6 percentages in parentheses in the table show the values of the sensitivity index calculated by eq 1 the annual biomass of phytoplankton is primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re that is k2 the optimal temperature to of carp and the temperature response slope tr of carp the annual biomass of macrophytes is primarily affected by the optimal temperature to of carp the optimal temperature to of macrophytes and the maximum photosynthetic rate pm of macrophytes the results obtain from algae suggest that most of the populations are very sensitive to toxicokinetic parameters and the temperature effects of carp because through the food web the latter are the main direct and indirect predator for algae the annual biomass of rotifer is sensitive to the parameters of blue greens this counterintuitive result suggests that indirect effects played a major role in rotifer production cladocerans are primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re and respiration rate rr and copepods are primarily affected by their eliminate rate re and the parameters of carp these results suggest that indirect effects play a key role in determining the populations of zooplankton the annual biomass of oligochaeta is mainly affected by temperature parameters of carp and its optimal temperature to chironomidae is primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re respiration rate rr and the optimal temperature to of blue greens mussels are primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re and respiration rate rr gastropods are primarily affected by the optimal temperature to of carp macrophytes and their own optimal temperature the results of benthic animals present the joint effects of direct reactions and indirect trophic level interactions triggered by chemicals and all kinds of environmental factors the annual production of carp is primarily affected by their eliminate rate re optimal temperature to and the to of oligochaeta catfish are primarily affected by their respiration rate rr eliminate rate constant re and the optimal temperature to of carp the results of fish suggest that direct effects including toxic effects played a major role in fish biomass the sensitivity analysis results of the byd model suggest that the biomass of the lake s ecosystem is affected by three kinds of factors the pahs loads as a factor are large enough to affect lake organisms indirect trophic level interactions especially those of carp and blue greens largely determined the populations of most species directly sensitive parameters such as the temperature limitation maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration rate also impact the biomass of organisms these results are consistent with those of similar studies niu et al 2016 sourisseau et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 3 2 model calibration the perturbed byd model was calibrated over a period of one year as shown in fig 2 the goodness of the model fit to the observed average monthly biomass in april june and november is shown in table 7 for every species from table 7 the simulated results are acceptable as the overall average biomass relative variation ε was 17 56 and the average relative variation of each species ε i was less than 30 because there are only three observed biomass values for each species in spring summer and autumn correlation coefficients are not used to measure the trend consistency between the observed and simulated values alternatively the monthly biomass relative variations are employed to assess the accuracy of the seasonal simulation if the model aptly simulates seasonal trends the relative variation of species in the three periods april june and november should be all relatively small however the most relative variations of simulated species are large exceeding 15 00 reaching as high as 40 25 except for macrophyte and carp these results suggest that the accuracy of the seasonal simulation is poor this deficiency was noted by grechi et al 2016 who found that the ecosystem model of the lower po river in italy was satisfactorily calibrated for annual average biomass but not for seasonal trends owing to the poor efficiency of the manual calibration process and the limited availability of biomonitoring data aquatox based ecosystem level models represent a useful platform to assess the impact of chemicals on the structure and function of a whole ecosystem impacted by multiple stressors e g chemical mixtures organic matter and nutrients it provides an approach that is theoretically more accurate and comprehensive for assessing the ecological impact of chemicals than conventional methods which are based on hazard quotients for individual level endpoints conventional methods have limited utility for assessing risks at the population ecosystem and landscape levels which are the most relevant indicators for environmental management pastorok et al 2003 in addition other benefits of the ecological modeling approach include the following 1 it allows for extensive scenario testing without the accompanying high costs 2 it can extrapolate the effects of a tested exposure pattern to other untested exposure patterns 3 it can analyze and predict possible indirect effects in communities and 4 it can uncover bioaccumulation and biomagnification within food chains or food webs galic et al 2010 although data are often limited regarding the vital rates and dose response functions needed for ecological modeling ecological modeling is nevertheless a valuable approach to addressing issues related to the assessment of chemical risk including ecosystem management issues the objective of this paper is to offer an example of how to approach ecosystem level predictions of a toxicant s impact as more researchers pay attention to and apply the ecological model the structure and parameters of the model will be optimized and uncertainty or errors with the model will be mitigated by the level of practical management and application as shown in fig 2 the peak values of the modeled producers correspond to the observed growth of diatoms in spring march summer may june and winter october november and to blue greens in autumn july august there is no obvious trend for macrophytes the growth patterns of algae depended on their different needs in terms of optimal temperature and adaptation range in autumn blue greens rapidly increase due to their need for higher optimum water temperatures in spring and autumn diatoms increase rapidly because they have lower optimum water temperatures macrophytes thrive in a wider temperature range and thus have no obvious peak values the simulated biomass of macrophytes is as high as 88 629 g m2 dry accounting for 66 04 table 8 of the simulated total biomass in the whole lake and indicating that the water body had been seriously eutrophicated resulting in the excessive growth of large aquatic plants and submerged plants from table 8 compared to simulated producer biomass the simulated biomass of zooplankton is relatively small accounting for only 0 35 of the simulated total biomass as shown in fig 2 the simulated rotifer biomass peaks in spring january march and autumn august september the simulated cladoceran biomass peaks in spring january march and autumn august the simulated copepod biomass peaks in spring march however as shown in table 8 the simulated biomasses of benthos which are mainly composed of mussel gastropod chironomid and oligochaeta only accounts for 5 13 of the simulated total biomass the biodiversity of benthos decreases due to a lack of key species such as shrimp and crab which live in benthic environments previous studies chen et al 2021 fu et al 2022 found the dominant species of benthos were mainly pollution tolerant species including gastropods and chironomids however the abundance and biomass of shrimp and crab species as clean species have gradually decreased in recent years biomass monitoring data in 2018 did not record any shrimp and crab from fig 2 the simulated biomass of oligochaeta chironomid and mussel all peak in spring march and summer april except for gastropods which peaks in summer april and autumn september moreover the simulated biomass of fish accounts for 28 43 of the simulated total biomass as shown in table 8 the fish species in byd lake as the key factors in mediating other biodiversity have suffered from miniaturization juvenilization and a reduction in bio diversity over the past decade zeng et al 2021 from fig 2 the simulated biomass of both carp and catfish peak in summer april and autumn september 3 3 ecological impact of pahs the average biomass and eco exergy of each compartment between the perturbed and control scenarios are shown in table 8 suter and mabrey 1994 used a 20 reduction in population biomass as the endpoint by which to establish toxicological benchmarks of potential contaminants for aquatic biota this is because 20 is the minimum detectable difference in population characteristics in the field suter 1993 we consider a 20 change in biomass to represent remarkable impact by a toxicant the overall biomass difference v and the eco exergy difference v e x is 4 02 and 5 64 respectively i e less than 20 this indicates pahs have an unremarkable impact on changes in biomass and ecosystem health the p r ratio under the perturbed scenario reaches 2 65 an increase of 5 58 compared with that under the control scenario 2 51 these results further demonstrate that pahs in byd lake have an adverse effect on total biomass and ecosystem health the calculated p r ratio under the perturbed scenario is consistent with previous results from 2009 to 2010 for byd lake zeng et al 2021 although the adverse effects of pahs on the byd lake ecosystem are not so remarkable as a whole the adverse effects on some species are important to consider because one third species are considerably affected resulting in biomass changes higher than 20 the most remarkably affected species are oligochaeta whose biomass under the perturbed scenario reduced by 29 63 compared with that of the control scenario and likewise for mussels 22 65 and chironomidae 21 30 however under the perturbed scenario the plant biomass counter intuitively increases by 25 15 for diatoms and by 18 45 for blue green algae with a decrease of 1 55 for macrophytes species not remarkably affected include rotifers 15 51 gastropods 15 27 catfish 9 63 and carp 6 76 the least affected species are cladocerans 5 03 copepods 3 37 and macrophyte 1 55 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy and adaptability of the byd lake model at its current level of accuracy the combined perturbed and control simulations may be capable of evaluating the impact of organic chemicals on lake ecosystems at a system scale by discerning the differences between the perturbed and control simulations the model can reflect the changes in biomass of each species before and after interference as well as the bio transmission bioaccumulation and biomagnification between species through the food web the model can also reflect direct and indirect effects whereas the latter are difficult to observe in the laboratory or in the field the byd lake model could also be used to design mesocosm or field toxicological tests such as identifying test species and determining the dose range of a toxicant however there are many uncertainties in the model structure and parameters due to multiple environmental variables predator prey interactions complicated feedback and nonlinear processes in ecological systems in response to perturbations because of a lack of field data some processes were not simulated e g intraspecific differences in terms of size and sex organism drift migration biotransformation sediment diagenesis etc neglecting these processes will inevitably lead to structural model errors too many parameters especially regarding the biodynamics of growth and death for every species need to be decided by calibration when there are no observed data the lack of high quality information regarding the food web between organisms will produce errors in predicting indirect effects toxicological kinetic parameters are also rare although they greatly affect the internal concentrations of organisms the biological monitoring indicators and frequency are also insufficient and this affects the accuracy of models model calibration is a time consuming manual fitting exercise given the high number of parameters to be calibrated combined with the lack of an automatic calibration routine in aquatox 3 1 in order to improve the efficiency of parameter calibration sensitivity analysis of the parameters should be carried out in advance before calibrating the model parameters the results of the sensitivity analysis for the byd model show that the elimination rate optimum temperature and maximum photosynthetic rate are the most sensitive parameters these parameters must be carefully checked the biomass and pahs concentration of high trophic levels are affected by hydrodynamics nutrients and food web species such as absorbed and accumulated pahs in low trophic levels which are transmitted to high trophic levels along the food web thus the simulation errors of high trophic level will be enlarged level by level with the increase in the trophic level therefore a step by step calibration method is recommended as a strategy for model calibration to control simulation errors hydrodynamic state variables such as the water level outlet flow and flow velocity are first calibrated compared with the flow velocity the fitting error of the water level and outlet flow was usually small and it is easier to calibrate successfully therefore the calibration of the water level and outlet flow should precede that of the flow velocity second nutrients are calibrated where dissolved oxygen is calibrated first because the model error of dissolved oxygen is easier to control than that of nitrogen and phosphorus and will further affect the calibration of the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus by affecting the process of nitrification denitrification and mineralization phosphate is next calibrated followed by the calibration of nitrogen because the latter is the most difficult to fit during calibration more state variables need to be simulated there are more complex model structures with differential equations and more parameters need to be set and calibrated third aquatic biomass and pahs internal concentrations are calibrated for low trophic levels to high trophic levels that is in the order of phytoplankton zooplankton benthos and fish the accuracy of the model largely depended on the quality of the monitoring data ecological models need ample multi sectoral data especially biological monitoring data the monitoring frequency of an indicator needs to be increased to reflect seasonal trends in addition when many parameters need to be calibrated it is difficult for modelers to understand the cause effect relationship between the variables therefore the number of non sensitive parameters should be reduced as much as possible through literature reviews field tests and specific experiments this will help modelers to focus on a few key parameters and understand the key processes of the ecosystem 4 2 toxicity effects at an ecosystem level the byd lake model provides a tool to better understand the distribution of a chemical in environmental media water suspended solids and sediments as well as changes to the biomass of various organisms driven by exposure to a chemical although there is considerable uncertainty thus the model based approach may be able to evaluate the toxicity effects of a chemical at an ecosystem level by figuring out the structural and functional indicators of an ecosystem such work could be done by ecological network analysis which is commonly used to systematic assess the structure and function of an ecosystem and identify indirect effects zeng et al 2021 an understanding of the ecological effects at a system scale requires knowledge of the direct toxicity caused by a chemical but it is more important to understand the indirect effects of toxicity that is the interaction between ecological components triggered by a chemical input direct toxicity measured by lc50 values and biomass perturbation measured by biomass difference are poorly correlated fig 3 suggesting that other ecological processes besides direct toxicological effects play an important role in ecosystem dynamics for example the most sensitive organism cladocerans in the byd lake ecosystem according to the lc50 value do not show high average perturbation rather the highest average perturbations are exhibited by oligochaeta and chironomidae organisms with almost identical toxicity show different effects for example blue greens and carp have almost the same sensitivity to pahs but they have opposite biomass variations moreover blue greens and diatoms show positive biomass variation following pahs perturbation this is clearly an indirect effect because the only outcome of a direct effect presented in the model is a decrease in biomass due to toxicity there are several ways to identify indirect effects any biomass increases in the perturbed simulation compared to the control are obviously due to indirect effects for example in the cases of diatoms and blue greens indirect effects are also obvious when a clear perturbation is observed for organisms that are insensitive to direct chemical toxicity as in the case of gastropods which has the highest lc50 value but with a clear decline in biomass likewise phase differences in the time varying biomass curves between perturbed and control simulations are likely caused by indirect effects as in the case of oligochaeta and mussels whose biomass peak time under the perturbed scenario advance or lag behind that of control scenario in general previous literatures showed that indirect effects were unpredictable and often counterintuitive due to the complexity of ecosystem level interactions lombardo et al 2015 grechi et al 2016 indirect toxic effects together with direct toxic effects not only affect the biomass of species at all levels but also produce bioconcentration and biomagnification effects of chemical pollutants at all trophic levels the bioconcentration factor of pahs for each species is shown in table 5 the order of the bioconcentration factor from large to small was fish zooplankton benthos plants the internal exposure concentrations in organisms are proportional to the external concentrations and largely dependent on trophic level interactions the higher the trophic level the higher the internal concentration in aquatox the bioaccumulation factor baf is the ratio of the concentration in the organism to that in the water the baf is a field based measure of the uptake and bioaccumulation in a species in fish for example this is caused by the uptake from the water via gill dermal and dietary exposure through all pathways bioconcentration factors bcfs are estimated from empirical regression equations and the pollutant s octanol water partition coefficient bcfs do not account for dietary uptake but they do reflect metabolic transformation and elimination processes that take place in the studied organisms the biomagnification factor bmf can be measured by the ratio of the baf to the bcf the baf may be smaller than the bcf baf bcf due to growth dilution especially in small organisms with fast growth rates conversely baf bcf indicates biomagnification most likely due to dietary uptake and subsequent slow depuration rates the bmf of catfish 3 98 or carp 1 80 shows a biomagnification effect to some extent which has the potential to be employed as an indicator to evaluate the indirect toxic effects of chemicals zhang et al 2018 employed an aquatox 3 1 model to assess the ecological effects of pahs in a plateau eutrophication lake namely dianchi lake in south china a shallow lake with 3 77 times the water volume of byd lake the teq of total pahs in water varied from 7 97 ng l to 201 04 ng l which is the same order of magnitude as that of byd lake however pahs in sediment were not monitored in dianci lake which may increase the uncertainties of the model the total nitrogen was almost equal to that of byd and the total phosphorus was about 10 times that of byd the model structures were developed based on aquatox the growth and death predation and competition toxicological effect and kinetic processes of 12 species were simulated most of the best parameters were estimated based on previous studies or by calibration moreover most of the populations were very sensitive to parameters related to temperature and respiration rate the results were different from those for byd in which the toxicological kinetic parameters also played key roles alongside the physiological parameters of species the results for dianchi lake showed that rotifer and chironomidae were sensitive to pah pollution as they are in byd in our study however phytoplankton and other benthic animals in byd lake also show sensitivity the reasons for the differing results are complicated and may include the following 1 different ecosystem traits such as physical size climate hydrology hydrodynamics water quality species structures etc 2 different pah pollution levels in water sediment and biota 3 different pah loads such as loads from upstream inflow non point source loads air deposition etc and 4 uncertainties of model structures and parameters the multi receptor multi disturbance multi medium and nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of the ecological model increase the complexity of the model structures the more complicated these structures are the more model parameters that are needed this positive feedback increases the difficulty of identifying the model parameters thus increasing the uncertainty moreover the lack of data in terms of quantity and quality also exacerbates the uncertainties of parameters the uncertainties of model structures and parameters call for more research efforts to be put into this field more case studies should be carried out to optimize the model structures to establish initial values of model parameters with standardized procedures to acquire more monitoring values of the physiological parameters of local species and to calibrate the parameters with more efficient methods 4 3 comparison with traditional methods the main goal of ecological impact assessments is to establish a safe threshold for the concentration of a chemical known as the predicted no effect concentration pnec no adverse effect on the ecosystem s structure and function is expected to be observed if the actual concentration in the lake is below the value of the pnec three methods are employed to acquire the pnec value the assessment factor af method the species sensitivity distribution ssd method and the modeling method for an ecosystem gredelj et al 2018 the af method involves calculating pnec based on laboratory toxicity data for three different populations usually including three trophic levels according to the different types of toxicity data assessment factors can vary from 10 to 1000 in order to assess the worst situation the lowest ec50 and the highest afs are applied to calculate the pnec in this study the pnec of pahs are calculated by dividing ec50 or lc50 for the most sensitive species with 1000 afs park and choi 2008 such afs is applied to the lowest lc50 of daphnia 1 30 µg l yielding a pnec by the af method pnecafs of 0 0013 µg l the ssd method involves constructing a cumulative probability distribution curve based on the toxicity data of each species to a chemical usually the concentration of 5 of affected species is taken as the biosafety concentration to protect the remaining 95 of species the pnec by the ssd method pnecssd is quoted from zeng et al 2020 at 0 050 µg l because species are highly aggregated in aqutox 3 1 it is hard to find the biosafety concentration corresponding to 5 of affected species the chemical concentration corresponding to 5 biomass loss in the whole ecosystem is defined as the pnec by aqutox pnecaqutox in this study yielding pnecaqutox 0 033 µg l we can conclude that the pnec by the three methods increased in the order of pnecafs pnecaquatox pnecssd these results suggest that pnec derived from the af method may be overprotective since they come from one thousandth of the lowest toxicity value the assessment factor is highly subjective and its value varies within the range of several orders of magnitude however pnecaquatox is almost half as low as pnecssd though they have the same order of magnitude this can be explained by the fact that both the direct and indirect toxic effects of a chemical are included in the aquatox 3 1 model whereas only direct toxic effects are considered by the ssd method this also implies that indirect effects due to competition for food sources and predation have the same magnitude of impact as those due to direct toxicity aquatox 3 1 simultaneously considers other factors in a real ecosystem besides toxic responses such as the influence of physicochemical and biological factors therefore the aquatox 3 1 modeling method can derive more reasonable pnecs than other methods at present aquatox 3 1 models have been employed to predict ecologically safe thresholds for different pollutants in various ecosystems lei et al 2010 gredelj et al 2018 5 conclusions a realistic byd lake model of pahs pollution was developed using aquatox 3 1 the proposed model was used to describe the dynamics of the functional groups of byd lake and the bioconcentration bioaccumulation and bio amplification of toxicity in living organisms along the food web the model has the potential to be an effective and useful tool to evaluate the toxicity effects of organic pollutants at an ecosystem level the information gained from model simulations shed light on the propagation of toxic effects from individual organisms to whole communities such information can aid in predicting no effect concentrations with more accuracy than traditional methods such as afs and the ssd which face uncertainty in lab to field extrapolations the biomass of each species was compared between perturbed and control simulations and the results suggested that species sensitivity measured in the laboratory rank of lc50 or ec50 of simulated species was obviously different from species sensitivity simulated by the byd lake model rank of biomass difference v i of simulated species due to indirect interactions at the ecosystem level despite the potential value of ecological modeling calibrating and validating perturbed simulations remain extremely challenging it is difficult to understand the cause effect relationship between variables because too many parameters are simultaneously calibrated and because biomonitoring data are insufficient therefore some suggestions and further research directions are put forward to reduce the uncertainty of ecological modeling first monitoring and testing for biological and toxicological parameters should be strengthened by improving the monitoring frequency of organisms taxonomy and biomass to reflect seasonal trends quantitatively monitoring the abundance and diet composition of representative species and performing toxicological testing of native species to acquire toxicokinetic and ecotoxicological data e g bcf lc50 and ec50 second a step by step calibration method is recommended as a strategy to reduce the complexity of model calibration prioritizing the calibration of state variables is suggested with a decreasing order of hydrology water chemistry phytoplankton zooplankton benthic omnivorous fish carnivorous fish third model sensitivity analysis can be performed before calibration so that sensitive parameters can be prioritized for adjustment before calibrating other parameters focusing on a few sensitive parameters can help identify the main cause effect relationship improve the efficiency of parameter calibration and facilitate an understanding

24373,conventional approaches to assessing the ecological impact of chemicals face uncertainty when extrapolating from single species toxicity data to community level effects on real ecosystems ecological models may be a useful tool to reduce that uncertainty because they enable a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of chemicals on species assemblages at the ecosystem level here a case study was developed in aquatox 3 1 to simulate the effects of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs on baiyangdian byd lake in northern china the model consisted of 12 groups of species two phytoplankton one macrophyte three zooplankton four benthic macroinvertebrates one omnivorous fish and one piscivorous fish a simulation of a perturbed or baseline scenario over 1 year showed satisfactory calibration on annual average biomasses compared with a control scenario the overall average biomass relative variation v decreases by 4 02 the relative variation of eco exergy v e x decreases by 5 64 and the ratio of gross primary productivity to community respiration p r increases by 5 58 these results indicate that one third of the species are remarkably affected of which the biomass differences are larger than 20 however indirect effects due to ecological interactions simulated by the byd model can either amplify or mitigate the effect of direct toxicity leading to significant changes for some organisms responses to chemicals in real ecosystems the case study demonstrates that the byd model has the potential to be an effective and useful tool to evaluate the toxicity effects of organic pollutants at an ecosystem level some suggestions are put forward to improve the model s accuracy including 1 more monitoring and testing data for biological and toxicological parameters 2 a step by step strategy for model calibration and 3 sensitivity analysis before calibrating the parameters keywords ecological model toxicity effects polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs ecosystem level baiyangdian lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are persistent organic pollutants that have long existed in aquatic sediments sandro et al 2018 owing to their low solubility and hydrophobic nature pahs tend to be associated with fine particles they are introduced into lakes by runoff and atmospheric fallout and lakes often act as a trap for pahs zhang et al 2018 pahs remain the most widely distributed toxic pollutant causing a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms including endocrine alteration growth reduction dna damage and malformations of embryos and larvae behera et al 2018 moreover the transfer of pahs from sediments into benthic organisms is a risk to higher trophic levels due to the consumption of contaminated benthic organisms khairy et al 2014 eventually the adverse impact of pahs extends to the whole ecosystem through the transmission bioaccumulation and biomagnification effects of the food chain therefore it is crucial to understand and evaluate the ecological impacts of pahs on lake ecosystems in order to guide management and inform policy towards the mitigation of their threat ecological impact assessments describe and forecast ecological impacts from human activities mainly focusing on the change in the structure and function of ecosystem processes and analyzing impacts at the ecosystem level in the long term liu et al 2015 however conventional approaches to ecological impact assessments of pahs are based on ecotoxicological studies for a few test species corresponding to three classes of organisms algae invertebrates and fish yan et al 2015 ikenaka et al 2013 with little significance in relation to the structures and functions of the ecosystems an assessment factor af method is applied to the lowest toxicity value lc50 or ec50 of a species in an ecosystem to derive predicted no effect concentrations pnecs that are considered safe for ecosystems lombardo et al 2015 pnecs can also be derived using a statistical approach based on the species sensitivity distribution ssd method gredelj et al 2018 which is also based on the toxicities of multiple species however population dynamics in polluted environments are not only driven by the direct toxicity effects of chemicals on single species but also by ecological interactions caused by competition and predation between species and by the influence of abiotic factors de laender et al 2007 therefore community and ecosystem level assessments can provide better indications of how species respond to chemicals than individual level ones there is a strong need for alternative approaches to extrapolating single species effects to ecosystem level responses to address different aspects of ecological realism lombardo et al 2015 ecological models can be applied to simulate both abiotic and biotic processes as well as direct toxicities and indirect toxicant effects propagated through food webs park and choi 2008 among these ecological models aquatox 3 1 is an integrated fate and effects model that combines water quality food web chemical fate and ecotoxicological processes a few case studies based on aquatox 3 1 have demonstrated its value as a useful tool to assess the impact of chemicals on the structure and function of an aquatic ecosystem zhang et al 2013 however the ecological impact of pahs on the structure and function of baiyangdian byd lake in northern china has not been evaluated until now byd is a typical plant dominated shallow freshwater lake consisting of about 143 lake parks distributed across 36 villages with 67 km2 of reed marshes zeng et al 2021 as a sink for nine upstream rivers with much human activity in the surrounding villages byd lake has a moderate level of pahs pollution in surface sediment compared with other chinese lakes guo et al 2011 hu et al 2009 pahs were also detected in the water in pelagic and benthic organisms and in fish zheng et al 2016 pahs exist widely and persistently in environmental media such as lake water suspended solids and sediment and they are bioaccumulated and transmitted in aquatic organisms leading to cumulative amplified and long term ecological risks assessing the ecological impact of pahs on byd lake is urgently needed before taking the next step therefore the aims of this study are to 1 develop a byd lake ecological model of pahs pollution based on aquatox 3 1 2 parameterize calibrate and analyze the sensitivity of the parameters of the byd lake model and 3 evaluate the ecological impact of pahs on the byd lake ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area byd lake e 115 75 116 12 n 38 73 38 98 has an area of approximately 366 km2 it is located in anxin county near the city of baoding in hebei province fig 1 the water depth varies from 2 m to 6 m and the lake is surrounded by 143 lake parks adjacent to 36 villages zhang et al 2020 as a famous tourist resort in china byd lake receives more than 850 000 tourists every year with many diesel boats serving as transportation guo et al 2011 the lake has been subjected to moderate pahs pollution due to increasing energy consumption from biomass fuel and coal combustion in villages and exhaust gas from boats and vehicle emissions in nearby areas zhou et al 2008 previous studies found that the average total pahs concentration 16 kinds of priority control monomer compounds defined by usepa in the surface sediment ranged from 353 0 to 755 6 ng g dry weight dw between 2007 and 2009 zhou et al 2008 hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2009a qin et al 2018 thirty two sediment water and macrophyte samples were collected and tested for pahs concentrations in april 2021 the average concentrations are given in table s1 because polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a mixture the toxic equivalency factor tef approach proposed by nisbet and lagoy 1992 was applied to estimate the overall impact of pahs the concentration of individual pahs was expressed as bap equivalents by toxicity comparisons and these bap equivalent values were added together to yield the toxicity equivalent concentration of total pahs table s1 the formula for this calculation is given in eq s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 the aquatox model in this study aquatox 3 1 was utilized to predict the ecological impact of pahs on byd lake aquatox 3 1 is a mechanistic model suitable to assess the effects of several stressors environmental variables nutrients and chemical pollutants at the ecosystem level as it accounts for the cause effect mechanisms between biological response and chemical toxicity through the trophic level relationships from primary producers to fish martins et al 2019 a powerful feature of aquatox 3 1 is that it can run paired simulations the model runs twice with and without chemical interference with other settings unchanged for perturbed and control conditions and specify the differences between these two types of runs to derive the ecological effects of a chemical clough 2018 the fundamental equations used in aquatox 3 1 include simulating the changes of biomass of each species and predicting the fate of a chemical partitioned into water sediment particulate and biota detailed descriptions of the equations used in the model can be found in the technical reference guide for the model park and clough 2018 2 2 1 data sources aquatox 3 1 requires selecting the type of aquatic system being modeled pond lake stream or estuary defining the set of site specific parameters providing the variation of the forcing functions e g temperature dissolved oxygen nutrients and organic pollutants selecting the food web constituents and parameterizing trophic relationships inputting the biodynamic parameters of each species inputting chemical properties and toxicity parameters and finally predicting the biomass over time of each trophic level and the partitioning of a chemical between the water sediment and biota therefore ample data are needed to allow the user to specify key process rates and characteristics lombardo et al al 2015 the types specifications and sources of the data used by the byd lake model are shown in table s2 of the supplementary material thirty two sediment water and macrophyte samples were collected and tested for pahs concentrations in april 2021 fourteen biomass samples including 12 species in each sample were seasonally monitored from april to november 2018 the locations of these samples are shown in fig 1 the monitoring results show that the average total pahs concentration in sediment water macrophyte was 411 12 ng g dw 78 ng l and 230 45 ng g wet respectively as shown in table s1 only three sampling dates april june and november were used as observed values to calibrate the model due to budget and time constraints although the lack of sufficient observations might bring uncertainty to the interpretation of seasonal trends it will not prevent us from using the ecosystem approach to model the impact of a toxicant in terms of the application of the method and the formation of the program flow with more monitoring data the ecological model will be more accurate than conventional methods based on single species toxicity the improvement will lead to the establishment of adequate protection levels for species and the implementation of effective ecosystem management more importantly it provides a new tool for understanding the complex effects of toxicants on the structure and functions of specific ecosystems 2 2 2 parameterization 2 2 2 1 physicochemical parameters of the byd lake model basic morphological hydrologic and meteorological parameters of the byd lake model were collected from time series routine monitoring data provided by the local government and previous literature input data were constant or variable over time depending on data availability and model requirements main morphological meteorological and physical data used by byd lake model are compiled and summarized in table s3 chemical data of the inflow loadings are summarized in table s4 2 2 2 2 biological parameters of the byd lake model in aquatox 3 1 biological parameters are employed to construct a food web model which includes the selection of representative species imputing initial biomass and kinetic parameters and building a diet matrix in the diet matrix predators and prey are defined according to the food relationship the user indicates the potential prey preferences of each predator in terms of the mass percentage and defines the egestion coefficients of each predator the species of byd lake were chosen based on zeng et al 2021 who reclassified the species into 12 species two microalgae one macrophyte three zooplankton four benthic animals and two fish the prey preferences of each modeled species were revised from zeng et al 2021 and the egestion coefficients came from values of similar species described by lombardo et al 2015 as shown in table 1 for each modeled species the initial values of biomass were taken from biomonitoring data in april 2018 the starting values of the kinetic parameters came from previous literature or the default values of the most similar species in the aquatox 3 1 library the best parameters of each species after calibration are presented in tables 2 and 3 2 2 2 3 parameters of pahs for the byd lake model the input parameters of pahs include physicochemical properties toxicokinetic parameters toxicological parameters initial concentrations and loadings the loads of pahs in the inflow were very low so they were ignored previous research results showed that pahs pollution mainly came from the atmospheric deposition of local human activities such as fuel combustion traffic exhaust emission and biomass combustion zhou et al 2008 hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2009a as a result only the loads of atmospheric deposition were considered pahs rarely consist of a single compound instead they are usually a mixture of compounds however simulations in aquatox 3 1 are typically based on single compound a method of converting a mixture into a single compound is thus required toxic equivalency factors tefs of each pah which are derived from a pairwise comparison with the toxicity of bap were employed to convert other compounds into bap by this means the concentration of pahs was replaced by a cumulative concentration of bap table s1 the main physicochemical properties and single species toxicity data of bap were summarized from previous literature and the ecotox database as listed in tables 4 and 5 lethal and sublethal toxicity were computed on the basis of the internal concentration derived from the bioconcentration factor bcf the latter was calculated by the octanol water partition coefficient kow the fraction of biomass killed by a given internal concentration of a toxicant was estimated using a weibull distribution with a default shape factor value of 0 33 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out to examine the relative contribution of parameters to the biomass or internal concentration of the bap equivalent for each species sensitive parameters were then used to refine the estimation of parameters and improve the efficiency of the model calibration the sensitivity index was calculated by the following expression 1 s e n s i t i v i t y r e s u l t p o s r e s u l t b a s e l i n e r e s u l t n e g r e s u l t b a s e l i n e 2 r e s u l t b a s e l

pctchanged is the percentage by which an input parameter changed e g a value of 20 means that the percentage of a parameter varies by 10 a larger value of the sensitivity index means a greater contribution of the parameter 2 2 4 calibration strategy since historical monitoring data from march 1 2018 to march 1 2019 showed the results under the influence of pahs pollution the perturbed ecosystem was calibrated over a period of 1 year the calibration was done manually as follows first eutrophic variables including dissolved oxygen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and phosphate were calibrated by modifying the default remineralization parameters and reaeration rate then phytoplankton zooplankton benthic organisms and fish were calibrated successively by modifying the default sensitive parameters suggested by the results of the parameter sensitivity analysis such as the optimal temperature temperature response slope maximum photosynthetic rate saturating light morality rate maximum consumption minimum prey for feeding etc the goal of calibration was to quantitatively match averaged simulated biomass with averaged observed values in april june and november 2018 this can be mathematically expressed by the average relative variation between averaged observed value for the ith species in the jth month b o i j g dry m2 and averaged simulated value for the ith species in the jth month b s i j g dry m2 2 ε i j 1 3 b o i j b s i j b o i j 3 100 3 ε i 1 12 ε i 12 100 where ε is the overall average biomass relative variation ε i is the average biomass relative variation for the ith species the subscript i denotes the number of species from 1 to 12 and j takes a value of 1 2 or 3 representing april june or november respectively 2 3 ecosystem impact indicators one of the key challenges of this study is to find a suitable methodology to assess the ecological impact of pahs on byd lake at a system level the proposed methodology compared the results between the control and the perturbed scenarios in terms of the defined systematic indicators these indicators include three categories such as the compartment or overall average biomass relative variation grechi et al 2016 in which the relative variation reflects the different degree of average biomass between the perturbed and control scenarios suter and mabrey 1994 used a 20 reduction in population biomass as the endpoint by which to establish toxicological benchmarks of potential contaminants for aquatic biota this is because 20 is the minimum detectable difference in population characteristics in the field the biomass difference of the ith compartment v i is calculated using eq 4 and the overall biomass difference for all compartments v is calculated with eq 5 4 v i b p i b c i b c i 100 5 v 1 n i 1 n b p i b c i b c i 100 where b p i is the average biomass for a given compartment i during the perturbed simulation g m 2 d r y and b c i is the average biomass for a given compartment i during the control simulation g m 2 d r y another category pertains to ecosystem metrics which are measurable indicators of the structure and function of ecological systems such as the gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp community respiration r ratio of gpp to community respiration p r and turnover time p b ratio of gpp to biomass in days park and clough 2018 here p r is selected to evaluate the state of an ecosystem and is calculated as follows 6 p r g p p r where gpp is the gross primary production go2 m2d and r is the community respiration go2 m2d a mature ecosystem tends to have a p r value of almost 1 values far higher or lower than 1 are thought to be those of an immature ecosystem or an unhealthy ecosystem eco exergy e x has a solid theoretical basis in thermodynamics and can be used as a holistic indicator of ecosystem development and health jørgensen et al 2005 the value of exergy is equal to the weighted sum of the biomass of all species in an ecosystem higher trophic levels such as zooplankton and fish have larger weights than phytoplankton or macrophytes because they have a higher number of information genes the general equation proposed by jørgensen 1995a 1995b is as follows 7 e x i 1 n β i c i where β i is the weighting factor of the ith compartment that accounts for the information that the organisms carried the determination of β for various organisms is based on the number of coding and non coding genes and more precise values of β are given in table 8 further c i is the average annual biomass of the ith compartment or the average annual concentration of the ith component and n is the total number of compartments the eco exergy difference v e x can be calculated as the relative variation between the eco exergy under the perturbed simulation e x p and the eco exergy under the control simulation e x c 8 v e x e x p e x c e x c 100 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the top three parameters that contributed most to the biomass of the species are listed in table 6 percentages in parentheses in the table show the values of the sensitivity index calculated by eq 1 the annual biomass of phytoplankton is primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re that is k2 the optimal temperature to of carp and the temperature response slope tr of carp the annual biomass of macrophytes is primarily affected by the optimal temperature to of carp the optimal temperature to of macrophytes and the maximum photosynthetic rate pm of macrophytes the results obtain from algae suggest that most of the populations are very sensitive to toxicokinetic parameters and the temperature effects of carp because through the food web the latter are the main direct and indirect predator for algae the annual biomass of rotifer is sensitive to the parameters of blue greens this counterintuitive result suggests that indirect effects played a major role in rotifer production cladocerans are primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re and respiration rate rr and copepods are primarily affected by their eliminate rate re and the parameters of carp these results suggest that indirect effects play a key role in determining the populations of zooplankton the annual biomass of oligochaeta is mainly affected by temperature parameters of carp and its optimal temperature to chironomidae is primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re respiration rate rr and the optimal temperature to of blue greens mussels are primarily affected by their eliminate rate constant re and respiration rate rr gastropods are primarily affected by the optimal temperature to of carp macrophytes and their own optimal temperature the results of benthic animals present the joint effects of direct reactions and indirect trophic level interactions triggered by chemicals and all kinds of environmental factors the annual production of carp is primarily affected by their eliminate rate re optimal temperature to and the to of oligochaeta catfish are primarily affected by their respiration rate rr eliminate rate constant re and the optimal temperature to of carp the results of fish suggest that direct effects including toxic effects played a major role in fish biomass the sensitivity analysis results of the byd model suggest that the biomass of the lake s ecosystem is affected by three kinds of factors the pahs loads as a factor are large enough to affect lake organisms indirect trophic level interactions especially those of carp and blue greens largely determined the populations of most species directly sensitive parameters such as the temperature limitation maximum photosynthetic rate and respiration rate also impact the biomass of organisms these results are consistent with those of similar studies niu et al 2016 sourisseau et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 3 2 model calibration the perturbed byd model was calibrated over a period of one year as shown in fig 2 the goodness of the model fit to the observed average monthly biomass in april june and november is shown in table 7 for every species from table 7 the simulated results are acceptable as the overall average biomass relative variation ε was 17 56 and the average relative variation of each species ε i was less than 30 because there are only three observed biomass values for each species in spring summer and autumn correlation coefficients are not used to measure the trend consistency between the observed and simulated values alternatively the monthly biomass relative variations are employed to assess the accuracy of the seasonal simulation if the model aptly simulates seasonal trends the relative variation of species in the three periods april june and november should be all relatively small however the most relative variations of simulated species are large exceeding 15 00 reaching as high as 40 25 except for macrophyte and carp these results suggest that the accuracy of the seasonal simulation is poor this deficiency was noted by grechi et al 2016 who found that the ecosystem model of the lower po river in italy was satisfactorily calibrated for annual average biomass but not for seasonal trends owing to the poor efficiency of the manual calibration process and the limited availability of biomonitoring data aquatox based ecosystem level models represent a useful platform to assess the impact of chemicals on the structure and function of a whole ecosystem impacted by multiple stressors e g chemical mixtures organic matter and nutrients it provides an approach that is theoretically more accurate and comprehensive for assessing the ecological impact of chemicals than conventional methods which are based on hazard quotients for individual level endpoints conventional methods have limited utility for assessing risks at the population ecosystem and landscape levels which are the most relevant indicators for environmental management pastorok et al 2003 in addition other benefits of the ecological modeling approach include the following 1 it allows for extensive scenario testing without the accompanying high costs 2 it can extrapolate the effects of a tested exposure pattern to other untested exposure patterns 3 it can analyze and predict possible indirect effects in communities and 4 it can uncover bioaccumulation and biomagnification within food chains or food webs galic et al 2010 although data are often limited regarding the vital rates and dose response functions needed for ecological modeling ecological modeling is nevertheless a valuable approach to addressing issues related to the assessment of chemical risk including ecosystem management issues the objective of this paper is to offer an example of how to approach ecosystem level predictions of a toxicant s impact as more researchers pay attention to and apply the ecological model the structure and parameters of the model will be optimized and uncertainty or errors with the model will be mitigated by the level of practical management and application as shown in fig 2 the peak values of the modeled producers correspond to the observed growth of diatoms in spring march summer may june and winter october november and to blue greens in autumn july august there is no obvious trend for macrophytes the growth patterns of algae depended on their different needs in terms of optimal temperature and adaptation range in autumn blue greens rapidly increase due to their need for higher optimum water temperatures in spring and autumn diatoms increase rapidly because they have lower optimum water temperatures macrophytes thrive in a wider temperature range and thus have no obvious peak values the simulated biomass of macrophytes is as high as 88 629 g m2 dry accounting for 66 04 table 8 of the simulated total biomass in the whole lake and indicating that the water body had been seriously eutrophicated resulting in the excessive growth of large aquatic plants and submerged plants from table 8 compared to simulated producer biomass the simulated biomass of zooplankton is relatively small accounting for only 0 35 of the simulated total biomass as shown in fig 2 the simulated rotifer biomass peaks in spring january march and autumn august september the simulated cladoceran biomass peaks in spring january march and autumn august the simulated copepod biomass peaks in spring march however as shown in table 8 the simulated biomasses of benthos which are mainly composed of mussel gastropod chironomid and oligochaeta only accounts for 5 13 of the simulated total biomass the biodiversity of benthos decreases due to a lack of key species such as shrimp and crab which live in benthic environments previous studies chen et al 2021 fu et al 2022 found the dominant species of benthos were mainly pollution tolerant species including gastropods and chironomids however the abundance and biomass of shrimp and crab species as clean species have gradually decreased in recent years biomass monitoring data in 2018 did not record any shrimp and crab from fig 2 the simulated biomass of oligochaeta chironomid and mussel all peak in spring march and summer april except for gastropods which peaks in summer april and autumn september moreover the simulated biomass of fish accounts for 28 43 of the simulated total biomass as shown in table 8 the fish species in byd lake as the key factors in mediating other biodiversity have suffered from miniaturization juvenilization and a reduction in bio diversity over the past decade zeng et al 2021 from fig 2 the simulated biomass of both carp and catfish peak in summer april and autumn september 3 3 ecological impact of pahs the average biomass and eco exergy of each compartment between the perturbed and control scenarios are shown in table 8 suter and mabrey 1994 used a 20 reduction in population biomass as the endpoint by which to establish toxicological benchmarks of potential contaminants for aquatic biota this is because 20 is the minimum detectable difference in population characteristics in the field suter 1993 we consider a 20 change in biomass to represent remarkable impact by a toxicant the overall biomass difference v and the eco exergy difference v e x is 4 02 and 5 64 respectively i e less than 20 this indicates pahs have an unremarkable impact on changes in biomass and ecosystem health the p r ratio under the perturbed scenario reaches 2 65 an increase of 5 58 compared with that under the control scenario 2 51 these results further demonstrate that pahs in byd lake have an adverse effect on total biomass and ecosystem health the calculated p r ratio under the perturbed scenario is consistent with previous results from 2009 to 2010 for byd lake zeng et al 2021 although the adverse effects of pahs on the byd lake ecosystem are not so remarkable as a whole the adverse effects on some species are important to consider because one third species are considerably affected resulting in biomass changes higher than 20 the most remarkably affected species are oligochaeta whose biomass under the perturbed scenario reduced by 29 63 compared with that of the control scenario and likewise for mussels 22 65 and chironomidae 21 30 however under the perturbed scenario the plant biomass counter intuitively increases by 25 15 for diatoms and by 18 45 for blue green algae with a decrease of 1 55 for macrophytes species not remarkably affected include rotifers 15 51 gastropods 15 27 catfish 9 63 and carp 6 76 the least affected species are cladocerans 5 03 copepods 3 37 and macrophyte 1 55 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy and adaptability of the byd lake model at its current level of accuracy the combined perturbed and control simulations may be capable of evaluating the impact of organic chemicals on lake ecosystems at a system scale by discerning the differences between the perturbed and control simulations the model can reflect the changes in biomass of each species before and after interference as well as the bio transmission bioaccumulation and biomagnification between species through the food web the model can also reflect direct and indirect effects whereas the latter are difficult to observe in the laboratory or in the field the byd lake model could also be used to design mesocosm or field toxicological tests such as identifying test species and determining the dose range of a toxicant however there are many uncertainties in the model structure and parameters due to multiple environmental variables predator prey interactions complicated feedback and nonlinear processes in ecological systems in response to perturbations because of a lack of field data some processes were not simulated e g intraspecific differences in terms of size and sex organism drift migration biotransformation sediment diagenesis etc neglecting these processes will inevitably lead to structural model errors too many parameters especially regarding the biodynamics of growth and death for every species need to be decided by calibration when there are no observed data the lack of high quality information regarding the food web between organisms will produce errors in predicting indirect effects toxicological kinetic parameters are also rare although they greatly affect the internal concentrations of organisms the biological monitoring indicators and frequency are also insufficient and this affects the accuracy of models model calibration is a time consuming manual fitting exercise given the high number of parameters to be calibrated combined with the lack of an automatic calibration routine in aquatox 3 1 in order to improve the efficiency of parameter calibration sensitivity analysis of the parameters should be carried out in advance before calibrating the model parameters the results of the sensitivity analysis for the byd model show that the elimination rate optimum temperature and maximum photosynthetic rate are the most sensitive parameters these parameters must be carefully checked the biomass and pahs concentration of high trophic levels are affected by hydrodynamics nutrients and food web species such as absorbed and accumulated pahs in low trophic levels which are transmitted to high trophic levels along the food web thus the simulation errors of high trophic level will be enlarged level by level with the increase in the trophic level therefore a step by step calibration method is recommended as a strategy for model calibration to control simulation errors hydrodynamic state variables such as the water level outlet flow and flow velocity are first calibrated compared with the flow velocity the fitting error of the water level and outlet flow was usually small and it is easier to calibrate successfully therefore the calibration of the water level and outlet flow should precede that of the flow velocity second nutrients are calibrated where dissolved oxygen is calibrated first because the model error of dissolved oxygen is easier to control than that of nitrogen and phosphorus and will further affect the calibration of the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus by affecting the process of nitrification denitrification and mineralization phosphate is next calibrated followed by the calibration of nitrogen because the latter is the most difficult to fit during calibration more state variables need to be simulated there are more complex model structures with differential equations and more parameters need to be set and calibrated third aquatic biomass and pahs internal concentrations are calibrated for low trophic levels to high trophic levels that is in the order of phytoplankton zooplankton benthos and fish the accuracy of the model largely depended on the quality of the monitoring data ecological models need ample multi sectoral data especially biological monitoring data the monitoring frequency of an indicator needs to be increased to reflect seasonal trends in addition when many parameters need to be calibrated it is difficult for modelers to understand the cause effect relationship between the variables therefore the number of non sensitive parameters should be reduced as much as possible through literature reviews field tests and specific experiments this will help modelers to focus on a few key parameters and understand the key processes of the ecosystem 4 2 toxicity effects at an ecosystem level the byd lake model provides a tool to better understand the distribution of a chemical in environmental media water suspended solids and sediments as well as changes to the biomass of various organisms driven by exposure to a chemical although there is considerable uncertainty thus the model based approach may be able to evaluate the toxicity effects of a chemical at an ecosystem level by figuring out the structural and functional indicators of an ecosystem such work could be done by ecological network analysis which is commonly used to systematic assess the structure and function of an ecosystem and identify indirect effects zeng et al 2021 an understanding of the ecological effects at a system scale requires knowledge of the direct toxicity caused by a chemical but it is more important to understand the indirect effects of toxicity that is the interaction between ecological components triggered by a chemical input direct toxicity measured by lc50 values and biomass perturbation measured by biomass difference are poorly correlated fig 3 suggesting that other ecological processes besides direct toxicological effects play an important role in ecosystem dynamics for example the most sensitive organism cladocerans in the byd lake ecosystem according to the lc50 value do not show high average perturbation rather the highest average perturbations are exhibited by oligochaeta and chironomidae organisms with almost identical toxicity show different effects for example blue greens and carp have almost the same sensitivity to pahs but they have opposite biomass variations moreover blue greens and diatoms show positive biomass variation following pahs perturbation this is clearly an indirect effect because the only outcome of a direct effect presented in the model is a decrease in biomass due to toxicity there are several ways to identify indirect effects any biomass increases in the perturbed simulation compared to the control are obviously due to indirect effects for example in the cases of diatoms and blue greens indirect effects are also obvious when a clear perturbation is observed for organisms that are insensitive to direct chemical toxicity as in the case of gastropods which has the highest lc50 value but with a clear decline in biomass likewise phase differences in the time varying biomass curves between perturbed and control simulations are likely caused by indirect effects as in the case of oligochaeta and mussels whose biomass peak time under the perturbed scenario advance or lag behind that of control scenario in general previous literatures showed that indirect effects were unpredictable and often counterintuitive due to the complexity of ecosystem level interactions lombardo et al 2015 grechi et al 2016 indirect toxic effects together with direct toxic effects not only affect the biomass of species at all levels but also produce bioconcentration and biomagnification effects of chemical pollutants at all trophic levels the bioconcentration factor of pahs for each species is shown in table 5 the order of the bioconcentration factor from large to small was fish zooplankton benthos plants the internal exposure concentrations in organisms are proportional to the external concentrations and largely dependent on trophic level interactions the higher the trophic level the higher the internal concentration in aquatox the bioaccumulation factor baf is the ratio of the concentration in the organism to that in the water the baf is a field based measure of the uptake and bioaccumulation in a species in fish for example this is caused by the uptake from the water via gill dermal and dietary exposure through all pathways bioconcentration factors bcfs are estimated from empirical regression equations and the pollutant s octanol water partition coefficient bcfs do not account for dietary uptake but they do reflect metabolic transformation and elimination processes that take place in the studied organisms the biomagnification factor bmf can be measured by the ratio of the baf to the bcf the baf may be smaller than the bcf baf bcf due to growth dilution especially in small organisms with fast growth rates conversely baf bcf indicates biomagnification most likely due to dietary uptake and subsequent slow depuration rates the bmf of catfish 3 98 or carp 1 80 shows a biomagnification effect to some extent which has the potential to be employed as an indicator to evaluate the indirect toxic effects of chemicals zhang et al 2018 employed an aquatox 3 1 model to assess the ecological effects of pahs in a plateau eutrophication lake namely dianchi lake in south china a shallow lake with 3 77 times the water volume of byd lake the teq of total pahs in water varied from 7 97 ng l to 201 04 ng l which is the same order of magnitude as that of byd lake however pahs in sediment were not monitored in dianci lake which may increase the uncertainties of the model the total nitrogen was almost equal to that of byd and the total phosphorus was about 10 times that of byd the model structures were developed based on aquatox the growth and death predation and competition toxicological effect and kinetic processes of 12 species were simulated most of the best parameters were estimated based on previous studies or by calibration moreover most of the populations were very sensitive to parameters related to temperature and respiration rate the results were different from those for byd in which the toxicological kinetic parameters also played key roles alongside the physiological parameters of species the results for dianchi lake showed that rotifer and chironomidae were sensitive to pah pollution as they are in byd in our study however phytoplankton and other benthic animals in byd lake also show sensitivity the reasons for the differing results are complicated and may include the following 1 different ecosystem traits such as physical size climate hydrology hydrodynamics water quality species structures etc 2 different pah pollution levels in water sediment and biota 3 different pah loads such as loads from upstream inflow non point source loads air deposition etc and 4 uncertainties of model structures and parameters the multi receptor multi disturbance multi medium and nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of the ecological model increase the complexity of the model structures the more complicated these structures are the more model parameters that are needed this positive feedback increases the difficulty of identifying the model parameters thus increasing the uncertainty moreover the lack of data in terms of quantity and quality also exacerbates the uncertainties of parameters the uncertainties of model structures and parameters call for more research efforts to be put into this field more case studies should be carried out to optimize the model structures to establish initial values of model parameters with standardized procedures to acquire more monitoring values of the physiological parameters of local species and to calibrate the parameters with more efficient methods 4 3 comparison with traditional methods the main goal of ecological impact assessments is to establish a safe threshold for the concentration of a chemical known as the predicted no effect concentration pnec no adverse effect on the ecosystem s structure and function is expected to be observed if the actual concentration in the lake is below the value of the pnec three methods are employed to acquire the pnec value the assessment factor af method the species sensitivity distribution ssd method and the modeling method for an ecosystem gredelj et al 2018 the af method involves calculating pnec based on laboratory toxicity data for three different populations usually including three trophic levels according to the different types of toxicity data assessment factors can vary from 10 to 1000 in order to assess the worst situation the lowest ec50 and the highest afs are applied to calculate the pnec in this study the pnec of pahs are calculated by dividing ec50 or lc50 for the most sensitive species with 1000 afs park and choi 2008 such afs is applied to the lowest lc50 of daphnia 1 30 µg l yielding a pnec by the af method pnecafs of 0 0013 µg l the ssd method involves constructing a cumulative probability distribution curve based on the toxicity data of each species to a chemical usually the concentration of 5 of affected species is taken as the biosafety concentration to protect the remaining 95 of species the pnec by the ssd method pnecssd is quoted from zeng et al 2020 at 0 050 µg l because species are highly aggregated in aqutox 3 1 it is hard to find the biosafety concentration corresponding to 5 of affected species the chemical concentration corresponding to 5 biomass loss in the whole ecosystem is defined as the pnec by aqutox pnecaqutox in this study yielding pnecaqutox 0 033 µg l we can conclude that the pnec by the three methods increased in the order of pnecafs pnecaquatox pnecssd these results suggest that pnec derived from the af method may be overprotective since they come from one thousandth of the lowest toxicity value the assessment factor is highly subjective and its value varies within the range of several orders of magnitude however pnecaquatox is almost half as low as pnecssd though they have the same order of magnitude this can be explained by the fact that both the direct and indirect toxic effects of a chemical are included in the aquatox 3 1 model whereas only direct toxic effects are considered by the ssd method this also implies that indirect effects due to competition for food sources and predation have the same magnitude of impact as those due to direct toxicity aquatox 3 1 simultaneously considers other factors in a real ecosystem besides toxic responses such as the influence of physicochemical and biological factors therefore the aquatox 3 1 modeling method can derive more reasonable pnecs than other methods at present aquatox 3 1 models have been employed to predict ecologically safe thresholds for different pollutants in various ecosystems lei et al 2010 gredelj et al 2018 5 conclusions a realistic byd lake model of pahs pollution was developed using aquatox 3 1 the proposed model was used to describe the dynamics of the functional groups of byd lake and the bioconcentration bioaccumulation and bio amplification of toxicity in living organisms along the food web the model has the potential to be an effective and useful tool to evaluate the toxicity effects of organic pollutants at an ecosystem level the information gained from model simulations shed light on the propagation of toxic effects from individual organisms to whole communities such information can aid in predicting no effect concentrations with more accuracy than traditional methods such as afs and the ssd which face uncertainty in lab to field extrapolations the biomass of each species was compared between perturbed and control simulations and the results suggested that species sensitivity measured in the laboratory rank of lc50 or ec50 of simulated species was obviously different from species sensitivity simulated by the byd lake model rank of biomass difference v i of simulated species due to indirect interactions at the ecosystem level despite the potential value of ecological modeling calibrating and validating perturbed simulations remain extremely challenging it is difficult to understand the cause effect relationship between variables because too many parameters are simultaneously calibrated and because biomonitoring data are insufficient therefore some suggestions and further research directions are put forward to reduce the uncertainty of ecological modeling first monitoring and testing for biological and toxicological parameters should be strengthened by improving the monitoring frequency of organisms taxonomy and biomass to reflect seasonal trends quantitatively monitoring the abundance and diet composition of representative species and performing toxicological testing of native species to acquire toxicokinetic and ecotoxicological data e g bcf lc50 and ec50 second a step by step calibration method is recommended as a strategy to reduce the complexity of model calibration prioritizing the calibration of state variables is suggested with a decreasing order of hydrology water chemistry phytoplankton zooplankton benthic omnivorous fish carnivorous fish third model sensitivity analysis can be performed before calibration so that sensitive parameters can be prioritized for adjustment before calibrating other parameters focusing on a few sensitive parameters can help identify the main cause effect relationship improve the efficiency of parameter calibration and facilitate an understanding

24374,disturbances of coral reefs are increasing in frequency intensity and duration these changes will likely result in demographic shifts in many populations of reef building corals with unknown consequences for ongoing coral restoration efforts to address this knowledge gap here we use empirically derived stage based matrix population models to predict how a relatively stable population and areal coverage of orbicella franksi may change under simulated disturbance and restoration scenarios overall simulated restoration outplanting greatly increased the number of o franksi colonies and overall estimated areal coverage when compared to baseline population estimates under a mild disturbance scenario the number of o franksi colonies were projected to decrease by up to 90 by 2050 but simulated restoration was predicted to offset the loss in number of colonies under a severe disturbance scenario the number of o franksi colonies also decreased but simulated restoration efforts were not able to offset colony losses under both disturbance scenarios there was a large projected loss of o franksi areal coverage even when restoration was implemented however restoration prevented a rapid decrease in number of colonies in the severe disturbance scenario these findings highlight the potentially catastrophic effects of disturbances on previously stable coral populations and the role restoration can play in mitigating these threats increasing studies focused on widespread ecological and demographic monitoring of disturbed and restored corals will be critical in the development of more effective restoration strategies for conserving these threatened species in an uncertain future keywords coral reefs demography disturbance matrix population models orbicella

abiotic disturbances e g storm intensity and exacerbating stressors e g increasing temperatures and decreasing dissolved oxygen creating challenges for the long term persistence of marine species and ecosystems keister et al 2000 schmidtko et al 2017 raven et al 2020 in many instances the rate of change of environmental conditions can occur faster than species can adapt leading to a loss of biodiversity and ultimately loss of ecosystem functions and services hooper et al 2005 harley 2011 cook et al 2014 benthic species unable to shift their spatial distribution at rates similar to shifts occurring in the environment are at higher risk of population decline as compared to relatively mobile species levin 2006 atkins and travis 2010 harley 2011 lewis et al 2021a while many sessile marine species have a larval dispersal stage as part of their life history such larval stages are relatively passive compared to advective forces and largely reliant on ocean currents to transport them to more favorable habitat after the larvae of some of these species settle they grow to create complex biogenic habitat serving as foundation species that support a diversity of organisms ellison et al 2005 slattery et al 2011 van katwijk et al 2016 foundation species play a critical role in structuring and supporting complex marine ecosystems and their loss can result in severe negative effects on higher trophic levels ellison et al 2005 duke et al 2007 van katwijk et al 2016 stony corals the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems are highly imperiled by climate change bindoff et al 2019 maher et al 2020 these species vary in geographic range and life history strategies but in terms of survivorship many can only survive within a relatively narrow range of water temperature and light availability a degree or two increase in temperature can lead to massive coral bleaching events glynn 1993 baird et al 2018 hughes et al 2018c extreme coral bleaching events used to occur relatively infrequently but now are predicted to occur every six years globally hughes et al 2018b due to these myriad threats tropical coral cover loss is estimated at 50 75 globally de ath et al 2012 hughes et al 2018b bruno et al 2019 additional threats to corals include hypoxic events disease outbreaks algal overgrowth severe storms and predation all of which may pressure a population simultaneously bruno et al 2007 de ath et al 2012 glynn et al 2020 further the increase in prevalence of diseases namely stony coral tissue loss disease sctld has led to extreme colony loss of highly susceptible corals and is spreading rapidly in many regions muller et al 2020 brandt et al 2021 these compounding and interacting factors make determining the true driver of coral loss and mortality complicated together disturbances e g extreme storms and hypoxic events have resulted in coral cover losses ranging from 5 to 60 hughes et al 2018c 2018b 2018a johnston et al 2019b while coral reef systems have evolved mechanisms to recover from natural disturbances the frequency and magnitude of disturbances in recent years suggests active restoration and conservation efforts will be increasingly important to help sustain and ensure these foundation species continue to exist in nature glynn 1993 slattery et al 2011 bostrom einarsson et al 2018 to combat coral loss the practice of restoration is increasing bostrom einarsson et al 2018 direct interventions including restoration along with natural and assisted adaptation are now considered necessary for corals and coral reefs to survive the climate crisis nasem 2019 to date coral reef restoration has been dominated by coral gardening which involves transplanting coral fragments primarily branching corals following a nursery phase bostrom einarsson et al 2018 in recent years additional restoration techniques have emerged and efforts to restore massive non branching corals such as orbicella franksi have increased augmenting coral species richness on a degraded reef can have multiple synergistic benefits and enhance the resistance and resilience of a reef to bleaching and fragmentation clements and hay 2021 furthermore massive corals increase the physical stability of the reef structure bostrom einarsson et al 2018 and can contribute substantially to reef accretion however it remains unclear how restoration of massive corals impacts population growth rates and how effective restoration may be at mitigating colony losses caused by disturbances to address this knowledge gap size structured matrix population models were developed for o franksi using empirical data describing vital rates i e survivorship mortality growth etc in the northwest gulf of mexico caswell 2001 vardi et al 2012 riegl et al 2017 edmunds 2019 more specifically data collected within the boundaries of the flower garden banks fgb were used to forecast demographic shifts in o franksi population structure under different scenarios simulating future disturbance regimes and restoration scenarios due to the relative paucity of coral vital rate data demographic models have been underutilized in coral reef ecology edmunds 2019 edmunds and riegl 2020 yet when vital rate data are available these models provide a powerful means to understand the effects of various ecological disturbances on population growth and simultaneously provide a means to predict how potential restoration strategies may be best used to help sustain these species over time hernandez pacheco et al 2011 bostrom einarsson et al 2018 edmunds and riegl 2020 this study uses a combination of size structured matrix population models elasticity analyses and simulation modeling to answer fundamental questions regarding the demographic consequences of disturbance and restoration for o franksi a dominant reef building coral in the wider caribbean johnston et al 2016 through these analyses three questions were assessed 1 what is the size class structure of an orbicella franksi population during a period with no reported disturbances or restoration efforts 2 how do mild and severe disturbances impact size class structure relative to the baseline scenario by the years 2030 and 2050 3 does restoration stabilize populations or offset losses stemming from disturbances 2 methods 2 1 collection methods vital rate data on individual colonies of orbicella franksi were collected in both east and west flower garden banks from 2011 through 2015 fig 1 while the fgb national marine sanctuary was established in 1992 average percent coral cover for east and west flower garden banks has been recorded since 1974 jackson et al 2014 east and west fgb are approximately 143 4 km2 and approximately 1 85 km2 of that area is coral reef habitat noaa 2020 the east and west fgb reefs are at the crest of salt domes in the gulf of mexico approximately 180 km from the southwest coast of texas minnery et al 1985 empirical data were obtained from maher et al 2018 in which a total of 121 o franksi coral colonies were photographed for five years 2011 2015 and planar projections were drawn digitally and recorded as a representation of colony area cm2 these empirical data were used to estimate annual growth rates of various sized coral colonies no disturbances were seen to impact these colonies during this time while coral populations at these reefs are relatively stable and free from disease in the summer of 2016 a coral mortality event affected parts of east fgb this disturbance was driven by the effects of floodwaters reaching the area in conjunction with localized upwelling ultimately leading to hypoxia johnston et al 2019b 2019a kealoha et al 2020 shore et al 2021 wright et al 2019 doyle et al 2022 as the oceans continue to warm it is likely that fgb like all reefs will face more frequent and severe threats such as hypoxia and bleaching johnston et al 2019a 2 2 matrix population modeling 2 2 1 model terminology and construction five size classes were chosen incorporating current understanding of the model species i e natural history knowledge regarding growth survivorship etc following carson et al 2011 the five size classes identified were small 250 cm2 medium 250 500 cm2 large 500 1000 cm2 x large 1000 2000 cm2 and xx large 2000 cm2 these size classes are broad enough to capture sufficient variability in annual growth rates and narrow enough to capture a range of transition probabilities and sampling error carson et al 2011 transition probabilities are the likelihood a coral will grow or shrink from one size class to another die or stay in the same size class from one time point to the next in this case one year ultimately the chosen size classes result in a relatively even number of colonies in each size class comprising the population projection vector specifically the proportion of the population n 121 in each size class was derived from the corresponding values in the dominant right eigenvector after the population converged on the stable stage distribution terms defined below matrix population projection models are a subset of demographic models that describe vital rates such as the probability of surviving and remaining in a given age or stage class caswell 2001 when the elements in a given population projection matrix describe the probability of growing or shrinking among various age classes within a given period of time e g from age 1 to age 2 they are known as leslie matrices leslie 1945 when probabilities such as in this study describe transitioning from one life stage to another they are called lefkovitch matrices fig 2 lefkovich 1965 in corals age does not relate to as many biological characteristics as size and thus for corals a size based lefkovitch population projection matrix was developed as in vardi 2012 lirman 2003 and others using linear algebra the dominant eigenvalue and the associated right and left eigenvectors of the population projection matrix can be calculated from a biological standpoint the dominant eigenvalue is the finite rate of increase or population growth rate the right eigenvector is the stable stage distribution or proportion of the population in each size class and the left eigenvector contains the corresponding reproductive value of each size class caswell 2001 lirman 2003 the population projection vector contains the number of individuals in each of the size classes when the population projection matrix is multiplied by the population projection vector it yields the population size in the next time step and by iterating this process estimates of the population size growth rate and stable stage distribution are generated stubben and milligan 2007 using the empirical vital rate data collected from 2011 to 2015 four population projection matrices were created to represent annual changes among size classes from 2011 to 2012 2012 to 2013 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 using the equation nt 1 a x nt where a is the population projection matrix estimated for each time step i e year nt is the number of individuals in year t and nt 1 is the number of individuals in year t 1 from these four annual population projection matrices i e a01 a12 a23 and a34 a single mean population projection matrix was calculated this generated a mean se value for each of the elements comprising a single population projection matrix spanning the five year period of time for which empirical vital rate data were available i e from 2011 to 2015 from this aggregate mean population projection matrix spanning from 2011 to 2015 the long term population growth rate i e lambda was calculated as described above the dominant right eigenvector of the mean population projection matrix provided estimates of the proportion of the population in each size class these values were combined with the empirical data describing the actual number of individuals in each size class in 2015 to forecast the total population size annually from 2016 to the year 2050 focusing results and discussion on the population in the years 2030 and 2050 elasticity analyses were conducted on the mean population projection matrix to assess the relative importance of the individual vital rates growth survivorship to the population growth rate i e λ elasticities measure the proportional sensitivity of λ to proportional perturbations in the individual matrix elements aij caswell 2001 elasticity was calculated as 1 e i j a i j λ s i j where sij is the sensitivity matrix sij was calculated as 2 s i j v i w j w v where v is the dominant left eigenvector of a i e the reproductive values of each size class w is the dominant right eigenvector of a i e stable stage distribution or proportion of the population in each of the five size classes w v is the scalar product of the right and left eigenvectors v i is the ith element of v and w j is the jth element of w six different scenarios were simulated to forecast size class structures 35 years into the future equivalent to the year 2050 baseline mild disturbance severe disturbance restoration mild disturbance with restoration and severe disturbance with restoration detailed descriptions below table 1 the empirically derived number of individuals in each size class in 2015 was the initial population vector used to simulate future population sizes to estimate the mean areal coverage of o franksi in the future years the mean size of individual colonies within each size class in 2015 was calculated from the empirical data these mean sizes were used to convert number of individual colonies in each size class to areal coverage 2 2 2 baseline scenario using the mean matrix calculated from empirical data the population size was estimated annually from 2016 to 2050 starting with the number of individuals per size class in 2015 i e the last year empirical data are available table 1 2 2 3 disturbance simulation scenarios in order to simulate ecological disturbances on coral reefs of the east and west fgb two population projection matrices were created to represent two potential disturbance regimes experienced in nature one mild and one severe the mild disturbance scenario is representative of a chronic low level stressor with limited mortality 5 while the severe disturbance scenario is representative of a large mortality event 25 values used in these disturbance scenarios are derived from empirical results found in the primary literature and all of the disturbance scenarios simulated here are bounded by disturbance related mortality documented in the same or taxonomically similar coral species inhabiting tropical reef systems de ath et al 2012 altieri et al 2017 hughes et al 2018c bruno et al 2019 johnston et al 2019b the mild disturbance scenario was simulated by perturbing the empirical population data by inducing 20 areal loss and 5 mortality annually e g reducing the size of each individual by 20 and randomly removing 5 of individuals table 1 chronic but relatively mild heat stress or certain diseases could account for the simulated mild disturbance i e these stressors have resulted in 5 mortality and 20 decrease in coral cover glynn 1993 bidegain and paul pont 2018 hughes et al 2018a bruno et al 2019 individuals that experienced mortality within each size class were randomly selected from the data frame mortality across size classes was assumed to be similar to estimates from neal et al 2017 cover loss was simulated by artificially reducing the empirical data in 2015 by a given percent and calculating a new 2015 2016 transition matrix the disturbance matrix for example an individual colony that was 250 cm2 would be reduced by 20 to 200 cm2 following a mild disturbance the population size structure vector from mild 2016 and the mean mild disturbance matrix calculated from the 2015 and 2016 interval was then iterated to simulate an annual chronic disturbance to explore changes in population size and size structure the future population stage structure was assessed until the year 2050 to simulate the severe disturbance we approximated a hypoxia related i e low dissolved oxygen mass coral mortality event that was documented in the east flower garden banks in 2016 johnston et al 2019b the result of this severe disturbance was a 41 loss of o franksi cover in the affected region johnston et al 2019b using this value a severe disturbance year was simulated by decreasing percent cover for all colonies by 40 and assuming 25 mortality per size class based on orbicella mortality rates documented in hughes et al 2018a the population size structure vector produced from severe 2016 and the ensuing matrix calculated from the 2015 to 2016 time interval was used to project population size one year into the future following a mass mortality event this simulates a decrease in both colony size and number of individuals for one year after the severe disturbance previous studies of o franksi have shown growth rates following disturbance return to pre disturbance levels in less than 2 years neal et al 2017 therefore following the major disturbance and based on the frequency of major disturbances in the region the major disturbance was followed by five years of potential regrowth during a period without major disturbance neal et al 2017 hughes et al 2018b johnston et al 2019b the five year undisturbed period was simulated by multiplying the population size structure vector following the severe disturbance by the mean population projection matrix derived from the empirical data 2011 2015 together this simulates a major mortality event followed five years of relatively normal period without major disturbance growth rates this severe simulation scenario one year of disturbance followed by five years of normal growth was repeated six times through the year 2050 table 1 the size class structures were compared against the baseline scenario in 2030 and 2050 however it should be noted that this scenario could be an underestimation of coral loss due to other disturbances such as sctld as o franksi is highly susceptible to sctld and colony losses have been reported as high as 88 following the onset of sctld outbreaks in the u s virgin islands muller et al 2020 brandt et al 2021 2 2 4 restoration simulation scenario the restoration simulation scenario assumes an initial period of growth of microfragments in a nursery i e microfragments of o franksi have been growing for 3 years and fused prior to outplanting after fusing colonies attain the area of a single medium size class individual 492 cm 2 in the restoration scenario 30 individual colonies in the medium size class were virtually outplanted each year for six years forsman et al 2015 page et al 2018 to simulate these coral restoration efforts 30 individuals were added to the medium size class class in the population projection vector for six years beginning in 2019 through 2025 a three year lag from 2016 to 2019 was simulated to account for the time it would take to grow the microfragments in a nursery before outplanting the population stage structure vector was multiplied by the mean matrix from the baseline scenario i e assuming normal growth to project the population for 25 iterations from 2025 to 2050 the size class structures from these simulations were compared to the baseline scenario and disturbance scenarios at 2030 and 2050 2 2 5 combined restoration and disturbance scenarios the restoration simulation i e outplanting 30 medium sized colonies for six years was combined with both the mild and severe disturbance scenarios as described above in these combined restoration and disturbance scenarios 30 individuals were added to the medium size class size vector during the 3rd 2019 through 9th 2024 iterations in the severe disturbance scenario with restoration the seventh year 2022 includes a severe disturbance in this instance the severe disturbance matrix described in section 2 2 2 above is multiplied by a population stage structure vector with 30 additional medium size colonies added to the population before the simulated severe disturbance this iteration of the simulation model assumes the outplanting occurred earlier in the year and the severe disturbance event occurred later that same year i e to capture the probability of a major hypoxic or storm event disturbing the region later in the summer johnson et al 2016 neal et al 2017 hughes et al 2018b bruno et al 2019 johnson et al 2019a 2019b 3 results 3 1 baseline scenario the empirical data collected from 2011 to 2015 resulted in a stable population growth rate lambda 1 00 with a relatively even distribution of colonies spread among the five size classes 27 colonies per size class fig 3 table 2 daily growth rates across all size classes ranged from 0 02 cm2 day to 0 26 cm2 day these translated into annual growth rates ranging from as high as 5031 cm2 year to as low as 3084 cm2 year i e some individuals decreased in size the mean colony size within each of the five size classes small 250 cm2 medium 250 500 cm2 large 500 1000 cm2 x large 1000 2000 cm2 and xx large 2000 cm2 was calculated for 2015 small colonies 167 54 cm2 medium colonies 395 78 cm2 large colonies 712 167 cm2 x large colonies 1338 222 cm2 xx large colonies 4222 2774 cm2 note that the population of o franksi is much larger in the fgb than in other locations in the wider caribbean levitan et al 2014 maher et al 2018 elasticity analyses reveal the three largest size classes are the three largest contributors to population growth rate λ and account for 80 of the rate of change in population size table 3 the baseline population projection indicates the size distribution and total abundance of the population would remain stable over time n 136 in 2030 and n 138 in 2050 with a nearly even number of individuals per size class by 2030 table 4 fig 4 and 5 1 3 2 disturbance simulation scenarios the mild disturbance simulation resulted in the loss of six individual colonies from 2015 to 2016 the population matrix from 2015 to 2016 table 5 was then used to project the population size and size structure to the year 2050 these simulations and elasticity analyses indicated the smallest size class i e colonies 250 cm2 was the greatest relative contributors to the population growth rate elasticity 1 0 i e the probability of remaining in the smallest size class further all individuals in the smallest size class remained in the smallest size class table 5 under the mild disturbance scenario the majority of individuals 91 of 112 individuals ended up in the small size class by the year 2030 and all but one individual was in the smallest size class by 2050 114 of 115 individuals fig 4 and 5 1 table 4 furthermore although there were only 22 fewer individual colonies overall in the mild disturbance scenario compared to the baseline scenario because all colonies were in the smallest size class the areal cover was projected to decrease by 90 by the year 2050 under the mild scenario fig 5 2 a and c a severe disturbance matrix was calculated from 2015 to 2016 table 6 the elasticity analysis for severe disturbance also indicated the smallest size class was the greatest relative contributor to population growth rate elasticity 1 0 similar to the mild disturbance all individuals in the smallest size class remained in the smallest size class however additionally all of the x large individuals decreased in size to the large size class table 6 only 71 individuals were projected to remain by 2030 and only 31 colonies remain by 2050 table 4 the severe disturbance scenario projection had 107 fewer colonies predicted by 2050 and approximately seven times lower areal coverage of coral compared to the baseline scenario fig 5 1 and 5 2 a and e 3 3 restoration simulation scenario when restoration was simulated by adding 30 medium size class i e 250 500 cm2 colonies annually for six years it resulted in the number of colonies increasing in all size classes and the total number of colonies increasing from 121 to 267 also the colony size distribution in 2050 remained relatively even across the five size classes table 4 this simulated restoration scenario increased total coral cover by approximately 50 by the year 2050 fig 4 and 5 2 3 4 combined disturbance and restoration scenarios when restoration was simulated 30 medium individuals added annually for six years along with the mild disturbance scenario there were 297 colonies by 2030 with the majority of individuals in the small size class 231 individuals of 297 the number of individuals was consistent but by 2050 only two individuals remained in the medium size class and the rest of the individuals were small 295 of 297 individuals table 4 implementing restoration increased areal coverage under the mild disturbance scenario by 160 fig 5 2 while there were more individuals in 2050 under the combined mild disturbance and restoration scenario than the restoration scenario with no disturbance the non disturbed scenario had 5x more areal coverage due to the mean size of individuals per size class fig 5 the same restoration scenario simulated with severe disturbance resulted in 183 total individuals by 2030 with the majority of colonies in the small size class n 118 in 2050 69 individuals remained with about half of the colonies in the small size class n 35 fig 4 restoration increased the areal coverage under the severe disturbance scenario by 110 in 2050 with half of the areal coverage contributed by xx large o franksi colonies however this was still only 25 of the combined areal coral coverage projected compared to the baseline projection scenario estimated areal coverage was almost equivalent comparing the severe and mild disturbance scenarios with restoration 50 043 cm2 and 50 439 cm2 respectively however almost all coverage was due to small individuals in the mild disturbance restoration scenario while the smallest size class contributed only 12 of coral cover in the severe disturbance restoration scenario fig 5 2 4 discussion 4 1 comparing mild and sever scenarios this study assessed how coral restoration may interact with and potentially offset the effects of mild and severe ecological disturbances from 2011 to 2015 the o franksi population on the east and west fgb was relatively stable however under a simulated mild disturbance scenario by 2030 78 of individuals were predicted to be in the small size class and 99 of colonies were projected to be in the small size class by 2050 populations exhibiting such a downward trend may be headed towards extinction riegl et al 2017 even though the population is not experiencing a loss of individual colonies under this scenario their estimated areal coverage greatly decreased over time with or without restoration however two times the amount of areal coverage was projected when active coral restoration is implemented while the number of individuals projected by the year 2050 is higher in the mild disturbance with restoration scenario than in the restoration scenario alone the areal coverage is approximately six times less this suggests more frequent restoration may be necessary to combat coral loss in regions that are chronically disturbed our findings also indicate that when using a modelling technique that relies on data describing the number of individuals it is essential to consider colony size distribution as well as areal coverage in the severe scenario five years of normal population dynamics appear to benefit larger individuals and allow the colonies a chance to recover i e increase in size during non disturbance periods compared to the mild disturbance with restoration scenario the severe disturbance with restoration scenario saw a drastic loss of individuals overall furthermore by the year 2030 64 of all individuals were small 250 cm2 aerial coverage was projected to be similar in both disturbance with restoration scenarios but almost half of the coral cover in the severe disturbance with restoration scenario was due to xx large individuals and all individuals in the mild restoration scenario were small similar to the mild restoration scenario hurricanes have been shown promote asexual reproduction through fragmentation mirroring this trend foster et al 2007 2013 however if the surviving individuals in the severe disturbance scenarios are larger they may also have the ability to produce more gametes or fragments to create new colonies highsmith 1982 davies et al 2017 local retention of coral larvae plays an important role in the persistence of coral metapopulations in the fgb limer et al 2020 under a more severe but less frequent disturbance regime the restoration simulated here appears to enable the population to have a distribution of individuals in each size class more similar to a non disturbed population however the loss of areal coverage due to these simulated severe disturbance events could not be counteracted by the restoration scenario number of individuals and areal coverage do not always correlate fig 5 model results suggest more individuals or more frequent outplantings would be necessary to offset either disturbance regime indicating that restoration is by no means a replacement for preservation particularly on reefs such as east and west fgb with unusually large colonies the loss of a few of these large individuals has a disproportionate effect on areal coverage fig 5 ultimately because these corals grow slowly groves et al 2018 disturbance events followed by restoration are unlikely to replicate the current size distribution under both simulated disturbance scenarios there was a loss of colonies and a shift in the population structure to smaller colonies both of which result in a loss in projected areal coverage fig 5 table 4 while restoration did provide additional individuals and prevent some coverage loss the population was still substantially impacted by the disturbances compared to the non disturbed population projections fig 5 table 4 the o franksi population in fgb was relatively stable from 2011 to 2015 and there was an even distribution among size classes when projected to 2050 with no restoration or disturbance events there was an additional 17 individuals and a slight increase in areal coverage forecasted however when even a mild disturbance was simulated annually the population shifted to mainly small individuals by the year 2030 by 2050 while there were only 16 fewer individuals remaining compared to the baseline projection the areal coverage was 3 5x less fig 5 with sea surface temperatures continuing to rise and disease increasing among many coral populations severe years of disturbance will likely become more common dee et al 2019 manzello et al 2021 in the future a severe disturbance event could be caused by these increases in temperature impacts from extreme storms and or shifts in the location or areal extent of the gulf of mexico dead zone rabalais et al 2002 turner et al 2008 rabalais and turner 2019 when comparing mild and severe disturbance scenarios areal coverage in 2050 is relatively similar whereas size class structure is not this discrepancy could be due to annual or chronic stress leading to less mortality but many individuals being continually fragmented also this could be a result specific to populations with very extremely large individuals 2000 cm2 such as fgb this mild scenario could still lead to a loss of the majority of highly reproductive individuals while the small corals in fgb may be able to retain enough areal coverage to persist over time the ability to serve as a source population would be jeopardized under either scenario davies et al 2017 overall both disturbance scenarios similarly alter which size class contributes the most to population growth rate from the largest size classes to the smallest size class elasticity 1 0 small small transition for both the mild and severe disturbance table 3 4 2 disturbances in flower garden banks east and west flower garden banks have had relatively few large disturbances in the past jackson et al 2014 however disturbances appear to be increasing from 1972 when the first quantitative benthic assessment occurred to 1997 three hurricanes impacted the region but only one reported bleaching event occurred jackson et al 2014 in 2005 a coral bleaching event coral disease event and two hurricanes affected parts of fgb from 1998 through 2016 four coral bleaching events were reported two of which were during years with high hurricane activity jackson et al 2014 johnston et al 2019a past disturbance events ranged in severity and total coral loss or mortality was not reported or calculated for the majority of disturbances in this region aside from 2016 jackson et al 2014 davies et al 2017 johnston et al 2019b furthermore disease ocean warming and deoxygenation may be compounding increasing the intensity and frequency of disturbances de ath et al 2012 hughes et al 2018b 2018c brandt et al 2021 due to these factors anticipating disturbances is difficult in the region but simulations can be used to elucidate potential size structure shifts of corals following these events long term monitoring is crucial to assess demographic shifts and cannot be done with coral cover data alone edmunds and riegl 2020 flower garden banks has been identified as a possible refugium for o franksi and as a potential source population for lower caribbean reefs davies et al 2017 limer et al 2020 orbicella franksi has been shown to have relatively long pelagic larval durations pld allowing them to seed distant reefs under favorable conditions however dispersal can be highly variable and is greatly impacted by disturbances and overall stress davies et al 2017 with climate change shifting currents pld may become an important factor in retaining connectivity among reefs levin 2006 davies et al 2017 the loss of large individuals which greatly decreases areal coverage concomitantly decreases the number of gametes produced loya et al 2001 levitan et al 2014 further massive corals that have bleached or experienced thermal stress have also been shown to produce fewer gametes or have lower fecundity following a disturbance levitan et al 2014 riegl and purkis 2015 our forecasts suggest large individuals that can reproduce via fragmentation and have large areal coverage and thus release more gametes disappear in the mild disturbance scenario and the number of all individuals decrease in the severe scenario preventing bleaching disease and other damage is always the preferred management strategy however restoration efforts can be used to help offset some losses the restoration of massive corals through microfragmentation is becoming more common bostrom einarsson et al 2018 by restoring massive species especially in a source population multiple reefs can benefit from restoration efforts large scale coral restoration projects such as the reef restoration and adaptation program in australia or the mission iconic reefs in the florida keys are propagating massive corals using various propagation methods e g larval micro fragmentation regardless of methodology chosen for propagation restoration of massive corals is still experimental many variables e g size density or genotypic diversity of outplants can be manipulated and understanding demography through modeling approaches such as in this study is essential to assessing the success of restoration and adapting restoration plans accordingly here restoration not combined with disturbance increased projected areal coverage by approximately 50 with the majority of areal coverage being comprised of xx large individuals this simulation highlighted how restoration can enhance stable populations and increase individuals across size classes however most coral populations do not remain this stable downs et al 2002 mora et al 2011 de ath et al 2012 anticipating how effective restoration is under changing disturbance regimes is important when choosing restoration strategies as well as how often it needs to occur for certain reefs 4 3 modelling demography of corals demographic assessments of corals can also be done in regions like the florida keys that appear to be increasingly impacted by disturbance events leading to severe loss of cover and more recent data can be used to determine if certain reefs or areas are more at risk than others specifically in the florida keys sctld is leading to large losses of coral cover in the lower caribbean and is difficult to treat muller et al 2020 brandt et al 2021 incorporating demographic assessments such as this one into future studies of sctld could elucidate which size classes are most at risk provide insights into population stability and quantify how growth rates are affected edmunds 2015 further when attempting to predict and understand the effects of future disturbance intensity and frequency running multiple scenarios can help bound the truth by elucidating the upper and lower bounds of potential impacts given that contribution to population growth rate i e elasticity decreases with size of colony table 3 keeping corals in a nursery to enable them to grow into larger size classes before outplanting should be weighed against the expense of doing so this is a perennial balancing act that land based nurseries focused on coral restoration are faced with cost of coral reef restoration is highly variable estimates range 6 000 4 000 000 usd per hectare and dependent on restoration strategy bayraktarov et al 2019 research on increasing coral growth in early life stages may improve the efficiency of restoration using land based facilities or microfragmentation by modelling disturbance with restoration in other populations similarities and differences between populations and species can help highlight which species may be best to restore in certain regions to support reef function and services moberg and rönnbäck 2003 barbier et al 2011 edmunds and riegl 2020 projection matrices allow managers to simulate and compare various potential restoration regimes and predict how the current population of corals may respond this in turn can create more targeted and efficient restoration strategies and lead to more effective management constraints exist with this type of modelling such as accurately predicting the severity or frequency of future disturbance regimes bleaching is a particularly difficult disturbance to model as its effects are not equivalent to coral mortality or cover loss hughes et al 2018c if colonies are not measured prior to and following an actual disturbance creating a completely realistic and accurate transition matrix is not possible further disease extreme storms and bleaching lead to variable tissue loss as well as mortality neal et al 2017 hughes et al 2018c muller et al 2020 in this study size class structure is projected out to 2050 to compare the estimated populations under these two scenarios but within the projection period more variance is likely here coral cover is estimated based on the average size of a colony within each size class but to more accurately predict coral cover other forecasting methods should be incorporated in future studies vercelloni et al 2020 furthermore with respect to coral restoration and the application of matrix population models more accurate simulations will require conducting in situ experiments to quantify the response of outplanted corals to disturbances and compare those to both outplanted and natural corals in undisturbed regions 4 4 future directions from a biological standpoint data describing egg reproduction of closely related o annularis exist e g van veghel and bak 1994 however empirical studies translating these into fecundity or fertility i e fecundity accounting for annual survival and documenting successful recruitment in situ are incredibly rare edmunds 2015 for example over a 16 year study of o annularis in jamaica only one 1 recruit was ever found hughes and tanner 2000 together the lack of key vital rate data describing the number of offspring produced each year via sexual reproduction of genus orbicella suggest more studies are required on coral recruitment and together these knowledge gaps contribute to there being no stock recruitment relationships for any coral species holstein et al 2022 increased monitoring following disturbances in specific regions for multiple species is the best way to ensure realistic mortality and cover loss are used in simulations although obvious it also bears noting that the more realistic the simulations of the disturbances are and the larger the amount of empirical data the more realistic the projections of the population will be edmunds 2015 future studies should consider longer term annual sampling from ecologically connected reefs eventually this would allow for real disturbances to be captured during sampling events creating an empirical disturbance matrix that can be projected into the future as well as allow comparisons among populations further long term monitoring following restoration in concert with advancing photogrammetry would be helpful for creating additional population projection matrices and increasing the accuracy of projections that can be used to project how restored individuals will grow into the future dee et al 2019 multiple species of reef building corals are considered threatened with some populations specifically at risk of extinction such as those in the florida keys mora et al 2011 national marine fisheries service 2016 page et al 2018 as corals continue to be impacted by disturbances and repaired by restoration determining how restored communities grow differently than natural communities especially under dynamic disturbance regimes will be important to verify the best restoration strategies bostrom einarsson et al 2018 page et al 2018 assessing the demography of multiple species of reef building corals in a region can help guide which species are best to restore edmunds and riegl 2020 furthermore it can help highlight how corals are adapting or not adapting to shifts in the environment riegl and purkis 2015 hughes et al 2018c bruno et al 2019 nelson and altieri 2019 kodera et al 2020 other studies have highlighted the impacts of disturbance on reef building corals and also found a general decrease in colony size that could potentially lead to demographic bottlenecks and other negative effects in addition to coral cover loss hernandez pacheco et al 2011 brandt et al 2013 pisapia et al 2020 mortality among smaller size classes may also be higher in subsequent years or with increasing disturbance frequency and may not be apparent in coral cover surveys alone hernandez pacheco et al 2011 vardi et al 2012 simulations using empirical data following both disturbance and restoration events are necessary to create more realistic projections integrating matrix population models with complementary modelling approaches such as species distribution modelling biophysical modelling of larval dispersal and structural equation models could elucidate shifts in connectivity and identify sites serving as source or sink populations providing a deeper understanding of species persistence davies et al 2017 lewis et al 2021b and how changes in the environment are

24374,disturbances of coral reefs are increasing in frequency intensity and duration these changes will likely result in demographic shifts in many populations of reef building corals with unknown consequences for ongoing coral restoration efforts to address this knowledge gap here we use empirically derived stage based matrix population models to predict how a relatively stable population and areal coverage of orbicella franksi may change under simulated disturbance and restoration scenarios overall simulated restoration outplanting greatly increased the number of o franksi colonies and overall estimated areal coverage when compared to baseline population estimates under a mild disturbance scenario the number of o franksi colonies were projected to decrease by up to 90 by 2050 but simulated restoration was predicted to offset the loss in number of colonies under a severe disturbance scenario the number of o franksi colonies also decreased but simulated restoration efforts were not able to offset colony losses under both disturbance scenarios there was a large projected loss of o franksi areal coverage even when restoration was implemented however restoration prevented a rapid decrease in number of colonies in the severe disturbance scenario these findings highlight the potentially catastrophic effects of disturbances on previously stable coral populations and the role restoration can play in mitigating these threats increasing studies focused on widespread ecological and demographic monitoring of disturbed and restored corals will be critical in the development of more effective restoration strategies for conserving these threatened species in an uncertain future keywords coral reefs demography disturbance matrix population models orbicella

ecosystems keister et al 2000 schmidtko et al 2017 raven et al 2020 in many instances the rate of change of environmental conditions can occur faster than species can adapt leading to a loss of biodiversity and ultimately loss of ecosystem functions and services hooper et al 2005 harley 2011 cook et al 2014 benthic species unable to shift their spatial distribution at rates similar to shifts occurring in the environment are at higher risk of population decline as compared to relatively mobile species levin 2006 atkins and travis 2010 harley 2011 lewis et al 2021a while many sessile marine species have a larval dispersal stage as part of their life history such larval stages are relatively passive compared to advective forces and largely reliant on ocean currents to transport them to more favorable habitat after the larvae of some of these species settle they grow to create complex biogenic habitat serving as foundation species that support a diversity of organisms ellison et al 2005 slattery et al 2011 van katwijk et al 2016 foundation species play a critical role in structuring and supporting complex marine ecosystems and their loss can result in severe negative effects on higher trophic levels ellison et al 2005 duke et al 2007 van katwijk et al 2016 stony corals the foundation species of coral reef ecosystems are highly imperiled by climate change bindoff et al 2019 maher et al 2020 these species vary in geographic range and life history strategies but in terms of survivorship many can only survive within a relatively narrow range of water temperature and light availability a degree or two increase in temperature can lead to massive coral bleaching events glynn 1993 baird et al 2018 hughes et al 2018c extreme coral bleaching events used to occur relatively infrequently but now are predicted to occur every six years globally hughes et al 2018b due to these myriad threats tropical coral cover loss is estimated at 50 75 globally de ath et al 2012 hughes et al 2018b bruno et al 2019 additional threats to corals include hypoxic events disease outbreaks algal overgrowth severe storms and predation all of which may pressure a population simultaneously bruno et al 2007 de ath et al 2012 glynn et al 2020 further the increase in prevalence of diseases namely stony coral tissue loss disease sctld has led to extreme colony loss of highly susceptible corals and is spreading rapidly in many regions muller et al 2020 brandt et al 2021 these compounding and interacting factors make determining the true driver of coral loss and mortality complicated together disturbances e g extreme storms and hypoxic events have resulted in coral cover losses ranging from 5 to 60 hughes et al 2018c 2018b 2018a johnston et al 2019b while coral reef systems have evolved mechanisms to recover from natural disturbances the frequency and magnitude of disturbances in recent years suggests active restoration and conservation efforts will be increasingly important to help sustain and ensure these foundation species continue to exist in nature glynn 1993 slattery et al 2011 bostrom einarsson et al 2018 to combat coral loss the practice of restoration is increasing bostrom einarsson et al 2018 direct interventions including restoration along with natural and assisted adaptation are now considered necessary for corals and coral reefs to survive the climate crisis nasem 2019 to date coral reef restoration has been dominated by coral gardening which involves transplanting coral fragments primarily branching corals following a nursery phase bostrom einarsson et al 2018 in recent years additional restoration techniques have emerged and efforts to restore massive non branching corals such as orbicella franksi have increased augmenting coral species richness on a degraded reef can have multiple synergistic benefits and enhance the resistance and resilience of a reef to bleaching and fragmentation clements and hay 2021 furthermore massive corals increase the physical stability of the reef structure bostrom einarsson et al 2018 and can contribute substantially to reef accretion however it remains unclear how restoration of massive corals impacts population growth rates and how effective restoration may be at mitigating colony losses caused by disturbances to address this knowledge gap size structured matrix population models were developed for o franksi

collected within the boundaries of the flower garden banks fgb were used to forecast demographic shifts in o franksi population structure under different scenarios simulating future disturbance regimes and restoration scenarios due to the relative paucity of coral vital rate data demographic models have been underutilized in coral reef ecology edmunds 2019 edmunds and riegl 2020 yet when vital rate data are available these models provide a powerful means to understand the effects of various ecological disturbances on population growth and simultaneously provide a means to predict how potential restoration strategies may be best used to help sustain these species over time hernandez pacheco et al 2011 bostrom einarsson et al 2018 edmunds and riegl 2020 this study uses a combination of size structured matrix population models elasticity analyses and simulation modeling to answer fundamental questions regarding the demographic consequences of disturbance and restoration for o franksi a dominant reef building coral in the wider caribbean johnston et al 2016 through these analyses three questions were assessed 1 what is the size class structure of an orbicella franksi population during a period with no reported disturbances or restoration efforts 2 how do mild and severe disturbances impact size class structure relative to the baseline scenario by the years 2030 and 2050 3 does restoration stabilize populations or offset losses stemming from disturbances 2 methods 2 1 collection methods vital rate data on individual colonies of orbicella franksi were collected in both east and west flower garden banks from 2011 through 2015 fig 1 while the fgb national marine sanctuary was established in 1992 average percent coral cover for east and west flower garden banks has been recorded since 1974 jackson et al 2014 east and west fgb are approximately 143 4 km2 and approximately 1 85 km2 of that area is coral reef habitat noaa 2020 the east and west fgb reefs are at the crest of salt domes in the gulf of mexico approximately 180 km from the southwest coast of texas minnery et al 1985 empirical data were obtained from maher et al 2018 in which a total of 121 o franksi coral colonies were photographed for five years 2011 2015 and planar projections were drawn digitally and recorded as a representation of colony area cm2 these empirical data were used to estimate annual growth rates of various sized coral colonies no disturbances were seen to impact these colonies during this time while coral populations at these reefs are relatively stable and free from disease in the summer of 2016 a coral mortality event affected parts of east fgb this disturbance was driven by the effects of floodwaters reaching the area in conjunction with localized upwelling ultimately leading to hypoxia johnston et al 2019b 2019a kealoha et al 2020 shore et al 2021 wright et al 2019 doyle et al 2022 as the oceans continue to warm it is likely that fgb like all reefs will face more frequent and severe threats such as hypoxia and bleaching johnston et al 2019a 2 2 matrix population modeling 2 2 1 model terminology and construction five size classes were chosen incorporating current understanding of the model species i e natural history knowledge regarding growth survivorship etc following carson et al 2011 the five size classes identified were small 250 cm2 medium 250 500 cm2 large 500 1000 cm2 x large 1000 2000 cm2 and xx large 2000 cm2 these size classes are broad enough to capture sufficient variability in annual growth rates and narrow enough to capture a range of transition probabilities and sampling error carson et al 2011 transition probabilities are the likelihood a coral will grow or shrink from one size class to another die or stay in the same size class from one time point to the next in this case one year ultimately the chosen size classes result in a relatively even number of colonies in each size class comprising the population projection vector specifically the proportion of the population n 121 in each size class was derived from the corresponding values in the dominant right eigenvector after the population converged on the stable stage distribution terms defined below matrix population projection models are a subset of demographic models that describe vital rates such as the probability of surviving and remaining in a given age or stage class caswell 2001 when the elements in a given population projection matrix describe the probability of growing or shrinking among various age classes within a given period of time e g from age 1 to age 2 they are known as leslie matrices leslie 1945 when probabilities such as in this study describe transitioning from one life stage to another they are called lefkovitch matrices fig 2 lefkovich 1965 in corals age does not relate to as many biological characteristics as size and thus for corals a size based lefkovitch population projection matrix was developed as in vardi 2012 lirman 2003 and others using linear algebra the dominant eigenvalue and the associated right and left eigenvectors of the population projection matrix can be calculated from a biological standpoint the dominant eigenvalue is the finite rate of increase or population growth rate the right eigenvector is the stable stage distribution or proportion of the population in each size class and the left eigenvector contains the corresponding reproductive value of each size class caswell 2001 lirman 2003 the population projection vector contains the number of individuals in each of the size classes when the population projection matrix is multiplied by the population projection vector it yields the population size in the next time step and by iterating this process estimates of the population size growth rate and stable stage distribution are generated stubben and milligan 2007 using the empirical vital rate data collected from 2011 to 2015 four population projection matrices were created to represent annual changes among size classes from 2011 to 2012 2012 to 2013 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 using the equation nt 1 a x nt where a is the population projection matrix estimated for each time step i e year nt is the number of individuals in year t and nt 1 is the number of individuals in year t 1 from these four annual population projection matrices i e a01 a12 a23 and a34 a single mean population projection matrix was calculated this generated a mean se value for each of the elements comprising a single population projection matrix spanning the five year period of time for which empirical vital rate data were available i e from 2011 to 2015 from this aggregate mean population projection matrix spanning from 2011 to 2015 the long term population growth rate i e lambda was calculated as described above the dominant right eigenvector of the mean population projection matrix provided estimates of the proportion of the population in each size class these values were combined with the empirical data describing the actual number of individuals in each size class in 2015 to forecast the total population size annually from 2016 to the year 2050 focusing results and discussion on the population in the years 2030 and 2050 elasticity analyses were conducted on the mean population projection matrix to assess the relative importance of the individual vital rates growth survivorship to the population growth rate i e λ elasticities measure the proportional sensitivity of λ to proportional perturbations in the individual matrix elements aij caswell 2001 elasticity was calculated as 1 e i j a i j λ s i j where sij is the sensitivity matrix sij was calculated as 2 s i j v i w j w v where v is the dominant left eigenvector of a i e the reproductive values of each size class w is the dominant right eigenvector of a i e stable stage distribution or proportion of the population in each of the five size classes w v is the scalar product of the right and left eigenvectors v i is the ith element of v and w j is the jth element of w six different scenarios were simulated to forecast size class structures 35 years into the future equivalent to the year 2050 baseline mild disturbance severe disturbance restoration mild disturbance with restoration and severe disturbance with restoration detailed descriptions below table 1 the empirically derived number of individuals in each size class in 2015 was the initial population vector used to simulate future population sizes to estimate the mean areal coverage of o franksi in the future years the mean size of individual colonies within each size class in 2015 was calculated from the empirical data these mean sizes were used to convert number of individual colonies in each size class to areal coverage 2 2 2 baseline scenario using the mean matrix calculated from empirical data the population size was estimated annually from 2016 to 2050 starting with the number of individuals per size class in 2015 i e the last year empirical data are available table 1 2 2 3 disturbance simulation scenarios in order to simulate ecological disturbances on coral reefs of the east and west fgb two population projection matrices were created to represent two potential disturbance regimes experienced in nature one mild and one severe the mild disturbance scenario is representative of a chronic low level stressor with limited mortality 5 while the severe disturbance scenario is representative of a large mortality event 25 values used in these disturbance scenarios are derived from empirical results found in the primary literature and all of the disturbance scenarios simulated here are bounded by disturbance related mortality documented in the same or taxonomically similar coral species inhabiting tropical reef systems de ath et al 2012 altieri et al 2017 hughes et al 2018c bruno et al 2019 johnston et al 2019b the mild disturbance scenario was simulated by perturbing the empirical population data by inducing 20 areal loss and 5 mortality annually e g reducing the size of each individual by 20 and randomly removing 5 of individuals table 1 chronic but relatively mild heat stress or certain diseases could account for the simulated mild disturbance i e these stressors have resulted in 5 mortality and 20 decrease in coral cover glynn 1993 bidegain and paul pont 2018 hughes et al 2018a bruno et al 2019 individuals that experienced mortality within each size class were randomly selected from the data frame mortality across size classes was assumed to be similar to estimates from neal et al 2017 cover loss was simulated by artificially reducing the empirical data in 2015 by a given percent and calculating a new 2015 2016 transition matrix the disturbance matrix for example an individual colony that was 250 cm2 would be reduced by 20 to 200 cm2 following a mild disturbance the population size structure vector from mild 2016 and the mean mild disturbance matrix calculated from the 2015 and 2016 interval was then iterated to simulate an annual chronic disturbance to explore changes in population size and size structure the future population stage structure was assessed until the year 2050 to simulate the severe disturbance we approximated a hypoxia related i e low dissolved oxygen mass coral mortality event that was documented in the east flower garden banks in 2016 johnston et al 2019b the result of this severe disturbance was a 41 loss of o franksi cover in the affected region johnston et al 2019b using this value a severe disturbance year was simulated by decreasing percent cover for all colonies by 40 and assuming 25 mortality per size class based on orbicella mortality rates documented in hughes et al 2018a the population size structure vector produced from severe 2016 and the ensuing matrix calculated from the 2015 to 2016 time interval was used to project population size one year into the future following a mass mortality event this simulates a decrease in both colony size and number of individuals for one year after the severe disturbance previous studies of o franksi have shown growth rates following disturbance return to pre disturbance levels in less than 2 years neal et al 2017 therefore following the major disturbance and based on the frequency of major disturbances in the region the major disturbance was followed by five years of potential regrowth during a period without major disturbance neal et al 2017 hughes et al 2018b johnston et al 2019b the five year undisturbed period was simulated by multiplying the population size structure vector following the severe disturbance by the mean population projection matrix derived from the empirical data 2011 2015 together this simulates a major mortality event followed five years of relatively normal period without major disturbance growth rates this severe simulation scenario one year of disturbance followed by five years of normal growth was repeated six times through the year 2050 table 1 the size class structures were compared against the baseline scenario in 2030 and 2050 however it should be noted that this scenario could be an underestimation of coral loss due to other disturbances such as sctld as o franksi is highly susceptible to sctld and colony losses have been reported as high as 88 following the onset of sctld outbreaks in the u s virgin islands muller et al 2020 brandt et al 2021 2 2 4 restoration simulation scenario the restoration simulation scenario assumes an initial period of growth of microfragments in a nursery i e microfragments of o franksi have been growing for 3 years and fused prior to outplanting after fusing colonies attain the area of a single medium size class individual 492 cm 2 in the restoration scenario 30 individual colonies in the medium size class were virtually outplanted each year for six years forsman et al 2015 page et al 2018 to simulate these coral restoration efforts 30 individuals were added to the medium size class class in the population projection vector for six years beginning in 2019 through 2025 a three year lag from 2016 to 2019 was simulated to account for the time it would take to grow the microfragments in a nursery before outplanting the population stage structure vector was multiplied by the mean matrix from the baseline scenario i e assuming normal growth to project the population for 25 iterations from 2025 to 2050 the size class structures from these simulations were compared to the baseline scenario and disturbance scenarios at 2030 and 2050 2 2 5 combined restoration and disturbance scenarios the restoration simulation i e outplanting 30 medium sized colonies for six years was combined with both the mild and severe disturbance scenarios as described above in these combined restoration and disturbance scenarios 30 individuals were added to the medium size class size vector during the 3rd 2019 through 9th 2024 iterations in the severe disturbance scenario with restoration the seventh year 2022 includes a severe disturbance in this instance the severe disturbance matrix described in section 2 2 2 above is multiplied by a population stage structure vector with 30 additional medium size colonies added to the population before the simulated severe disturbance this iteration of the simulation model assumes the outplanting occurred earlier in the year and the severe disturbance event occurred later that same year i e to capture the probability of a major hypoxic or storm event disturbing the region later in the summer johnson et al 2016 neal et al 2017 hughes et al 2018b bruno et al 2019 johnson et al 2019a 2019b 3 results 3 1 baseline scenario the empirical data collected from 2011 to 2015 resulted in a stable population growth rate lambda 1 00 with a relatively even distribution of colonies spread among the five size classes 27 colonies per size class fig 3 table 2 daily growth rates across all size classes ranged from 0 02 cm2 day to 0 26 cm2 day these translated into annual growth rates ranging from as high as 5031 cm2 year to as low as 3084 cm2 year i e some individuals decreased in size the mean colony size within each of the five size classes small 250 cm2 medium 250 500 cm2 large 500 1000 cm2 x large 1000 2000 cm2 and xx large 2000 cm2 was calculated for 2015 small colonies 167 54 cm2 medium colonies 395 78 cm2 large colonies 712 167 cm2 x large colonies 1338 222 cm2 xx large colonies 4222 2774 cm2 note that the population of o franksi is much larger in the fgb than in other locations in the wider caribbean levitan et al 2014 maher et al 2018 elasticity analyses reveal the three largest size classes are the three largest contributors to population growth rate λ and account for 80 of the rate of change in population size table 3 the baseline population projection indicates the size distribution and total abundance of the population would remain stable over time n 136 in 2030 and n 138 in 2050 with a nearly even number of individuals per size class by 2030 table 4 fig 4 and 5 1 3 2 disturbance simulation scenarios the mild disturbance simulation resulted in the loss of six individual colonies from 2015 to 2016 the population matrix from 2015 to 2016 table 5 was then used to project the population size and size structure to the year 2050 these simulations and elasticity analyses indicated the smallest size class i e colonies 250 cm2 was the greatest relative contributors to the population growth rate elasticity 1 0 i e the probability of remaining in the smallest size class further all individuals in the smallest size class remained in the smallest size class table 5 under the mild disturbance scenario the majority of individuals 91 of 112 individuals ended up in the small size class by the year 2030 and all but one individual was in the smallest size class by 2050 114 of 115 individuals fig 4 and 5 1 table 4 furthermore although there were only 22 fewer individual colonies overall in the mild disturbance scenario compared to the baseline scenario because all colonies were in the smallest size class the areal cover was projected to decrease by 90 by the year 2050 under the mild scenario fig 5 2 a and c a severe disturbance matrix was calculated from 2015 to 2016 table 6 the elasticity analysis for severe disturbance also indicated the smallest size class was the greatest relative contributor to population growth rate elasticity 1 0 similar to the mild disturbance all individuals in the smallest size class remained in the smallest size class however additionally all of the x large individuals decreased in size to the large size class table 6 only 71 individuals were projected to remain by 2030 and only 31 colonies remain by 2050 table 4 the severe disturbance scenario projection had 107 fewer colonies predicted by 2050 and approximately seven times lower areal coverage of coral compared to the baseline scenario fig 5 1 and 5 2 a and e 3 3 restoration simulation scenario when restoration was simulated by adding 30 medium size class i e 250 500 cm2 colonies annually for six years it resulted in the number of colonies increasing in all size classes and the total number of colonies increasing from 121 to 267 also the colony size distribution in 2050 remained relatively even across the five size classes table 4 this simulated restoration scenario increased total coral cover by approximately 50 by the year 2050 fig 4 and 5 2 3 4 combined disturbance and restoration scenarios when restoration was simulated 30 medium individuals added annually for six years along with the mild disturbance scenario there were 297 colonies by 2030 with the majority of individuals in the small size class 231 individuals of 297 the number of individuals was consistent but by 2050 only two individuals remained in the medium size class and the rest of the individuals were small 295 of 297 individuals table 4 implementing restoration increased areal coverage under the mild disturbance scenario by 160 fig 5 2 while there were more individuals in 2050 under the combined mild disturbance and restoration scenario than the restoration scenario with no disturbance the non disturbed scenario had 5x more areal coverage due to the mean size of individuals per size class fig 5 the same restoration scenario simulated with severe disturbance resulted in 183 total individuals by 2030 with the majority of colonies in the small size class n 118 in 2050 69 individuals remained with about half of the colonies in the small size class n 35 fig 4 restoration increased the areal coverage under the severe disturbance scenario by 110 in 2050 with half of the areal coverage contributed by xx large o franksi colonies however this was still only 25 of the combined areal coral coverage projected compared to the baseline projection scenario estimated areal coverage was almost equivalent comparing the severe and mild disturbance scenarios with restoration 50 043 cm2 and 50 439 cm2 respectively however almost all coverage was due to small individuals in the mild disturbance restoration scenario while the smallest size class contributed only 12 of coral cover in the severe disturbance restoration scenario fig 5 2 4 discussion 4 1 comparing mild and sever scenarios this study assessed how coral restoration may interact with and potentially offset the effects of mild and severe ecological disturbances from 2011 to 2015 the o franksi population on the east and west fgb was relatively stable however under a simulated mild disturbance scenario by 2030 78 of individuals were predicted to be in the small size class and 99 of colonies were projected to be in the small size class by 2050 populations exhibiting such a downward trend may be headed towards extinction riegl et al 2017 even though the population is not experiencing a loss of individual colonies under this scenario their estimated areal coverage greatly decreased over time with or without restoration however two times the amount of areal coverage was projected when active coral restoration is implemented while the number of individuals projected by the year 2050 is higher in the mild disturbance with restoration scenario than in the restoration scenario alone the areal coverage is approximately six times less this suggests more frequent restoration may be necessary to combat coral loss in regions that are chronically disturbed our findings also indicate that when using a modelling technique that relies on data describing the number of individuals it is essential to consider colony size distribution as well as areal coverage in the severe scenario five years of normal population dynamics appear to benefit larger individuals and allow the colonies a chance to recover i e increase in size during non disturbance periods compared to the mild disturbance with restoration scenario the severe disturbance with restoration scenario saw a drastic loss of individuals overall furthermore by the year 2030 64 of all individuals were small 250 cm2 aerial coverage was projected to be similar in both disturbance with restoration scenarios but almost half of the coral cover in the severe disturbance with restoration scenario was due to xx large individuals and all individuals in the mild restoration scenario were small similar to the mild restoration scenario hurricanes have been shown promote asexual reproduction through fragmentation mirroring this trend foster et al 2007 2013 however if the surviving individuals in the severe disturbance scenarios are larger they may also have the ability to produce more gametes or fragments to create new colonies highsmith 1982 davies et al 2017 local retention of coral larvae plays an important role in the persistence of coral metapopulations in the fgb limer et al 2020 under a more severe but less frequent disturbance regime the restoration simulated here appears to enable the population to have a distribution of individuals in each size class more similar to a non disturbed population however the loss of areal coverage due to these simulated severe disturbance events could not be counteracted by the restoration scenario number of individuals and areal coverage do not always correlate fig 5 model results suggest more individuals or more frequent outplantings would be necessary to offset either disturbance regime indicating that restoration is by no means a replacement for preservation particularly on reefs such as east and west fgb with unusually large colonies the loss of a few of these large individuals has a disproportionate effect on areal coverage fig 5 ultimately because these corals grow slowly groves et al 2018 disturbance events followed by restoration are unlikely to replicate the current size distribution under both simulated disturbance scenarios there was a loss of colonies and a shift in the population structure to smaller colonies both of which result in a loss in projected areal coverage fig 5 table 4 while restoration did provide additional individuals and prevent some coverage loss the population was still substantially impacted by the disturbances compared to the non disturbed population projections fig 5 table 4 the o franksi population in fgb was relatively stable from 2011 to 2015 and there was an even distribution among size classes when projected to 2050 with no restoration or disturbance events there was an additional 17 individuals and a slight increase in areal coverage forecasted however when even a mild disturbance was simulated annually the population shifted to mainly small individuals by the year 2030 by 2050 while there were only 16 fewer individuals remaining compared to the baseline projection the areal coverage was 3 5x less fig 5 with sea surface temperatures continuing to rise and disease increasing among many coral populations severe years of disturbance will likely become more common dee et al 2019 manzello et al 2021 in the future a severe disturbance event could be caused by these increases in temperature impacts from extreme storms and or shifts in the location or areal extent of the gulf of mexico dead zone rabalais et al 2002 turner et al 2008 rabalais and turner 2019 when comparing mild and severe disturbance scenarios areal coverage in 2050 is relatively similar whereas size class structure is not this discrepancy could be due to annual or chronic stress leading to less mortality but many individuals being continually fragmented also this could be a result specific to populations with very extremely large individuals 2000 cm2 such as fgb this mild scenario could still lead to a loss of the majority of highly reproductive individuals while the small corals in fgb may be able to retain enough areal coverage to persist over time the ability to serve as a source population would be jeopardized under either scenario davies et al 2017 overall both disturbance scenarios similarly alter which size class contributes the most to population growth rate from the largest size classes to the smallest size class elasticity 1 0 small small transition for both the mild and severe disturbance table 3 4 2 disturbances in flower garden banks east and west flower garden banks have had relatively few large disturbances in the past jackson et al 2014 however disturbances appear to be increasing from 1972 when the first quantitative benthic assessment occurred to 1997 three hurricanes impacted the region but only one reported bleaching event occurred jackson et al 2014 in 2005 a coral bleaching event coral disease event and two hurricanes affected parts of fgb from 1998 through 2016 four coral bleaching events were reported two of which were during years with high hurricane activity jackson et al 2014 johnston et al 2019a past disturbance events ranged in severity and total coral loss or mortality was not reported or calculated for the majority of disturbances in this region aside from 2016 jackson et al 2014 davies et al 2017 johnston et al 2019b furthermore disease ocean warming and deoxygenation may be compounding increasing the intensity and frequency of disturbances de ath et al 2012 hughes et al 2018b 2018c brandt et al 2021 due to these factors anticipating disturbances is difficult in the region but simulations can be used to elucidate potential size structure shifts of corals following these events long term monitoring is crucial to assess demographic shifts and cannot be done with coral cover data alone edmunds and riegl 2020 flower garden banks has been identified as a possible refugium for o franksi and as a potential source population for lower caribbean reefs davies et al 2017 limer et al 2020 orbicella franksi has been shown to have relatively long pelagic larval durations pld allowing them to seed distant reefs under favorable conditions however dispersal can be highly variable and is greatly impacted by disturbances and overall stress davies et al 2017 with climate change shifting currents pld may become an important factor in retaining connectivity among reefs levin 2006 davies et al 2017 the loss of large individuals which greatly decreases areal coverage concomitantly decreases the number of gametes produced loya et al 2001 levitan et al 2014 further massive corals that have bleached or experienced thermal stress have also been shown to produce fewer gametes or have lower fecundity following a disturbance levitan et al 2014 riegl and purkis 2015 our forecasts suggest large individuals that can reproduce via fragmentation and have large areal coverage and thus release more gametes disappear in the mild disturbance scenario and the number of all individuals decrease in the severe scenario preventing bleaching disease and other damage is always the preferred management strategy however restoration efforts can be used to help offset some losses the restoration of massive corals through microfragmentation is becoming more common bostrom einarsson et al 2018 by restoring massive species especially in a source population multiple reefs can benefit from restoration efforts large scale coral restoration projects such as the reef restoration and adaptation program in australia or the mission iconic reefs in the florida keys are propagating massive corals using various propagation methods e g larval micro fragmentation regardless of methodology chosen for propagation restoration of massive corals is still experimental many variables e g size density or genotypic diversity of outplants can be manipulated and understanding demography through modeling approaches such as in this study is essential to assessing the success of restoration and adapting restoration plans accordingly here restoration not combined with disturbance increased projected areal coverage by approximately 50 with the majority of areal coverage being comprised of xx large individuals this simulation highlighted how restoration can enhance stable populations and increase individuals across size classes however most coral populations do not remain this stable downs et al 2002 mora et al 2011 de ath et al 2012 anticipating how effective restoration is under changing disturbance regimes is important when choosing restoration strategies as well as how often it needs to occur for certain reefs 4 3 modelling demography of corals demographic assessments of corals can also be done in regions like the florida keys that appear to be increasingly impacted by disturbance events leading to severe loss of cover and more recent data can be used to determine if certain reefs or areas are more at risk than others specifically in the florida keys sctld is leading to large losses of coral cover in the lower caribbean and is difficult to treat muller et al 2020 brandt et al 2021 incorporating demographic assessments such as this one into future studies of sctld could elucidate which size classes are most at risk provide insights into population stability and quantify how growth rates are affected edmunds 2015 further when attempting to predict and understand the effects of future disturbance intensity and frequency running multiple scenarios can help bound the truth by elucidating the upper and lower bounds of potential impacts given that contribution to population growth rate i e elasticity decreases with size of colony table 3 keeping corals in a nursery to enable them to grow into larger size classes before outplanting should be weighed against the expense of doing so this is a perennial balancing act that land based nurseries focused on coral restoration are faced with cost of coral reef restoration is highly variable estimates range 6 000 4 000 000 usd per hectare and dependent on restoration strategy bayraktarov et al 2019 research on increasing coral growth in early life stages may improve the efficiency of restoration using land based facilities or microfragmentation by modelling disturbance with restoration in other populations similarities and differences between populations and species can help highlight which species may be best to restore in certain regions to support reef function and services moberg and rönnbäck 2003 barbier et al 2011 edmunds and riegl 2020 projection matrices allow managers to simulate and compare various potential restoration regimes and predict how the current population of corals may respond this in turn can create more targeted and efficient restoration strategies and lead to more effective management constraints exist with this type of modelling such as accurately predicting the severity or frequency of future disturbance regimes bleaching is a particularly difficult disturbance to model as its effects are not equivalent to coral mortality or cover loss hughes et al 2018c if colonies are not measured prior to and following an actual disturbance creating a completely realistic and accurate transition matrix is not possible further disease extreme storms and bleaching lead to variable tissue loss as well as mortality neal et al 2017 hughes et al 2018c muller et al 2020 in this study size class structure is projected out to 2050 to compare the estimated populations under these two scenarios but within the projection period more variance is likely here coral cover is estimated based on the average size of a colony within each size class but to more accurately predict coral cover other forecasting methods should be incorporated in future studies vercelloni et al 2020 furthermore with respect to coral restoration and the application of matrix population models more accurate simulations will require conducting in situ experiments to quantify the response of outplanted corals to disturbances and compare those to both outplanted and natural corals in undisturbed regions 4 4 future directions from a biological standpoint data describing egg reproduction of closely related o annularis exist e g van veghel and bak 1994 however empirical studies translating these into fecundity or fertility i e fecundity accounting for annual survival and documenting successful recruitment in situ are incredibly rare edmunds 2015 for example over a 16 year study of o annularis in jamaica only one 1 recruit was ever found hughes and tanner 2000 together the lack of key vital rate data describing the number of offspring produced each year via sexual reproduction of genus orbicella suggest more studies are required on coral recruitment and together these knowledge gaps contribute to there being no stock recruitment relationships for any coral species holstein et al 2022 increased monitoring following disturbances in specific regions for multiple species is the best way to ensure realistic mortality and cover loss are used in simulations although obvious it also bears noting that the more realistic the simulations of the disturbances are and the larger the amount of empirical data the more realistic the projections of the population will be edmunds 2015 future studies should consider longer term annual sampling from ecologically connected reefs eventually this would allow for real disturbances to be captured during sampling events creating an empirical disturbance matrix that can be projected into the future as well as allow comparisons among populations further long term monitoring following restoration in concert with advancing photogrammetry would be helpful for creating additional population projection matrices and increasing the accuracy of projections that can be used to project how restored individuals will grow into the future dee et al 2019 multiple species of reef building corals are considered threatened with some populations specifically at risk of extinction such as those in the florida keys mora et al 2011 national marine fisheries service 2016 page et al 2018 as corals continue to be impacted by disturbances and repaired by restoration determining how restored communities grow differently than natural communities especially under dynamic disturbance regimes will be important to verify the best restoration strategies bostrom einarsson et al 2018 page et al 2018 assessing the demography of multiple species of reef building corals in a region can help guide which species are best to restore edmunds and riegl 2020 furthermore it can help highlight how corals are adapting or not adapting to shifts in the environment riegl and purkis 2015 hughes et al 2018c bruno et al 2019 nelson and altieri 2019 kodera et al 2020 other studies have highlighted the impacts of disturbance on reef building corals and also found a general decrease in colony size that could potentially lead to demographic bottlenecks and other negative effects in addition to coral cover loss hernandez pacheco et al 2011 brandt et al 2013 pisapia et al 2020 mortality among smaller size classes may also be higher in subsequent years or with increasing disturbance frequency and may not be apparent in coral cover surveys alone hernandez pacheco et al 2011 vardi et al 2012 simulations using empirical data following both disturbance and restoration events are necessary to create more realistic projections integrating matrix
