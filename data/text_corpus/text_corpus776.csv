3880,surface water connectivity between rivers and floodplain lakes is essential to maintain biodiversity and ecological functioning in floodplain wetlands this study proposes a method to analyze the spatial and temporal connectivity using hydraulic modeling and freely available remote sensing data a novel dynamic connectivity metric introduced here accounts for the entire flow path which can be a substitute for flow connectivity indicators and statistical connectivity indicators the metric allows comparing the hydrological connectivity between different phases of a flood event between different flood events and potentially between different catchments the method was applied to the northern lakes of the narran river catchment in new south wales australia the results indicate that there is no clear transition in the connectivity between different stages of a flood event in the flat narran river wetland compared with other wetlands connecting to deeper river channels thus the proposed metric brings a more comprehensive observation on hydrological connectivity in floodplain wetlands than previously developed metrics which is expected to further support ecological and water management studies in river catchments keywords surface water connectivity geostatistical connectivity function dynamic connectivity connection length wetland 1 introduction hydrological connectivity is a key factor influencing the biodiversity and ecological integrity of many floodplain wetlands karim et al 2014 park and latrubesse 2017 critical functions of floodplain wetlands that are directly or indirectly linked to connectivity include providing essential habitats for water plants native fish and waterbird species balcombe et al 2007 thoms et al 2008 rolls and wilson 2010 acting as reservoirs to reduce impacts of flooding pattison williams et al 2018 and transporting and transforming nutrients and sediments long and pavelsky 2013 the quantity and variety of floodplain wetlands have been declining because of altered flow regimes due to anthropogenic activities such as water extraction for irrigation dam construction and land use changes pringle 2003 davies et al 2010 robinson et al 2015 moreover extreme weather events such as long droughts i e the millennium drought in australia van dijk et al 2013 and climate change have also impacted the ecosystem functioning of floodplain wetlands karim et al 2016 therefore there has been a rise in the awareness to maintain and restore water exchange between rivers and floodplain wetlands to support the aquatic biota balcombe et al 2007 however because of the shortage of high resolution spatial and temporal data in many catchments the mechanism driving the changes in the connectivity of wetlands is not straightforward to investigate trigg et al 2013 karim et al 2014 the concept of hydrological connectivity in floodplain wetlands can be defined in different ways these depend on factors like surface water and groundwater transport meteorological processes such as precipitation and evaporation and the hydro geomorphologic complexity of the floodplain karim et al 2016 ameli and creed 2017 park and latrubesse 2017 in addition each of these factors contributes distinctly to the variation of the water exchange within different floodplain wetlands for example many studies mentioned the flood pulse concept or surface water flow as the primary source recharging floodplain wetlands and affecting their connectivity lesack and marsh 2010 hudson et al 2012 brooks et al 2018 nevertheless park and latrubesse 2017 proved that surface flow only partly contributed to the connectivity in a large anabranching river like the amazon river whilst subsurface flow played an essential role in this basin more specifically the floodplain lakes in the amazon wetlands are usually connected to the river when the discharge in the river was lower than the bankfull flow these studies indicate that the hydrological connectivity of each floodplain wetland has a high level of complexity suggesting that there is no general way to study the surface water connectivity of catchments with the design of such studies depending on the size of the catchment and the purposes of the study levin 1992 bracken et al 2013 the hydrological connectivity in this paper focuses on the surface water connectivity in floodplain wetlands which is the connection between a river and lakes wetlands in the river floodplain several methods have been introduced to statistically quantify connectivity in floodplain wetlands field survey data or measured data at gauge stations are commonly used to establish the duration of connectivity between rivers and floodplain wetlands for ecological purposes lesack and marsh 2010 epting et al 2018 brandis et al 2018 however field monitoring studies are usually costly difficult to establish and time consuming especially for remote catchments karim et al 2014 for these reasons remote sensing data provide an attractive alternative to analyze surface connectivity from catchment robinson et al 2015 to regional scales mateo et al 2017 another possible alternative is using hydrologic and hydrodynamic models in combination with other methods these models are usually applied to fill the temporal gaps between the remote sensing acquisitions and to adequately study hydrological processes in small wetlands or in complex drainage networks that cannot be acquired from remote sensing data ameli and creed 2017 chen et al 2020 tan et al 2019 liu et al 2020 recent studies on hydrological connectivity focused more on the temporal and spatial connection in the entire floodplain wetland catchments instead of exploring the flow pathways and changes in the spilling water source at different phases of a flood event indeed it is challenging to find the connection pathway for the floodplain wetlands that are located at a distance from the main river channel karim et al 2014 the flow pathway was also researched using particle tracking chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 or watershed delineation wu and lane 2017 different connectivity metrics and indicators have been established to use field measurements remote sensing data and hydraulic hydrodynamic model results to evaluate hydrological connectivity some statistical connectivity metrics were proposed to characterize the spatial connectivity applicable to binary maps of landscapes or flood extents such as the connectivity function western et al 2001 the relative surface connection function antoine et al 2009 the directional connectivity index dci larsen et al 2012 and the geostatistical connectivity function cf trigg et al 2013 western et al 2001 developed the connectivity function to calculate the lag dependent probability that two pixels separated by a certain distance are connected the connectivity function by western et al 2001 was initially applied to soil moisture patterns but it can also be used to evaluate the surface water connectivity knudby and carrera 2005 larsen et al 2012 bracken et al 2013 antoine et al 2009 introduced the relative surface connection function to present the ratio of surface connectivity as a function of actual surface storage the metric can discriminate the connectivity in different landscapes at the micro topographical scale and can be implemented for larger catchments antoine et al 2009 bracken et al 2013 nonetheless the relative surface connection function did not consider dynamic changes in connectivity influenced by rainfalls or flood pulses larsen et al 2012 proposed the dci that measures the linearity of patches along a particular direction preferring the shortest connection paths the dci was initially developed to be applicable for ecological slough and ridge landscapes however yuan et al 2015 stated that the dci had not been validated in river catchments therefore the performance of the index to assess the connectivity in floodplain wetlands is still a question indeed complexities in characterizing floodplain wetland connectivity include substantive topographic challenges which may not be present in slough and ridge landscapes for example slough and ridge landscapes usually have flow oriented patterns when the flow velocity is high in a river catchment the flow follows the path of river channels in different directions and the floodplain is only involved when the flow surpasses bankfull stages moreover the dci puts higher weights on the shorter distances of the connection while the flow in a river stream follows the lower slope routes not the shorter directions the concept of the geostatistical cf by trigg et al 2013 is similar to the connectivity function by western et al 2001 the geostatistical cf was improved by applying the bivariate entropy algorithm journel et al 2000 to find the connection links between two pixels along a particular direction e g north south n s or east west e w a common feature in the former statistical connectivity metrics is that those metrics only consider the connectivity in a chosen direction that cannot fully capture the connectivity in floodplain wetlands where water flows in different directions moreover these metrics are usually scaled between 0 and 1 making it challenging to compare the connectivity between catchments knudby and carrera 2005 proposed other indicators for flow connectivity considering flow channeling transport connectivity considering fast paths allowing early solute arrival and statistical connectivity the statistical connection between two or multiple points bracken et al 2013 it is suggested that the flow connectivity indicators present the changes in hydrological connectivity in high conductivity flow paths that are not observed by using the statistical connectivity indicators e g the connectivity function by western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 however the effective conductivity values used to calculate the flow connectivity indicators are estimated from field data which are costly and challenging to collect the index of connectivity ic defined by borselli et al 2008 represents the potential connectivity in different parts of a watershed although the ic accounts for the slope of flow paths and the topographical characteristics that contribute to water and sediment movements it can only give an estimation of the potential connectivity for a landscape instead of the actual hydrological connectivity for a specific event borselli et al 2008 to fill the research gaps it is essential to develop a metric that considers dynamic changes in hydrological connectivity and is suitable for ecological and hydrological applications the new metric should examine the flow direction along a river channel and from a river to floodplain wetlands the metric should also enable a comparison of the connectivity between different flood events and catchments this study aims to introduce a methodology and a connectivity metric to interpret surface water connectivity in a complex river floodplain wetland system the northern lakes of the narran river wetlands in australia are used to showcase the method remote sensing data are integrated with the hydraulic model lisflood fp and a new metric of dynamic connection length analysis is developed the main objectives are 1 to take advantage of remote sensing data to investigate the temporal connectivity in a remote and data scarce catchment and 2 to develop a novel metric to quantify the hydrological connectivity in a floodplain wetland statistically 2 methodology 2 1 study area the narran river catchment is located in the condamine balonne river floodplain in northern new south wales australia the catchment is recognized as an internationally important habitat for colonial waterbird and native fish species and is listed in the ramsar convention on wetlands brandis et al 2018 thoms et al 2008 the narran catchment is a complex river wetland system with many small drainages connecting water from the main river channel to the floodplain lakes the river channel is classified as a small river with a width varying from 25 to 50 m the river and the floodplain have a high vegetation coverage thoms et al 2008 therefore it is challenging to clearly identify the boundary between the main channel and the floodplain in some parts of the river this study focuses on the northern lakes of the narran river floodplain the narran river runs from north to south fig 1 c the northern lakes include clear lake long arm and back lake with surface areas of 5 4 km2 1 5 km2 and 1 3 km2 respectively fig 1 the river reach in this study area is 19 5 km long from the narran park gauge station to the bundah gauge station further downstream there is no clear seasonal flooding pattern in the study area and the water levels in the lakes are mainly driven by the flood pulses from the river junk et al 1989 thoms et al 2008 the highest flood event recorded from 2002 occurred in 2011 with a peak discharge of 110 m3s 1 the breeding of the waterbirds and the fish assemblage in the narran river wetland highly correlates with the flow volume input from the river to the floodplain rolls and wilson 2010 brandis et al 2018 according to brandis et al 2018 the cumulative flow volume must be maintained at 154 000 megalitres in the first 90 days of a flow event for breeding of waterbirds to occur in the wetland 2 2 remote sensing data the flood extents in the study area were observed using water observation from space wofs and sentinel 2 imagery these remote sensing data with a resolution of 25 m 25 m were selected to adequately capture the complexity of the narran river networks the satellite images of wofs and sentinel 2 were obtained from the digital earth australia sandbox developed by geoscience australia url https docs dea ga gov au index html the wofs images were derived from landsat 5 and landsat 7 satellite imagery available from 1987 onward mueller et al 2016 with a revisit time of 8 days with both satellites the wofs images present the detected water pixels using a decision tree classifier mueller et al 2016 the overall accuracy of wofs is 97 for the water vegetation mixed pixels the accuracy is 74 and for small water bodies the accuracy is 88 mueller et al 2016 the wofs dataset was compared with the global surface water dataset developed by the european joint research centre pekel et al 2016 the wofs images provide the flood extent maps associated with the acquisition time of landsat 5 and landsat 7 thus enabling the validation of the water extent results from the lisflood fp model the global surface water dataset provides monthly average flood extents which is an insufficient temporal resolution to validate the model moreover wofs can identify the main river channel and the channels connecting the river and the floodplain lakes while the global surface water dataset cannot therefore the wofs dataset appears to be more suitable than the global surface water dataset to assess the hydrological connectivity in the narran river catchment in the period from 01 01 2010 to 14 07 2019 there are 624 wofs images available however the scan line corrector off slc off errors in the landsat 7 images affect the products of wofs since wofs is derived from landsat 5 and landsat 7 markham et al 2004 mueller et al 2016 each of the classified images of wofs contains different flags for each pixel that indicate whether the pixel is affected by the slc off errors or is located under clouds geoscience australia 2019a by filtering the images from cloud cover and slc off errors 228 images with at least 80 error free pixels can be used for the temporal connectivity analysis the flood extents derived from the sentinel 2 images were used in combination with the wofs images to reduce the temporal interval of the observed flood maps and consequently to increase the confidence of the temporal connectivity analysis the sentinel 2 mission includes the two satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b the images from sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b are available from 23 06 2015 and 7 03 2017 respectively the european space agency 2015 the average revisit interval for sentinel 2 both sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b is 5 days at the equator the spatial resolution ranges from 10 m to 60 m depending on different bands the european space agency 2015 the sentinel 2 images were resized to 25 m using the nearest neighbor method to match the resolution of the wofs images and the lisflood fp model there are 417 sentinel 2 images available from 23 06 2015 to 01 07 2020 the analysis ready sentinel 2 images from the digital earth australia sandbox have boolean masks that allow filtering for cloud cloud shadow and invalid pixels after filtering for these problems 307 images are retrieved with at least 80 error free pixels the modification of normalised difference water index mndwi was used to extract the water pixels from the satellite images xu 2006 1 mndwi green swir green swir where green is the top of atmosphere reflectance of the green band and swir is the top of atmosphere reflectance of the shortwave infrared band the central wavelength and the bandwidth of the green band of the sentinel 2 image are 560 nm and 35 nm respectively the central wavelength and the bandwidth of the shortwave infrared band are 1610 nm and 90 nm respectively geoscience australia 2019b pixels with mndwi indices higher than 0 are classified as water cells as suggested by xu 2006 from fisher et al 2016 the threshold of 0 for mndwi was tested on landsat 5 landsat 7 and landsat 8 images in queensland and new south wales australia and resulted in an accuracy of 99 5 for pure pixels and 78 for mixed pixels this accuracy is comparable with the accuracy of the wofs dataset the flood extents from sentinel 2 were then compared with the wofs images a selection of images from both datasets with a temporal difference of fewer than 2 days was used it is assumed that there is no extreme change in the flood extent within 2 days difference from 23 6 2015 when the first sentinel 2 image is available to 31 12 2020 27 pairs of images are available for comparison the result proved a similarity in detecting water by the wofs and sentinel 2 images shown by the average of 93 match in the prediction of flooded pixels hence it is concluded that the two datasets have the same level of accuracy and is suitable to observe the temporal connectivity in the narran river floodplain wetland 2 3 the hydraulic model lisflood fp the two dimensional hydraulic lisflood fp model bates and de roo 2000 bates et al 2010 almeida et al 2012 almeida and bates 2013 was implemented to simulate the flood inundation in the upper narran river catchment this model has been widely used to simulate flood dynamics of different river catchments wwilson and atkinsonilson and atkinson 2007 grimaldi et al 2018 the shallow water equations swes describe the flood wave routing which expresses the conservation of mass and momentum in the version of lisflood fp in almeida and bates 2013 that was used here the local inertia approximation simplification is adopted thus ignoring the convective acceleration term in the swes this approximation has been found to lead to comparable results as the full swes with a faster computational time almeida and bates 2013 the input data include a digital elevation model dem a discharge hydrograph at the upstream gauge station narran park and initial and downstream boundary conditions for the model the 5 m lidar derived dem from geoscience australia was used url https elevation fsdf org au the vertical accuracy of the dem is 30 cm with 95 confidence and the horizontal accuracy is 80 cm with 95 confidence intergovernmental and mapping surveying and mapping 2010 the dem was then resampled to 25 m to reduce the model computational time stripe pattern errors in the 5 m lidar derived dem from geoscience australia are observed in the lower elevation area in the narran river catchment fig 1c the difference between the dark and light areas was checked manually and showed an elevation difference smaller than 0 2 m which is within the range of the vertical accuracy of the dem 30 cm the width of the deeper stripe regions is about 300 350 m it was stated that a limitation of the lidar derived dem is the interpolation error of the dem around the edges of the areas of interest intergovernmental and mapping surveying and mapping 2010 in the literature the stripe pattern error in the lidar derived dem is not mentioned clearly the discharge data at narran park gs 422029 from the australian bureau of meteorology url http www bom gov au waterdata was used as the upstream input boundary condition the initial condition was set as completely dry for both the river and floodplain because the north and east edges of the flooding domain have higher elevations the boundaries were set as no flow the boundary condition downstream of the river in the west and south edges of the domain is free flow which means water can freely flow out of the catchment without affecting the condition upstream the free flow condition forces the model to calculate the normal depth of the water level downstream using the slope at the last two river sections bates et al 2013 the lisflood fp model was calibrated by changing the roughness coefficients for a low flow flood event in 2010 and was validated for flood events in 2011 and 2013 fig 2 a low flow event was chosen for the calibration and validation to minimize the overbank flow to the floodplain this calibration strategy is used because the flat floodplain consists of a complex network of small channels when the water rises above the bank level and emerges between different sections it is challenging to identify the total discharge at a given river cross section the discharges and water levels at the downstream gauge station bundah gs 422031 were checked and compared with the measurements the main river channel was defined by running the lisflood fp model with a minimal and constant discharge input 1 m3s 1 until the river was connected from the upstream to the downstream end then two different manning s roughness coefficients were assigned for the river and the floodplain the range of river and floodplain roughness coefficients for different vegetation classes were retrieved from chow 1959 the vegetation classes were chosen based on the vegetation survey by thoms et al 2008 the manning s coefficient of the river bed was modified with steps of 0 005 between 0 01 to 0 06 m 1 3s because of the light vegetation for the floodplain the roughness coefficient was modified between 0 02 and 0 08 m 1 3s with steps of 0 005 due to the moderate to high vegetation cover moreover the flood extents from the model were compared with the wofs images for the flood events in 2011 and 2013 there are 12 error free images from wofs available for evaluating the modeled flood extent in 2011 and 2 images available for the flood event in 2013 the water level threshold to define the wetness was set as 0 01 0 05 0 1 and 0 3 m where 0 3 m is the vertical accuracy of the dem 2 4 performance metrics the root mean square error rmse the percentage bias pbias the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge were used to compare the modeled discharge and water level with the measured data calculated as 2 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 3 pbias i 1 n y i y i 100 i 1 n y i 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 5 kge 1 r 1 2 σ y i σ y i 1 2 μ y i μ y i 1 2 where y i is the modeled discharge or water level y i is the measured discharge or water level y i or μ y i is the mean of measured discharge μ y i is the mean of modeled discharge r is the linear correlation between modeled and measured discharge σ y i is the standard deviation of modeled discharge σ y i is the standard deviation of measured discharge and n is the total number of observations the rmse shows the relative error of the model compared to the measurement data therefore the lower values of rmse the better the model performance rmse 0 indicates a perfect match between modeled and measured results a positive pbias value means the model overpredicts the measurements knoben et al 2019 suggested that nse 0 and kge 0 41 indicates that the model is a better predictor than the mean of the measurements different performance metrics are used to compare the modeled flood extents with the wofs images including bias hit rate and the critical success index csi or f 2 as suggested in stephens et al 2014 the contingency table table 1 and the equations of the metrics are shown as following 6 bias a b a c 7 hitrate a a c 8 csi a a b c a bias value higher than 1 shows overprediction the hit rate shows the proportion of correct predictions of an observed flood the csi is suitable for comparing the accuracy of modeled flood extents since it does not account for the correct prediction of dry pixels it can avoid providing a too optimistic evaluation of model performance while the flooded area in the domain is generally smaller than the unflooded area stephens et al 2014 however it is biased toward overprediction and is affected by the size of the domain and the magnitude of flood events stephens et al 2014 the optimal value for hit rate and csi is 1 for those reasons the bias hit rate and csi measures were used together to compare the lisflood fp model results and the wofs images 2 5 measures of connectivity the popular geostatistical connectivity function or cf western et al 2001 trigg et al 2013 is used to analyze the hydrological connectivity in the narran river wetlands it is also used to compare and contrast with the new dynamic connection length metric 2 5 1 geostatistical connectivity function the geostatistical cf was employed to calculate the probability that two points at a certain distance connect to each other western et al 2001 pardo igözquiza and dowd 2003 trigg et al 2013 the algorithm applied in trigg et al 2013 which was developed by journel et al 2000 calculates the cf value for inundated cells based on a two dimensional 2d wet dry binary layer using either 4 way connectivity cells connect through the interface of the cells or 8 way connectivity cells connect through both the interface and the corner vertex of the cells the cf in journel et al 2000 calculates the likelihood that two points at a distance n have values of z u j all higher than a threshold value z c i e an elevation threshold cf is written as 9 p n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 where pr x is the probability that x is true i u j z c is an indicator of the variable z u j exceeding the threshold value z c and is the product operator i u j z c 1 if z u j z c and 0 otherwise therefore if there is a connection between two cells at a distance n all the values of i u j z c starting from 1 to n will be equal to 1 and the product operator in eq 9 will be equal to 1 the cf value p n z c calculates the probability that all the pairs of inundated cells separated by a distance n are connected to each other for example if there is a total of 5 pairs of inundated cells at a distance of 5 m with 3 of them connected to each other i e j 1 5 i u j z c 1 and 2 pairs not connected i e j 1 5 i u j z c 0 cf will be equal to 0 6 the geostatistical cf was calculated using the flood extents modeled by lisflood fp using the matlab code provided in trigg et al 2013 in the lisflood fp model water can only travel through the interface of cells so the 4 way connectivity was used in the analysis the n s and e w connectivities were analyzed to explain the connection between the narran river and its floodplain lakes 2 5 2 dynamic connection length the dynamic connection length analysis was introduced in this study to efficiently visualize surface water connectivity in a river catchment the connection length is defined as the distance of water traveling to a specific location from a water source e g the input discharge gauge station at narran park instead of considering the connectivity along a direction such as n s or e w as in the cf trigg et al 2013 the connection lengths are calculated for all the cells in the domain based on the flow direction in those cells two types of dynamic connection lengths are developed and defined as the total connection length tcl and the dominant connection length dcl the tcl indicates all the possible distances that water can travel from an input source to different locations in the floodplain the dcl shows the pathway that water prefers to travel by only considering the highest discharge coming in or out of each cell the analysis uses the outputs from the hydraulic model lisflood fp including water levels and discharges in both x and y directions in the model the water level is calculated at the center of a cell and the discharges are assigned to the edges of a cell an illustration of the connection lengths calculation is shown in fig 3 and the steps for its calculation are detailed below 1 the analysis is applied for the inundated cells with a water level larger than a certain threshold only the discharges higher than 0 01 m3s 1 are included in the calculation to avoid a small amount of water fluctuating between the inundated cells that may cause an unbreakable loop in the calculation of the connection length 2 a cell is marked as an input water cell or the water spilling source if it only provides water for surrounding cells and does not receive water from any cell at a given time step the input water cells are assigned a counter variable of 1 3 the connection length is calculated following the flow direction for both the tcl and the dcl the next cell along the flow path that receives water from a cell numbered n will be assigned a counter n 1 if a cell receives water from more than one cell around it different numbers corresponding to the tcls will be stored in that cell one dcl is associated with the direction of the dominant flow the largest discharge value into the cell the process continues until all the inundated cells are numbered 4 the relative frequency distribution of the tcl and the dcl are calculated to observe the variation of spatial connectivity at each time step the relative frequency is the ratio of the frequency of each connection length over the total number of connection lengths the spatial pattern and the relative frequency distribution of the dcl at different time steps present the dynamic connectivity variation of the catchment the relative frequency distribution of the tcl shows all available lengths of water traveling from one cell to another the analysis of the connection length results in the connectivity statistics including the maximum and the mean travel distance of water in the catchment the distribution of the connection lengths and the active cells with water movement the expansion and contraction of the flow network can be examined from the spatial pattern of the dcl overall the connection length analysis is expected to bring a comprehensive measure to quantify the hydrological connectivity of floodplain wetlands 3 results and discussions 3 1 observation of hydrological connectivity from the satellite images fig 4 presents the wofs images at different phases of the flood event in 2011 the contraction and expansion of the flood extents during the rising limbs and the recession periods can be observed from the satellite images during the flood peaks the maximum observed flood extent from wofs in fig 4g shows a clear connection between the river and the floodplain lakes through the channels in the upper floodplain area however because the width of the main channel is narrow 25 50 m the wofs images cannot present a continuous connection from the upstream to the downstream part of the main river channel furthermore the movement of the flood pulse from the river to the floodplain lakes during the rising limb at time a f in fig 4o cannot be distinguished from the flood pulse from the lakes to the downstream part of the river during the recession at times h k l and n in fig 4o therefore the observation of water extents from the satellite data alone is not adequate to examine the changes in connectivity at different phases of a flood event 3 2 model calibration and evaluation the calibration results and the performance metrics are shown in fig 5 and table 2 although a wide range of manning s coefficients were used in the calibration no reasonable match between the discharge and the water level at bundah was obtained for both the magnitude and flood arrival time the calibration of the model using manning s coefficients where the friction varied locally can fit water level results but not the flood arrival time neal et al 2015 the inaccuracy of the dem used as the model input might also explain this issue the input dem was resampled to the coarser resolution of 25 m 25 m resulting in shallower depths of the river bed moreover the dem which was derived from remote sensing data in our case from lidar can only capture the nearly clear shallow water surface but not the depth of river bed legleiter 2015 sampson et al 2015 the narran wetland is a complex river catchment with a narrow and shallow mainstream and many small streams with high vegetation coverage connecting the river to the floodplain lakes therefore the quality of the dem has a strong influence on the model performance and even minor errors can lead to the inaccuracy of the model results jarihani et al 2015 to overcome this issue the dem was modified by lowering the main river stream depth from the calibration of the river roughness the model with manning s coefficients 0 045 m 1 3s for the river stream and 0 07 m 1 3s for the flood plain has the most reasonable phase pattern compared to the measured discharge therefore these values were used for the calibration of the river bed the results from the models with the dem lowered by 0 3 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m are presented in fig 6 the model with the river bed lowered by 0 4 m resulted in the best outcome for the discharge and water level at bundah this model significantly reduces the rmse and the pbias values compared with the model with the original dem table 3 it also results in the highest nse and kge for the discharge among the models with adjusted depths of the river bed table 3 the calibrated model was tested against the flood events in 2011 and 2013 fig 7 and table 4 show the comparison of the modeled discharge for the two flood events to the measurements at the bundah gauge station the rmse values for the flood events in 2011 and 2013 are 5 128 and 2 840 m3s 1 which is approximately 10 of the maximum measured discharges the nse 0 and kge close to 1 suggest an acceptable performance of the model knoben et al 2019 there are 14 wofs images available for cross comparison with the flood extents from the lisflood fp model for the flood events in 2011 and 2013 the average performance metrics associated with each wetness threshold are summarized in table 5 for example the overlaps between the wofs image and the modeled flood extents with different wetness thresholds on 17 04 2013 are shown in fig 8 the csi values are higher with the thresholds of 0 01 and 0 3 m however it does not mean that the flood extents with lower wetness thresholds are incorrect although the flood extent with a threshold of 0 01 m leads to an overestimation of the flood extent it shows more details of the channels connecting the river and the floodplain lakes fig 8a the threshold of 0 01 m also results in the highest average hit rate value of 0 916 the connectivity between the river and the floodplain lakes can still be observed with a threshold of 0 05 m however when the threshold increased to 0 1 m or 0 3 m there is little to no flow from the river to the floodplain lakes fig 8d also shows a larger underestimated flooded area for the threshold 0 3 m even though 0 01 m seems to be a low water level it can be argued that it is sufficient to present the connection in a flat catchment as our study area in the study area with many connecting channels smaller than the resolution of wofs and sentinel 2 25 m the modeled flood extents are more adequate to observe spatial connectivity moreover in the dynamic connectivity analysis only the pixels with water movement the flow larger than 0 01 m3s 1 are considered so the pixels saturated with water are excluded from the connectivity analysis hence from the evaluation the model provides a reasonable prediction for discharges water levels and flood extents for the connectivity analysis it is suggested to evaluate a suitable wetness threshold depending on catchment conditions before applying the dynamic connectivity analysis 3 3 temporal connectivity analysis many studies that quantified the impact of the connectivity on floodplain wetland habitat required hydrological information such as the seasonal patterns of connection the duration of the connection and disconnection periods and the cumulative threshold volume or volume to connect required before connection occurred lesack and marsh 2010 robinson et al 2015 epting et al 2018 brandis et al 2018 however in most remote catchments long records and continuous measurements of the lake stage are not always available this study takes advantage of the accessible sources of remote sensing data from the wofs and sentinel 2 images to analyze the connection and disconnection periods of back lake and clear lake since there is a gauge station at back lake to measure the water level in the lake the water level data were used to double check the connectivity analysis of the lake in addition the gap fill method introduced in trigg et al 2013 was applied to connect the periods when there was no image available or there were slc off errors in the wofs images at the location of the lakes indeed it is unlikely for the lakes to connect in one time step disconnect in one or a few next time steps and immediately reconnect again therefore if the gap between two time steps of connection is less than 2 weeks the period in between will be considered as connected the connection of back lake observed from the wofs and sentinel 2 images overlapped with the water level time series at the back lake gauge station fig 9 a compares the connection of back lake observed from the wofs and sentinel 2 images to the water level time series at the back lake gauge station it is noticeable that there was an error in the measurement of the water level at back lake from 2013 the water level at back lake never went below 0 63 m even when the lake was observed to be completely dry from the satellite images there are small lags in the onset and the end of each connection period identified by the remote sensing data compared with the rise of the water level in the lake which can be explained by the coarse temporal resolution of the satellite images fig 9b compares the connection of back lake and clear lake identified by the satellite data with the discharge input at narran park the analysis on the connectivity duration demonstrates that there is no seasonal pattern in the connection between the river and the floodplain lakes in the narran river catchment the critical determinant of the water level in the lakes is the flood pulses from the river this is also observed in many other catchments robinson et al 2015 ameli and creed 2017 park and latrubesse 2017 since clear lake is a larger lake and is located closer to the river reach the lake received water from the river earlier than back lake and also remains connected for a longer time for all flood events during three minor flood events between 2014 and 2016 clear lake was also connected to the river when the back lake remained dry in our analysis from 2010 to 2020 there were 7 connections for clear lake and only 3 for back lake the most extended connection duration for back lake and clear lake are 995 days and 1073 days respectively it occurred during the high flood event from early 2010 to the end of 2012 the shortest connection for back lake is 35 days during the flood event from 18 10 2016 to 22 11 2016 the shortest connection observed in clear lake is 8 days due to a small flood pulse from 28 02 2016 to 8 03 2016 further analysis of the volume to connect indicates that back lake requires a more extensive volume input than clear lake to connect to the river the average volume to connect back lake is 32 000 megalitres while for clear lake is 2 000 megalitres it concludes that in the narran river catchment the volume to connect is strongly influenced by the proximity of the lakes to the river some other factors affecting the volume to connect and the duration of connection in different flood events but which are not included in the scope of this study are the rainfall evaporation infiltration and subsurface and groundwater flow lesack and melack 1995 karim et al 2016 ameli and creed 2017 3 4 spatial connectivity analysis 3 4 1 n s and e w connectivity the connectivity of the northern lakes in the narran river catchment was examined in the n s and e w directions based on modeled water levels from the lisflood fp model during the two flood events in 2011 and 2013 the timing of the analyzed time steps during the floods is shown in fig 2b c because of the orientation of our study area the cf in the n s direction presents the connection along the river channel in contrast the cf in the e w direction indicates the connection between the river and its floodplain lakes during the rising limb of the two events fig 10 a d fig a 1a d the cf values were close to 1 indicating strong connectivity both in the n s and e w directions during the recession periods fig 10e f fig a 1e f the values of cf decreased both in the n s and e w directions but earlier in the e w direction due to the disruption of the connection between the river and the lakes the shape of the e w cf curve transitioned from concave to convex during the two recession time steps a convex cf curve indicates fewer pixels with a long connection length and thus indicates a disconnection of the river from the floodplain trigg et al 2013 furthermore there were more significant fluctuations in the average cf time series in the e w direction than in the n s direction for both flood events fig 11 it implies that the expansion and contraction of flood extent due to the connection of the floodplain lakes is more significant than the change in the connection along the river channel after the river channel was connected upstream to the downstream end of the reach the maximum connectivity distances in the n s direction remained almost unchanged in some routing periods e g from 28 12 2010 to 16 02 2011 fig 11a there were minimal variations in the average cf values and the maximum connectivity distance in both the n s and e w direction during these periods water input mainly filled up the water level in the floodplain instead of contributing to the expansion of the flooded areas because the cf values are scaled between 0 and 1 the difference in the hydrological connectivity between a high flood event in 2011 and an average flood event in 2013 cannot be discriminated the cf values are close to 1 during the rising limbs observed in both flood events did not explain whether introducing more water to the floodplain results in higher connectivity to further parts of the catchments unlike the results of trigg et al 2013 and tan et al 2019 in our catchment there is no clear connectivity distance threshold caused by the clustering of cf curves for an extended period previous studies had shown that the connectivity threshold usually separated the period of expansion and contraction of the flood inundation area from the period when the water level of the floodplain was increasing but the flood extent maintained the same trigg et al 2013 however because of the flat topography and the shallowness of the river bed in the narran wetland the floodplain usually becomes flooded at the beginning of the flood event and the flood extent area consistently increases during the rising limb of the hydrograph therefore the connectivity transition is different from catchments with deep river channels this result is consistent with the conclusion from park and latrubesse 2017 who stated that the connectivity characteristics of a specific river are variable and that the topography has a strong influence on the water exchange of river wetland systems 3 4 2 dynamic connectivity the dynamic connection length analysis introduces an additional measure to investigate the spatial connectivity between rivers and floodplain wetlands two points in a catchment can be connected through different routes therefore the observation of dynamic connectivity and the water transport pathway can contribute to the understanding of the exchange of nutrients and sediments as well as the movement of fish in a river wetland balcombe et al 2007 long and pavelsky 2013 the advantage of the dcl analysis is that the connectivity at different stages of a flood event can be identified from the change in the shape of the dcl relative distribution an analysis of the cf value plot or the water extent maps does not have this advantage the variance of the dcl frequency distribution is smaller at the early time steps fig 12 a fig a 2a and increases in the later time steps of the rising limb fig 12b d fig a 2b d when the flooded area expands and the lakes are connected to the river during the recession there is a rapid reduction in connectivity the disconnection of the river from the floodplain can be indicated by the change in the cf curve shape in the e w direction fig 10e but it is even more apparent in the dcl figures fig 12e shows a decline in the connectivity between the upstream part of the river and the floodplain by a drop in the value of the dcl relative frequency at a distance from 7 5 to 10 km when the lakes were disconnected from the river at the end of the flood events the dcl distribution curve shifts to a reversed j shape and the frequency of the connection lengths lower than 7 5 km increases fig 12f fig a 2e f the analysis of connection length taking into account the flow direction can be used to comprehensively analyze the dynamic change in surface connectivity for example fig 12c d and fig a 2c d reveal that a larger amount of overbank flow from the river traveled to the eastern direction of the floodplain than the western side filled the lakes and then returned to the river in the downstream part additionally the spatial pattern of the dcl in fig 12b and fig a 2b demonstrates that clear lake was filled up by flow from both the upper river channel to the drainage in the north of the lake and the south of the lake during the later time steps of the recession period water from the lake drained to the downstream part of the river and the floodplain fig 12f fig a 2e f the backflow from the floodplain to the river is also an important contribution of the water exchange in a river wetland system li et al 2017 chen et al 2020 without the need to apply the particle tracking method as in li et al 2017 and chen et al 2020 the connection length analysis can also contribute to understanding the backflow mechanism another important hydraulic implication is that the statistics from the connection length analysis reflect the behavior of different floods that is not easy to detect from remote sensing data or flood extent maps more specifically different flood waves with various rates of increasing discharge have a tendency to fill different parts of the river and the floodplain thus for example after a similar cumulative volume of 2000 megalitres was delivered to the catchment in 2011 and 2013 fig 12a fig a 2a the flood extents and the connectivity frequency were different in the flood event in 2011 with the discharge increasing at a rate of 0 046 m3s 1h 1 water likely remained in the river channel until it reached the downstream end before involving the floodplain in contrast the discharge increasing at a higher rate at the start of the flood event in 2013 i e 0 111 m3s 1h 1 led to the overbank flow that flooded the upstream floodplain early in the flood event even while the river at the downstream end remained dry the variance of the dcl distribution curve in the initial period of the flood event in 2011 is smaller with one peak at a distance of 15 20 km while in the flood event in 2013 the curve has larger values between 10 20 km indicating that the floodplain upstream was already flooded understanding the behavior of flood waves with different input rates is essential for both ecological purposes and flood forecasting and warning in floodplain wetlands the tcl analysis can be also used to compare the maximum distance that water has traveled in a catchment at different stages of a flood event or between several flood events it is also possible to compare the maximum values of the dcl to the maximum values of the tcl the maximum values of the dcl do not vary significantly once the river is fully connected the maximum values of the tcl increase during the rising limb of the hydrograph and reduce dramatically during the recession fig 13 fig a 3 during the flood event in 2011 when the cumulative volume input of the entire event is higher 487 000 megalitres in 2011 compared with 86 000 megalitres in 2013 the maximum value of tcl at the peak discharge is also higher than the value for the flood event 2013 fig 13d fig a 3d the expansion of flooded areas can provide more connection routes and increase the flood travel distance in a floodplain which increases the heterogeneity of wetland catchments chen et al 2020 moreover the multi modality of the distribution indicates a change in the water source at different stages of a flood event the shape of the tcl relative frequency distribution becomes bimodal due to the disconnection between the river and the floodplain fig 13f fig a 3e the new peak of the tcl distributions at 7 5 10 km is formed by the backwater flow from clear lake to the floodplain downstream in addition the tcl relative frequency changes from symmetric curves in the early time steps of the rising limbs to right skewed curves during the later time steps but the peak connection lengths remain in the range from 15 to 20 km during the rising limb fig 13a e fig a 3a d the values of the tcl associated with the peaks of the relative frequency indicate the distance from the input point at narran park to clear lake which is the largest lake in the floodplain it means that in combination with the analysis the shape of the tcl reflects the dynamic connectivity behavior at different phases of the flood including the process of backflow in the catchment the connection length analysis can be accomplished using direct outputs from the hydraulic model leading to a comprehensive understanding of hydrological connectivity without requiring other complicated techniques 4 conclusions this study presents a novel metric to analyze hydrological connectivity in a floodplain wetland applied to the upper narran river catchment in new south wales australia both the total tcl and dominant dcl connection lengths are computed the tcl analysis calculates all possible travel distances from an input source to an inundated cell in the floodplain the dcl analysis considers the travel distance of the largest flow into each inundated cell the method calculates the connectivity along the flow path as opposed to the currently available geostatistical method connectivity function or cf which only evaluates the connectivity along the n s and or e w directions furthermore the dynamic change in surface connectivity is reflected in the relative frequency distribution of the dcl and the tcl and the spatial pattern of the dcl in contrast with the cf the proposed method identifies the change in connectivity at different phases of a flood event in a flat floodplain wetland additionally the typical connectivity behaviors in different flood events with different magnitude and duration can be examined a standout advantage of the dynamic connection length compared with other connectivity metrics is that it can be used to compare the hydrological connectivity between different phases of a flood event between different flood events and probably between different catchments moreover the new metric considering the actual flow can substitute both flow connectivity indicators and statistical connectivity indicators mentioned in knudby and carrera 2005 more information about hydrological connectivity can be obtained from the dynamic connection length analysis than from the flood extents from the remote sensing data finally the backflow effect or the flood pulse from the lakes to the rivers during the recession period can be indicated without other complicated methods some of the limitations are pointed out since the analysis requires a map of water discharge or velocity it is necessary to use a hydraulic or hydrodynamic model which can require extensive computational resources for large catchments the accuracy of the analysis highly depends on the accuracy of the model results in this study the uncertainties in the dem and the discharge and water level measurements are acknowledged therefore we suggest carefully calibrating and evaluating the model before applying the dynamic connection length metric the temporal hydrological connectivity of the upper narran river wetland was examined using the open and analysis ready sources of remote sensing data from wofs and sentinel 2 from the satellite images the observed connectivity durations of back lake and clear lake are highly correlated with the discharge input at narran park proving that the total volume and peak magnitude of the flood pulse are the main factors determining the water level of the lakes the present study indicates that the hydrological connectivity mechanism depends on many factors including the topography of the catchments consequently the behavior of the connectivity in the flat narran wetland can be expected to be different from other wetlands that connect to deeper river channels the findings in this study are expected to support further ecological research flood management and forecasting and the management

3880,surface water connectivity between rivers and floodplain lakes is essential to maintain biodiversity and ecological functioning in floodplain wetlands this study proposes a method to analyze the spatial and temporal connectivity using hydraulic modeling and freely available remote sensing data a novel dynamic connectivity metric introduced here accounts for the entire flow path which can be a substitute for flow connectivity indicators and statistical connectivity indicators the metric allows comparing the hydrological connectivity between different phases of a flood event between different flood events and potentially between different catchments the method was applied to the northern lakes of the narran river catchment in new south wales australia the results indicate that there is no clear transition in the connectivity between different stages of a flood event in the flat narran river wetland compared with other wetlands connecting to deeper river channels thus the proposed metric brings a more comprehensive observation on hydrological connectivity in floodplain wetlands than previously developed metrics which is expected to further support ecological and water management studies in river catchments keywords surface water connectivity geostatistical connectivity function dynamic connectivity connection length wetland 1 introduction hydrological connectivity is a key factor influencing the biodiversity and ecological integrity of many floodplain wetlands karim et al 2014 park and latrubesse 2017 critical functions of floodplain wetlands that are directly or indirectly linked to connectivity include providing essential habitats for water plants native fish and waterbird species balcombe et al 2007 thoms et al 2008 rolls and wilson 2010 acting as reservoirs to reduce impacts of flooding pattison williams et al 2018 and transporting and transforming nutrients and sediments long and pavelsky 2013 the quantity and variety of floodplain wetlands have been declining because of altered flow regimes due to anthropogenic activities such as water extraction for irrigation dam construction and land use changes pringle 2003 davies et al 2010 robinson et al 2015 moreover extreme weather events such as long droughts i e the millennium drought in australia van dijk et al 2013 and climate change have also impacted the ecosystem functioning of floodplain wetlands karim et al 2016 therefore there has been a rise in the awareness to maintain and restore water exchange between rivers and floodplain wetlands to support the aquatic biota balcombe et al 2007 however because of the shortage of high resolution spatial and temporal data in many catchments the mechanism driving the changes in the connectivity of wetlands is not straightforward to investigate trigg et al 2013 karim et al 2014 the concept of hydrological connectivity in floodplain wetlands can be defined in different ways these depend on factors like surface water and groundwater transport meteorological processes such as precipitation and evaporation and the hydro geomorphologic complexity of the floodplain karim et al 2016 ameli and creed 2017 park and latrubesse 2017 in addition each of these factors contributes distinctly to the variation of the water exchange within different floodplain wetlands for example many studies mentioned the flood pulse concept or surface water flow as the primary source recharging floodplain wetlands and affecting their connectivity lesack and marsh 2010 hudson et al 2012 brooks et al 2018 nevertheless park and latrubesse 2017 proved that surface flow only partly contributed to the connectivity in a large anabranching river like the amazon river whilst subsurface flow played an essential role in this basin more specifically the floodplain lakes in the amazon wetlands are usually connected to the river when the discharge in the river was lower than the bankfull flow these studies indicate that the hydrological connectivity of each floodplain wetland has a high level of complexity suggesting that there is no general way to study the surface water connectivity of catchments with the design of such studies depending on the size of the catchment and the purposes of the study levin 1992 bracken et al 2013 the hydrological connectivity in this paper focuses on the surface water connectivity in floodplain wetlands which is the connection between a river and lakes wetlands in the river floodplain several methods have been introduced to statistically quantify connectivity in floodplain wetlands field survey data or measured data at gauge stations are commonly used to establish the duration of connectivity between rivers and floodplain wetlands for ecological purposes lesack and marsh 2010 epting et al 2018 brandis et al 2018 however field monitoring studies are usually costly difficult to establish and time consuming especially for remote catchments karim et al 2014 for these reasons remote sensing data provide an attractive alternative to analyze surface connectivity from catchment robinson et al 2015 to regional scales mateo et al 2017 another possible alternative is using hydrologic and hydrodynamic models in combination with other methods these models are usually applied to fill the temporal gaps between the remote sensing acquisitions and to adequately study hydrological processes in small wetlands or in complex drainage networks that cannot be acquired from remote sensing data ameli and creed 2017 chen et al 2020 tan et al 2019 liu et al 2020 recent studies on hydrological connectivity focused more on the temporal and spatial connection in the entire floodplain wetland catchments instead of exploring the flow pathways and changes in the spilling water source at different phases of a flood event indeed it is challenging to find the connection pathway for the floodplain wetlands that are located at a distance from the main river channel karim et al 2014 the flow pathway was also researched using particle tracking chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 or watershed delineation wu and lane 2017 different connectivity metrics and indicators have been established to use field measurements remote sensing data and hydraulic hydrodynamic model results to evaluate hydrological connectivity some statistical connectivity metrics were proposed to characterize the spatial connectivity applicable to binary maps of landscapes or flood extents such as the connectivity function western et al 2001 the relative surface connection function antoine et al 2009 the directional connectivity index dci larsen et al 2012 and the geostatistical connectivity function cf trigg et al 2013 western et al 2001 developed the connectivity function to calculate the lag dependent probability that two pixels separated by a certain distance are connected the connectivity function by western et al 2001 was initially applied to soil moisture patterns but it can also be used to evaluate the surface water connectivity knudby and carrera 2005 larsen et al 2012 bracken et al 2013 antoine et al 2009 introduced the relative surface connection function to present the ratio of surface connectivity as a function of actual surface storage the metric can discriminate the connectivity in different landscapes at the micro topographical scale and can be implemented for larger catchments antoine et al 2009 bracken et al 2013 nonetheless the relative surface connection function did not consider dynamic changes in connectivity influenced by rainfalls or flood pulses larsen et al 2012 proposed the dci that measures the linearity of patches along a particular direction preferring the shortest connection paths the dci was initially developed to be applicable for ecological slough and ridge landscapes however yuan et al 2015 stated that the dci had not been validated in river catchments therefore the performance of the index to assess the connectivity in floodplain wetlands is still a question indeed complexities in characterizing floodplain wetland connectivity include substantive topographic challenges which may not be present in slough and ridge landscapes for example slough and ridge landscapes usually have flow oriented patterns when the flow velocity is high in a river catchment the flow follows the path of river channels in different directions and the floodplain is only involved when the flow surpasses bankfull stages moreover the dci puts higher weights on the shorter distances of the connection while the flow in a river stream follows the lower slope routes not the shorter directions the concept of the geostatistical cf by trigg et al 2013 is similar to the connectivity function by western et al 2001 the geostatistical cf was improved by applying the bivariate entropy algorithm journel et al 2000 to find the connection links between two pixels along a particular direction e g north south n s or east west e w a common feature in the former statistical connectivity metrics is that those metrics only consider the connectivity in a chosen direction that cannot fully capture the connectivity in floodplain wetlands where water flows in different directions moreover these metrics are usually scaled between 0 and 1 making it challenging to compare the connectivity between catchments knudby and carrera 2005 proposed other indicators for flow connectivity considering flow channeling transport connectivity considering fast paths allowing early solute arrival and statistical connectivity the statistical connection between two or multiple points bracken et al 2013 it is suggested that the flow connectivity indicators present the changes in hydrological connectivity in high conductivity flow paths that are not observed by using the statistical connectivity indicators e g the connectivity function by western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 however the effective conductivity values used to calculate the flow connectivity indicators are estimated from field data which are costly and challenging to collect the index of connectivity ic defined by borselli et al 2008 represents the potential connectivity in different parts of a watershed although the ic accounts for the slope of flow paths and the topographical characteristics that contribute to water and sediment movements it can only give an estimation of the potential connectivity for a landscape instead of the actual hydrological connectivity for a specific event borselli et al 2008 to fill the research gaps it is essential to develop a metric that considers dynamic changes in hydrological connectivity and is suitable for ecological and hydrological applications the new metric should examine the flow direction along a river channel and from a river to floodplain wetlands the metric should also enable a comparison of the connectivity between different flood events and catchments this study aims to introduce a methodology and a connectivity metric to interpret surface water connectivity in a complex river floodplain wetland system the northern lakes of the narran river wetlands in australia are used to showcase the method remote sensing data are integrated with the hydraulic model lisflood fp and a new metric of dynamic connection length analysis is developed the main objectives are 1 to take advantage of remote sensing data to investigate the temporal connectivity in a remote and data scarce catchment and 2 to develop a novel metric to quantify the hydrological connectivity in a floodplain wetland statistically 2 methodology 2 1 study area the narran river catchment is located in the condamine balonne river floodplain in northern new south wales australia the catchment is recognized as an internationally important habitat for colonial waterbird and native fish species and is listed in the ramsar convention on wetlands brandis et al 2018 thoms et al 2008 the narran catchment is a complex river wetland system with many small drainages connecting water from the main river channel to the floodplain lakes the river channel is classified as a small river with a width varying from 25 to 50 m the river and the floodplain have a high vegetation coverage thoms et al 2008 therefore it is challenging to clearly identify the boundary between the main channel and the floodplain in some parts of the river this study focuses on the northern lakes of the narran river floodplain the narran river runs from north to south fig 1 c the northern lakes include clear lake long arm and back lake with surface areas of 5 4 km2 1 5 km2 and 1 3 km2 respectively fig 1 the river reach in this study area is 19 5 km long from the narran park gauge station to the bundah gauge station further downstream there is no clear seasonal flooding pattern in the study area and the water levels in the lakes are mainly driven by the flood pulses from the river junk et al 1989 thoms et al 2008 the highest flood event recorded from 2002 occurred in 2011 with a peak discharge of 110 m3s 1 the breeding of the waterbirds and the fish assemblage in the narran river wetland highly correlates with the flow volume input from the river to the floodplain rolls and wilson 2010 brandis et al 2018 according to brandis et al 2018 the cumulative flow volume must be maintained at 154 000 megalitres in the first 90 days of a flow event for breeding of waterbirds to occur in the wetland 2 2 remote sensing data the flood extents in the study area were observed using water observation from space wofs and sentinel 2 imagery these remote sensing data with a resolution of 25 m 25 m were selected to adequately capture the complexity of the narran river networks the satellite images of wofs and sentinel 2 were obtained from the digital earth australia sandbox developed by geoscience australia url https docs dea ga gov au index html the wofs images were derived from landsat 5 and landsat 7 satellite imagery available from 1987 onward mueller et al 2016 with a revisit time of 8 days with both satellites the wofs images present the detected water pixels using a decision tree classifier mueller et al 2016 the overall accuracy of wofs is 97 for the water vegetation mixed pixels the accuracy is 74 and for small water bodies the accuracy is 88 mueller et al 2016 the wofs dataset was compared with the global surface water dataset developed by the european joint research centre pekel et al 2016 the wofs images provide the flood extent maps associated with the acquisition time of landsat 5 and landsat 7 thus enabling the validation of the water extent results from the lisflood fp model the global surface water dataset provides monthly average flood extents which is an insufficient temporal resolution to validate the model moreover wofs can identify the main river channel and the channels connecting the river and the floodplain lakes while the global surface water dataset cannot therefore the wofs dataset appears to be more suitable than the global surface water dataset to assess the hydrological connectivity in the narran river catchment in the period from 01 01 2010 to 14 07 2019 there are 624 wofs images available however the scan line corrector off slc off errors in the landsat 7 images affect the products of wofs since wofs is derived from landsat 5 and landsat 7 markham et al 2004 mueller et al 2016 each of the classified images of wofs contains different flags for each pixel that indicate whether the pixel is affected by the slc off errors or is located under clouds geoscience australia 2019a by filtering the images from cloud cover and slc off errors 228 images with at least 80 error free pixels can be used for the temporal connectivity analysis the flood extents derived from the sentinel 2 images were used in combination with the wofs images to reduce the temporal interval of the observed flood maps and consequently to increase the confidence of the temporal connectivity analysis the sentinel 2 mission includes the two satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b the images from sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b are available from 23 06 2015 and 7 03 2017 respectively the european space agency 2015 the average revisit interval for sentinel 2 both sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b is 5 days at the equator the spatial resolution ranges from 10 m to 60 m depending on different bands the european space agency 2015 the sentinel 2 images were resized to 25 m using the nearest neighbor method to match the resolution of the wofs images and the lisflood fp model there are 417 sentinel 2 images available from 23 06 2015 to 01 07 2020 the analysis ready sentinel 2 images from the digital earth australia sandbox have boolean masks that allow filtering for cloud cloud shadow and invalid pixels after filtering for these problems 307 images are retrieved with at least 80 error free pixels the modification of normalised difference water index mndwi was used to extract the water pixels from the satellite images xu 2006 1 mndwi green swir green swir where green is the top of atmosphere reflectance of the green band and swir is the top of atmosphere reflectance of the shortwave infrared band the central wavelength and the bandwidth of the green band of the sentinel 2 image are 560 nm and 35 nm respectively the central wavelength and the bandwidth of the shortwave infrared band are 1610 nm and 90 nm respectively geoscience australia 2019b pixels with mndwi indices higher than 0 are classified as water cells as suggested by xu 2006 from fisher et al 2016 the threshold of 0 for mndwi was tested on landsat 5 landsat 7 and landsat 8 images in queensland and new south wales australia and resulted in an accuracy of 99 5 for pure pixels and 78 for mixed pixels this accuracy is comparable with the accuracy of the wofs dataset the flood extents from sentinel 2 were then compared with the wofs images a selection of images from both datasets with a temporal difference of fewer than 2 days was used it is assumed that there is no extreme change in the flood extent within 2 days difference from 23 6 2015 when the first sentinel 2 image is available to 31 12 2020 27 pairs of images are available for comparison the result proved a similarity in detecting water by the wofs and sentinel 2 images shown by the average of 93 match in the prediction of flooded pixels hence it is concluded that the two datasets have the same level of accuracy and is suitable to observe the temporal connectivity in the narran river floodplain wetland 2 3 the hydraulic model lisflood fp the two dimensional hydraulic lisflood fp model bates and de roo 2000 bates et al 2010 almeida et al 2012 almeida and bates 2013 was implemented to simulate the flood inundation in the upper narran river catchment this model has been widely used to simulate flood dynamics of different river catchments wwilson and atkinsonilson and atkinson 2007 grimaldi et al 2018 the shallow water equations swes describe the flood wave routing which expresses the conservation of mass and momentum in the version of lisflood fp in almeida and bates 2013 that was used here the local inertia approximation simplification is adopted thus ignoring the convective acceleration term in the swes this approximation has been found to lead to comparable results as the full swes with a faster computational time almeida and bates 2013 the input data include a digital elevation model dem a discharge hydrograph at the upstream gauge station narran park and initial and downstream boundary conditions for the model the 5 m lidar derived dem from geoscience australia was used url https elevation fsdf org au the vertical accuracy of the dem is 30 cm with 95 confidence and the horizontal accuracy is 80 cm with 95 confidence intergovernmental and mapping surveying and mapping 2010 the dem was then resampled to 25 m to reduce the model computational time stripe pattern errors in the 5 m lidar derived dem from geoscience australia are observed in the lower elevation area in the narran river catchment fig 1c the difference between the dark and light areas was checked manually and showed an elevation difference smaller than 0 2 m which is within the range of the vertical accuracy of the dem 30 cm the width of the deeper stripe regions is about 300 350 m it was stated that a limitation of the lidar derived dem is the interpolation error of the dem around the edges of the areas of interest intergovernmental and mapping surveying and mapping 2010 in the literature the stripe pattern error in the lidar derived dem is not mentioned clearly the discharge data at narran park gs 422029 from the australian bureau of meteorology url http www bom gov au waterdata was used as the upstream input boundary condition the initial condition was set as completely dry for both the river and floodplain because the north and east edges of the flooding domain have higher elevations the boundaries were set as no flow the boundary condition downstream of the river in the west and south edges of the domain is free flow which means water can freely flow out of the catchment without affecting the condition upstream the free flow condition forces the model to calculate the normal depth of the water level downstream using the slope at the last two river sections bates et al 2013 the lisflood fp model was calibrated by changing the roughness coefficients for a low flow flood event in 2010 and was validated for flood events in 2011 and 2013 fig 2 a low flow event was chosen for the calibration and validation to minimize the overbank flow to the floodplain this calibration strategy is used because the flat floodplain consists of a complex network of small channels when the water rises above the bank level and emerges between different sections it is challenging to identify the total discharge at a given river cross section the discharges and water levels at the downstream gauge station bundah gs 422031 were checked and compared with the measurements the main river channel was defined by running the lisflood fp model with a minimal and constant discharge input 1 m3s 1 until the river was connected from the upstream to the downstream end then two different manning s roughness coefficients were assigned for the river and the floodplain the range of river and floodplain roughness coefficients for different vegetation classes were retrieved from chow 1959 the vegetation classes were chosen based on the vegetation survey by thoms et al 2008 the manning s coefficient of the river bed was modified with steps of 0 005 between 0 01 to 0 06 m 1 3s because of the light vegetation for the floodplain the roughness coefficient was modified between 0 02 and 0 08 m 1 3s with steps of 0 005 due to the moderate to high vegetation cover moreover the flood extents from the model were compared with the wofs images for the flood events in 2011 and 2013 there are 12 error free images from wofs available for evaluating the modeled flood extent in 2011 and 2 images available for the flood event in 2013 the water level threshold to define the wetness was set as 0 01 0 05 0 1 and 0 3 m where 0 3 m is the vertical accuracy of the dem 2 4 performance metrics the root mean square error rmse the percentage bias pbias the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge were used to compare the modeled discharge and water level with the measured data calculated as 2 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 3 pbias i 1 n y i y i 100 i 1 n y i 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 5 kge 1 r 1 2 σ y i σ y i 1 2 μ y i μ y i 1 2 where y i is the modeled discharge or water level y i is the measured discharge or water level y i or μ y i is the mean of measured discharge μ y i is the mean of modeled discharge r is the linear correlation between modeled and measured discharge σ y i is the standard deviation of modeled discharge σ y i is the standard deviation of measured discharge and n is the total number of observations the rmse shows the relative error of the model compared to the measurement data therefore the lower values of rmse the better the model performance rmse 0 indicates a perfect match between modeled and measured results a positive pbias value means the model overpredicts the measurements knoben et al 2019 suggested that nse 0 and kge 0 41 indicates that the model is a better predictor than the mean of the measurements different performance metrics are used to compare the modeled flood extents with the wofs images including bias hit rate and the critical success index csi or f 2 as suggested in stephens et al 2014 the contingency table table 1 and the equations of the metrics are shown as following 6 bias a b a c 7 hitrate a a c 8 csi a a b c a bias value higher than 1 shows overprediction the hit rate shows the proportion of correct predictions of an observed flood the csi is suitable for comparing the accuracy of modeled flood extents since it does not account for the correct prediction of dry pixels it can avoid providing a too optimistic evaluation of model performance while the flooded area in the domain is generally smaller than the unflooded area stephens et al 2014 however it is biased toward overprediction and is affected by the size of the domain and the magnitude of flood events stephens et al 2014 the optimal value for hit rate and csi is 1 for those reasons the bias hit rate and csi measures were used together to compare the lisflood fp model results and the wofs images 2 5 measures of connectivity the popular geostatistical connectivity function or cf western et al 2001 trigg et al 2013 is used to analyze the hydrological connectivity in the narran river wetlands it is also used to compare and contrast with the new dynamic connection length metric 2 5 1 geostatistical connectivity function the geostatistical cf was employed to calculate the probability that two points at a certain distance connect to each other western et al 2001 pardo igözquiza and dowd 2003 trigg et al 2013 the algorithm applied in trigg et al 2013 which was developed by journel et al 2000 calculates the cf value for inundated cells based on a two dimensional 2d wet dry binary layer using either 4 way connectivity cells connect through the interface of the cells or 8 way connectivity cells connect through both the interface and the corner vertex of the cells the cf in journel et al 2000 calculates the likelihood that two points at a distance n have values of z u j all higher than a threshold value z c i e an elevation threshold cf is written as 9 p n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 where pr x is the probability that x is true i u j z c is an indicator of the variable z u j exceeding the threshold value z c and is the product operator i u j z c 1 if z u j z c and 0 otherwise therefore if there is a connection between two cells at a distance n all the values of i u j z c starting from 1 to n will be equal to 1 and the product operator in eq 9 will be equal to 1 the cf value p n z c calculates the probability that all the pairs of inundated cells separated by a distance n are connected to each other for example if there is a total of 5 pairs of inundated cells at a distance of 5 m with 3 of them connected to each other i e j 1 5 i u j z c 1 and 2 pairs not connected i e j 1 5 i u j z c 0 cf will be equal to 0 6 the geostatistical cf was calculated using the flood extents modeled by lisflood fp using the matlab code provided in trigg et al 2013 in the lisflood fp model water can only travel through the interface of cells so the 4 way connectivity was used in the analysis the n s and e w connectivities were analyzed to explain the connection between the narran river and its floodplain lakes 2 5 2 dynamic connection length the dynamic connection length analysis was introduced in this study to efficiently visualize surface water connectivity in a river catchment the connection length is defined as the distance of water traveling to a specific location from a water source e g the input discharge gauge station at narran park instead of considering the connectivity along a direction such as n s or e w as in the cf trigg et al 2013 the connection lengths are calculated for all the cells in the domain based on the flow direction in those cells two types of dynamic connection lengths are developed and defined as the total connection length tcl and the dominant connection length dcl the tcl indicates all the possible distances that water can travel from an input source to different locations in the floodplain the dcl shows the pathway that water prefers to travel by only considering the highest discharge coming in or out of each cell the analysis uses the outputs from the hydraulic model lisflood fp including water levels and discharges in both x and y directions in the model the water level is calculated at the center of a cell and the discharges are assigned to the edges of a cell an illustration of the connection lengths calculation is shown in fig 3 and the steps for its calculation are detailed below 1 the analysis is applied for the inundated cells with a water level larger than a certain threshold only the discharges higher than 0 01 m3s 1 are included in the calculation to avoid a small amount of water fluctuating between the inundated cells that may cause an unbreakable loop in the calculation of the connection length 2 a cell is marked as an input water cell or the water spilling source if it only provides water for surrounding cells and does not receive water from any cell at a given time step the input water cells are assigned a counter variable of 1 3 the connection length is calculated following the flow direction for both the tcl and the dcl the next cell along the flow path that receives water from a cell numbered n will be assigned a counter n 1 if a cell receives water from more than one cell around it different numbers corresponding to the tcls will be stored in that cell one dcl is associated with the direction of the dominant flow the largest discharge value into the cell the process continues until all the inundated cells are numbered 4 the relative frequency distribution of the tcl and the dcl are calculated to observe the variation of spatial connectivity at each time step the relative frequency is the ratio of the frequency of each connection length over the total number of connection lengths the spatial pattern and the relative frequency distribution of the dcl at different time steps present the dynamic connectivity variation of the catchment the relative frequency distribution of the tcl shows all available lengths of water traveling from one cell to another the analysis of the connection length results in the connectivity statistics including the maximum and the mean travel distance of water in the catchment the distribution of the connection lengths and the active cells with water movement the expansion and contraction of the flow network can be examined from the spatial pattern of the dcl overall the connection length analysis is expected to bring a comprehensive measure to quantify the hydrological connectivity of floodplain wetlands 3 results and discussions 3 1 observation of hydrological connectivity from the satellite images fig 4 presents the wofs images at different phases of the flood event in 2011 the contraction and expansion of the flood extents during the rising limbs and the recession periods can be observed from the satellite images during the flood peaks the maximum observed flood extent from wofs in fig 4g shows a clear connection between the river and the floodplain lakes through the channels in the upper floodplain area however because the width of the main channel is narrow 25 50 m the wofs images cannot present a continuous connection from the upstream to the downstream part of the main river channel furthermore the movement of the flood pulse from the river to the floodplain lakes during the rising limb at time a f in fig 4o cannot be distinguished from the flood pulse from the lakes to the downstream part of the river during the recession at times h k l and n in fig 4o therefore the observation of water extents from the satellite data alone is not adequate to examine the changes in connectivity at different phases of a flood event 3 2 model calibration and evaluation the calibration results and the performance metrics are shown in fig 5 and table 2 although a wide range of manning s coefficients were used in the calibration no reasonable match between the discharge and the water level at bundah was obtained for both the magnitude and flood arrival time the calibration of the model using manning s coefficients where the friction varied locally can fit water level results but not the flood arrival time neal et al 2015 the inaccuracy of the dem used as the model input might also explain this issue the input dem was resampled to the coarser resolution of 25 m 25 m resulting in shallower depths of the river bed moreover the dem which was derived from remote sensing data in our case from lidar can only capture the nearly clear shallow water surface but not the depth of river bed legleiter 2015 sampson et al 2015 the narran wetland is a complex river catchment with a narrow and shallow mainstream and many small streams with high vegetation coverage connecting the river to the floodplain lakes therefore the quality of the dem has a strong influence on the model performance and even minor errors can lead to the inaccuracy of the model results jarihani et al 2015 to overcome this issue the dem was modified by lowering the main river stream depth from the calibration of the river roughness the model with manning s coefficients 0 045 m 1 3s for the river stream and 0 07 m 1 3s for the flood plain has the most reasonable phase pattern compared to the measured discharge therefore these values were used for the calibration of the river bed the results from the models with the dem lowered by 0 3 m 0 4 m and 0 5 m are presented in fig 6 the model with the river bed lowered by 0 4 m resulted in the best outcome for the discharge and water level at bundah this model significantly reduces the rmse and the pbias values compared with the model with the original dem table 3 it also results in the highest nse and kge for the discharge among the models with adjusted depths of the river bed table 3 the calibrated model was tested against the flood events in 2011 and 2013 fig 7 and table 4 show the comparison of the modeled discharge for the two flood events to the measurements at the bundah gauge station the rmse values for the flood events in 2011 and 2013 are 5 128 and 2 840 m3s 1 which is approximately 10 of the maximum measured discharges the nse 0 and kge close to 1 suggest an acceptable performance of the model knoben et al 2019 there are 14 wofs images available for cross comparison with the flood extents from the lisflood fp model for the flood events in 2011 and 2013 the average performance metrics associated with each wetness threshold are summarized in table 5 for example the overlaps between the wofs image and the modeled flood extents with different wetness thresholds on 17 04 2013 are shown in fig 8 the csi values are higher with the thresholds of 0 01 and 0 3 m however it does not mean that the flood extents with lower wetness thresholds are incorrect although the flood extent with a threshold of 0 01 m leads to an overestimation of the flood extent it shows more details of the channels connecting the river and the floodplain lakes fig 8a the threshold of 0 01 m also results in the highest average hit rate value of 0 916 the connectivity between the river and the floodplain lakes can still be observed with a threshold of 0 05 m however when the threshold increased to 0 1 m or 0 3 m there is little to no flow from the river to the floodplain lakes fig 8d also shows a larger underestimated flooded area for the threshold 0 3 m even though 0 01 m seems to be a low water level it can be argued that it is sufficient to present the connection in a flat catchment as our study area in the study area with many connecting channels smaller than the resolution of wofs and sentinel 2 25 m the modeled flood extents are more adequate to observe spatial connectivity moreover in the dynamic connectivity analysis only the pixels with water movement the flow larger than 0 01 m3s 1 are considered so the pixels saturated with water are excluded from the connectivity analysis hence from the evaluation the model provides a reasonable prediction for discharges water levels and flood extents for the connectivity analysis it is suggested to evaluate a suitable wetness threshold depending on catchment conditions before applying the dynamic connectivity analysis 3 3 temporal connectivity analysis many studies that quantified the impact of the connectivity on floodplain wetland habitat required hydrological information such as the seasonal patterns of connection the duration of the connection and disconnection periods and the cumulative threshold volume or volume to connect required before connection occurred lesack and marsh 2010 robinson et al 2015 epting et al 2018 brandis et al 2018 however in most remote catchments long records and continuous measurements of the lake stage are not always available this study takes advantage of the accessible sources of remote sensing data from the wofs and sentinel 2 images to analyze the connection and disconnection periods of back lake and clear lake since there is a gauge station at back lake to measure the water level in the lake the water level data were used to double check the connectivity analysis of the lake in addition the gap fill method introduced in trigg et al 2013 was applied to connect the periods when there was no image available or there were slc off errors in the wofs images at the location of the lakes indeed it is unlikely for the lakes to connect in one time step disconnect in one or a few next time steps and immediately reconnect again therefore if the gap between two time steps of connection is less than 2 weeks the period in between will be considered as connected the connection of back lake observed from the wofs and sentinel 2 images overlapped with the water level time series at the back lake gauge station fig 9 a compares the connection of back lake observed from the wofs and sentinel 2 images to the water level time series at the back lake gauge station it is noticeable that there was an error in the measurement of the water level at back lake from 2013 the water level at back lake never went below 0 63 m even when the lake was observed to be completely dry from the satellite images there are small lags in the onset and the end of each connection period identified by the remote sensing data compared with the rise of the water level in the lake which can be explained by the coarse temporal resolution of the satellite images fig 9b compares the connection of back lake and clear lake identified by the satellite data with the discharge input at narran park the analysis on the connectivity duration demonstrates that there is no seasonal pattern in the connection between the river and the floodplain lakes in the narran river catchment the critical determinant of the water level in the lakes is the flood pulses from the river this is also observed in many other catchments robinson et al 2015 ameli and creed 2017 park and latrubesse 2017 since clear lake is a larger lake and is located closer to the river reach the lake received water from the river earlier than back lake and also remains connected for a longer time for all flood events during three minor flood events between 2014 and 2016 clear lake was also connected to the river when the back lake remained dry in our analysis from 2010 to 2020 there were 7 connections for clear lake and only 3 for back lake the most extended connection duration for back lake and clear lake are 995 days and 1073 days respectively it occurred during the high flood event from early 2010 to the end of 2012 the shortest connection for back lake is 35 days during the flood event from 18 10 2016 to 22 11 2016 the shortest connection observed in clear lake is 8 days due to a small flood pulse from 28 02 2016 to 8 03 2016 further analysis of the volume to connect indicates that back lake requires a more extensive volume input than clear lake to connect to the river the average volume to connect back lake is 32 000 megalitres while for clear lake is 2 000 megalitres it concludes that in the narran river catchment the volume to connect is strongly influenced by the proximity of the lakes to the river some other factors affecting the volume to connect and the duration of connection in different flood events but which are not included in the scope of this study are the rainfall evaporation infiltration and subsurface and groundwater flow lesack and melack 1995 karim et al 2016 ameli and creed 2017 3 4 spatial connectivity analysis 3 4 1 n s and e w connectivity the connectivity of the northern lakes in the narran river catchment was examined in the n s and e w directions based on modeled water levels from the lisflood fp model during the two flood events in 2011 and 2013 the timing of the analyzed time steps during the floods is shown in fig 2b c because of the orientation of our study area the cf in the n s direction presents the connection along the river channel in contrast the cf in the e w direction indicates the connection between the river and its floodplain lakes during the rising limb of the two events fig 10 a d fig a 1a d the cf values were close to 1 indicating strong connectivity both in the n s and e w directions during the recession periods fig 10e f fig a 1e f the values of cf decreased both in the n s and e w directions but earlier in the e w direction due to the disruption of the connection between the river and the lakes the shape of the e w cf curve transitioned from concave to convex during the two recession time steps a convex cf curve indicates fewer pixels with a long connection length and thus indicates a disconnection of the river from the floodplain trigg et al 2013 furthermore there were more significant fluctuations in the average cf time series in the e w direction than in the n s direction for both flood events fig 11 it implies that the expansion and contraction of flood extent due to the connection of the floodplain lakes is more significant than the change in the connection along the river channel after the river channel was connected upstream to the downstream end of the reach the maximum connectivity distances in the n s direction remained almost unchanged in some routing periods e g from 28 12 2010 to 16 02 2011 fig 11a there were minimal variations in the average cf values and the maximum connectivity distance in both the n s and e w direction during these periods water input mainly filled up the water level in the floodplain instead of contributing to the expansion of the flooded areas because the cf values are scaled between 0 and 1 the difference in the hydrological connectivity between a high flood event in 2011 and an average flood event in 2013 cannot be discriminated the cf values are close to 1 during the rising limbs observed in both flood events did not explain whether introducing more water to the floodplain results in higher connectivity to further parts of the catchments unlike the results of trigg et al 2013 and tan et al 2019 in our catchment there is no clear connectivity distance threshold caused by the clustering of cf curves for an extended period previous studies had shown that the connectivity threshold usually separated the period of expansion and contraction of the flood inundation area from the period when the water level of the floodplain was increasing but the flood extent maintained the same trigg et al 2013 however because of the flat topography and the shallowness of the river bed in the narran wetland the floodplain usually becomes flooded at the beginning of the flood event and the flood extent area consistently increases during the rising limb of the hydrograph therefore the connectivity transition is different from catchments with deep river channels this result is consistent with the conclusion from park and latrubesse 2017 who stated that the connectivity characteristics of a specific river are variable and that the topography has a strong influence on the water exchange of river wetland systems 3 4 2 dynamic connectivity the dynamic connection length analysis introduces an additional measure to investigate the spatial connectivity between rivers and floodplain wetlands two points in a catchment can be connected through different routes therefore the observation of dynamic connectivity and the water transport pathway can contribute to the understanding of the exchange of nutrients and sediments as well as the movement of fish in a river wetland balcombe et al 2007 long and pavelsky 2013 the advantage of the dcl analysis is that the connectivity at different stages of a flood event can be identified from the change in the shape of the dcl relative distribution an analysis of the cf value plot or the water extent maps does not have this advantage the variance of the dcl frequency distribution is smaller at the early time steps fig 12 a fig a 2a and increases in the later time steps of the rising limb fig 12b d fig a 2b d when the flooded area expands and the lakes are connected to the river during the recession there is a rapid reduction in connectivity the disconnection of the river from the floodplain can be indicated by the change in the cf curve shape in the e w direction fig 10e but it is even more apparent in the dcl figures fig 12e shows a decline in the connectivity between the upstream part of the river and the floodplain by a drop in the value of the dcl relative frequency at a distance from 7 5 to 10 km when the lakes were disconnected from the river at the end of the flood events the dcl distribution curve shifts to a reversed j shape and the frequency of the connection lengths lower than 7 5 km increases fig 12f fig a 2e f the analysis of connection length taking into account the flow direction can be used to comprehensively analyze the dynamic change in surface connectivity for example fig 12c d and fig a 2c d reveal that a larger amount of overbank flow from the river traveled to the eastern direction of the floodplain than the western side filled the lakes and then returned to the river in the downstream part additionally the spatial pattern of the dcl in fig 12b and fig a 2b demonstrates that clear lake was filled up by flow from both the upper river channel to the drainage in the north of the lake and the south of the lake during the later time steps of the recession period water from the lake drained to the downstream part of the river and the floodplain fig 12f fig a 2e f the backflow from the floodplain to the river is also an important contribution of the water exchange in a river wetland system li et al 2017 chen et al 2020 without the need to apply the particle tracking method as in li et al 2017 and chen et al 2020 the connection length analysis can also contribute to understanding the backflow mechanism another important hydraulic implication is that the statistics from the connection length analysis reflect the behavior of different floods that is not easy to detect from remote sensing data or flood extent maps more specifically different flood waves with various rates of increasing discharge have a tendency to fill different parts of the river and the floodplain thus for example after a similar cumulative volume of 2000 megalitres was delivered to the catchment in 2011 and 2013 fig 12a fig a 2a the flood extents and the connectivity frequency were different in the flood event in 2011 with the discharge increasing at a rate of 0 046 m3s 1h 1 water likely remained in the river channel until it reached the downstream end before involving the floodplain in contrast the discharge increasing at a higher rate at the start of the flood event in 2013 i e 0 111 m3s 1h 1 led to the overbank flow that flooded the upstream floodplain early in the flood event even while the river at the downstream end remained dry the variance of the dcl distribution curve in the initial period of the flood event in 2011 is smaller with one peak at a distance of 15 20 km while in the flood event in 2013 the curve has larger values between 10 20 km indicating that the floodplain upstream was already flooded understanding the behavior of flood waves with different input rates is essential for both ecological purposes and flood forecasting and warning in floodplain wetlands the tcl analysis can be also used to compare the maximum distance that water has traveled in a catchment at different stages of a flood event or between several flood events it is also possible to compare the maximum values of the dcl to the maximum values of the tcl the maximum values of the dcl do not vary significantly once the river is fully connected the maximum values of the tcl increase during the rising limb of the hydrograph and reduce dramatically during the recession fig 13 fig a 3 during the flood event in 2011 when the cumulative volume input of the entire event is higher 487 000 megalitres in 2011 compared with 86 000 megalitres in 2013 the maximum value of tcl at the peak discharge is also higher than the value for the flood event 2013 fig 13d fig a 3d the expansion of flooded areas can provide more connection routes and increase the flood travel distance in a floodplain which increases the heterogeneity of wetland catchments chen et al 2020 moreover the multi modality of the distribution indicates a change in the water source at different stages of a flood event the shape of the tcl relative frequency distribution becomes bimodal due to the disconnection between the river and the floodplain fig 13f fig a 3e the new peak of the tcl distributions at 7 5 10 km is formed by the backwater flow from clear lake to the floodplain downstream in addition the tcl relative frequency changes from symmetric curves in the early time steps of the rising limbs to right skewed curves during the later time steps but the peak connection lengths remain in the range from 15 to 20 km during the rising limb fig 13a e fig a 3a d the values of the tcl associated with the peaks of the relative frequency indicate the distance from the input point at narran park to clear lake which is the largest lake in the floodplain it means that in combination with the analysis the shape of the tcl reflects the dynamic connectivity behavior at different phases of the flood including the process of backflow in the catchment the connection length analysis can be accomplished using direct outputs from the hydraulic model leading to a comprehensive understanding of hydrological connectivity without requiring other complicated techniques 4 conclusions this study presents a novel metric to analyze hydrological connectivity in a floodplain wetland applied to the upper narran river catchment in new south wales australia both the total tcl and dominant dcl connection lengths are computed the tcl analysis calculates all possible travel distances from an input source to an inundated cell in the floodplain the dcl analysis considers the travel distance of the largest flow into each inundated cell the method calculates the connectivity along the flow path as opposed to the currently available geostatistical method connectivity function or cf which only evaluates the connectivity along the n s and or e w directions furthermore the dynamic change in surface connectivity is reflected in the relative frequency distribution of the dcl and the tcl and the spatial pattern of the dcl in contrast with the cf the proposed method identifies the change in connectivity at different phases of a flood event in a flat floodplain wetland additionally the typical connectivity behaviors in different flood events with different magnitude and duration can be examined a standout advantage of the dynamic connection length compared with other connectivity metrics is that it can be used to compare the hydrological connectivity between different phases of a flood event between different flood events and probably between different catchments moreover the new metric considering the actual flow can substitute both flow connectivity indicators and statistical connectivity indicators mentioned in knudby and carrera 2005 more information about hydrological connectivity can be obtained from the dynamic connection length analysis than from the flood extents from the remote sensing data finally the backflow effect or the flood pulse from the lakes to the rivers during the recession period can be indicated without other complicated methods some of the limitations are pointed out since the analysis requires a map of water discharge or velocity it is necessary to use a hydraulic or hydrodynamic model which can require extensive computational resources for large catchments the accuracy of the analysis highly depends on the accuracy of the model results in this study the uncertainties in the dem and the discharge and water level measurements are acknowledged therefore we suggest carefully calibrating and evaluating the model before applying the dynamic connection length metric the temporal hydrological connectivity of the upper narran river wetland was examined using the open and analysis ready sources of remote sensing data from wofs and sentinel 2 from the satellite images the observed connectivity durations of back lake and clear lake are highly correlated with the discharge input at narran park proving that the total volume and peak magnitude of the flood pulse are the main factors determining the water level of the lakes the present study indicates that the hydrological connectivity mechanism depends on many factors including the topography of the catchments consequently the behavior of the connectivity in the flat narran wetland can be expected to be different from other wetlands that connect to deeper river channels the findings in this study are expected to support further ecological research flood management and forecasting and the management

3881,understanding water level fluctuation patterns in the great lakes is one of the pillars for designing adaptive management practices that can mitigate the impacts of extreme water levels on shoreline infrastructure and associated economic activities the present study uses continuous wavelet transformation to conduct a two dimensional frequency scale spectral analysis on monthly water levels in lake huron michigan consistent with past work we detected 1 8 12 and 36 year quasi state periodicities in water level records during the 1860 2015 period the wavelet analysis revealed diminishing re emergent and or intermodulation patterns in the long term periodicities but the 1 year cycle has persisted throughout the temporal domain studied while the features of the dominant frequencies are consistent with previous findings the consideration of wavelet ridges with the continuous wavelet transformation yielded a complete picture of evolution in time frequency domain that is impossible to achieve with the same accuracy using conventional signal processing methods continuous wavelet transformation and analysis of wavelet coherence between hydrological and water level changes signified the role of runoff and evaporation as the primary drivers of water level fluctuations in lake huron michigan evaporation strongly influences the annual water level fluctuations whereas runoff and precipitation covary with the water levels in both intraannual and interannual cycles specifically analysis of phase differences indicated that runoff leads water level change by π 4 rad from 2 month up to 1 5 year cycles then runoff starts to become nearly in phase with small intermittent lags up to the 12 year cycle two main recurring cycles of 0 5 and 1 year finally we conducted a comprehensive assessment of 16 809 regression models which highlighted the effects of runoff minus evaporation in modulating the extreme high or low water levels which in turn could inundate the areas close to the shoreline or reduce the navigability in shallow parts of lake huron michigan keywords great lakes wavelet transformation water level fluctuation hydrological cycle

water levels hinder shipping and navigability within shallow canals limit hydroelectric power generation reduce tourism and recreational activities gronewold and stow 2014 alterations of hydrological cycle in the great lakes basin due to climate change have been manifested as increased air temperature and more intense but less frequent precipitation whereby wlfs are induced at different temporal scales lenters 2001 bai et al 2010 javed et al 2019 higher surface water temperature could be responsible for increased over lake evaporation reduced winter ice cover and periods of sustained low water levels which may be further accentuated by unusually dry years e g 2012 gronewold and stow 2014 the ever increasing population growth and subsequent expansion of industrial and agricultural activities in the great lakes basin influence the regional hydrological cycle and consequently the amplitude and periodicity of wlfs ghanbari and bravo 2008 mason et al 2016 owing to the combined anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past century the great lakes have endured greater wlfs than many marine coastal regions worldwide inducing the demand to regulate outflows between the lakes gronewold et al 2013 gronewold and stow 2014 considering the broad implications of large wlfs on the nearshore environment and the economy of the region understanding both short and long term wlf patterns and their hydrological drivers is profoundly important in this context a variety of statistical methods for the analysis of wlfs in the great lakes and the elucidation of their causal links with the hydrological and hydroclimatic variables have been employed cohn and robinson 1976 baedke and thompson 2000 sellinger et al 2008 hanrahan et al 2009 one of the first attempts to delineate prominent periodic patterns and draw long term forecasts of wlfs in the great lakes was presented by cohn and robinson 1976 using fourier analysis similarly baedke and thompson 2000 used a fourier based smoothing technique for the analysis of 4 700 years of reconstructed water level data for lake michigan determined by basal foreshore deposits the latter method could identify the major lake level fluctuations including the nipissing ii and algoma phases of ancestral lake michigan as well as quasi periodic lake level fluctuations occurring approximately every 160 120 to 200 years sellinger et al 2008 applied seasonal trend decomposition and dynamic linear modelling to examine the lake huron michigan lhm water levels recorded during 1860 2006 period the seasonal trend decomposition method indicated a water level decline since 1900 with a 30 year periodicity while the dynamic linear models signified a relationship between lake levels and precipitation over a 3 year lagged period wiles et al 2009 conducted a spectral analysis of reconstructed water levels for lhm using the multi taper method and detected various statistically significant fluctuation periodicities ranging from 5 8 to 160 years similarly hanrahan et al 2009 employed the multi taper method combined with monte carlo singular spectrum analysis to identify significant periodicities in the monthly water levels of lhm registered during 1865 2007 their analysis revealed significant water level periodicities between 8 and 12 years and also suggested a 30 year oscillation cycle but the statistical significance of the latter frequency could not be established due to the insufficient length of water level records the majority of the existing wlf studies in the great lakes have been based on methods pertaining to analysis of stationary signals even though water levels in most lacustrine systems are subjected to non stationary fluctuations and intermodulation 1 1 interacting frequencies can result in new frequencies through a process called intermodulation which can be estimated by the following trigonometric product identity sin x sin y 1 2 cos x y cos x y according to this process when two large scale oscillations are transmitted from the atmosphere to water other cycles can be observed in addition to the original ones and their intermodulated frequencies can be calculated by simply adding or subtracting the initial frequencies as shown in the right side of the trigonometric identity of quasi state periodicities in response to external terrestrial and atmospheric forcing in this regard the wavelet transformation is a viable tool for analyzing non stationary time series through decomposition of a signal in both time and frequency domains whereby the identification of frequency variations and modulation of quasi state wlf frequencies over time is allowed torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 to the best of our knowledge only few studies have used wavelet transform for the analysis of water levels in the great lakes cengiz 2011 employed continuous wavelet transforms to evaluate wlf patterns in lakes erie michigan ontario and superior during 1919 2004 period the spectral analysis of water levels in these lakes revealed annual and interannual variations over time with the annual cycle being the most pronounced wlf periodicity likewise altunkaynak 2014 combined wavelet transforms fuzzy logic and multilayer perceptron techniques to forecast up to one year 12 step ahead water levels in lhm in this context the present study applies continuous wavelet transform to characterize non stationary wlf patterns in lhm and shed light on their response to hydrological drivers compared to previous work our study employs a more advanced two dimensional time frequency wavelet analysis in order to capture non stationary fluctuations over time in both water level change and associated hydrological drivers by evaluating the evolution of wavelet coherence and phase relationships between their signals additionally our study evaluates the statistical significance of detected periodicities coherences frequency modulations and frequency shifts over time which have not received adequate attention in the existing body of literature a comprehensive statistical analysis of 16 809 multiple regression models is also conducted to evaluate the relationships between hydrological drivers and monthly water level differential and to provide insights into the selection of the optimal predictor variables we believe that the lessons learned from the present study can contribute to a better understanding of stationary and non stationary features of wlfs in the great lakes or other large water bodies around the globe and their interactions with the underlying dynamics of the hydrological cycle 2 methodology 2 1 study site and data lake huron michigan lhm with a surface area of 117 000 km2 is located downstream of lake superior and upstream of lake erie fig 1 lhm is considered a single water body as lakes michigan and huron are hydraulically connected through the wide 8 km and deep 37 m straits of mackinac fig 1 resulting in equal surface water level evolutions in the two lakes unlike the other great lakes lhm outflow is not tightly regulated for hydropower generation or commercial navigation and thus the signature of hydrological drivers on wlfs is more discernable hanrahan et al 2014 monthly averaged water levels during 1860 2015 and hydrological data including over lake evaporation and precipitation runoff from the surrounding watershed inflows from st marys river and outflow to st clair river and chicago diversion fig 1 were obtained from the great lakes dashboard of national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl the glerl estimates the total monthly precipitation based on daily measured data the glerl s monthly evaporation data are estimated from the daily simulations of the noaa s great lakes evaporation model croley ii 1992 croley 1989 croley ii and assel 1994 and subsequently corrected for land water and ice conditions croley ii 1989 monthly runoff is estimated based on daily stream flows from major rivers measured by the u s geological survey and water survey of canada runoff from ungauged catchments is estimated through extrapolation of daily streamflow using a flow per unit area method within the lhm basin croley ii 1992 2 2 wavelet analysis the present study used continuous wavelet transform cwt to identify oscillation periods of monthly wlfs and evaluate the variations of the detected oscillation periods over time since 1860 cwt is capable of analysing a time series in both frequency and time domains whereby both quasi state non stationary wlf periodicities in monthly water level records can be captured unlike fourier transform which is only limited to trigonometric sin and cosine functions for spectral analysis wavelet transform is flexible to use an arbitrary mother wavelet function that best pitches to the shape and characteristics of the wlf time series torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 this study used the morlet wavelet as this wavelet function has been previously used for the analysis of complex environmental signals grinsted et al 2004 the morlet wavelet function is defined as 1 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where ωo is the dimensionless frequency and η is the dimensionless time as a direct implication of the uncertainty principle for signal processing higher ωo values result in a greater frequency but lower spatial resolutions to provide a balance between time and frequency localization for feature extraction purposes the morlet wavelet with ωo 6 is recommended grinsted et al 2004 the cwt of the time series x n n 1 n is computed as 2 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s where t is the uniform time step for the time series x n one month in this study s is the wavelet scale and n s t for the morlet wavelet with ωo 6 the traditional fourier period λ is approximately equal to the wavelet scale λ 1 03 s the wavelet power at a given time and scale is given by w n x s 2 wavelet ridges which expose the dominant periodicities of w n x s 2 are extracted and overlaid on 2d time frequency plots the wavelet ridges were extracted by finding the local maxima that also exceed the 95 confidence level at the global wavelet power spectrum for a given frequency the global wavelet power spectrum at a given periodicity frequency are computed by averaging the powers at different times and the statistical significance 95 confidence level for both global and local wavelet powers was tested against a lag 1 red noise null hypothesis using a monte carlo analysis torrence and compo 1998 wavelets close to the beginning or end of the time series can be affected by the lack of information a cone of influence zone considering the edge effects was used for wavelet analyses more information regarding the cone of influence could be found in grinsted et al 2004 in addition to the water level the cwt was also conducted for hydrological parameters including runoff inflow outflow evaporation and over lake precipitation to evaluate their fluctuation patterns during the study period given the availability of data and consistency with the relevant literature our study was based on monthly averaged time series data wavelet coherence wtc analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the monthly water level change time series and hydrological variables wtc revealed the scales and instances at which two time series follow similar cyclic patterns and determines the phase difference between the two signals it is useful to think of wtc as a localized correlation coefficient in a time frequency space it is also worth noting that wtc can find coherence between two time series in the time frequency space even though the common power determined by cross wavelet transform could be low wavelet coherence between the two time series of x and y can be calculated as grinsted et al 2004 3 r n 2 s s m s 1 w n xy s 2 s m s 1 w n x s 2 s m s 1 w n y s 2 where w n xy s is the cross wavelet transform defined as w n xy s w n x s w n y s where denotes complex conjugation and sm is a smoothing operator in time and scale the monte carlo method was again used to evaluate the significance of coherence analysis at 95 confidence level by generating a large number of synthetic data pairs with the red noise lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient equivalent to the two input time series grinsted et al 2004 in this study we used the method developed by schulte 2016 to conduct significance testing for the global wavelet coherence of r n 2 s against a red noise background using monte carlo methods 2 3 multiple linear regression analysis the next step of our analysis aimed to develop multiple linear regression mlr models to shed light on the short term effects of hydrological factors on water level change to evaluate the effects of different hydrological variable as predictors in an mlr model the cross correlations between the monthly water level differential and lags of monthly values of different hydrological variables were calculated in the mlr models each of the five hydrological variables listed in table 1 i e monthly runoff evaporation over lake precipitation inflow and outflow were considered as predictors and the monthly water level differential was the targeted response variable all permutations of the five hydrological variables with up to 5 month lags 7 776 combinations were examined to determine the most parsimonious model that effectively balances between complexity and performance all possible subsets of the 5 predictors 31 possible subsets in each combination of hydrological variable were considered thereby leading to the examination of 16 806 unique mlr models to evaluate the performance of these mlr models two goodness of fit metrics were used namely the adjusted coefficient of determination adjusted r 2 and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1998 table s1 in supporting information section summarizes the goodness of fit metrics for the top 20 mlr models we also factored in our analysis the likelihood of collinearity among the predictors included within any given regression model using as a criterion the tolerance index tolerance is defined as 1 minus the squared multiple correlation of this variable with all other independent variables in the regression equation therefore the smaller the tolerance of a variable the more redundant is its contribution to the regression if the tolerance of any of the variables in the regression equation is 0 then the regression equation cannot be evaluated the matrix is ill conditioned and cannot be inverted specifically we ensured that the final model included predictor variables with tolerance values greater than 0 75 3 results 3 1 wavelet analysis of hydrological variables in reviewing the wlfs for lhm during the 1860 2015 period we observed larger amplitude fluctuations after 1915 fig 2 a the cwt for wlfs reveals multiple statistically significant quasi periodic oscillations including a 12 month cycle for the entire record 8 year and 12 year cycles during majority of the record a 36 year cycle during the last 100 years and a 24 year cycle that existed for a shorter duration from 1930s to 1970s as indicated by the wavelet ridges in wavelet power spectra fig 2b and s1 fig 2b further reveals that the time history of wlfs is characterized by periodicity and amplitude modulation involving bifurcation and merging of dominant periodicities near the harmonics and subharmonics of the fundamental period of 8 and 12 year i e 6 12 24 and 36 year in addition to the 1 year cycle four main frequency branches can be discerned inter annual 8 year decadal 12 year and two inter decadal 24 and 36 year scales most noticeably in the second half of the time history during the early part of the record between 1880 and 1920 the 8 and 12 year inter decadal cycles were predominant while the inter decadal scales were relatively weaker starting from the 1910s an abrupt bifurcation occurred with the revival of the 36 year cycle following the intensification of the 12 year cycle as manifested by the wavelet ridges and the black contours this is followed by the revival of 24 year cycle as the 8 year cycle strengthened in the 1920s the 8 year cycle became particularly pronounced from 1945 to 1965 while the 12 year oscillation diminished the 8 year cycle merged to a 6 year oscillation in 1980s while the 12 year cycle intensified and the 24 year cycle diminished the persistence of the 1 8 12 and 36 year cycles is manifested as 95 level significant oscillation periods in the global wavelet power spectrum fig 2c despite the sporadic occurrence of 3 to 4 year oscillations during the study period fig 2b these cycles were not found to be statistically significant at 95 level in the global wavelet power spectrum according to the historical records during the 1900 2015 study period over lake precipitation revolved around an average level of 65 mm year 1 fig 3 a the cwt for over lake precipitation suggests the occurrence of 0 5 1 2 5 6 and 36 year periodicities fig 3b but only the 1 6 and 36 year cycles are globally significant fig 3d the local and global biwavelet analyses also show coherence between water level change and precipitation for both intra and inter annual scales 2 2 the direction of arrows in the 2d coherence and 1d global coherence plots indicate the phase relationship in radians between the water level change signal and corresponding hydrological variable at any given scale for instance an arrow pointing to the right indicates an in phase relationship no phase difference between the water level change and the hydrological variable signals an arrow pointing up perpendicular to the x axes indicates that the water level change signal leads by π 2 rad which for a case of a 1 year 12 months cycle results in 12 months π 2 2π 3 months phase difference similarly if the arrow points to the left there is an anti phase relationship or the water level change leads by π radians fig 3c and 3e the statistically significant coherences occurred throughout the 6 year cycle as shown by the areas enclosed within the contours the 2 5 year 1 year and 6 month periodicities are also significant at smaller time frequency domains fig 3c and 3e analysis of phase difference shows over lake precipitation led water level change for all significant periods from 2 month to 8 years except for the 1 year cycle at which the water level change signal led by 3 months fig 3e compared to over lake precipitation runoff from the surrounding watershed experiences smaller and more regular fluctuation patterns during the annual cycle fig 4 a the cwt analysis also shows two main recurring cycles of 0 5 and 1 year fig 4b and 4d these cycles are consistent with the high runoff volumes associated with spring freshet events and relatively lower runoff during the summer nevertheless the global wavelet power spectrum shows a stronger wavelet power for the 1 year relative to the 0 5 year cycle fig 4c and 4e reveal strong coherence between water level change and runoff at different intra and inter annual periodicities up to 12 year which signifies the similarity of the fluctuation patterns between the two variables at multiple cycles analysis of phase differences indicates runoff leads water level change by π 4 rad from 2 month up to 1 5 year cycles then runoff starts to become nearly in phase with small intermittent lags up to the 12 year cycle after which the coherence of the two time series are not globally significant fig 4c and 4e the historical records suggest that evaporation varied around an average level of 50 mm year 1 throughout the 1950 2015 period fig 5 a strong annual periodicity is reflected in the wavelet power analysis fig 5b and 5d there are no major peaks nor wavelet ridges at inter annual scales likewise wavelet coherence between evaporation and water level change shows a distinct peak for the annual cycle fig 5c and 5e the wavelet coherence analysis also shows significant local coherence at a 3 7 year period between 1990 and 1997 then shifts to a 5 8 year from 2006 and thereafter nevertheless because of the local dominance of coherence at these cycles the global coherence plot shows smaller peaks at these periodicities than the annual cycle fig 5e consistent direction of the arrows in the coherence plots for the 1 year cycle indicates a nearly anti phase relationship where evaporation leads by 5 months signifying the inverse effects of evaporation on annual water level changes fig 5c and 5e inflows to lhm from st marys river display significant fluctuations with varying amplitudes and mean levels over extended periods during the 1900 2015 study domain fig 6 a water levels in st marys river are partly human regulated which contributes to the irregular behavior depicted by the inflow time series wavelet power spectra fig 6b reveals a statistically significant 1 4 and 10 year cycles in inflow time series the 10 year cycle initially emerged as a 11 year cycle then it gradually decreased to 8 4 year in 1950s and then weaken in mid 1950s and gradually shifted to the 4 year cycle around the same time as the 16 year cycle emerged the global wavelet power spectrum fig 6d detected statistically significant 1 10 and 36 year oscillations the wavelet coherence analysis shows coherence between inflow and water level change at 1 year and 4 to 12 year cycles during most of the historical records and 36 year from mid 1920s to late 1980s the global coherence plot fig 6e shows the globally significant coherence at 1 and 4 to 12 periods the phase difference shows inflow lagging water level change within a range between π 2 and π 4 rads at statistically significant cycles of 1 year and longer notwithstanding the considerable variability of the outflow time series historical data show a noticeable annual cycle fig 7 a also reflected in the wavelet power spectra fig 7b which however starts to weaken after 1980s in general the wavelet spectra is very similar to wlfs fig 2b with the presence of statistically significant periods at 1 8 12 24 and 36 year periodicities in both local and global plots fig 7b and 7d given the similarity between the two time series the wavelet coherence analysis showed statistically significant coherence with water level change for all periodicities longer than 1 year for the entire time history with water level change consistently leading by π 2 fig 7c and 7e 3 2 hydrological predictors of monthly water level changes according to our regression analysis the water fluxes associated with runoff evaporation over lake precipitation inflow and outflow had a distinct contribution to the monthly water level differentials and collectively accounted for more than 87 of the observed variability table 2 nevertheless the semi partial coefficients suggest runoff rsp 0 546 and evaporation rsp 0 431 are the main predictors of the best performing mlr whereas inflow rsp 0 173 outflow rsp 0 194 and over lake precipitation rsp 0 173 account for a relatively smaller portion of the variability in the monthly water level differential table 2 additional diagnostic statistics regarding the relative significance and minimal collearity among the the five variables used to predict the monthly water level change in lake huron michigan are also provided in table s2 partial regression plots for the strength of the relationships between individual predictors and the response variable are shown in fig s2 and reinforce the point that monthly water level differential and contemporaneous runoff levels display a strong relationship with a partial correlation rp of 0 837 runoff also recreated the widest range of water level change the relationship with the contemporaneous evaporation fluxes was nearly as strong rp 0 769 but accounted for a smaller range of monthly water level differentials fig s2 partial correlations with the inflow outflow and over lake precipitation that occurred concurrently 4 months and 1 month prior to the registered water level differential of interest were equal to 0 476 0 435 and 0 434 respectively while the associated linear relationships were characterized by a greater scatter and captured smaller ranges of the monthly water level differential after establishing the optimal regression model linking the month water differential with the major components of the water cycle we examined the variability of the corresponding monthly values within the annual cycle during the 1950 2015 period fig 8 a runoff and evaporation display the greatest month to month fluctuations whereas the partly human controlled inflow and outflow experience lower amplitude fluctuations during the annual cycle runoff is relatively greater in spring when the accumulated snow melts on the watershed surface resulting in the discharge of high volumes of water into the lake counter to the seasonality of air temperature the greatest evaporation rates occur between late fall and early winter fig 8a over lake precipitation displays minimal seasonal variability which is generally higher during late summer early fall and then gradually decreases until reaching its minima in winter these seasonal fluctuations of the hydrological variables collectively drive the highest and lowest lake water levels in mid summer and early winter respectively given that runoff and evaporation were identified as the primary predictors of the best performing mlr we conducted sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of these two variables on water level change on a monthly basis the influence of runoff and evaporation was assessed by generating 1000 inputs within their observed range for each month during 1950 2015 period while holding inflow outflow and over lake precipitation equal to their corresponding monthly values for the 1950 2015 period for illustration purposes we used the best performing mlr to evaluate the likelihood of extreme water levels to be experienced on the north bay s shorelines an area of commercial interest in southeastern georgian bay lake huron the long term average of recorded water levels indicates an elevation of approximately 176 4 m above the sea level gray color band in fig 8b our analysis showed that the lake water level could rise up to 177 6 m resulting in an inundation of all green areas in fig 8b conversely the extreme low water level scenario showed that lake water level can drop down to 175 4 m under which the navigability water pathways in north bay can be dramatically reduced to put our results into perspective we note that high and low water levels close to the predicted extremes have indeed been recorded in the area fig 2a wavelet power spectra also suggest that local maxima and minima occur approximately every 12 years when annual and inter annual fluctuations coincide fig 2a 2b and s1 4 discussion disentangling the role of the underlying drivers as well as the uncertainties pertaining to lake level trends over time is a critical piece of knowledge that can help water managers to develop mitigation policies and make decisions on infrastructural investments gronewold and stow 2014 our literature review of wlf studies on lhm indicated that the vast majority relied upon conventional stationary signal processing tools such as multi taper and fourier analysis or simpler methods including the evaluation of deviations from the long term mean and visual inspection of recorded reconstructed data to determine periodicities table 3 however elucidating the presence of modulations frequency shifts or other irregularities in water level time series requires the use of more advanced signal processing tools and therefore the present study aimed to shed light on the evolution of periodicities over time using 2d frequency scale wavelet analysis of water level records in lhm projection of periodicities detected through the wavelet spectra on the frequency axis yielded the 1d global wavelet power spectra which were equivalent to traditional 1d spectral analyses derived by the fourier or multi taper frequency analysis methods previous studies have often overlooked the characteristics of wavelet ridges by highlighting them in this study we have discovered more clearly the transitional oscillation modes in frequency scale for wlfs and hydrological variables our cwt analysis identified statistically significant 1 8 12 and 36 year periodicities during 1860 2015 which are fairly consistent with the 1 11 22 and 36 year periodicities originally reported by cohn and robinson 1976 using fourier analysis of historical water level records table 3 similarly hanrahan et al s 2014 2009 multi taper analysis showed two distinct 8 and 12 year oscillations driven by climatic signals from the north atlantic while their intermodulation was deemed to be responsible for the emergence of additional interdecadal oscillations drawing parallels with the latter study we hypothesize that the occasional appearance of 4 and 6 year cycles in our wavelet power spectrum could be sub harmonics half cycles of the quasi state 8 and 12 year periodicities with a careful inspection of our power spectrum plot we also identified the locally significant 22 to 26 year cycles during 1945 1968 when the 12 year cycle weakened which could be an evidence of intermodulation of the 12 year cycle with interannual cycles nevertheless the 22 to 26 year cycles were not strong enough to be statistically significant in our global wavelet plot striving to improve the characterization of periodicities at different time scales hanrahan et al 2010 pointed out that the outflow from lhm is directly proportional to lake water levels and may dampen the effects of climate related events consequently removing the outflow effects from historical lake levels may allow to fully capture climate related wlfs in doing so the same multi taper analysis on outflow corrected lake level data revealed 6 1 7 9 12 3 and 27 year periodicities when considering the uncertainty of spectral analysis hanrahan et al 2010 speculated that the intermodulation of 8 and 12 year periodicities can potentially result in oscillations of around 4 4 5 3 and 15 2 38 6 years and therefore the derived 27 year cycle could be the result of the interaction of the two near decadal cycles by contrast because the 6 year cycle was outside of the former intermodulation range it was perceived as a sub harmonic for the 12 year cycle rather than a distinct cycle similar to our work cengiz 2011 used cwt for the analysis of historical water level records in the great lakes and determined 1 4 9 11 21 28 and 43 year wlf periodicities in lake michigan but did not evaluate the statistical significance and likelihood of modulation of these periodicities interestingly the same study noted that the influence of inter annual atmospheric variability is more discernible in lake michigan which generally appears to display longer term periodicities relative to lake erie lake superior and lake ontario over the temporal domain studied in the same vein both polderman and pryor 2004 and sellinger et al 2008 reported 30 year fluctuation patterns in historical water level records in lhm table 3 given the limited length 155 years of the available historical lake water level records our study and other relevant literature could not identify wlf cycles longer than 30 years however thompson and baedke 1997 and quinn and sellinger 2006 who respectively analyzed 361 and 4700 years of reconstructed lake water levels based on sediment samples from beach ridges and tree rings reported fluctuation patterns of approximately every 150 years in their reconstructed records table 3 several efforts to establish proxies of the water level periodicities specifically examined the presence of a robust relationship with the sunspot activity sellinger et al 2008 for example earlier work from wilson 1946 identified a strong positive relationship between sunspot maxima and water levels in lake michigan from mid 19th century until the 1940s which was not confirmed by sellinger et al 2008 owing to a subsequent shift to a wetter regional climate in the area that obfuscated the delineation of the presumably causal linkages between sunspots precipitation evaporation and water levels changnon 2004 nonetheless sellinger et al 2008 asserted that even if the sunspot activity reflects only a small component of the lake level variability it is still important to establish the relative importance of all the factors that could modulate the impact of future climate change to lake level assessments previous attempts to characterize the relative importance of different water budget processes highlighted the role of precipitation as the single most important variable in modulating historical intra and inter annual lake level fluctuations consistent with our work hanrahan et al 2014 reported that the aforementioned presence of two dominant 8 year and 12 year signals in the lake level time series reflected the variations in the amount and frequency of precipitation events during the winter and summer months respectively the former cycle has been recently connected with variations in the moisture transport and precipitation totals in the great lakes region driven by temperature changes in the north atlantic hanrahan et al 2014 instead of earlier assertions that is associated with the pacific north american teleconnection pattern rodionov 1994 in contrast the 12 year cycle appears to be triggered by an upper air trough pattern situated over the great lakes that is responsible for the increased convective activity during the summer hanrahan et al 2014 hanrahan et al 2014 also identified a relatively strong correlation r greater than 0 45 between water level differential and contemporaneous precipitation values which is on par with our results reported in table 2 even more so both our regression and wavelet analysis signify the signature of the runoff time series on the monthly changes and inter annual periodicities of the lake water levels consistent with our finding gronewold et al 2016 highlighted the tributary runoff as the predominant driver of water level anomalies in the lhm system owing to the strong relationship between regional precipitation and runoff along with the higher land to lake area ratio relative to other basins in the great lakes system in particular the 2013 2014 water level rise in lake michigan huron was mainly attributed to the above average runoff and persistent over lake precipitation gronewold et al 2015 2016 and thus may have been responsible for imbalances in the water budget that could ultimately lead to cumulative lake level changes over time evaporation is frequently identified as a primary driver of the seasonality of the water budget arhonditsis et al 2004 gronewold et al 2015 2016 but its interannual variability is typically considered relatively minor with negligible effects on long term lake level changes hanrahan et al 2010 consistent with this expectation our analysis identified a strong annual periodicity and distinct signature of evaporation on monthly lake level differential but no major peaks or wavelet ridges at inter annual scales regarding the latter finding though hanrahan et al 2010 revealed an increasing trend in the annual evaporative losses since 1980 and about half of this increase appears to have occurred during the summer months while this pattern may seem counterintuitive given that summer evaporation is typically curtailed by the cooler water temperatures relative to those of the overlying air see fig 8a summertime water surface temperature has displayed a significant increase over the past few decades which may have been translated into an increase in water losses through evaporation hanrahan et al 2010 2014 in the same context our wavelet power spectra also showed a local coherence at a 3 7 year period between 1990 and 1997 followed by a shift to a 5 8 year cycle since 2006 which is also manifested as a strong anti phase relationship with the lake levels outflow is another major lake level driver with signals that show a significant peak at the 6 month cycle with nearly the same phase as runoff and precipitation counterbalancing their seasonal effects on the water budget overall the global wavelet spectrum for outflow follows a similar trend as the global wavelet spectrum for lake water level signifying the strong co dependence between outflow and lake water level as previously mentioned hanrahan et al 2010 argued that outflow does not directly respond to atmospheric processes but instead tends to dampen the climate related lake level fluctuations arising from the other hydrological components and conjectured that could be calculated as directly proportional to the lhm levels however the lagged relationships between outflow and monthly water level differential or their phase differences at different periodicities in our global wavelet coherence support the idea that the relationship between outflow and lake levels may not be as straightforward in lhm given that a multitude of additional factors appear to be influencing the outflow rates our finding is conceptually on par with the results presented by ghanbari and bravo 2008 who signified the coherencies between atmospheric teleconnections trans niño index pacific decadal oscillation northern annular mode arctic oscillation index and pacific north american pattern and connecting channel flows for lakes michigan erie and ontario as being stronger relative to the weaker direct correlations between teleconnections and individual hydrologic variables evidently water flows in channels connecting the individual lakes depend on the cumulative effects of upstream lakes and their corresponding watersheds and therefore the interannual and interdecadal atmospheric signals are more discernible compared with those to precipitation evaporation and air temperature ghanbari and bravo 2008 5 conclusions water levels in the great lakes fluctuate more widely than in marine coastal areas and can thus have profound impacts on a multitude of socioeconomic activities the present study conducted a comprehensive wavelet analysis on historical water level records and relevant hydrological variables analysis of 1d global wavelet power spectrum identified statistically significant 1 8 12 and 36 year periodicities during 1860 2015 which resemble to wlf periodicities reported in the previous literature while the features of the dominant frequencies are consistent with previous findings with the help of wavelet ridges the cwt yields a complete picture of evolution in time frequency domain that is impossible to achieve with the same accuracy using conventional signal processing methods the cwt and analysis of wavelet coherence between hydrological and water level changes signified the role of runoff and evaporation as the primary drivers of monthly wlf in lhm the same result was reinforced by multilinear regression analysis that considered the effects of different combinations of hydrological predictors on the month to month water level differential an illustrative application of our empirical model on the north bay s shorelines showed that the runoff minus evaporation monthly fluxes can induce water level fluctuations up to two meters with profound socioeconomic implications in light of recent evidence about the transmissivity of the signals of large scale atmospheric teleconnections the application of wavelet analysis could offer additional insights into the mechanisms that drive the diminishing re emergent and or intermodulation patterns in the long term periodicities of various hydrological processes the likelihood to shape the balance of the water budget and ultimately lead to cumulative lake level changes over time the introduction of atmospheric teleconnections could be an essential augmentation to establish more reliable forecasting tools of water level variability

3881,understanding water level fluctuation patterns in the great lakes is one of the pillars for designing adaptive management practices that can mitigate the impacts of extreme water levels on shoreline infrastructure and associated economic activities the present study uses continuous wavelet transformation to conduct a two dimensional frequency scale spectral analysis on monthly water levels in lake huron michigan consistent with past work we detected 1 8 12 and 36 year quasi state periodicities in water level records during the 1860 2015 period the wavelet analysis revealed diminishing re emergent and or intermodulation patterns in the long term periodicities but the 1 year cycle has persisted throughout the temporal domain studied while the features of the dominant frequencies are consistent with previous findings the consideration of wavelet ridges with the continuous wavelet transformation yielded a complete picture of evolution in time frequency domain that is impossible to achieve with the same accuracy using conventional signal processing methods continuous wavelet transformation and analysis of wavelet coherence between hydrological and water level changes signified the role of runoff and evaporation as the primary drivers of water level fluctuations in lake huron michigan evaporation strongly influences the annual water level fluctuations whereas runoff and precipitation covary with the water levels in both intraannual and interannual cycles specifically analysis of phase differences indicated that runoff leads water level change by π 4 rad from 2 month up to 1 5 year cycles then runoff starts to become nearly in phase with small intermittent lags up to the 12 year cycle two main recurring cycles of 0 5 and 1 year finally we conducted a comprehensive assessment of 16 809 regression models which highlighted the effects of runoff minus evaporation in modulating the extreme high or low water levels which in turn could inundate the areas close to the shoreline or reduce the navigability in shallow parts of lake huron michigan keywords great lakes wavelet transformation water level fluctuation hydrological cycle climate change signal processing 1 introduction the laurentian great lakes constitute the largest freshwater system on earth by surface area holding 20 of the world s unfrozen fresh surface water supply munawar et al 2005 gronewold et al 2013 the great lakes provide a wide range of economic and societal benefits including hydroelectric power generation commercial fishing municipal and industrial water supply transportation recreational boating and fishing to surrounding communities in canada and the united states assel et al 2004 large water level fluctuations wlfs could impose stress on a variety of ecosystem services and human welfare benefits obtained from the great lakes high water levels can result in flooding and erosion of shorelines lamon and stow 2010 whereas low water levels hinder shipping and navigability within shallow canals limit hydroelectric power generation reduce tourism and recreational activities gronewold and stow 2014 alterations of hydrological cycle in the great lakes basin due to climate change have been manifested as increased air temperature and more intense but less frequent precipitation whereby wlfs are induced at different temporal scales lenters 2001 bai et al 2010 javed et al 2019 higher surface water temperature could be responsible for increased over lake evaporation reduced winter ice cover and periods of sustained low water levels which may be further accentuated by unusually dry years e g 2012 gronewold and stow 2014 the ever increasing population growth and subsequent expansion of industrial and agricultural activities in the great lakes basin influence the regional hydrological cycle and consequently the amplitude and periodicity of wlfs ghanbari and bravo 2008 mason et al 2016 owing to the combined anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past century the great lakes have endured greater wlfs than many marine coastal regions worldwide inducing the demand to regulate outflows between the lakes gronewold et al 2013 gronewold and stow 2014 considering the broad implications of large wlfs on the nearshore environment and the economy of the region understanding both short and long term wlf patterns and their hydrological drivers is profoundly important in this context a variety of statistical methods for the analysis of wlfs in the great lakes and the elucidation of their causal links with the hydrological and hydroclimatic variables have been employed cohn and robinson 1976 baedke and thompson 2000 sellinger et al 2008 hanrahan et al 2009 one of the first attempts to delineate prominent periodic patterns and draw long term forecasts of wlfs in the great lakes was presented by cohn and robinson 1976 using fourier analysis similarly baedke and thompson 2000 used a fourier based smoothing technique for the analysis of 4 700 years of reconstructed water level data for lake michigan determined by basal foreshore deposits the latter method could identify the major lake level fluctuations including the nipissing ii and algoma phases of ancestral lake michigan as well as quasi periodic lake level fluctuations occurring approximately every 160 120 to 200 years sellinger et al 2008 applied seasonal trend decomposition and dynamic linear modelling to examine the lake huron michigan lhm water levels recorded during 1860 2006 period the seasonal trend decomposition method indicated a water level decline since 1900 with a 30 year periodicity while the dynamic linear models signified a relationship between lake levels and precipitation over a 3 year lagged period wiles et al 2009 conducted a spectral analysis of reconstructed water levels for lhm using the multi taper method and detected various statistically significant fluctuation periodicities ranging from 5 8 to 160 years similarly hanrahan et al 2009 employed the multi taper method combined with monte carlo singular spectrum analysis to identify significant periodicities in the monthly water levels of lhm registered during 1865 2007 their analysis revealed significant water level periodicities between 8 and 12 years and also suggested a 30 year oscillation cycle but the statistical significance of the latter frequency could not be established due to the insufficient length of water level records the majority of the existing wlf studies in the great lakes have been based on methods pertaining to analysis of stationary signals even though water levels in most lacustrine systems are subjected to non stationary fluctuations and intermodulation 1 1 interacting frequencies can result in new frequencies through a process called intermodulation which can be estimated by the following trigonometric product identity sin x sin y 1 2 cos x y cos x y according to this process when two large scale oscillations are transmitted from the atmosphere to water other cycles can be observed in addition to the original ones and their intermodulated frequencies can be calculated by simply adding or subtracting the initial frequencies as shown in the right side of the trigonometric identity of quasi state periodicities in response to external terrestrial and atmospheric forcing in this regard the wavelet transformation is a viable tool for analyzing non stationary time series through decomposition of a signal in both time and frequency domains whereby the identification of frequency variations and modulation of quasi state wlf frequencies over time is allowed torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 to the best of our knowledge only few studies have used wavelet transform for the analysis of water levels in the great lakes cengiz 2011 employed continuous wavelet transforms to evaluate wlf patterns in lakes erie michigan ontario and superior during 1919 2004 period the spectral analysis of water levels in these lakes revealed annual and interannual variations over time with the annual cycle being the most pronounced wlf periodicity likewise altunkaynak 2014 combined wavelet transforms fuzzy logic and multilayer perceptron techniques to forecast up to one year 12 step ahead water levels in lhm in this context the present study applies continuous wavelet transform to characterize non stationary wlf patterns in lhm and shed light on their response to hydrological drivers compared to previous work our study employs a more advanced two dimensional time frequency wavelet analysis in order to capture non stationary fluctuations over time in both water level change and associated hydrological drivers by evaluating the evolution of wavelet coherence and phase relationships between their signals additionally our study evaluates the statistical significance of detected periodicities coherences frequency modulations and frequency shifts over time which have not received adequate attention in the existing body of literature a comprehensive statistical analysis of 16 809 multiple regression models is also conducted to evaluate the relationships between hydrological drivers and monthly water level differential and to provide insights into the selection of the optimal predictor variables we believe that the lessons learned from the present study can contribute to a better understanding of stationary and non stationary features of wlfs in the great lakes or other large water bodies around the globe and their interactions with the underlying dynamics of the hydrological cycle 2 methodology 2 1 study site and data lake huron michigan lhm with a surface area of 117 000 km2 is located downstream of lake superior and upstream of lake erie fig 1 lhm is considered a single water body as lakes michigan and huron are hydraulically connected through the wide 8 km and deep 37 m straits of mackinac fig 1 resulting in equal surface water level evolutions in the two lakes unlike the other great lakes lhm outflow is not tightly regulated for hydropower generation or commercial navigation and thus the signature of hydrological drivers on wlfs is more discernable hanrahan et al 2014 monthly averaged water levels during 1860 2015 and hydrological data including over lake evaporation and precipitation runoff from the surrounding watershed inflows from st marys river and outflow to st clair river and chicago diversion fig 1 were obtained from the great lakes dashboard of national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl the glerl estimates the total monthly precipitation based on daily measured data the glerl s monthly evaporation data are estimated from the daily simulations of the noaa s great lakes evaporation model croley ii 1992 croley 1989 croley ii and assel 1994 and subsequently corrected for land water and ice conditions croley ii 1989 monthly runoff is estimated based on daily stream flows from major rivers measured by the u s geological survey and water survey of canada runoff from ungauged catchments is estimated through extrapolation of daily streamflow using a flow per unit area method within the lhm basin croley ii 1992 2 2 wavelet analysis the present study used continuous wavelet transform cwt to identify oscillation periods of monthly wlfs and evaluate the variations of the detected oscillation periods over time since 1860 cwt is capable of analysing a time series in both frequency and time domains whereby both quasi state non stationary wlf periodicities in monthly water level records can be captured unlike fourier transform which is only limited to trigonometric sin and cosine functions for spectral analysis wavelet transform is flexible to use an arbitrary mother wavelet function that best pitches to the shape and characteristics of the wlf time series torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 this study used the morlet wavelet as this wavelet function has been previously used for the analysis of complex environmental signals grinsted et al 2004 the morlet wavelet function is defined as 1 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where ωo is the dimensionless frequency and η is the dimensionless time as a direct implication of the uncertainty principle for signal processing higher ωo values result in a greater frequency but lower spatial resolutions to provide a balance between time and frequency localization for feature extraction purposes the morlet wavelet with ωo 6 is recommended grinsted et al 2004 the cwt of the time series x n n 1 n is computed as 2 w n x s δ t s n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t s where t is the uniform time step for the time series x n one month in this study s is the wavelet scale and n s t for the morlet wavelet with ωo 6 the traditional fourier period λ is approximately equal to the wavelet scale λ 1 03 s the wavelet power at a given time and scale is given by w n x s 2 wavelet ridges which expose the dominant periodicities of w n x s 2 are extracted and overlaid on 2d time frequency plots the wavelet ridges were extracted by finding the local maxima that also exceed the 95 confidence level at the global wavelet power spectrum for a given frequency the global wavelet power spectrum at a given periodicity frequency are computed by averaging the powers at different times and the statistical significance 95 confidence level for both global and local wavelet powers was tested against a lag 1 red noise null hypothesis using a monte carlo analysis torrence and compo 1998 wavelets close to the beginning or end of the time series can be affected by the lack of information a cone of influence zone considering the edge effects was used for wavelet analyses more information regarding the cone of influence could be found in grinsted et al 2004 in addition to the water level the cwt was also conducted for hydrological parameters including runoff inflow outflow evaporation and over lake precipitation to evaluate their fluctuation patterns during the study period given the availability of data and consistency with the relevant literature our study was based on monthly averaged time series data wavelet coherence wtc analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the monthly water level change time series and hydrological variables wtc revealed the scales and instances at which two time series follow similar cyclic patterns and determines the phase difference between the two signals it is useful to think of wtc as a localized correlation coefficient in a time frequency space it is also worth noting that wtc can find coherence between two time series in the time frequency space even though the common power determined by cross wavelet transform could be low wavelet coherence between the two time series of x and y can be calculated as grinsted et al 2004 3 r n 2 s s m s 1 w n xy s 2 s m s 1 w n x s 2 s m s 1 w n y s 2 where w n xy s is the cross wavelet transform defined as w n xy s w n x s w n y s where denotes complex conjugation and sm is a smoothing operator in time and scale the monte carlo method was again used to evaluate the significance of coherence analysis at 95 confidence level by generating a large number of synthetic data pairs with the red noise lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient equivalent to the two input time series grinsted et al 2004 in this study we used the method developed by schulte 2016 to conduct significance testing for the global wavelet coherence of r n 2 s against a red noise background using monte carlo methods 2 3 multiple linear regression analysis the next step of our analysis aimed to develop multiple linear regression mlr models to shed light on the short term effects of hydrological factors on water level change to evaluate the effects of different hydrological variable as predictors in an mlr model the cross correlations between the monthly water level differential and lags of monthly values of different hydrological variables were calculated in the mlr models each of the five hydrological variables listed in table 1 i e monthly runoff evaporation over lake precipitation inflow and outflow were considered as predictors and the monthly water level differential was the targeted response variable all permutations of the five hydrological variables with up to 5 month lags 7 776 combinations were examined to determine the most parsimonious model that effectively balances between complexity and performance all possible subsets of the 5 predictors 31 possible subsets in each combination of hydrological variable were considered thereby leading to the examination of 16 806 unique mlr models to evaluate the performance of these mlr models two goodness of fit metrics were used namely the adjusted coefficient of determination adjusted r 2 and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1998 table s1 in supporting information section summarizes the goodness of fit metrics for the top 20 mlr models we also factored in our analysis the likelihood of collinearity among the predictors included within any given regression model using as a criterion the tolerance index tolerance is defined as 1 minus the squared multiple correlation of this variable with all other independent variables in the regression equation therefore the smaller the tolerance of a variable the more redundant is its contribution to the regression if the tolerance of any of the variables in the regression equation is 0 then the regression equation cannot be evaluated the matrix is ill conditioned and cannot be inverted specifically we ensured that the final model included predictor variables with tolerance values greater than 0 75 3 results 3 1 wavelet analysis of hydrological variables in reviewing the wlfs for lhm during the 1860 2015 period we observed larger amplitude fluctuations after 1915 fig 2 a the cwt for wlfs reveals multiple statistically significant quasi periodic oscillations including a 12 month cycle for the entire record 8 year and 12 year cycles during majority of the record a 36 year cycle during the last 100 years and a 24 year cycle that existed for a shorter duration from 1930s to 1970s as indicated by the wavelet ridges in wavelet power spectra fig 2b and s1 fig 2b further reveals that the time history of wlfs is characterized by periodicity and amplitude modulation involving bifurcation and merging of dominant periodicities near the harmonics and subharmonics of the fundamental period of 8 and 12 year i e 6 12 24 and 36 year in addition to the 1 year cycle four main frequency branches can be discerned inter annual 8 year decadal 12 year and two inter decadal 24 and 36 year scales most noticeably in the second half of the time history during the early part of the record between 1880 and 1920 the 8 and 12 year inter decadal cycles were predominant while the inter decadal scales were relatively weaker starting from the 1910s an abrupt bifurcation occurred with the revival of the 36 year cycle following the intensification of the 12 year cycle as manifested by the wavelet ridges and the black contours this is followed by the revival of 24 year cycle as the 8 year cycle strengthened in the 1920s the 8 year cycle became particularly pronounced from 1945 to 1965 while the 12 year oscillation diminished the 8 year cycle merged to a 6 year oscillation in 1980s while the 12 year cycle intensified and the 24 year cycle diminished the persistence of the 1 8 12 and 36 year cycles is manifested as 95 level significant oscillation periods in the global wavelet power spectrum fig 2c despite the sporadic occurrence of 3 to 4 year oscillations during the study period fig 2b these cycles were not found to be statistically significant at 95 level in the global wavelet power spectrum according to the historical records during the 1900 2015 study period over lake precipitation revolved around an average level of 65 mm year 1 fig 3 a the cwt for over lake precipitation suggests the occurrence of 0 5 1 2 5 6 and 36 year periodicities fig 3b but only the 1 6 and 36 year cycles are globally significant fig 3d the local and global biwavelet analyses also show coherence between water level change and precipitation for both intra and inter annual scales 2 2 the direction of arrows in the 2d coherence and 1d global coherence plots indicate the phase relationship in radians between the water level change signal and corresponding hydrological variable at any given scale for instance an arrow pointing to the right indicates an in phase relationship no phase difference between the water level change and the hydrological variable signals an arrow pointing up perpendicular to the x axes indicates that the water level change signal leads by π 2 rad which for a case of a 1 year 12 months cycle results in 12 months π 2 2π 3 months phase difference similarly if the arrow points to the left there is an anti phase relationship or the water level change leads by π radians fig 3c and 3e the statistically significant coherences occurred throughout the 6 year cycle as shown by the areas enclosed within the contours the 2 5 year 1 year and 6 month periodicities are also significant at smaller time frequency domains fig 3c and 3e analysis of phase difference shows over lake precipitation led water level change for all significant periods from 2 month to 8 years except for the 1 year cycle at which the water level change signal led by 3 months fig 3e compared to over lake precipitation runoff from the surrounding watershed experiences smaller and more regular fluctuation patterns during the annual cycle fig 4 a the cwt analysis also shows two main recurring cycles of 0 5 and 1 year fig 4b and 4d these cycles are consistent with the high runoff volumes associated with spring freshet events and relatively lower runoff during the summer nevertheless the global wavelet power spectrum shows a stronger wavelet power for the 1 year relative to the 0 5 year cycle fig 4c and 4e reveal strong coherence between water level change and runoff at different intra and inter annual periodicities up to 12 year which signifies the similarity of the fluctuation patterns between the two variables at multiple cycles analysis of phase differences indicates runoff leads water level change by π 4 rad from 2 month up to 1 5 year cycles then runoff starts to become nearly in phase with small intermittent lags up to the 12 year cycle after which the coherence of the two time series are not globally significant fig 4c and 4e the historical records suggest that evaporation varied around an average level of 50 mm year 1 throughout the 1950 2015 period fig 5 a strong annual periodicity is reflected in the wavelet power analysis fig 5b and 5d there are no major peaks nor wavelet ridges at inter annual scales likewise wavelet coherence between evaporation and water level change shows a distinct peak for the annual cycle fig 5c and 5e the wavelet coherence analysis also shows significant local coherence at a 3 7 year period between 1990 and 1997 then shifts to a 5 8 year from 2006 and thereafter nevertheless because of the local dominance of coherence at these cycles the global coherence plot shows smaller peaks at these periodicities than the annual cycle fig 5e consistent direction of the arrows in the coherence plots for the 1 year cycle indicates a nearly anti phase relationship where evaporation leads by 5 months signifying the inverse effects of evaporation on annual water level changes fig 5c and 5e inflows to lhm from st marys river display significant fluctuations with varying amplitudes and mean levels over extended periods during the 1900 2015 study domain fig 6 a water levels in st marys river are partly human regulated which contributes to the irregular behavior depicted by the inflow time series wavelet power spectra fig 6b reveals a statistically significant 1 4 and 10 year cycles in inflow time series the 10 year cycle initially emerged as a 11 year cycle then it gradually decreased to 8 4 year in 1950s and then weaken in mid 1950s and gradually shifted to the 4 year cycle around the same time as the 16 year cycle emerged the global wavelet power spectrum fig 6d detected statistically significant 1 10 and 36 year oscillations the wavelet coherence analysis shows coherence between inflow and water level change at 1 year and 4 to 12 year cycles during most of the historical records and 36 year from mid 1920s to late 1980s the global coherence plot fig 6e shows the globally significant coherence at 1 and 4 to 12 periods the phase difference shows inflow lagging water level change within a range between π 2 and π 4 rads at statistically significant cycles of 1 year and longer notwithstanding the considerable variability of the outflow time series historical data show a noticeable annual cycle fig 7 a also reflected in the wavelet power spectra fig 7b which however starts to weaken after 1980s in general the wavelet spectra is very similar to wlfs fig 2b with the presence of statistically significant periods at 1 8 12 24 and 36 year periodicities in both local and global plots fig 7b and 7d given the similarity between the two time series the wavelet coherence analysis showed statistically significant coherence with water level change for all periodicities longer than 1 year for the entire time history with water level change consistently leading by π 2 fig 7c and 7e 3 2 hydrological predictors of monthly water level changes according to our regression analysis the water fluxes associated with runoff evaporation over lake precipitation inflow and outflow had a distinct contribution to the monthly water level differentials and collectively accounted for more than 87 of the observed variability table 2 nevertheless the semi partial coefficients suggest runoff rsp 0 546 and evaporation rsp 0 431 are the main predictors of the best performing mlr whereas inflow rsp 0 173 outflow rsp 0 194 and over lake precipitation rsp 0 173 account for a relatively smaller portion of the variability in the monthly water level differential table 2 additional diagnostic statistics regarding the relative significance and minimal collearity among the the five variables used to predict the monthly water level change in lake huron michigan are also provided in table s2 partial regression plots for the strength of the relationships between individual predictors and the response variable are shown in fig s2 and reinforce the point that monthly water level differential and contemporaneous runoff levels display a strong relationship with a partial correlation rp of 0 837 runoff also recreated the widest range of water level change the relationship with the contemporaneous evaporation fluxes was nearly as strong rp 0 769 but accounted for a smaller range of monthly water level differentials fig s2 partial correlations with the inflow outflow and over lake precipitation that occurred concurrently 4 months and 1 month prior to the registered water level differential of interest were equal to 0 476 0 435 and 0 434 respectively while the associated linear relationships were characterized by a greater scatter and captured smaller ranges of the monthly water level differential after establishing the optimal regression model linking the month water differential with the major components of the water cycle we examined the variability of the corresponding monthly values within the annual cycle during the 1950 2015 period fig 8 a runoff and evaporation display the greatest month to month fluctuations whereas the partly human controlled inflow and outflow experience lower amplitude fluctuations during the annual cycle runoff is relatively greater in spring when the accumulated snow melts on the watershed surface resulting in the discharge of high volumes of water into the lake counter to the seasonality of air temperature the greatest evaporation rates occur between late fall and early winter fig 8a over lake precipitation displays minimal seasonal variability which is generally higher during late summer early fall and then gradually decreases until reaching its minima in winter these seasonal fluctuations of the hydrological variables collectively drive the highest and lowest lake water levels in mid summer and early winter respectively given that runoff and evaporation were identified as the primary predictors of the best performing mlr we conducted sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of these two variables on water level change on a monthly basis the influence of runoff and evaporation was assessed by generating 1000 inputs within their observed range for each month during 1950 2015 period while holding inflow outflow and over lake precipitation equal to their corresponding monthly values for the 1950 2015 period for illustration purposes we used the best performing mlr to evaluate the likelihood of extreme water levels to be experienced on the north bay s shorelines an area of commercial interest in southeastern georgian bay lake huron the long term average of recorded water levels indicates an elevation of approximately 176 4 m above the sea level gray color band in fig 8b our analysis showed that the lake water level could rise up to 177 6 m resulting in an inundation of all green areas in fig 8b conversely the extreme low water level scenario showed that lake water level can drop down to 175 4 m under which the navigability water pathways in north bay can be dramatically reduced to put our results into perspective we note that high and low water levels close to the predicted extremes have indeed been recorded in the area fig 2a wavelet power spectra also suggest that local maxima and minima occur approximately every 12 years when annual and inter annual fluctuations coincide fig 2a 2b and s1 4 discussion disentangling the role of the underlying drivers as well as the uncertainties pertaining to lake level trends over time is a critical piece of knowledge that can help water managers to develop mitigation policies and make decisions on infrastructural investments gronewold and stow 2014 our literature review of wlf studies on lhm indicated that the vast majority relied upon conventional stationary signal processing tools such as multi taper and fourier analysis or simpler methods including the evaluation of deviations from the long term mean and visual inspection of recorded reconstructed data to determine periodicities table 3 however elucidating the presence of modulations frequency shifts or other irregularities in water level time series requires the use of more advanced signal processing tools and therefore the present study aimed to shed light on the evolution of periodicities over time using 2d frequency scale wavelet analysis of water level records in lhm projection of periodicities detected through the wavelet spectra on the frequency axis yielded the 1d global wavelet power spectra which were equivalent to traditional 1d spectral analyses derived by the fourier or multi taper frequency analysis methods previous studies have often overlooked the characteristics of wavelet ridges by highlighting them in this study we have discovered more clearly the transitional oscillation modes in frequency scale for wlfs and hydrological variables our cwt analysis identified statistically significant 1 8 12 and 36 year periodicities during 1860 2015 which are fairly consistent with the 1 11 22 and 36 year periodicities originally reported by cohn and robinson 1976 using fourier analysis of historical water level records table 3 similarly hanrahan et al s 2014 2009 multi taper analysis showed two distinct 8 and 12 year oscillations driven by climatic signals from the north atlantic while their intermodulation was deemed to be responsible for the emergence of additional interdecadal oscillations drawing parallels with the latter study we hypothesize that the occasional appearance of 4 and 6 year cycles in our wavelet power spectrum could be sub harmonics half cycles of the quasi state 8 and 12 year periodicities with a careful inspection of our power spectrum plot we also identified the locally significant 22 to 26 year cycles during 1945 1968 when the 12 year cycle weakened which could be an evidence of intermodulation of the 12 year cycle with interannual cycles nevertheless the 22 to 26 year cycles were not strong enough to be statistically significant in our global wavelet plot striving to improve the characterization of periodicities at different time scales hanrahan et al 2010 pointed out that the outflow from lhm is directly proportional to lake water levels and may dampen the effects of climate related events consequently removing the outflow effects from historical lake levels may allow to fully capture climate related wlfs in doing so the same multi taper analysis on outflow corrected lake level data revealed 6 1 7 9 12 3 and 27 year periodicities when considering the uncertainty of spectral analysis hanrahan et al 2010 speculated that the intermodulation of 8 and 12 year periodicities can potentially result in oscillations of around 4 4 5 3 and 15 2 38 6 years and therefore the derived 27 year cycle could be the result of the interaction of the two near decadal cycles by contrast because the 6 year cycle was outside of the former intermodulation range it was perceived as a sub harmonic for the 12 year cycle rather than a distinct cycle similar to our work cengiz 2011 used cwt for the analysis of historical water level records in the great lakes and determined 1 4 9 11 21 28 and 43 year wlf periodicities in lake michigan but did not evaluate the statistical significance and likelihood of modulation of these periodicities interestingly the same study noted that the influence of inter annual atmospheric variability is more discernible in lake michigan which generally appears to display longer term periodicities relative to lake erie lake superior and lake ontario over the temporal domain studied in the same vein both polderman and pryor 2004 and sellinger et al 2008 reported 30 year fluctuation patterns in historical water level records in lhm table 3 given the limited length 155 years of the available historical lake water level records our study and other relevant literature could not identify wlf cycles longer than 30 years however thompson and baedke 1997 and quinn and sellinger 2006 who respectively analyzed 361 and 4700 years of reconstructed lake water levels based on sediment samples from beach ridges and tree rings reported fluctuation patterns of approximately every 150 years in their reconstructed records table 3 several efforts to establish proxies of the water level periodicities specifically examined the presence of a robust relationship with the sunspot activity sellinger et al 2008 for example earlier work from wilson 1946 identified a strong positive relationship between sunspot maxima and water levels in lake michigan from mid 19th century until the 1940s which was not confirmed by sellinger et al 2008 owing to a subsequent shift to a wetter regional climate in the area that obfuscated the delineation of the presumably causal linkages between sunspots precipitation evaporation and water levels changnon 2004 nonetheless sellinger et al 2008 asserted that even if the sunspot activity reflects only a small component of the lake level variability it is still important to establish the relative importance of all the factors that could modulate the impact of future climate change to lake level assessments previous attempts to characterize the relative importance of different water budget processes highlighted the role of precipitation as the single most important variable in modulating historical intra and inter annual lake level fluctuations consistent with our work hanrahan et al 2014 reported that the aforementioned presence of two dominant 8 year and 12 year signals in the lake level time series reflected the variations in the amount and frequency of precipitation events during the winter and summer months respectively the former cycle has been recently connected with variations in the moisture transport and precipitation totals in the great lakes region driven by temperature changes in the north atlantic hanrahan et al 2014 instead of earlier assertions that is associated with the pacific north american teleconnection pattern rodionov 1994 in contrast the 12 year cycle appears to be triggered by an upper air trough pattern situated over the great lakes that is responsible for the increased convective activity during the summer hanrahan et al 2014 hanrahan et al 2014 also identified a relatively strong correlation r greater than 0 45 between water level differential and contemporaneous precipitation values which is on par with our results reported in table 2 even more so both our regression and wavelet analysis signify the signature of the runoff time series on the monthly changes and inter annual periodicities of the lake water levels consistent with our finding gronewold et al 2016 highlighted the tributary runoff as the predominant driver of water level anomalies in the lhm system owing to the strong relationship between regional precipitation and runoff along with the higher land to lake area ratio relative to other basins in the great lakes system in particular the 2013 2014 water level rise in lake michigan huron was mainly attributed to the above average runoff and persistent over lake precipitation gronewold et al 2015 2016 and thus may have been responsible for imbalances in the water budget that could ultimately lead to cumulative lake level changes over time evaporation is frequently identified as a primary driver of the seasonality of the water budget arhonditsis et al 2004 gronewold et al 2015 2016 but its interannual variability is typically considered relatively minor with negligible effects on long term lake level changes hanrahan et al 2010 consistent with this expectation our analysis identified a strong annual periodicity and distinct signature of evaporation on monthly lake level differential but no major peaks or wavelet ridges at inter annual scales regarding the latter finding though hanrahan et al 2010 revealed an increasing trend in the annual evaporative losses since 1980 and about half of this increase appears to have occurred during the summer months while this pattern may seem counterintuitive given that summer evaporation is typically curtailed by the cooler water temperatures relative to those of the overlying air see fig 8a summertime water surface temperature has displayed a significant increase over the past few decades which may have been translated into an increase in water losses through evaporation hanrahan et al 2010 2014 in the same context our wavelet power spectra also showed a local coherence at a 3 7 year period between 1990 and 1997 followed by a shift to a 5 8 year cycle since 2006 which is also manifested as a strong anti phase relationship with the lake levels outflow is another major lake level driver with signals that show a significant peak at the 6 month cycle with nearly the same phase as runoff and precipitation counterbalancing their seasonal effects on the water budget overall the global wavelet spectrum for outflow follows a similar trend as the global wavelet spectrum for lake water level signifying the strong co dependence between outflow and lake water level as previously mentioned hanrahan et al 2010 argued that outflow does not directly respond to atmospheric processes but instead tends to dampen the climate related lake level fluctuations arising from the other hydrological components and conjectured that could be calculated as directly proportional to the lhm levels however the lagged relationships between outflow and monthly water level differential or their phase differences at different periodicities in our global wavelet coherence support the idea that the relationship between outflow and lake levels may not be as straightforward in lhm given that a multitude of additional factors appear to be influencing the outflow rates our finding is conceptually on par with the results presented by ghanbari and bravo 2008 who signified the coherencies between atmospheric teleconnections trans niño index pacific decadal oscillation northern annular mode arctic oscillation index and pacific north american pattern and connecting channel flows for lakes michigan erie and ontario as being stronger relative to the weaker direct correlations between teleconnections and individual hydrologic variables evidently water flows in channels connecting the individual lakes depend on the cumulative effects of upstream lakes and their corresponding watersheds and therefore the interannual and interdecadal atmospheric signals are more discernible compared with those to precipitation evaporation and air temperature ghanbari and bravo 2008 5 conclusions water levels in the great lakes fluctuate more widely than in marine coastal areas and can thus have profound impacts on a multitude of socioeconomic activities the present study conducted a comprehensive wavelet analysis on historical water level records and relevant hydrological variables analysis of 1d global wavelet power spectrum identified statistically significant 1 8 12 and 36 year periodicities during 1860 2015 which resemble to wlf periodicities reported in the previous literature while the features of the dominant frequencies are consistent with previous findings with the help of wavelet ridges the cwt yields a complete picture of evolution in time frequency domain that is impossible to achieve with the same accuracy using conventional signal processing methods the cwt and analysis of wavelet coherence between hydrological and water level changes signified the role of runoff and evaporation as the primary drivers of monthly wlf in lhm the same result was reinforced by multilinear regression analysis that considered the effects of different combinations of hydrological predictors on the month to month water level differential an illustrative application of our empirical model on the north bay s shorelines showed that the runoff minus evaporation monthly fluxes can induce water level fluctuations up to two meters with profound socioeconomic implications in light of recent evidence about the transmissivity of the signals of large scale atmospheric teleconnections the application of wavelet analysis could offer additional insights into the mechanisms that drive the diminishing re emergent and or intermodulation patterns in the long term periodicities of various hydrological processes the likelihood to shape the balance of the water budget and ultimately lead to cumulative lake level changes over time the introduction of atmospheric teleconnections could be an essential augmentation to establish more reliable forecasting tools of water level variability

3882,water scarcity and environmental challenges are affecting many parts of the world particularly the arid middle east region limited water resources urbanization groundwater over extraction and water usage for irrigation and agriculture have exacerbated the situation over this region and is risking the future development of its growing population this study investigates the changes in various water storage components including groundwater surface water and soil moisture in the middle east to this end a long term reanalysis of land hydrologic water storage components was generated from 1980 to 2019 by combining multiple satellite remote sensing observations and a hydrological model via a state of art data assimilation approach the results indicate that assimilating multivariate satellite remote sensing significantly improves the model performance the reanalysis data also outperforms some of existing model outputs based on the results a considerable water storage depletion is observed across the middle east region not only over the dryer parts but also in areas with above average annual rainfall including countries located close to the mediterranean sea the water depletion is most pronounced for groundwater and over arid and semiarid areas in the central to southern parts involving iran saudi arabia bahrain and the united arab emirates water storage decline is further found in the region s eastern north western and western parts the results also reveal a close link between water storage declines and other environmental factors such as dust storms and loss of vegetation canopies keywords middle east water resources satellite remote sensing data assimilation land surface modelling water storage changes 1 introduction today water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity in many parts of the world which has become even more problematic due to climate change impacts and the ever increasing need for freshwater kummu et al 2016 guppy and anderson 2017 one of the most vulnerable regions to the water crisis is the middle east me where countries are struggling with various water related environmental issues e g voss et al 2013 islam and susskind 2015 al rawashdeh and al shboul 2016 food and agriculturere organization fao 2017 international energy agency iea 2018 alborzi et al 2018 me is one of the most arid regions in the world with very limited water resources paul et al 2016 the average temperature is more than 18 c over the region while its records have been repeatedly broken with the highest experienced in 2016 kuwait 54 c the region has further been identified as a hotspot for future temperature changes e g planton et al 2016 and it is predicted that heat related mortality rates to be up to 20 times higher than current rates by the end of the century e g aahmadalipour and moradkhanidalipour and moradkhani 2020 me suffers from insufficient precipitation rate and due to its climate condition evaporation often exceeds precipitation the region has also been subject to several droughts especially since 1998 which have significantly influenced its water resources notaro et al 2015 deng et al 2015 accessing freshwater resources is a big challenge in the me region with extreme water scarcity joffe 2016 me s annual internal renewable water resources amount to 6 against world average of 38 of its average annual precipitation undp rbas and sida 2013 population growth and increased demand for food energy and water over the past decades have put a lot of pressure on the region s environment and water resources the water supply per capita is 1274 cubic metres which categorises the region as being water stressed according to the world bank see e g planton et al 2016 waha et al 2017 excessive water use mainly for irrigation especially over the past few decades for economic growth has also exacerbated the situation llamas and custodio 2002 alborzi et al 2018 as a result water storage decline e g through groundwater abstraction has been reported in various parts of the region e g voss et al 2013 khaki et al 2018 haghighi and motagh 2019 while some recent advances in water supply technology and management can be seen over the involving counties in the region overall poor governance along with extreme water scarcity and increasing demands are negatively affecting the region s scarce water resources even more monitoring water storage changes is therefore crucial for the future planning of me s limited sub surface water resources the main goal of this effort is to study water storage changes over the entire me based on a new hydrologic based reanalysis dataset retrieved from model and satellite data integration for the first time multiple satellite remote sensing data are assimilated into a land hydrologic model to analyse various water compartments including terrestrial water storage tws surface water and groundwater and soil moisture over an extended time scale almost 40 years over the region in the absent of a well established network of in situ measurements such study offers a comprehensive look at the me s water resource changes it also addresses existing models and reanalysis limitations when despite recent advances in land hydrologic modelling they suffer from various sources of errors in inputs and forcing data parameters uncertainty and imperfect parameterisations renard et al 2010 vrugt et al 2013 teweldebrhan et al 2018 the proposed reanalysis datasets on the other hand offer more accurate estimates by combining different remote sensing data with model robock et al 2000 kim and alexander 2013 this contribution aims at using a newly developed reanalysis dataset from assimilating multivariate satellite remote sensing into a land hydrologic model over the me region despite a reasonable performance of reanalyses different studies have reported multiple limitations in existing products especially over regional areas for instance ullah et al 2018 showed considerable discrepancies between the global land data assimilation system gldas and era interim soil moisture and independent observations in the tibetan plateau similarly spennemann et al 2015 found errors in gldas soil moisture for different time windows over south america see also kato et al 2007 li et al 2020 it was also reported by ji et al 2015 that gldas temperature data is less accurate in africa south america and high mountain areas generally with limited weather stations see also han et al 2020 a similar issue exists in other developing countries especially in the me region furthermore deng et al 2020 discussed the mismatch between tws changes from three widely used land and atmospheric reanalysis products and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tws the weak performance of era interim and era5 in reflecting precipitation was reported e g by tarek et al 2020 over the east usa and gleixner et al 2020 in africa the proposed approach in this study allows for accurate regional water storage monitoring largely rely on space observation including soil moisture from soil moisture and ocean salinity mission smos advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e and soil moisture active passive smap tws from grace and leaf area index lai from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr satellite remote sensing which nowadays provides direct measurements of natural phenomena on large scales is covering more than decades of measurements and has been proven to greatly improve hydrological models simulations e g schuurmans et al 2003 de lannoy et al 2007 clark et al 2008 reichle et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 girotto et al 2016 schumacher et al 2018 the data has been applied previously over different parts of me to study water storage changes primarily using the grace data e g voss et al 2013 tourian et al 2015 forootan et al 2017 shami and ghorbani 2019 mohamed 2020 khaki et al 2018 used grace data assimilation to monitor groundwater depletion over iran that has led to considerable land surface deformation reported by haghighi and motagh 2019 using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar techniques the novelty of this contribution is the use of various satellite products for improving model outputs over me via data assimilation from 1980 to 2019 assimilating the state of art multi mission satellite observations can effectively be used to constrain the model outputs and optimize its performance which is particularly of interest over me with data deficiency furthermore the process enhances various water storage components based on the available observations which would then allow us to accurately monitor their changes over the region this further provides insights into analysing the imposed changes to the region s various water resources and its environment environmental challenges in this part of the world are influenced by various factors e g water energy and extreme events related to different interconnected land surface components such as water stored on and below the land surface as well as soil moisture see e g hameed et al 2019 therefore investigating the various water storage components and their long term relationships can also reveal their impacts on the environment 2 middle east me located in an arid region with largely below average global precipitation rate me fig 1 faces many serious challenges related to water and food security systems saif et al 2014 al mulali and ozturk 2015 analysed some of these challenges including excessive energy consumption high evaporation rate ecological footprint fast growing urbanization political instability and industrial development and concluded that these are major factors causing environmental degradation on top of these water scarcity is one of the most pressing issues which puts the future of me in danger multiple and persistent drought events have negatively influenced water resources and vegetation cover in me which not only affected the agriculture but also caused increased dust storms and vulnerability towards flash floods notaro et al 2015 deng et al 2015 multiple studies have documented occurrences of frequent droughts e g since 2006 in iraq western iran syria israel and jordan notaro et al 2015 and also their impacts on agriculture e g approximately 15 3 crop yield reduction in turkey in 2007 food and agriculturere organization fao 2017 industry and agriculture are the main water usage drivers in the region water for instance is widely used in the process of crude oil extraction which has also led to considerable carbon dioxide increase international energy agency iea 2018 in addition over cultivation and correspondingly excessive groundwater abstraction have also resulted in a significant water crisis mismanagement in using water resources for irrigation is also an important factor in this crisis as an example in the late 20th century saudi arabia became the sixth largest wheat exporter by over extracting groundwater ahmed et al 2014 this problem can also be observed in other me countries such as iran as reported by haghighi and motagh 2019 who showed that groundwater abstraction has led tehran the capital city of iran to sink by 12 mm negative water storage trends were also observed by voss et al 2013 in western iran and eastern iraq between 2003 and 2012 this decline has already impacted the lives of people in the region by decreasing crop yields voss et al 2013 alborzi et al 2018 and putting pressure on energy production international energy agency iea 2016 surface water storage is limited in the me region too multiple countries largely rely on transboundary water bodies this historically has caused conflicts between the engaged countries in the region over the tigris euphrates region north central area of me which is shared mainly between iraq turkey syria and iran about 143 6 km 3 freshwater depletion over the period of 2003 to 2009 was reported by voss et al 2013 this as some may argue along with the construction of more than 15 major dams by turkey over the tigris and euphrates rivers has exacerbated the situation based on these a study by elasha 2010 discussed the potential increase in anxiety in the region especially for the arab region many of these countries rely heavily on the desalinated water supply which is very energy consuming to meet their water demands keulertz et al 2016 all these indicate that currently water is a major issue in me and if not monitored and managed properly it will impose significant risks to the future of the region 3 datasets 3 1 model 3 1 1 land hydrologic model the model used here is the world wide water resources assessment w3ra model which simulates interactions between water and energy i e through the distribution of precipitation between various components of evaporation net precipitation runoffs and infiltration on a grid basis van dijk et al 2013 the model is run daily from 1980 to 2019 using the era 5 forcing data including precipitation downwelling short wave radiation and maximum and minimum temperature at 0 1250 resolution the model outputs used for data assimilation include water storage components of groundwater soil moisture at three layers of top as well as shallow and deep root surface water and snow water storage these are updated via the data assimilation scheme cf section 4 1 3 1 2 auxiliary models the outputs of three widely used land surface models are also used to 1 estimate the irrigation over the region and 2 assess the performance of the assimilation process these models are selected to provide a better estimates by merging their products see details in section 4 2 w3ra does not model irrigation and water use thus the irrigation storage needs to be removed from the grace data before data assimilation this helps to focus separately on water storage changes caused by climate variability as well as irrigation the former can be achieved from the assimilation results and for the latter we use monthly 0 50 irrigation outputs from the community land model clm version 4 5 oleson et al 2013 pcr globwb version 2 sutanudjaja et al 2018 and watergap version 2 müller et al 2014 tws estimates of these models are also compared with that of data assimilation to investigate the results in the absence of local in situ data see supplementary materials 3 2 satellite remote sensing 3 2 1 tws observations the tws data are derived from l2 level 2 up to degree and order 120 grace 2002 2017 and grace fo 2018 2019 products mayer gürr et al 2014 mayer gürr et al 2018 the l2 products are first improved using a standard procedure that includes replacing low degree coefficients i e c10 c11 s11 and c20 with accurate estimates swenson et al 2008 cheng and tapley 2004 and then converted from spherical harmonics to 1 1 gridded tws changes wahr et al 1998 the calculated tws are further filtered using the kernel fourier integration kefin filter khaki et al 2018 to reduce striping and leakage errors these steps are applied for both grace 2002 2017 and grace fo 2018 2019 the estimated tws is then used to update the aggregated model surface and snow water storage soil moisture at all layers and groundwater to remove the bias between the observations and model the mean model tws for each satellite period is derived added to the grace tws changes zaitchik et al 2008 following previous studies grace error is considered to be spatially uncorrelated with 10 mm error for data assimilation e g zaitchik et al 2008 kvas et al 2019 3 2 2 satellite soil moisture three satellite missions of amsr e 2002 2011 smos 2011 2015 and smap 2015 2019 are used to derive soil moisture products to update the model top layer soil moisture the daily level 3 amsr e njoku 2004 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 reflects soil moisture content at 0 3 cm layer the level 3 smos soil moisture data jacquette et al 2010 has spatial and temporal resolution of 50 km and three days respectively and represents moisture variability of 0 5 cm depth lastly smap l3 level 3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture o neill et al 2020 is used that reflects soil moisture variabilities of the top 5 cm of the soil column on a daily basis all soil moisture observations are rescaled into a 3 day for a full cover from ascending and descending passes 0 25 resolution for the assimilation process these are then used to update the model top layer soil moisture variabilities not the absolute values which has important impact on surface evaporation and water distribution to address the bias between the model simulations and observations cumulative distribution function cdf matching draper et al 2009 is used we assume 0 05 m 3 m 3 error for amsr e 0 04 m 3 m 3 error for smos and 0 02 m 3 m 3 error for smap observations following leroux et al 2016 dong et al 2018 during the data assimilation process 3 2 3 lai products the lai data is obtained from noaa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration lai climate data record cdr version 4 and fapar fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation claverie and vermote 2014 from 1981 to 2019 the data with a daily 0 125 0 125 converted from 0 05 0 05 resolution is used to improve the model counterpart the error of 0 2 m 2 m 2 is assumed for the lai data during data assimilation following fox et al 2018 the full list of datasets used in this study is described in table 1 4 method 4 1 data assimilation 4 1 1 state and observation vectors the multiple satellite remote sensing datasets are assimilated into w3ra using a dual ensemble kalman filter enkf filtering approach following ait el fquih et al 2016 to improve the model simulations of surface and snow water storage soil moisture top shallow root zone groundwater and lai thus the state vector includes these water components and the observation vector contains grace derived tws satellite soil moisture and lai products modis surface water data is used separately to improve surface water dynamics using the nudging approach cf section 3 2 the state vector is translated into the observation space using a linear observation operator where each simulated water component is updated based on its counterpart observation at every assimilation cycle to this end the observation operator accumulates all model water storage components into 1 to be updated by grace once a month the estimated correction i e offset between the model state and grace tws is added to the corresponding month s last day to run the model for the following month the observation operator also converts the model soil moisture into 0 25 by accumulating the values that correspond to each observational grid point model lai estimates are simply updated with observations with the same spatiotemporal resolution note that depending on the observation availability the observation operator is changed to either update variable individually e g for lai or jointly e g for lai and soil moisture or all three observations 4 1 2 state update the model state vector at assimilation steps when assimilated observations become available is updated using the dual enkf approach the dual enkf conditions the probability density function pdf of the model water components to available observations following the bayes rule the dual variant of the enkf jointly estimates the water components together with a well chosen set of poorly known model parameters these were selected based on a global sensitivity analysis khaki et al 2020 uncertainties in the model and its parameters and observations are also taken into account in the dual enkf which weights the available information according to their relative accuracy model uncertainty is parameterised based on a set of ensemble members which represent uncertainties in different model trajectories simulated using different model initial conditions and parameters observations uncertainties are derived from different sources cf section 3 2 the dual enkf estimates the state and parameters using two interactive enkfs this was derived following a one step ahead osa smoothing step as derived by ait el fquih et al 2016 the approach enforces an additional update step with the future observation which helps to mitigate standard enkf issues that often arise when dealing with poorly known noise models and limited ensembles raboudi et al 2019 at each assimilation cycle the applied filtering approach involves cycles of forecast steps with the model and update steps with the incoming observations the parameters are first updated using a kalman like update an osa smoothing step is then applied to compute a smoothed state ensemble based on the observation and updated parameters both the smoothed state and updated parameters are then integrated with the model to forecast the state another kalman like update scheme is then implemented to estimate the final state according to the observation these estimates are next used for forecasting with the model until the next observation becomes available see details in ait el fquih et al 2016 4 1 3 experiment run to implement the data assimilation approach first the model is run from 1979 to 1980 to generate an initial ensemble of 50 members by perturbing the meteorological forcing terms i e n 0 0 3 for precipitation n 0 50 for shortwave radiation and n 0 2 for temperature to account for the filter inbreeding issue in enkf based methods when a small ensemble size is used ensemble inflation and localization methods are applied ensemble members tend to converge when using a low ensemble number which consequently degrades the assimilation performance the two applied tuning techniques are standard solutions to address this issue without increasing the ensemble number that significantly adds to computation needs ensemble inflation works by increasing the ensemble deviation with respect to their mean by multiplying a coefficient here 1 2 suggested by e g anderson et al 2007 furthermore local analysis la houtekamer and mitchell 2001 is applied to limit the assimilation process spatially within 3 e g suggested by khaki et al 2020 of grid points this helps to tackle the filter divergence issue the outputs of the data assimilation system are validated using various independent observations across the me region to ensure the method s effectiveness to improve the model and water storage information the results of the validation process are provided in supplementary materials 4 2 auxiliary data merging 4 2 1 triple collocation analysis tca to have a better estimates of irrigation and tws estimates from clm4 5 pcr globwb and watergap2 a tca based approach is applied see e g dong et al 2020 first tca is applied to derive the error variance which in turn used to merge the three products for three independent noisy dataset tca can effectively provide their error characterization that is crucial for blending observations the method is applied at each grid point separately for irrigation and tws from the three models it considers one of the products as a reference and scales the other two to this reference product to remove the dynamic range differences of different products draper et al 2013 afterwards the error variances of the scaled products are calculated assuming that the errors of the three products are orthogonal and mutually independent the estimated error variances are then used for data merging explained below 4 2 2 data merging this step is carried out using a weighted averaging method based on the tca estimates for this purpose a merging approach based on the least square analysis can be defined as 1 m xw x yw y zw z where m is the merged output x y and z are the three input data with the corresponding weights of w x w y and w z that can be calculated using the least square solutions see details in yilmaz et al 2012 the merged irrigation is then removed from the grace data prior data assimilation assimilation of the remaining grace data can help to retrieve the missing trends and variabilities into water storage simulations caused by other factors such as floods droughts in addition the merged tws is used to assess the assimilation results 4 3 drought analysis drought plays an important role in climate variability over the me region characterising it then can help to better interpret the water storage changes within the area therefore two drought indices of standardized precipitation index spi and multivariate standardized drought index msdi are calculated to present hydro meteorological droughts forootan et al 2019 shows that spi and msdi can largely represent both meteorological and hydrological droughts based on precipitation and tws data over various regions spi is computed by fitting a gamma probability density function to the precipitation data then use the computed cumulative distribution to derive standard normal distributions following wu et al 2001 the output which ranges between 3 0 and 3 0 represents wet and dry conditions respectively and can be used for various scale droughts sub seasonal to seasonal and inter annual msdi is calculated using the cumulative joint probability density function of precipitation and tws time series details can be found in hao and aghakouchak 2013 similar to spi the calculated negative index represents dry drought climate condition while the positive index indicates wet climate condition aghakouchak 2014 afterwards a drought is characterised for a specific period if the estimated indices are continuously less than negative 0 9 for at least 3 months suggested by mpelasoka et al 2017 5 results we first analyse the spatial distribution of the water storage components across the me region to this end average tws groundwater soil moisture and surface water are compared against average precipitation over the period of 1980 2019 in fig 2 the standard deviations stds of estimated storage components based on the model ensemble are also plotted in the figure first the average water components are calculated over the study period for individual ensemble members i e 50 then the std values are calculated for every water storage it can clearly be seen that the water storage pattern largely follows precipitation with more available storage over the northwestern parts of me which include turkey northern parts of syria and iraq mountain ranges of alborz and zagros respectively in the northern and western parts of iran also show a large amount of water similarly a considerable amount of water storage can be found over the hindu kush mountains in the northeast parts of me limited water storage can be seen over a majority of the me region e g the southern south eastern central and south western parts these areas mostly cover the arab region including countries bahrain egypt iraq jordan kuwait lebanon oman palestine qatar saudi arabia syrian arab republic yemen and united arab emirates as well as large parts of iran central to southeast afghanistan west and south and pakistan centre south and west fig 2 suggests that except for the northern parts a majority of the me region suffers from insufficient water resources mainly due to climatic factors related to limited precipitation from fig 2 larger std values can be observed over areas with larger water variation which can be attributed to larger model uncertainties as well as variabilities the presented data assimilation uncertainties can be attributed to model and forcing data meteorology assimilated observations and applied data assimilation technique the impacts of both observations and data assimilation are far less than the forcing data on the output uncertainties e g hamill and snyder 2002 khaki et al 2020 despite this observation uncertainties are taken into an account during the data assimilation cf section 3 2 and the application of ensemble inflation and localization alleviate uncertainties in the system and small ensembles e g bergemann and reich 2010 thus fig 2 mainly reflect the uncertainties in the model forcing mainly precipitation where larger water and energy variabilities over the north and northwest parts of the region cause more uncertainties in the assimilation outputs to investigate results uncertainties further the tws results are compared with independent products from community land model clm version 4 5 oleson et al 2013 pcr globwb version 2 sutanudjaja et al 2018 watergap version 2 müller et al 2014 and nasa global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 1 gldas version 2 1 beaudoing et al 2020 fig 3 shows the correlation and the root mean squared errors rmse calculated between the assimilation results and tws from each model at every grid point all rescaled to 0 50 spatial resolution overall the results indicate a high correlation between the outputs especially for the case of gldas followed by pcr globwb the lowest rmse values are found between the assimilation and gldas tws larger rmse values can be seen e g for clm4 5 and to a lesser extent watergap2 in some areas e g northwest where of zagros mountain range exist these parts usually have a higher amount of rain variability throughout the year that can make modelling more complicated thus can lead to potential errors in land surface models more detailed evaluation of the assimilation performance to analyse the associated uncertainties against these models and additional independent measurements can be found in supplementary materials to further analyse the relationship between precipitation and water storage component changes in me average time series over the region are depicted in fig 4 trends for different periods are also displayed the trend values represented in red are checked statistically at 0 05 significant level using mann kendall test gocic and trajkovic 2012 statistically significant trends are found to be the periods 2 3 for precipitation 2 4 for tws 2 4 for groundwater 2 3 for soil moisture and non for surface water it can be seen that soil moisture variation and to a lesser degree surface water changes follow precipitation patterns and its trend tws and groundwater changes on the other hand show different patterns especially after 2000 similar to the precipitation time series positive tws and groundwater trends are noticeable prior to 2000 this however changes over the following years with mostly negative trends negative anomaly in and after 1990 can also exist and can be explained by the reported less than average precipitation in several countries of the me region barlow et al 2016 the negative trends over the period 1996 2001 follow the negative precipitation trend and are mainly attributed to the 1999 2000 drought extended to 1998 2002 over some areas the estimated drought indices can help to better investigate this fig 5 fig 5 shows the average spi and msdi indices over the me region noticeable wet period with positive values can be clearly seen prior to 2000 for both indices this is followed by a significant drought from 1999 to 2002 represented by spi and msdi this event is found to be extended by spi which shows a dry period up to 2005 as mentioned drought condition is characterised if the indices are continuously less than negative 0 9 for at least 3 months accordingly two major drought conditions are identified in the me region including the aforementioned 1999 2002 drought as well as the 2007 2008 drought also shown by barlow et al 2002 lotsch et al 2005 trigo et al 2010 both these droughts are largely attributed to la niña condition trigo et al 2010 hoell et al 2012 the impact of the 2007 2008 drought within the period 2001 2014 is also reflected in different water storage components including tws groundwater soil moisture and surface water cf fig 4 based on spi the dry condition dominates after 1999 until 2018 msdi on the other hand indicates more variations with considerable dry and wet periods during this time after 2018 spi and to a lesser degree msdi show wet condition mainly caused by increased precipitation for period 5 in fig 4 in addition to the impact of the drought water storage in the me region is influenced by non climatic impacts such as irrigation dry condition reported in fig 5 along with the irrigation water use can attribute to water decrease for the corresponding periods as it can be seen from fig 6 irrigation water use has been increasing constantly with 3 4 mm slope but more rapidly in 1985 1990 and after 2010 this exacerbates the pressure on the region s limited water resources the majority of irrigations occur in the eastern side of the region e g pakistan northwest of iran me s north to northwest parts e g iran and turkey the southern parts e g yemen and along with the nile basin in north africa this excessive irrigation e g through groundwater abstraction can lead to water storage decline and are also reported in longuevergne et al 2013 for the tigris euphrates basin located in the northwest of me and in forootan et al 2014 over iran khaki et al 2018 also showed groundwater depletion during the period of 2002 to 2013 across iran over the period 2014 2019 tws rise is noticeable following the increase in precipitation spatial maps of trend values over the entire me region for precipitation and various water storage components are presented in fig 7 plotting the overall trend over the period 1980 to 2019 for each grid point the spatial distribution of trend values helps to understand which areas are affected more by water storage depletion in general tws and groundwater exhibit negative trends across the me region this is more pronounced over the central to eastern parts of iran large parts of pakistan south eastern parts of the mediterranean sea where egypt israel and palestine are located and also over saudi arabia considerable groundwater decline can also be seen in the southern part of the arabian peninsula and yemen eastern parts of turkey and central parts of afghanistan these can be attributed mainly to the prolonged impact of droughts and to a lesser degree the water use other than irrigation a similar trend pattern cannot be observed in precipitation where the negative values can only be seen over areas in the southern north eastern and north western parts this can also be seen for the surface and soil moisture soil moisture does not show considerable trends except for negative trends in northwest of turkey southern saudi arabia central afghanistan and northwest of iran which can be mainly due to precipitation changes and to a lesser degree reduction in large streamflow and crop loss mutin 2009 as a result of dam impoundment and operations e g 1989 1998 in turkey jones et al 2008 this has also affected surface water storage along with other climatic factors negative surface water trends are also noticeable in some me areas e g turkey s eastern parts west of iran south of arabian peninsula and afghanistan s western parts this is particularly important because any decline in surface water storage can cause other significant environmental challenges such as dust storms as further discussed below the results suggest so far that water storage exhibits negative trends over almost the entire me cf fig 7 to further investigate this tws storage combined from the assimilation and irrigation results for different years across the region are shown in fig 8 note that the tws assimilation results are spatially rescaled to the same resolution of irrigation for this analysis tws decline can be clearly seen over the years many central to southern parts including areas in iran and arab countries have lost significant water resources cf fig 8 in addition considerable tws decrease can be observed over pakistan and to a lesser degree afghanistan the extent of water resources in the north western parts of me where turkey and the northwest of iran are located decreased gradually moreover tws decline is also considerable in the northern parts of egypt east and south of iran and the eastern side of the mediterranean sea to a large extent saudi arabia kuwait iraq have also been affected this extended issue can be explained mainly by the impact of the dry period after 1999 and frequent droughts and also increased water use primarily due to irrigation multiple studies have suggested an anthropogenic impact on water resources over the region for instance khaki et al 2018 showed that water use for various objectives e g industry and farming had considerable impacts on groundwater resources in iran haghighi and motagh 2019 reported similar findings and also concluded that this groundwater depletion has led to land subsidence in tehran groundwater depletion was also observed by voss et al 2013 over the tigris euphrates western as a combined effect of drought and groundwater withdrawals fig 8 shows that a majority of me suffers from water depletion which could lead to water crisis issues in the future overall it is estimated that tws declines with more than 2 0 46 mm year over the region this is statistically significant at 0 05 level based on mann kendall test the negative trend is found to be more considerable after 1995 the two major drought events in 1998 2002 and 2007 2008 seem to have exacerbated the situation to further analyse the tws variations the average trends for each me country for the two periods of 1980 1995 and 1996 2019 as well as the average amount of precipitation they receive are presented in fig 9 these two time periods are selected according to the tws time series which show larger discrepancies to precipitation and other water components after 1995 see fig 4 we also analyse the trends for major basins within the region and over the same periods fig 10 a noticeable difference can be seen between the precipitation and tws trend values blue and red bars in figs 9 and 10 over the two periods negative trends are evident during the 1996 2019 period for most of the me countries while the corresponding average precipitation does not show the same pattern no significant changes are observed in precipitation before and after 1996 despite this tws declines are considerable in different countries with iran saudi arabia and bahrain being the most affected turkey with a larger amount of received precipitation also experiences a negative trend similar results can be observed for pakistan especially for the period of 1996 to 2019 similarly it can be seen that most of the major hydrologic basins in the study area experience negative water storage trends during 1996 2019 there are however a few basins with negative trends before and after 1996 such as sakarya orontes and lake urmia nevertheless the rate of decline after 1996 is more pronounced for these basins the two major drought events in 1999 2002 and 2007 2008 along with increased water use for irrigation and industry e g voss et al 2013 khaki et al 2018 haghighi and motagh 2019 can cause the major negative trends in addition to climate variabilities and groundwater abstractions surface water managements can largely disrupt natural cycle of water storage changes during the past few decades several dams and reservoirs have been constructed at various scales in the me region to supply the growing population the number of these dams and reservoirs between 1950 and 2019 and their distribution are outlined in fig 11 a majority of the constructions are in the northwest areas where more surface water resources are available cf fig 2 turkey and iran are countries with the largest number of dams and reservoirs constructions which has not only affected these countries but also downstream countries such as syria and iraq this is especially important for those countries that rely on transboundary water bodies e g the tigris euphrates region which is shared mainly between iraq turkey syria and iran to investigate the impact of dam constructions on involved countries three sample areas a b and c as indicated in fig 11 are selected and their corresponding tws and surface water time series are demonstrated in fig 11 negative trends for tws can be observed in three areas with a more severe slope in c and to a lesser degree in b surface water changes also show a declining pattern specifically in c this can be caused by various factors such as decreased precipitation groundwater depletion and surface water managements tws and to a lesser degree surface water decreases are negatively correlated with the developments of dam and reservoir constructions this water storage decline especially after 2005 with an increased number of constructed dams can be partially attributed to the impacts of surface water management policies water storage changes over lakes and reservoirs are explored here using altimetry derived datasets and the reanalysis results to this end trends are calculated for the water level changes from g realm as part of the u s department of agriculture s foreign agricultural service usda fas and hydroweb similarly trends are calculated for the reanalysis tws over the same period and after spatially interpolating the results to the nearest lake and reservoir stations the spatial distribution of these trend values is displayed in fig 12 it can be observed that trends are generally negative for both results on the western parts of the region on the eastern side the trends are much smaller indicating less water decline rate compared to the western side overall a good agreement can also been seen from fig 12 between the lakes and reservoirs datasets and the assimilation results see more details in supplementary materials such agreement can also be seen in the central parts where both results demonstrate considerable negative trends these results agree with tws and surface water changes presented in fig 11 indicating negative water storage trends especially over the tigris euphrates region due to extended droughts and applied water management strategies e g upstream water abstractions water storage declines can also pose environmental challenges in addition to risking freshwater availability surface water deficiency insufficient soil moisture and soil degradation and reduction in land vegetation cover are important factors that can cause more frequent with higher intensity dust storms in iran s southeast parts for example drying of marshy freshwater lakes due to droughts and water abstraction have caused more occurrence of such storms miri et al 2010 rashki et al 2012 over the me region dust storms are a major concern for many countries particularly those located in the arabian peninsula this problem has become more frequent and severe over the past decades mainly due to surface water depletion and vegetation canopies decline furman 2003 world bank 2019 here the connection between water decline and dust storm variations is investigated for this purpose dust spatial and temporal over two points variations from the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 are analysed in relation to water storage components fig 13 this helps to investigate the impacts of changes in tws and soil water which is highly related to lai as a dimensionless index of vegetation canopies bréda 2003 to dust changes as shown previously kok et al 2018 the presence absence of vegetation can affect dust emissions this has usually been modelled based on the lai component e g mahowald et al 2010 from fig 13 the largest concentrations are found over semi arid and arid regions mainly in the central to southern parts of me and especially in saudi arabia however increased water stress and surface water scarcity in parts of iran in recent years seem to have also increased the occurrence of dust storms the analysis of the water components and dust variations over the sample points a and b with relatively bigger impacts suggest a clear connection between water loss and dust increase this effect can clearly be seen after 2005 with remarkable tws declines declines are also considerable for soil moisture and correspondingly lai especially over point a located in the southwest of iran considerable dust content increase is evident from the time series over both a and b which can be partially caused by the land surface dryness 6 conclusions this study presents the first comprehensive investigation of decadal water storage changes 1980 2019 across the me region the area has long suffered from the lack of accurate information on water resources which led to poor water management policies that not only put at risk its future development but also posed various environmental difficulties for the first time an advanced multivariate data assimilation system combining the outputs of a land hydrologic model and multiple satellite products have been implemented to reconstruct the variation of various storage components including groundwater surface water and soil moisture over the last 4 decades our analysis showed an uneven distribution of water resources with more availability in the northwest parts of the region where turkey northern parts of syria and western parts of iran are located excessive dam constructions especially after 2005 in these areas introduce more challenges to downstream regions such as iraq by affecting transboundary water bodies similar water issues were observed in the eastern parts of the me region and shared water bodies between afghanistan iran and pakistan the water management policies caused reduced surface water storage as well as vegetation canopies and crop loss in lower latitudes this was also found to cause more frequent and intense dust storms especially over the western parts of the me region our results also revealed a significant water storage decline across the me region particularly after 2000 negative trends of total water storage tws were observed to a larger extent over dry regions including the arabian peninsula with considerable impacts on saudi arabia and yemen central to eastern parts of iran and the majority of pakistan these regions highly depend on underground water resources nevertheless water storage depletion was also observed in areas with above average precipitation rate such as turkey south eastern parts of the mediterranean sea particularly israel and egypt these results confirm previous findings over different parts of the me region such as the reported tws declines for the tigris euphrates basin located in the northwest of me and over iran water storage depletion has also occurred in many me areas especially over recent years despite occasional increased precipitation which can be largely attributed to human interference and groundwater abstraction in addition frequent drought events were also found to affect the water storage within the me region particularly the two major droughts of 1999 2000 extended to 1998 2002 over some areas and 2007 2008 triggered by la niña conditions these have considerably impacted the region s water resources by imposing negative tws trends declaration of competing

3882,water scarcity and environmental challenges are affecting many parts of the world particularly the arid middle east region limited water resources urbanization groundwater over extraction and water usage for irrigation and agriculture have exacerbated the situation over this region and is risking the future development of its growing population this study investigates the changes in various water storage components including groundwater surface water and soil moisture in the middle east to this end a long term reanalysis of land hydrologic water storage components was generated from 1980 to 2019 by combining multiple satellite remote sensing observations and a hydrological model via a state of art data assimilation approach the results indicate that assimilating multivariate satellite remote sensing significantly improves the model performance the reanalysis data also outperforms some of existing model outputs based on the results a considerable water storage depletion is observed across the middle east region not only over the dryer parts but also in areas with above average annual rainfall including countries located close to the mediterranean sea the water depletion is most pronounced for groundwater and over arid and semiarid areas in the central to southern parts involving iran saudi arabia bahrain and the united arab emirates water storage decline is further found in the region s eastern north western and western parts the results also reveal a close link between water storage declines and other environmental factors such as dust storms and loss of vegetation canopies keywords middle east water resources satellite remote sensing data assimilation land surface modelling water storage changes 1 introduction today water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity in many parts of the world which has become even more problematic due to climate change impacts and the ever increasing need for freshwater kummu et al 2016 guppy and anderson 2017 one of the most vulnerable regions to the water crisis is the middle east me where countries are struggling with various water related environmental issues e g voss et al 2013 islam and susskind 2015 al rawashdeh and al shboul 2016 food and agriculturere organization fao 2017 international energy agency iea 2018 alborzi et al 2018 me is one of the most arid regions in the world with very limited water resources paul et al 2016 the average temperature is more than 18 c over the region while its records have been repeatedly broken with the highest experienced in 2016 kuwait 54

current rates by the end of the century e g aahmadalipour and moradkhanidalipour and moradkhani 2020 me suffers from insufficient precipitation rate and due to its climate condition evaporation often exceeds precipitation the region has also been subject to several droughts especially since 1998 which have significantly influenced its water resources notaro et al 2015 deng et al 2015 accessing freshwater resources is a big challenge in the me region with extreme water scarcity joffe 2016 me s annual internal renewable water resources amount to 6 against world average of 38 of its average annual precipitation undp rbas and sida 2013 population growth and increased demand for food energy and water over the past decades have put a lot of pressure on the region s environment and water resources the water supply per capita is 1274 cubic metres which categorises the region as being water stressed according to the world bank see e g planton et al 2016 waha et al 2017 excessive water use mainly for irrigation especially over the past few decades for economic growth has also exacerbated the situation llamas and custodio 2002 alborzi et al 2018 as a result water storage decline e g through groundwater abstraction has been reported in various parts of the region e g voss et al 2013 khaki et al 2018 haghighi and motagh 2019 while some recent advances in water supply technology and management can be seen over the involving counties in the region overall poor governance along with extreme water scarcity and increasing demands are negatively affecting the region s scarce water resources even more monitoring water storage changes is therefore crucial for the future planning of me s limited sub surface water resources the main goal of this effort is to study water storage changes over the entire me based on a new hydrologic based reanalysis dataset retrieved from model and satellite data integration for the first time multiple satellite remote sensing data are assimilated into a land hydrologic model to analyse various water compartments including terrestrial water storage tws surface water and groundwater and soil moisture over an extended time scale almost 40 years over the region in the absent of a well established network of in situ measurements such study offers a comprehensive look at the me s water resource changes it also addresses existing models and reanalysis limitations when despite recent advances in land hydrologic modelling they suffer from various sources of errors in inputs and forcing data parameters uncertainty and imperfect parameterisations renard et al 2010 vrugt et al 2013 teweldebrhan et al 2018 the proposed reanalysis datasets on the other hand offer more accurate estimates by combining different remote sensing data with model robock et al 2000 kim and alexander 2013 this contribution aims at using a newly developed reanalysis dataset from assimilating multivariate satellite remote sensing into a land hydrologic model over the me region despite a reasonable performance of reanalyses different studies have reported multiple limitations in existing products especially over regional areas for instance ullah et al 2018 showed considerable discrepancies between the global land data assimilation system gldas and era interim soil moisture and independent observations in the tibetan plateau similarly spennemann et al 2015 found errors in gldas soil moisture for different time windows over south america see also kato et al 2007 li et al 2020 it was also reported by ji et al 2015 that gldas temperature data is less accurate in africa south america and high mountain areas generally with limited weather stations see also han et al 2020 a similar issue exists in other developing countries especially in the me region furthermore deng et al 2020 discussed the mismatch between tws changes from three widely used land and atmospheric reanalysis products and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tws the weak performance of era interim and era5 in reflecting precipitation was reported e g by tarek et al 2020 over the east usa and gleixner et al 2020 in africa the proposed approach in this study

nowadays provides direct measurements of natural phenomena on large scales is covering more than decades of measurements and has been proven to greatly improve hydrological models simulations e g schuurmans et al 2003 de lannoy et al 2007 clark et al 2008 reichle et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 girotto et al 2016 schumacher et al 2018 the data has been applied previously over different parts of me to study water storage changes primarily using the grace data e g voss et al 2013 tourian et al 2015 forootan et al 2017 shami and ghorbani 2019 mohamed 2020 khaki et al 2018 used grace data assimilation to monitor groundwater depletion over iran that has led to considerable land surface deformation reported by haghighi and motagh 2019 using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar techniques the novelty of this contribution is the use of various satellite products for improving model outputs over me via data assimilation from 1980 to 2019 assimilating the state of art multi mission satellite observations can effectively be used to constrain the model outputs and optimize its performance which is particularly of interest over me with data deficiency furthermore the process enhances various water storage components based on the available observations which would then allow us to accurately monitor their changes over the region this further provides insights into analysing the imposed changes to the region s various water resources and its environment environmental challenges in this part of the world are influenced by various factors e g water energy and extreme events related to different interconnected land surface components such as water stored on and below the land surface as well as soil moisture see e g hameed et al 2019 therefore investigating the various water storage components and their long term relationships can also reveal their impacts on the environment 2 middle east me located in an arid region with largely below average global precipitation rate me fig 1 faces many serious challenges related to water and food security systems saif et al 2014 al mulali and ozturk 2015 analysed some of these challenges including excessive energy consumption high evaporation rate ecological footprint fast growing urbanization political instability and industrial development and concluded that these are major factors causing environmental degradation on top of these water scarcity is one of the most pressing issues which puts the future of me in danger multiple and persistent drought events have negatively influenced water resources and vegetation cover in me which not only affected the agriculture but also caused increased dust storms and vulnerability towards flash floods notaro et al 2015 deng et al 2015 multiple studies have documented occurrences of frequent droughts e g since 2006 in iraq western iran syria israel and jordan notaro et al 2015 and also their impacts on agriculture e g approximately 15 3 crop yield reduction in turkey in 2007 food and agriculturere organization fao 2017 industry and agriculture are the main water usage drivers in the region water for instance is widely used in the process of crude oil extraction which has also led to considerable carbon dioxide increase international energy agency iea 2018 in addition over cultivation and correspondingly excessive groundwater abstraction have also resulted in a significant water crisis mismanagement in using water resources for irrigation is also an important factor in this crisis as an example in the late 20th century saudi arabia became the sixth largest wheat exporter by over extracting groundwater ahmed et al 2014 this problem can also be observed in other me countries such as iran as reported by haghighi and motagh 2019 who showed that groundwater abstraction has led tehran the capital city of iran to sink by 12 mm negative water storage trends were also observed by voss et al 2013 in western iran and eastern iraq between 2003 and 2012 this decline has already impacted the lives of people in the region by decreasing crop yields voss et al 2013 alborzi et al 2018 and putting pressure on energy production international energy agency iea 2016 surface water storage is limited in the me region too multiple countries largely rely on transboundary water bodies this historically has caused conflicts between the engaged countries in the region over the tigris euphrates region north central area of me which is shared mainly between iraq turkey syria and iran about 143 6 km 3 freshwater depletion over the period of 2003 to 2009 was reported by voss et al 2013 this as some may argue along with the construction of more than 15 major dams by turkey over the tigris and euphrates rivers has exacerbated the situation based on these a study by elasha 2010 discussed the potential increase in anxiety in the region especially for the arab region many of these countries rely heavily on the desalinated water supply which is very energy consuming to meet their water demands keulertz et al 2016 all these indicate that currently water is a major issue in me and if not monitored and managed properly it will impose significant risks to the future of the region 3 datasets 3 1 model 3 1 1 land hydrologic model the model used here is the world wide water resources assessment w3ra model which simulates interactions between water and energy i e through the distribution of precipitation between various components of evaporation net precipitation runoffs and infiltration on a grid basis van dijk et al 2013 the model is run daily from 1980 to 2019 using the era 5 forcing data including precipitation downwelling short wave radiation and maximum and minimum temperature at 0 1250 resolution the model outputs used for data assimilation include water storage components of groundwater soil moisture at three layers of top as well as shallow and deep root surface water and snow water storage these are updated via the data assimilation scheme cf section 4 1 3 1 2 auxiliary models the outputs of three widely used land surface models are also used to 1 estimate the irrigation over the region and 2 assess the performance of the assimilation process these models are selected to provide a better estimates by merging their products see details in section 4 2 w3ra does not model irrigation and water use thus the irrigation storage needs to be removed from the grace data before data assimilation this helps to focus separately on water storage changes caused by climate variability as well as irrigation the former can be achieved from the assimilation results and for the latter we use monthly 0 50 irrigation outputs from the community land model clm version 4 5 oleson et al 2013 pcr globwb version 2 sutanudjaja et al 2018 and watergap version 2 müller et al 2014 tws estimates of these models are also compared with that of data assimilation to investigate the results in the absence of local in situ data see supplementary materials 3 2 satellite remote sensing 3 2 1 tws observations the tws data are derived from l2 level 2 up to degree and order 120 grace 2002 2017 and grace fo 2018 2019 products mayer gürr et al 2014 mayer gürr et al 2018 the l2 products are first improved using a standard procedure that includes replacing low degree coefficients i e c10 c11 s11 and c20 with accurate estimates swenson et al 2008 cheng and tapley 2004 and then converted from spherical harmonics to 1 1 gridded tws changes wahr et al 1998 the calculated tws are further filtered using the kernel fourier integration kefin filter khaki et al 2018 to reduce striping and leakage errors these steps are applied for both grace 2002 2017 and grace fo 2018 2019 the estimated tws is then used to update the aggregated model surface and snow water storage soil moisture at all layers and groundwater to remove the bias between the observations and model the mean model tws for each satellite period is derived added to the grace tws changes zaitchik et al 2008 following previous studies grace error is considered to be spatially uncorrelated with 10 mm error for data assimilation e g zaitchik et al 2008 kvas et al 2019 3 2 2 satellite soil moisture three satellite missions of amsr e 2002 2011 smos 2011 2015 and smap 2015 2019 are used to derive soil moisture products to update the model top layer soil moisture the daily level 3 amsr e njoku 2004 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 reflects soil moisture content at 0 3 cm layer the level 3 smos soil moisture data jacquette et al 2010 has spatial and temporal resolution of 50 km and three days respectively and represents moisture variability of 0 5 cm depth lastly smap l3 level 3 radiometer global daily 36 km ease grid soil moisture o neill et al 2020 is used that reflects soil moisture variabilities of the top 5 cm of the soil column on a daily basis all soil moisture observations are rescaled into a 3 day for a full cover from ascending and descending passes 0 25 resolution for the assimilation process these are then used to update the model top layer soil moisture variabilities not the absolute values which has important impact on surface evaporation and water distribution to address the bias between the model simulations and observations cumulative distribution function cdf matching draper et al 2009 is used we assume 0 05 m 3 m 3 error for amsr e 0 04 m 3 m 3 error for smos and 0 02 m 3 m 3 error for smap observations following leroux et al 2016 dong et al 2018 during the data assimilation process 3 2 3 lai products the lai data is obtained from noaa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration lai climate data record cdr version 4 and fapar fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation claverie and vermote 2014 from 1981 to 2019 the data with a daily 0 125 0 125 converted from 0 05 0 05 resolution is used to improve the model counterpart the error of 0 2 m 2 m 2 is assumed for the lai data during data assimilation following fox et al 2018 the full list of datasets used in this study is described in table 1 4 method 4 1 data assimilation 4 1 1 state and observation vectors the multiple satellite remote sensing datasets are assimilated into w3ra using a dual ensemble kalman filter enkf filtering approach following ait el fquih et al 2016 to improve the model simulations of surface and snow water storage soil moisture top shallow root zone groundwater and lai thus the state vector includes these water components and the observation vector contains grace derived tws satellite soil moisture and lai products modis surface water data is used separately to improve surface water dynamics using the nudging approach cf section 3 2 the state vector is translated into the observation space using a linear observation operator where each simulated water component is updated based on its counterpart observation at every assimilation cycle to this end the observation operator accumulates all model water storage components into 1 to be updated by grace once a month the estimated correction i e offset between the model state and grace tws is added to the corresponding month s last day to run the model for the following month the observation operator also converts the model soil moisture into 0 25 by accumulating the values that correspond to each observational grid point model lai estimates are simply updated with observations with the same spatiotemporal resolution note that depending on the observation availability the observation operator is changed to either update variable individually e g for lai or jointly e g for lai and soil moisture or all three observations 4 1 2 state update the model state vector at assimilation steps when assimilated observations become available is updated using the dual enkf approach the dual enkf conditions the probability density function pdf of the model water components to available observations following the bayes rule the dual variant of the enkf jointly estimates the water components together with a well chosen set of poorly known model parameters these were selected based on a global sensitivity analysis khaki et al 2020 uncertainties in the model and its parameters and observations are also taken into account in the dual enkf which weights the available information according to their relative accuracy model uncertainty is parameterised based on a set of ensemble members which represent uncertainties in different model trajectories simulated using different model initial conditions and parameters observations uncertainties are derived from different sources cf section 3 2 the dual enkf estimates the state and parameters using two interactive enkfs this was derived following a one step ahead osa smoothing step as derived by ait el fquih et al 2016 the approach enforces an additional update step with the future observation which helps to mitigate standard enkf issues that often arise when dealing with poorly known noise models and limited ensembles raboudi et al 2019 at each assimilation cycle the applied filtering approach involves cycles of forecast steps with the model and update steps with the incoming observations the parameters are first updated using a kalman like update an osa smoothing step is then applied to compute a smoothed state ensemble based on the observation and updated parameters both the smoothed state and updated parameters are then integrated with the model to forecast the state another kalman like update scheme is then implemented to estimate the final state according to the observation these estimates are next used for forecasting with the model until the next observation becomes available see details in ait el fquih et al 2016 4 1 3 experiment run to implement the data assimilation approach first the model is run from 1979 to 1980 to generate an initial ensemble of 50 members by perturbing the meteorological forcing terms i e n 0 0 3 for precipitation n 0 50 for shortwave radiation and n 0 2 for temperature to account for the filter inbreeding issue in enkf based methods when a small ensemble size is used ensemble inflation and localization methods are applied ensemble members tend to converge when using a low ensemble number which consequently degrades the assimilation performance the two applied tuning techniques are standard solutions to address this issue without increasing the ensemble number that significantly adds to computation needs ensemble inflation works by increasing the ensemble deviation with respect to their mean by multiplying a coefficient here 1 2 suggested by e g anderson et al 2007 furthermore local analysis la houtekamer and mitchell 2001 is applied to limit the assimilation process spatially within 3 e g suggested by khaki et al 2020 of grid points this helps to tackle the filter divergence issue the outputs of the data assimilation system are validated using various independent observations across the me region to ensure the method s effectiveness to improve the model and water storage information the results of the validation process are provided in supplementary materials 4 2 auxiliary data merging 4 2 1 triple collocation analysis tca to have a better estimates of irrigation and tws estimates from clm4 5 pcr globwb and watergap2 a tca based approach is applied see e g dong et al 2020 first tca is applied to derive the error variance which in turn used to merge the three products for three independent noisy dataset tca can effectively provide their error characterization that is crucial for blending observations the method is applied at each grid point separately for irrigation and tws from the three models it considers one of the products as a reference and scales the other two to this reference product to remove the dynamic range differences of different products draper et al 2013 afterwards the error variances of the scaled products are calculated assuming that the errors of the three products are orthogonal and mutually independent the estimated error variances are then used for data merging explained below 4 2 2 data merging this step is carried out using a weighted averaging method based on the tca estimates for this purpose a merging approach based on the least square analysis can be defined as 1 m xw x yw y zw z where m is the merged output x y and z are the three input data with the corresponding weights of w x w y and w z that can be calculated using the least square solutions see details in yilmaz et al 2012 the merged irrigation is then removed from the grace data prior data assimilation assimilation of the remaining grace data can help to retrieve the missing trends and variabilities into water storage simulations caused by other factors such as floods droughts in addition the merged tws is used to assess the assimilation results 4 3 drought analysis drought plays an important role in climate variability over the me region characterising it then can help to better interpret the water storage changes within the area therefore two drought indices of standardized precipitation index spi and multivariate standardized drought index msdi are calculated to present hydro meteorological droughts forootan et al 2019 shows that spi and msdi can largely represent both meteorological and hydrological droughts based on precipitation and tws data over various regions spi is computed by fitting a gamma probability density function to the precipitation data then use the computed cumulative distribution to derive standard normal distributions following wu et al 2001 the output which ranges between 3 0 and 3 0 represents wet and dry conditions respectively and can be used for various scale droughts sub seasonal to seasonal and inter annual msdi is calculated using the cumulative joint probability density function of precipitation and tws time series details can be found in hao and aghakouchak 2013 similar to spi the calculated negative index represents dry drought climate condition while the positive index indicates wet climate condition aghakouchak 2014 afterwards a drought is characterised for a specific period if the estimated indices are continuously less than negative 0 9 for at least 3 months suggested by mpelasoka et al 2017 5 results we first analyse the spatial distribution of the water storage components across the me region to this end average tws groundwater soil moisture and surface water are compared against average precipitation over the period of 1980 2019 in fig 2 the standard deviations stds of estimated storage components based on the model ensemble are also plotted in the figure first the average water components are calculated over the study period for individual ensemble members i e 50 then the std values are calculated for every water storage it can clearly be seen that the water storage pattern largely follows precipitation with more available storage over the northwestern parts of me which include turkey northern parts of syria and iraq mountain ranges of alborz and zagros respectively in the northern and western parts of iran also show a large amount of water similarly a considerable amount of water storage can be found over the hindu kush mountains in the northeast parts of me limited water storage can be seen over a majority of the me region e g the southern south eastern central and south western parts these areas mostly cover the arab region including countries bahrain egypt iraq jordan kuwait lebanon oman palestine qatar saudi arabia syrian arab republic yemen and united arab emirates as well as large parts of iran central to southeast afghanistan west and south and pakistan centre south and west fig 2 suggests that except for the northern parts a majority of the me region suffers from insufficient water resources mainly due to climatic factors related to limited precipitation from fig 2 larger std values can be observed over areas with larger water variation which can be attributed to larger model uncertainties as well as variabilities the presented data assimilation uncertainties can be attributed to model and forcing data meteorology assimilated observations and applied data assimilation technique the impacts of both observations and data assimilation are far less than the forcing data on the output uncertainties e g hamill and snyder 2002 khaki et al 2020 despite this observation uncertainties are taken into an account during the data assimilation cf section 3 2 and the application of ensemble inflation and localization alleviate uncertainties in the system and small ensembles e g bergemann and reich 2010 thus fig 2 mainly reflect the uncertainties in the model forcing mainly precipitation where larger water and energy variabilities over the north and northwest parts of the region cause more uncertainties in the assimilation outputs to investigate results uncertainties further the tws results are compared with independent products from community land model clm version 4 5 oleson et al 2013 pcr globwb version 2 sutanudjaja et al 2018 watergap version 2 müller et al 2014 and nasa global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 1 gldas version 2 1 beaudoing et al 2020 fig 3 shows the correlation and the root mean squared errors rmse calculated between the assimilation results and tws from each model at every grid point all rescaled to 0 50 spatial resolution overall the results indicate a high correlation between the outputs especially for the case of gldas followed by pcr globwb the lowest rmse values are found between the assimilation and gldas tws larger rmse values can be seen e g for clm4 5 and to a lesser extent watergap2 in some areas e g northwest where of zagros mountain range exist these parts usually have a higher amount of rain variability throughout the year that can make modelling more complicated thus can lead to potential errors in land surface models more detailed evaluation of the assimilation performance to analyse the associated uncertainties against these models and additional independent measurements can be found in supplementary materials to further analyse the relationship between precipitation and water storage component changes in me average time series over the region are depicted in fig 4 trends for different periods are also displayed the trend values represented in red are checked statistically at 0 05 significant level using mann kendall test gocic and trajkovic 2012 statistically significant trends are found to be the periods 2 3 for precipitation 2 4 for tws 2 4 for groundwater 2 3 for soil moisture and non for surface water it can be seen that soil moisture variation and to a lesser degree surface water changes follow precipitation patterns and its trend tws and groundwater changes on the other hand show different patterns especially after 2000 similar to the precipitation time series positive tws and groundwater trends are noticeable prior to 2000 this however changes over the following years with mostly negative trends negative anomaly in and after 1990 can also exist and can be explained by the reported less than average precipitation in several countries of the me region barlow et al 2016 the negative trends over the period 1996 2001 follow the negative precipitation trend and are mainly attributed to the 1999 2000 drought extended to 1998 2002 over some areas the estimated drought indices can help to better investigate this fig 5 fig 5 shows the average spi and msdi indices over the me region noticeable wet period with positive values can be clearly seen prior to 2000 for both indices this is followed by a significant drought from 1999 to 2002 represented by spi and msdi this event is found to be extended by spi which shows a dry period up to 2005 as mentioned drought condition is characterised if the indices are continuously less than negative 0 9 for at least 3 months accordingly two major drought conditions are identified in the me region including the aforementioned 1999 2002 drought as well as the 2007 2008 drought also shown by barlow et al 2002 lotsch et al 2005 trigo et al 2010 both these droughts are largely attributed to la niña condition trigo et al 2010 hoell et al 2012 the impact of the 2007 2008 drought within the period 2001 2014 is also reflected in different water storage components including tws groundwater soil moisture and surface water cf fig 4 based on spi the dry condition dominates after 1999 until 2018 msdi on the other hand indicates more variations with considerable dry and wet periods during this time after 2018 spi and to a lesser degree msdi show wet condition mainly caused by increased precipitation for period 5 in fig 4 in addition to the impact of the drought water storage in the me region is influenced by non climatic impacts such as irrigation dry condition reported in fig 5 along with the irrigation water use can attribute to water decrease for the corresponding periods as it can be seen from fig 6 irrigation water use has been increasing constantly with 3 4 mm slope but more rapidly in 1985 1990 and after 2010 this exacerbates the pressure on the region s limited water resources the majority of irrigations occur in the eastern side of the region e g pakistan northwest of iran me s north to northwest parts e g iran and turkey the southern parts e g yemen and along with the nile basin in north africa this excessive irrigation e g through groundwater abstraction can lead to water storage decline and are also reported in longuevergne et al 2013 for the tigris euphrates basin located in the northwest of me and in forootan et al 2014 over iran khaki et al 2018 also showed groundwater depletion during the period of 2002 to 2013 across iran over the period 2014 2019 tws rise is noticeable following the increase in precipitation spatial maps of trend values over the entire me region for precipitation and various water storage components are presented in fig 7 plotting the overall trend over the period 1980 to 2019 for each grid point the spatial distribution of trend values helps to understand which areas are affected more by water storage depletion in general tws and groundwater exhibit negative trends across the me region this is more pronounced over the central to eastern parts of iran large parts of pakistan south eastern parts of the mediterranean sea where egypt israel and palestine are located and also over saudi arabia considerable groundwater decline can also be seen in the southern part of the arabian peninsula and yemen eastern parts of turkey and central parts of afghanistan these can be attributed mainly to the prolonged impact of droughts and to a lesser degree the water use other than irrigation a similar trend pattern cannot be observed in precipitation where the negative values can only be seen over areas in the southern north eastern and north western parts this can also be seen for the surface and soil moisture soil moisture does not show considerable trends except for negative trends in northwest of turkey southern saudi arabia central afghanistan and northwest of iran which can be mainly due to precipitation changes and to a lesser degree reduction in large streamflow and crop loss mutin 2009 as a result of dam impoundment and operations e g 1989 1998 in turkey jones et al 2008 this has also affected surface water storage along with other climatic factors negative surface water trends are also noticeable in some me areas e g turkey s eastern parts west of iran south of arabian peninsula and afghanistan s western parts this is particularly important because any decline in surface water storage can cause other significant environmental challenges such as dust storms as further discussed below the results suggest so far that water storage exhibits negative trends over almost the entire me cf fig 7 to further investigate this tws storage combined from the assimilation and irrigation results for different years across the region are shown in fig 8 note that the tws assimilation results are spatially rescaled to the same resolution of irrigation for this analysis tws decline can be clearly seen over the years many central to southern parts including areas in iran and arab countries have lost significant water resources cf fig 8 in addition considerable tws decrease can be observed over pakistan and to a lesser degree afghanistan the extent of water resources in the north western parts of me where turkey and the northwest of iran are located decreased gradually moreover tws decline is also considerable in the northern parts of egypt east and south of iran and the eastern side of the mediterranean sea to a large extent saudi arabia kuwait iraq have also been affected this extended issue can be explained mainly by the impact of the dry period after 1999 and frequent droughts and also increased water use primarily due to irrigation multiple studies have suggested an anthropogenic impact on water resources over the region for instance khaki et al 2018 showed that water use for various objectives e g industry and farming had considerable impacts on groundwater resources in iran haghighi and motagh 2019 reported similar findings and also concluded that this groundwater depletion has led to land subsidence in tehran groundwater depletion was also observed by voss et al 2013 over the tigris euphrates western as a combined effect of drought and groundwater withdrawals fig 8 shows that a majority of me suffers from water depletion which could lead to water crisis issues in the future overall it is estimated that tws declines with more than 2 0 46 mm year over the region this is statistically significant at 0 05 level based on mann kendall test the negative trend is found to be more considerable after 1995 the two major drought events in 1998 2002 and 2007 2008 seem to have exacerbated the situation to further analyse the tws variations the average trends for each me country for the two periods of 1980 1995 and 1996 2019 as well as the average amount of precipitation they receive are presented in fig 9 these two time periods are selected according to the tws time series which show larger discrepancies to precipitation and other water components after 1995 see fig 4 we also analyse the trends for major basins within the region and over the same periods fig 10 a noticeable difference can be seen between the precipitation and tws trend values blue and red bars in figs 9 and 10 over the two periods negative trends are evident during the 1996 2019 period for most of the me countries while the corresponding average precipitation does not show the same pattern no significant changes are observed in precipitation before and after 1996 despite this tws declines are considerable in different countries with iran saudi arabia and bahrain being the most affected turkey with a larger amount of received precipitation also experiences a negative trend similar results can be observed for pakistan especially for the period of 1996 to 2019 similarly it can be seen that most of the major hydrologic basins in the study area experience negative water storage trends during 1996 2019 there are however a few basins with negative trends before and after 1996 such as sakarya orontes and lake urmia nevertheless the rate of decline after 1996 is more pronounced for these basins the two major drought events in 1999 2002 and 2007 2008 along with increased water use for irrigation and industry e g voss et al 2013 khaki et al 2018 haghighi and motagh 2019 can cause the major negative trends in addition to climate variabilities and groundwater abstractions surface water managements can largely disrupt natural cycle of water storage changes during the past few decades several dams and reservoirs have been constructed at various scales in the me region to supply the growing population the number of these dams and reservoirs between 1950 and 2019 and their distribution are outlined in fig 11 a majority of the constructions are in the northwest areas where more surface water resources are available cf fig 2 turkey and iran are countries with the largest number of dams and reservoirs constructions which has not only affected these countries but also downstream countries such as syria and iraq this is especially important for those countries that rely on transboundary water bodies e g the tigris euphrates region which is shared mainly between iraq turkey syria and iran to investigate the impact of dam constructions on involved countries three sample areas a b and c as indicated in fig 11 are selected and their corresponding tws and surface water time series are demonstrated in fig 11 negative trends for tws can be observed in three areas with a more severe slope in c and to a lesser degree in b surface water changes also show a declining pattern specifically in c this can be caused by various factors such as decreased precipitation groundwater depletion and surface water managements tws and to a lesser degree surface water decreases are negatively correlated with the developments of dam and reservoir constructions this water storage decline especially after 2005 with an increased number of constructed dams can be partially attributed to the impacts of surface water management policies water storage changes over lakes and reservoirs are explored here using altimetry derived datasets and the reanalysis results to this end trends are calculated for the water level changes from g realm as part of the u s department of agriculture s foreign agricultural service usda fas and hydroweb similarly trends are calculated for the reanalysis tws over the same period and after spatially interpolating the results to the nearest lake and reservoir stations the spatial distribution of these trend values is displayed in fig 12 it can be observed that trends are generally negative for both results on the western parts of the region on the eastern side the trends are much smaller indicating less water decline rate compared to the western side overall a good agreement can also been seen from fig 12 between the lakes and reservoirs datasets and the assimilation results see more details in supplementary materials such agreement can also be seen in the central parts where both results demonstrate considerable negative trends these results agree with tws and surface water changes presented in fig 11 indicating negative water storage trends especially over the tigris euphrates region due to extended droughts and applied water management strategies e g upstream water abstractions water storage declines can also pose environmental challenges in addition to risking freshwater availability surface water deficiency insufficient soil moisture and soil degradation and reduction in land vegetation cover are important factors that can cause more frequent with higher intensity dust storms in iran s southeast parts for example drying of marshy freshwater lakes due to droughts and water abstraction have caused more occurrence of such storms miri et al 2010 rashki et al 2012 over the me region dust storms are a major concern for many countries particularly those located in the arabian peninsula this problem has become more frequent and severe over the past decades mainly due to surface water depletion and vegetation canopies decline furman 2003 world bank 2019 here the connection between water decline and dust storm variations is investigated for this purpose dust spatial and temporal over two points variations from the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 are analysed in relation to water storage components fig 13 this helps to investigate the impacts of changes in tws and soil water which is highly related to lai as a dimensionless index of vegetation canopies bréda 2003 to dust changes as shown previously kok et al 2018 the presence absence of vegetation can affect dust emissions this has usually been modelled based on the lai component e g mahowald et al 2010 from fig 13 the largest concentrations are found over semi arid and arid regions mainly in the central to southern parts of me and especially in saudi arabia however increased water stress and surface water scarcity in parts of iran in recent years seem to have also increased the occurrence of dust storms the analysis of the water components and dust variations over the sample points a and b with relatively bigger impacts suggest a clear connection between water loss and dust increase this effect can clearly be seen after 2005 with remarkable tws declines declines are also considerable for soil moisture and correspondingly lai especially over point a located in the southwest of iran considerable dust content increase is evident from the time series over both a and b which can be partially caused by the land surface dryness 6 conclusions this study presents the first comprehensive investigation of decadal water storage changes 1980 2019 across the me region the area has long suffered from the lack of accurate information on water resources which led to poor water management policies that not only put at risk its future development but also posed various environmental difficulties for the first time an advanced multivariate data assimilation system combining the outputs of a land hydrologic model and multiple satellite products have been implemented to reconstruct the variation of various storage components including groundwater surface water and soil moisture over the last 4 decades our analysis showed an uneven distribution of water resources with more availability in the northwest parts of the region where turkey northern parts of syria and western parts of iran are located excessive dam constructions especially after 2005 in these areas introduce more challenges to downstream regions such as iraq by affecting transboundary water bodies similar water issues were observed in the eastern parts of the me region and shared water bodies between afghanistan iran and pakistan the water management policies caused reduced surface water storage as well as vegetation canopies and crop loss in lower latitudes this was also found to cause more frequent and intense dust storms especially over the western parts of the me region our results also revealed a significant water storage decline across the me region particularly after 2000 negative trends of total water storage tws were observed to a larger extent over dry regions including the arabian peninsula with considerable impacts on saudi arabia and yemen central to eastern parts of iran and the majority of pakistan these regions highly depend on underground water resources nevertheless water storage depletion was also observed in areas with above average precipitation rate such as turkey south eastern parts of the mediterranean sea particularly israel and egypt these results confirm previous findings over different parts of the me region such as the reported tws declines for the tigris euphrates basin located in the northwest of me and over iran water storage depletion has also occurred in many me areas especially over recent years despite occasional increased precipitation which can be largely attributed to human interference and groundwater abstraction in addition frequent drought events were also found to affect the water storage within the me region particularly the two major droughts of 1999 2000 extended to 1998 2002 over some areas and 2007 2008 triggered by la niña conditions these have considerably impacted the region s water resources by imposing negative tws trends declaration of competing

river mr tonle sap river tsr and tonle sap lake tsl has been further complicated due to the reverse flow phenomenon rf beyond ongoing anthropogenic activities and climate change while continuous observations insufficient data and event driven measurement have remained a challenge for such a large basin accurate prediction of the rf period and water level influenced would pave the way in providing effective remedies for side effects in this area for future scenarios in this study the rf periods were investigated employing the k nearest neighbors knn and ensemble bagged tree ebt classification algorithms that showed comparable results with observed periods the predicted periods were then used to predict the daily water level at the confluence where the mr and tsr join using long short term memory lstm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis methods although both models yielded highly accurate water level predictions a slightly better performance was attributed to the lstm model regarding the tsr s role in the rf period results highlighted its significant role in extending the rf period in some years despite its much lower streamflow than the mr the developed

planning do et al 2020 which may exacerbate the existing uncertainties this per se raises the question of how stored water behind dams and the timing of the water release may influence the predictable hydrological and downstream flow patterns regarding the duration of the wet and dry seasons olson and morton 2018 additionally variations in annual rainfall as a consequence of global warming may intensify the flow pattern changes in tsl where 50 of cambodian gdp is attributed to the lake and its environs yu et al 2019 lamberts 2006 frappart et al 2018 beyond the reasons discussed earlier the mr and tsr interaction has remained a challenge since to what extent they influence the water level in the mr and the rf period has been poorly addressed while most essential aspects of tsl and its environs have been studied regarding the flooded area sediment dynamics water balance analysis kummu and sarkhuda 2008 siev et al 2016 kummu et al 2014 siev et al 2019 details have yet to be addressed to verify the role of tsr and mr in the creation of rf period and water level in the confluence where both rivers join the changes in the mr and tsr flow regimes due to natural and anthropogenic activities have raised many difficulties in predicting the mr water level influenced by the rf period a major difficulty is the rf phenomenon s complicated mechanism and the absence of an explicit relationship between the water level and streamflow the process based models i e hydrological and hydrodynamic models are usually used to simulate watershed processes the abundant number of parameters in process based models require time consuming calibration to increase the accuracy of the model prediction especially if the behavior of the processing system is large complex and non linear matzopoulos 2011 machine learning ml data based models have recently attracted considerable attention as an alternative tool to model the inherent relationship and process within the long series and large scale data the complex pattern between variables and data in the ml techniques is found directly from data without providing an explicit form of a pattern making it easier to construct the ml models than process based models many studies have used ml methods such as a neural network ann support vector machine svm and random forest to predict water level due to their super modeling efficiency soleymani et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 faruq et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 nguyen et al 2015 used random forests lasso and support vector regression svr methods to predict the daily water level for a flood warning system at the thakhek station on the mr he et al 2018 used remotely sensed data to reconstruct water level measurements at the vam kenh station on the mr however there have been no studies on predicting the rf period using process based or ml models depending on the presence or absence of dependent variables the ml techniques are classified into supervised learning for classification regression and unsupervised learning for clustering classification and regression algorithms use input vectors and assign values of target attribute to the unseen datasets various ml methods can be applied to a problem based on the user s application in this study a classification approach is required to classify the streamflow dataset into rf and non rf periods knn and ebt algorithms have shown acceptable performances in hydrological classification problems abraham et al 2020 chen et al 2020 shahabi et al 2020 naghibi et al 2017 knn classifies the unlabeled objects by finding patterns and similarities with other objects in the training dataset the nonparametric knn classification method is a flexible model making it a suitable classifier for problems with unknown joint distribution or hard to model parametrically this advantage is very beneficial for high dimensional datasets furthermore troyanskaya et al 2001 concluded that knn has higher sensitivity and robustness than other popular classification algorithms the novel ebt model is an aggregation of a base classifier i e a decision tree ebt is also a nonparametric method that outperforms many weak learners by overcoming the major drawback of the individual classifier like instability and low prediction ability also the model can reduce variance thus eliminating overfitting and possible error of the model cao et al 2010 extensive research has been conducted based on the ebt model in recent years with various classification problems as they have high performance in complex and high dimensional data lee et al 2012 wen and hughes 2020 mosavi et al 2021 multiple data driven approaches such as anfis and lstm methods have been applied to many hydrological studies including water level prediction at various water systems soleymani et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 anfis is a hybrid system of fuzzy logic systems and a neural network that can estimate any continuous function to the required precision while representing a significant prediction accuracy and handling a large amount of data and high speed computation anfis is capable of modeling nonlinear and dynamic systems zare and koch 2018 chang and chang 2006 used the anfis model to predict hourly reservoir water levels under heavy rainfall conditions zhang et al 2016 concluded that the anfis model could avoid information noise more effectively than svm and ann models in predicting short term water levels the continued development of artificial intelligence ai techniques has led to new ml methods named deep learning deep learning has been employed to solve the problems of many fields and show their advantages compared to convolutional neural networks cnn cai et al 2019 lstm is an advanced network of recurrent neural network rnn it is a state of the art deep learning method for time series sequence prediction dealing with nonlinearity and huge data the main advantage of the lstm network is that it can improve training performance by reducing the input dimension of the network chiang et al 2004 despite the recognition of lstm as a method to predict time series few studies have been applied in hydrological research particularly water level prediction as an exception faruq et al 2020 used the lstm model to predict hourly river water levels for flood warning and forecasting systems this study s primary purpose is to develop ml models to investigate the role of tsr and mr on the rf phenomenon in the tsl basin and the impact on the water level where the two rivers connect such models development plays an essential role in studying climate change impacts for commissioned and under construction dams in this area since measured data will remain a challenge for future scenarios for this purpose the rf period was first investigated using the knn and ebt classification models the obtained results were then used as influential input data for multiple data driven models i e anfis and lstm to predict water levels 2 study area with approximately 120 km in length olson and morton 2018 the tsr connects tsl to the mr fig 1 tsl and its environs experience a monsoon climate with annual average precipitation ranging from 1 300 to 1 500 mm siev et al 2019 with a relatively flat bottom the lake s water depth reaches 8 to 10 m in the wet season while in the dry season as the water backs up to the mr from tsl the inundated lake drains reaching a depth lower than 3 m olson and morton 2018 with a virtually permanent lake area of 2 400 km2 the catchment s average maximum size exceeds 12 000 km2 in the wet season where the major tributaries illustrated in fig 1 drain into the tsl and tsr together with a portion of the mr s streamflow stemmed from rf phenomenon kummu and sarkkula 2008 this significant difference can exacerbate the livelihood of the country s most impoverished communities living around the tsl and tsr poole 2018 3 data assembly for this study s purpose three hydrological stations are considered kratie chaktomuk and phnom penh port stations see fig 1 kratie station is located on the mr approximately 145 km away from the confluence where chaktomuk station is located and mr and tsr join fig 1 measured data in terms of daily time series discharge and water level from 2000 to 2020 june was obtained from www mrcmekong org for kratie and chaktomuk stations respectively for phnom penh port station located on the tsr and virtually 4 km away from the confluence daily time series discharge data are unavailable the tsinghua hydrological model based on the representative elementary watershed threw model was therefore adapted to obtain the daily time series discharge data which has been proven to yield high accuracy data on the mr and the surrounding environs tian et al 2006 mou et al 2008li et al 2012 hou et al 2021 regarding the adapted hydrological model a summary is therefore provided here the threw model divides the research basin based on the representative elementary watershed rew approach the rew is further separated into eight zones i e bare soil zone vegetated zone snow covered zone glacier covered zone sub stream network zone main channel reach zone saturated zone and unsaturated zone tian et al 2008 the rews and zones are linked by a set of balance equations for mass momentum energy and entropy for detailed information concerning the threw model refer to tian et al 2008 in the threw model a rew is an independently functional unit that includes all the watershed s essential functional components the rew scale is variable and can be divided on the scale of interest without losing its hydrological characteristics a rew can be subdivided into a smaller scale of rew with self similarity glacier and snow melting processes were incorporated into the threw model to improve its applicability to cold regions the evaluation of the employed hydrological model is carried out based on the kratie station and sen river that flows into the tsl see fig 1 part a since measured discharge data don t exist for other existing hydrological stations in this area although the employed model has not accurately predicted some of the fluctuations in daily discharge for sen and kratie stations the predicted daily discharge profile over the investigated periods follows relatively close to the measured one as seen in fig 2 the corresponding performance matrices i e nse and r2 for kratie and sen river highlight the reliability and capability of the employed model for tsl and its environs 4 model description this study applied four widely used ml techniques knn and ebt classification algorithms to distinguish the rf and non rf periods and anfis and lstm models to predict river water level the mechanisms of these models are described in the following subsections 4 1 k nearest neighbors knn classifier the knn is a common and nonparametric classification algorithm that has been widely used in hydrological studies due to not requiring prior assumptions or knowledge about the primary data distribution xia et al 2015 abraham et al 2020 shahabi et al 2020 the basic principle of the knn classifier is that instances of a dataset with similar properties exist in close proximity the classification label of new instances can be predicted based on the labels of its nearest neighbors using similarity indices or distance functions there are multiple distance metrics used in the knn algorithm for classification the euclidean distance for continuous variables and hamming distance for discrete variables are the most common distance metrics the other used metrics are spearman city block cosine and pearson correlation coefficients the number of neighbors k depends on the selected dataset the best choice of the chosen k depends on the data the effect of noise on the classification is reduced with a large value of k but decreases the distinction of the boundaries between the classes duda et al 2006 introduced a rule of thumb for obtaining the k value as the square root of the number of samples however this is not wholly eligible for diverse applications with different datasets in this study distance metrics of euclidean distance spearman and pearson correlation coefficients are used with various k values of 2 to 20 to find the best results in classifying rf and non rf periods 4 2 ensemble bagged tree ebt the ebt is a highly variable and unstable method that is sensitive to the training pattern therefore a completely different tree with overfitting might obtain a slight variation in data and an individual decision tree ebt improves individual decision trees performance and avoids the overfitting problem by aggregating the results of multiple decision trees which makes it the most accurate and efficient ensemble algorithm naghibi et al 2017 abraham et al 2020 chen et al 2020 fig 3 shows the distinct steps of the ebt algorithm according to fig 3 the bagging algorithm involves three different steps bui et al 2016 first the bootstrap sampling technique used in ebt is responsible for randomly re sampling the training dataset to build numerous sub datasets second a decision tree classifier is applied for each subset third all classifiers are aggregated to set the final model with the most accurate predictor the number of learners and splits are an essential part of the ebt classification method the increase in the number of learners and splits enhances the model accuracy and performance however a greater number of splits can cause model overfitting and a higher number of learners increases the processing time therefore achieving the best model results necessitates a trade off between the number of learners and a maximum number of splits for detailed information on the ebt model refer to breiman 1996 fig 3 illustrates the ebt structure employed in the present study 4 3 anfis model jang 1993 developed a model based on the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with a structure illustrated in fig 4 this model has been used widely in forecasting hydrological variables including river water level prediction chang and chang 2006 zhang et al 2016 anfis takes full advantage of both the neural networks and the fuzzy systems which combines the learning ability and the ability to model the inference of fuzzy systems to improve the decision making process in uncertain conditions the training method of the anfis model generates if then rules and optimizes the parameters of the membership function to establish a relation between the input and output variables the anfis model has five layers with several neurons that are used for different purposes the general anfis structure is shown in fig 4 suppose that an anfis model has two inputs x and y and a single output two fuzzy if then rules are expressed as follows 1 r u l e 1 i f x i s a 1 a n d y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 2 rule 2 i f x i s a 2 a n d y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 and b 2 are the membership function for inputs x and y p 1 p 2 q 1 q 2 r 1 and r 2 are the parameters of output functions the first layer is the fuzzification layer that used the predefined membership functions to convert the two input variables to a fuzzy set 3 q 1 i μ a i x q 1 i μ b i y f o r i 1 2 where non fuzzy x or y are the input nodes μ a i and μ b i are the membership functions specifying linguistic input labels of a and b respectively in the second layer the firing strength or weight w of the antecedent fuzzy rule in layer one is obtained by applying the and or the or operator to each neuron 4 o 2 i w i μ a i x μ b i y for i 1 2 the third layer calculates the average proportion of all the firing strength 5 o 3 i w i w i w 1 w 2 for i 1 2 the fourth layer calculates the contribution of the rules in the model output 6 o 4 i w i f w i p i x q i y r i for i 1 2 the fifth layer is the output node computing the overall output of the model 7 o 5 i i 1 4 w i f i 1 4 w i f i 1 4 w i the sugeno fuzzy system is usually adapted in the anfis system takagi and sugeno 1985 in this study a combination of the backpropagation gradient descent and a least squares method are utilized in the learning process to optimize the distribution of the membership functions thus various membership function types with different numbers of membership functions are evaluated 4 4 long short term memory lstm lstm network as a category of recurrent neural network rnn processes sequential data in a recursive form and it has superior performance in learning long term dependency in a sequence compared to rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the memory cells and gates in lstm have solved the vanishing gradient problem caused by the backpropagation the memory cells are self connected and can store and output the information every individual memory cell s behavior is defined by three multiplicative gates the input output and forget gates that update the cell state by their activation the gates are responsible for determining whether to forget or remember the past cell status and avoid error signal decay over long time steps gu et al 2020 lstm was initially introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which have been employed extensively in complex problems like natural language processing ma et al 2020 however lstm has only recently received increasing attention in hydrologic applications thus very limited studies have been conducted with lstm to predict water level e g jung et al 2018 liang et al 2018 faruq et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a the schematic diagram of an lstm network is illustrated in fig 5 the formulation of lstm is defined as follows 8 i t σ g w xi x t r hi h t 1 b i f t σ g w xf x t r hf h t 1 b f g t σ c w xg x t r hg h t 1 b g o t σ g w xo x t r

activation function and the state activation function respectively the term x t is the input to the memory cell layer at time t and the term h t and c t defines the hidden state and the cell state at time step t respectively w xi w xf w xg and w xo are the weight matrices from the inputs to the gates and cell candidate r hi r hf r hg and r ho are weights for the recurrent output b i b f b g and b

dataset of 2000 to 2012 4 749 point data 2013 to 2016 1 461 point data and 2017 to 2020 june 1 276 point data were chosen as training validation and testing sample data respectively the validation dataset is part of the training process which is used to fine tune the model parameters and avoid overfitting of the model that is built using the training dataset however the testing dataset is wholly held out of the learning to independently evaluate the model output and provide an unbiased sense of model performance russell and norvig 2002 kuhn and johnson 2013 the first step in predicting daily water levels at the confluence of mr and tsr is to predict the rf period that might alter these rivers flow patterns therefore the knn and ebt classification models are used to predict the rf and non rf periods with high accuracy the classification algorithms require an input vector x and output vector y which is the labeled data here binary classification for non rf and rf periods was used the trial and error procedure was applied on different combinations of four input instances of q m q t doy and h to map the input values to the labeled output q m q t doy and h represent the mr discharge the tsr discharge the day of the water year and the daily water level above mean sea level msl respectively in the non rf period the streamflow of the mr and tsr merge and form the main mr at the confluence before it bifurcates into two arms bassac river and the main mr therefore qm qt are added together to investigate the influence of these rivers on the water level at the confluence in contrast in the rf period the diverted portion of the mr streamflow pushes the tsr streamflow to be discharged into the tsl thus the mr streamflow qm is the driving force in water level formation at the confluence therefore to predict the water level at the confluence the new daily time series discharge data corresponding to the rf and non rf periods are introduced to the regression models there are no unified methods to determine the most critical input variables that have the most influence on the final results of ml approaches as a result different structures with various input variables were considered as the trial and error procedure to find the best structure that effectively simulates the nonlinear streamflow water level relationship herein the anfis and lstm models were applied to eight different structures to predict daily river water levels using daily streamflow data the structures are considered with varying variables of input and various time lags to find the best structure the considered structures are shown in table 1 ensemble models were trained for each month s streamflow in s m 1 and s m 2 structures with no lag time and one day lag time respectively structures s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 consider the entire streamflow dataset with zero to three day lag time the day of the water year doy parameter is also applied into the modeling process as a predictor which is the number of days from the start of the water year i e 1 may is the origin in table 1 f represents the prediction model q mt and q mt 1 denote the daily streamflow of a specific month at time t and its antecedent discharge at t 1 q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 show daily streamflow at time t and its three antecedent times do y t and do y t 1 are the day of the water year at time t and t 1 respectively 5 2 data normalization the raw data were normalized before applying to the classification and prediction models the advantages of normalizing data were avoiding the dominance of greater attribute data over lesser ones and alleviating numerical difficulties on the model s performance due to introducing small data values into the model the data samples were linearly mapped into the range of 0 1 using eq 9 9 x i x i x min x max x min where x and x i are the raw data and normalized data respectively x min and x max represent the minimum and maximum of the raw data respectively 5 3 model performance evaluation five performance metrics including accuracy sensitivity specificity positive predictive rates ppr and negative predictive rates npr are considered to evaluate the classifier efficiency with the help of a confusion matrix the correct classification is denoted as true and the misclassification is denoted as false in the matrix the true positives tp and false positives fp are the correct and false rf period predictions as a positive class respectively the correct and false prediction of the non rf period as the negatives class is represented by the true negatives tn and the false negative fn respectively the accuracy estimates the ratio of correct prediction by the classifier eq 10 sensitivity and specificity determine the ratio of correct classification of tp and tn respectively eq 11 and eq 12 ppr and npr are the classifier certainty of predicting the positive and negative classes respectively eq 13 and eq 14 10 accuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n 11 sensitivity tp tp f n 12 specificity tn tn f p 13 ppr tp tp f p 14 npr tn tn f n the performance efficiency of anfis and lstm models for water level prediction is evaluated with three reliable statistical indicators including the root mean squared error rmse eq 15 the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 16 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 17 choi et al 2020 faruq et al 2020 niu and feng 2021 the rmse evaluates the magnitude of error between the simulated and observed dataset showing the standard deviation of the residual the model can explain the proportion of the variance in the observed dataset by r2 value which ranges between 0 and 1 the closer the value of r2 to 1 the more reliable the forecast nse in the range of 1 represents the relative magnitude of the residual variance and the observed data variance nse shows the fitness quality of the simulated and observed data on a 1 1 line nse 0 indicates the simulation s poor performance while the nse 0 shows an acceptable simulation and the nse 1 indicates the forecasting result is perfect 15 rmse 1 t t 1 t h t h 2 16 r 2 t 1 t h h avg 2 t 1 t h t h avg 2 17 nse 1 t 1 t h t h 2 t 1 t h t h avg 2 where t is the size of the dataset h t and h t denote the observed and forecasted river water level at the time t h avg is the average value of the actual dataset 5 4 relative importance of input variable identifying the essential independent variables and their impact magnitude on the neural networks output is assessed by various methodologies olden et al 2004 refined the method proposed by scardi and harding 1999 to evaluate the relative contribution of input variables to the model output using the input perturbation method the technique has been shown to perform acceptably in determining the important parameters gevrey et al 2003 olden et al 2004 kemp et al 2007 to measure the variables contribution a series of uniformly distributed random numbers in the range of 1 to 10 000 were generated and normalized to the interval 0 1 before applying them to the network models kemp et al 2007 sequentially each variable data was replaced by the generated numbers and feed the new dataset to the originally trained model then the rmse values of the models with the generated data in relation to the reference model with original data represent the contribution of the input variables to the model s predictive ability the closer the rmse of the randomized data to the rmse of the original data the less the parameter s contribution to the output the ml models require repetitions because the outcome of the randomized models is a stochastic event based on random data and an arbitrary start point of the model therefore 100 repetitions are considered to achieve the relative importance of the input variables by ranking the rmse values 6 results and discussions 6 1 knn and ebt classification algorithms multiple combinations of input variables with various distance metrics and k values in the knn model and different numbers of splits and learners in the ebt algorithm were investigated to find the best structure the optimal structure for both classifiers contains qm qt doy and h as input variables the city block distance metric eq 18 and two neighbors were obtained for knn and for the ebt algorithm the number of splits and learners was 6 209 and 30 respectively additionally the k fold cross validation procedure is used to generalize the model on test data and obtain a more accurate performance in this process data are partitioned into k folds where k 1 sections are used for learning while one fold is held out for validation k iterations of the model with different combinations of training and validation data are performed in this study 5 fold cross validation is used 18 d st j 1 n x sj y tj where n is the number of objects xsj and ytj are two points in the data sample table 2 presents the corresponding performance metrics for each classification algorithm based on the model s training results the models show perfect performance in all indices highlighting the models accurate classification in the training process although the accuracy metric results eq 11 of the knn algorithm given in table 2 is higher than ebt one the imbalanced datasets such as the corresponding datasets to rf and non rf periods see table 3 require other metrics to be compared the rf period classification in knn shows superior performance having a sensitivity index equal to 0 967 and 0 932 compared to ebt with a sensitivity of 0 875 and 0 911 in validation and testing phases respectively both classifiers produce the same performance concerning the non rf period classification specificity 0 977 in the testing phase while a slightly better prediction is attributed to the knn 0 994 in the validation phase further the knn classifier s certainty in predicting the correct class ppr and npr is relatively higher than ebt in both the validation and testing phases in different years the observed rf period is given on the mrc website https pmfm mrcmekong org monitoring 6b table 3 shows the results of the predicted rf periods using the knn classification model in different years no discrepancy in the rf period s prediction is observed in the training phase highlighting the model s high accuracy in this phase while the given results accuracy in the training phase may be inferred as model overfitting the comparable periods yielded in the validation and testing phases indicate that the employed model gives satisfactory performance the knn model tends to overpredict the rf period with a more pronounced overprediction of the period s end in most years in the validation and testing phases please note that as we discussed earlier no study has been conducted thus far to investigate the rf and non rf periods using hydrological hydrodynamic or ml models to compare with this study s results however the current high performance of the employed classification models in predicting rf and non rf periods illustrates the efficiency of models 6 2 anfis and lstm models as discussed earlier the yielded results for rf and non rf periods are considered to re define the daily time series discharge data corresponding to the rf and non rf periods to be utilized as the input variable for anfis and lstm models to predict daily water level in the confluence for the anfis model the number and type of membership functions greatly influence the prediction of river water levels in this paper the anifs parameters effect on the model output was evaluated using a sensitivity analysis it was concluded that increasing the number of membership functions beyond 2 complicated the model unnecessarily and insignificantly increased the model s performance in addition the sensitivity analysis found that the type of membership function did not substantially influence the anfis performance these findings are supported by nayak et al 2004 and talei et al 2010 therefore a gaussian type membership function with two membership functions is employed the lstm network requires selecting and optimizing hyperparameters including optimizer number of units learning rate or number of epochs the selection of hyperparameters plays a critical role in achieving proper prediction results hutter et al 2014 often the objective functions in the optimization problem of the neural networks are stochastic that require to be solved using the stochastic gradient descent sgd optimization however it is shown that the adam algorithm provides more reliable and better results than sgd or other gradient based optimizers reimers and gurevych 2017 bakhashwain and sagheer 2021 wunsch et al 2021 the adam optimization algorithm is an efficient stochastic optimization updating network weights using the gradient first and second moments kingma and ba 2014 in order to have a smoother curve showing the change of the loss function and decrease the training process s speed the learning rate of the algorithm is considered lower than the default value of the adam algorithm 0 0001 instead of 0 001 le et al 2019 also gradient clipping is applied to the network to prevent the gradient from exploding wunsch et al 2021 there is no specific method for tuning all of the hyper parameters in the lstm network therefore the trial and error process is used based on the performance of the validation set to evaluate the effect of selecting different parameters values on predicted results table 4 in this study a hidden layer with 1 to 300 hidden units was considered and it was found that 100 hidden units to be suitable for the prediction water level the number of epochs is another hyperparameter required for the construction of the lstm network an epoch is defined as the process by which an entire dataset is passed into the network only once the obtained maximum number of epochs was 300 to record the information during training and validation effectively overfitting refers to a model that learns the details and noise in the training data that adversely affect the model performance on the validation data dropout and early stopping training are the popular methods to apply in the network and improve the model s efficiency and avoid overfitting srivastava et al 2014 early stopping is applied to stop the training process when the performance of the validation period starts to decrease here the model training stops if the validation performance shows no improvement after 100 epochs the random start point of the lstm model can often lead to sub optimal solutions to reach the optimal output results 10 identical runs were performed for each structure and the replication with the best statistical criteria in the testing process was chosen as the final model in this study the train validation test strategy is used to avoid the overfitting problem the training dataset is used to train the model and the validation dataset is used to find the best model structure and the corresponding parameters then the selected model is evaluated for the unseen test dataset the test set performance is compared with the validation set and if the results are comparable the model generalization error is low and is not overfitted table 5 provides the results of the anfis and lstm models for the eight structures discussed in table 1 the best structure is chosen based on the highest obtained performance metrics of nse and r 2 for the model while achieving comparable results between the validation and test phases to avoid model overfitting as illustrated in table 5 the nse values for sm1 and sm2 structures were lower than 0 5 for both prediction models thus the river water level could not be accurately predicted with monthly based streamflow despite these input variables the models performance improves significantly in other structures the anfis algorithm shows an increase in nse value with the rise in the number of the antecedent discharges as the input variables in structures of s1 to s3 nse 0 82 however considering streamflow up to three day lag time significantly reduces the anfis performance in predicting water level nse 0 75 this illustrates that increasing the number of inputs beyond a specific number complicates the model and decreases the model performance structures with streamflow and doy i e s5 and s6 as model input have substantially better statistical criteria nse 0 93 than other structures the anfis model with a one day lag time of the entire streamflow dataset and their doy shows the best output results as the lstm network is capable of solving complex problems it results in considerably superior performance than anfis in structures with an entire streamflow dataset nse 0 95 specifically in s4 with a high number of input variables similarly models with discharge data and their doy show the highest model performance in the lstm model with s6 as the utmost accurate model both algorithms performance criteria indicate that introducing the doy of the streamflow data can enhance the models performance with a relatively more pronounced accuracy associated with a one day lag time of data in addition the streamflow and water level data were segregated for each season and a seasonal analysis was also performed for the model structures s 2 to s 6 the results showed highly unsatisfactory performance for all the structures in the anfis and lstm models the evaluation of the structures of s1 to s6 in the testing phase is shown in fig 7 a triangle with maximum nse and r2 i e 1 and minimum rmse i e close to zero depict the best model performance the lstm model s criteria represent very close results in various structures while the anfis model s indices depict varying outcomes particularly in rmse values the performance comparison of the models in fig 7 shows a decrease in the rmse value from 0 6302 to 0 4457 and an increase in nse and r2 values from 0 9353 to 0 9676 and 0 9559 to 0 9863 respectively in the lstm model compared to the anfis the results illustrate that lstm outperforms the anfis model therefore the s6 structure in the lstm network is used for further assessment and prediction the corresponding relationship of the s6 structure yielded by the lstm model between the observed and predicted water level is shown in fig 8 in the scatter plots the 45 line indicates the graphical performance of the data pairs revealing better prediction when they are closer to the line the results show that the model has accurately predicted most of the observation values with high r 2 in the training validation and testing phases a predicted water level profile in the testing phase for the years between 2017 and 2020 at the chaktomuk station is illustrated in fig 9 comparing the predicted and observed water level profiles highlights that the lstm model can predict low mid and high water levels with high accuracy although the employed model has not accurately predicted some of the fluctuations the predicted water level profile s general shape is nearly identical to the observed one the transferability of the developed model was verified using the best model structure of the lstm model i e s6 with long data records of the observed water levels at two hydrological stations including prek kdam and neak luong located upstream of the phnom penh port station and downstream of the confluence respectively see fig 1 comparing the predicted water level data with observed ones from 2000 to june 2020 shows the high accuracy of the developed model with the corresponding nse of 0 95 and 0 94 r 2 of 0 975 and 0 974 and rmse of 0 52 and 0 41 for perk kdam and neak luong stations respectively see fig 10 as seen the model has well captured the water level fluctuations throughout the investigated period although the water level at a few stations in the mr has already been predicted in some studies see introduction which are located outside of the study area in the present work the water level at the chaktomuk station and tsl s environs have not been investigated particularly considering the effects of the rf period in the tsr and mr s discharge comparing observed and simulated water levels at the chaktomuk prek kdam and neak luong hydrological stations demonstrates the efficiency and capability of the employed models in predicting the water level at this area 6 3 quantification of relative importance of input variables the relative contribution of four independent variables to the water level prediction of the lstm model is shown in fig 11 in a box plot form rmse is the error metric used to quantify the effect of independent variables on the model output compared to the reference model with the median value of 0 32 for rmse the model yields the higher median values for streamflow with no lag time q t and one day lag time q t 1 with the corresponding values of 2 98 and 2 85 respectively highlighting the strongest relationship with the predicted water level while the doy t and doy t 1 variables show a slight contribution in the model output with a median value of 0 35 the small contribution of doy parameters on the model s performance of water level prediction can also be seen from the results provided in table 5 for example the performance of the s 6 structure with the four parameters insignificantly improves compared to the s 2 structure with only streamflow parameters 6 4 the role of tsr on rf period and water level as discussed earlier as the water level rises during the rf period a portion of the mr streamflow deviates from the main stem pushing the tsr streamflow and discharge into the tsl highlighting the mr s dominant role in the creation of the rf phenomenon although the volume of water flowing in the mr and tsr is significantly different addressing tsr streamflow qt impacts upon predicting the rf period and the water level is essential since it might alter the accumulated water in tsr and tsl therefore the knn and lstm models which yielded more accurate results in the previous sections are employed to illustrate the effect of excluding qt from the modeling process i e using qm doy and h here the previously obtained structures are used in the employed models the predicted rf periods using knn and without tsr streamflow are presented in table 6 the knn algorithm showed an accuracy of 100 which was completely similar to the results presented in table 3 thus the predicted periods for validation and testing phases having the accuracy of 97 2 and 96 8 respectively are given in table 6 comparing the errors obtained in table 6 with table 3 highlights that tsr plays a vital role in predicting the rf period these discrepancies are more pronounced at the prediction of the end of the rf period considering the excluded qt from the model the qm is used as an input variable for the lstm model to predict water level at the confluence s6 structure given in table 1 which yielded more accurate results was modeled with the same parameter settings discussed in table 4 the statistical criteria obtained in training validation and testing phases for the lstm model were 0 9887 0 9868 and 0 9878 for r2 0 3157 0 3734 and 0 4662 for rmse and 0 9881 0 9747 and 0 9646 for nse respectively although the existing performance indices show better results in the training process than table 5 a lower accuracy is attributed to the validation and testing phases 0 02 however this difference is small and negligible this highlights the insignificant role of the tsr on the water level at the confluence 7 conclusions the rf phenomenon between the mr and tsl affects a large part of cambodia s ecosystem necessitating providing a reliable model to predict the rf period and the water level influenced in doing so four widely ml models were employed knn and ebt as classification algorithms for predicting rf periods and anfis and lstm regression models for water level prediction according to the performance metrics the knn model was employed to distinguish the rf and non rf periods the obtained results were comparable compared to the observed periods these results were then used to re define the corresponding daily time series discharge data to the rf and non rf periods to be used for water level prediction through eight structures defined to identify the most influential input variables it was concluded that anfis and lstm models produced accurate results as a structure entailing streamflow dataset with their doy and one day lag time i e s 6 was utilized however a slightly better performance was attributed to the lstm model according to three quantitative statistical indexes used i e rmse r2 and nse the influence of the tsr s role in creating the rf period and the water level affected at the confluence was also investigated excluding the tsr streamflow i e qt from the classification and water level prediction processes revealed that although tsr streamflow significantly extends the rf period in some years its impact on the water level at the confluence is relatively small and negligible the transferability of the developed lstm model was also verified and revealed that the model was capable of obtaining highly accurate results for daily water level data the developed modeling framework can be used for river lake systems influenced by the rf phenomenon as well as management plans for future scenarios where reliable data would not be available

3883,reliable assessment of the natural interactions in large river lake systems is vital for water supply planning flood regulation and ecosystem services the existing interaction between the mekong river mr tonle sap river tsr and tonle sap lake tsl has been further complicated due to the reverse flow phenomenon rf beyond ongoing anthropogenic activities and climate change while continuous observations insufficient data and event driven measurement have remained a challenge for such a large basin accurate prediction of the rf period and water level influenced would pave the way in providing effective remedies for side effects in this area for future scenarios in this study the rf periods were investigated employing the k nearest neighbors knn and ensemble bagged tree ebt classification algorithms that showed comparable results with observed periods the predicted periods were then used to predict the daily water level at the confluence where the mr and tsr join using long short term memory lstm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis methods although both models yielded highly accurate water level predictions a slightly better performance was attributed to the lstm model regarding the tsr s role in the rf period results highlighted its significant role in extending the rf period in some years despite its much lower streamflow than the mr the developed model could be used as a reliable machine learning ml framework where there is a need for highly accurate data regarding rf and water levels for tsl and its environs keyword tonle sap lake reverse

the lives of the people and local communities and is a critical resource for agriculture and commerce frappart et al 2018 the current unique hydrological phenomenon i e rf has created uncertainties in understanding the tsl interaction with the mr the rf period varies year by year which could be due to infrastructure development i e constructing large dams and climate variations e g in annual rainfall for example lancang mekong river basin lmrb countries have turned to building hydraulic structures such as multipurpose dams some of which have been built are under construction or are in the planning do et al 2020 which may exacerbate the existing uncertainties this per se raises the question of how stored water behind dams and the timing of the water release may influence the predictable hydrological and downstream flow patterns regarding the duration of the wet and dry seasons olson and morton 2018 additionally variations in annual rainfall as a consequence of global warming may intensify the flow pattern changes in tsl where 50 of cambodian gdp is attributed to the lake and its environs yu et al 2019 lamberts 2006 frappart et al 2018 beyond the reasons discussed earlier the mr and tsr interaction has remained a challenge since to what extent they influence the water level in the mr and the rf period has been poorly addressed while most essential aspects of tsl and its environs have been studied regarding the flooded area sediment dynamics water balance analysis kummu and sarkhuda 2008 siev et al 2016 kummu et al 2014 siev et al 2019 details have yet to be addressed to verify the role of tsr and mr in the creation of rf period and water level in the confluence where both rivers join the changes in the mr and tsr flow regimes due to natural and anthropogenic activities have raised many difficulties in predicting the mr water level influenced by the rf period a major difficulty is the rf phenomenon s complicated mechanism and the absence of an explicit relationship between the water level and streamflow the process based models i e hydrological and hydrodynamic models are usually used to simulate watershed processes the abundant number of parameters in process based models require time consuming calibration to increase the accuracy of the model prediction especially if the behavior of the processing system is large complex and non linear matzopoulos 2011 machine learning ml data based models have recently attracted considerable attention as an alternative tool to model the inherent relationship and process within the long series and large scale data the complex pattern between variables and data in the ml techniques is found directly from data without providing an explicit form of a pattern making it easier to construct the ml models than process based models many studies have used ml methods such as a neural network ann support vector machine svm and random forest to predict water level due to their super modeling efficiency soleymani et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 faruq et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 nguyen et al 2015 used random forests lasso and support vector regression svr methods to predict the daily water level for a flood warning system at the thakhek station on the mr he et al 2018 used remotely sensed data to reconstruct water level measurements at the vam kenh station on the mr however there have been no studies on predicting the rf period using process based or ml models depending on the presence or absence of dependent variables the ml techniques are classified into supervised learning for classification regression and unsupervised learning for clustering classification and regression algorithms use input vectors and assign values of target attribute to the unseen datasets various ml methods can be applied to a problem based on the user s application in this study a classification approach is required to classify the streamflow dataset into rf and non rf periods knn and ebt algorithms have shown acceptable performances in hydrological classification problems abraham et al 2020 chen et al 2020 shahabi et al 2020 naghibi et al 2017 knn classifies the unlabeled objects by finding patterns and similarities with other objects in the training dataset the nonparametric knn classification method is a flexible model making it a suitable classifier for problems with unknown joint distribution or hard to model parametrically this advantage is very beneficial for high dimensional datasets furthermore troyanskaya et al 2001 concluded that knn has higher sensitivity and robustness than other popular classification algorithms the novel ebt model is an aggregation of a base classifier i e a decision tree ebt is also a nonparametric method that outperforms many weak learners by overcoming the major drawback of the individual classifier like instability and low prediction ability also the model can reduce variance thus eliminating overfitting and possible error of the model cao et al 2010 extensive research has been conducted based on the ebt model in recent years with various classification problems as they have high performance in complex and high dimensional data lee et al 2012 wen and hughes 2020 mosavi et al 2021 multiple data driven approaches such as anfis and lstm methods have been applied to many hydrological studies including water level prediction at various water systems soleymani et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 anfis is a hybrid system of fuzzy logic systems and a neural network that can estimate any continuous function to the required precision while representing a significant prediction accuracy and handling a large amount of data and high speed computation anfis is capable of modeling nonlinear and dynamic systems zare and koch 2018 chang and chang 2006 used the anfis model to predict hourly reservoir water levels under heavy rainfall conditions zhang et al 2016 concluded that the anfis model could avoid information noise more effectively than svm and ann models in predicting short term water levels the continued development of artificial intelligence ai techniques has led to new ml methods named deep learning deep learning has been employed to solve the problems of many fields and show their advantages compared to convolutional neural networks cnn cai et al 2019 lstm is an advanced network of recurrent neural network rnn it is a state of the art deep learning method for time series sequence prediction dealing with nonlinearity and huge data the main advantage of the lstm network is that it can improve training performance by reducing the input dimension of the network chiang et al 2004 despite the recognition of lstm as a method to predict time series few studies have been applied in hydrological research particularly water level prediction as an exception faruq et al 2020 used the lstm model to predict hourly river water levels for flood warning and forecasting systems this study s primary purpose is to develop ml models to investigate the role of tsr and mr on the rf phenomenon in the tsl basin and the impact on the water level where the two rivers connect such models development plays an essential role in studying climate change impacts for commissioned and under construction dams in this area since measured data will remain a challenge for future scenarios for this purpose the rf period was first investigated using the knn and ebt classification models the obtained results were then used as influential input data for multiple data driven models i e anfis and lstm to predict water levels 2 study area with approximately 120 km in length olson and morton 2018 the tsr connects tsl to the mr fig 1 tsl and its environs experience a monsoon climate with annual average precipitation ranging from 1 300 to 1 500 mm siev et al 2019 with a relatively flat bottom the lake s water depth reaches 8 to 10 m in the wet season while in the dry season as the water backs up to the mr from tsl the inundated lake drains reaching a depth lower than 3 m olson and morton 2018 with a virtually permanent lake area of 2 400 km2 the catchment s average maximum size exceeds 12 000 km2 in the wet season where the major tributaries illustrated in fig 1 drain into the tsl and tsr together with a portion of the mr s streamflow stemmed from rf phenomenon kummu and sarkkula 2008 this significant difference can exacerbate the livelihood of the country s most impoverished communities living around the tsl and tsr poole 2018 3 data assembly for this study s purpose three hydrological stations are considered kratie chaktomuk and phnom penh port stations see fig 1 kratie station is located on the mr approximately 145 km away from the confluence where chaktomuk station is located and mr and tsr join fig 1 measured data in terms of daily time series discharge and water level from 2000 to 2020 june was obtained from www mrcmekong org for kratie and chaktomuk stations respectively for phnom penh port station located on the tsr and virtually 4 km away from the confluence daily time series discharge data are unavailable the tsinghua hydrological model based on the representative elementary watershed threw model was therefore adapted to obtain the daily time series discharge data which has been proven to yield high accuracy data on the mr and the surrounding environs tian et al 2006 mou et al 2008li et al 2012 hou et al 2021 regarding the adapted hydrological model a summary is therefore provided here the threw model divides the research basin based on the representative elementary watershed rew approach the rew is further separated into eight zones i e bare soil zone vegetated zone snow covered zone glacier covered zone sub stream network zone main channel reach zone saturated zone and unsaturated zone tian et al 2008 the rews and zones are linked by a set of balance equations for mass momentum energy and entropy for detailed information concerning the threw model refer to tian et al 2008 in the threw model a rew is an independently functional unit that includes all the watershed s essential functional components the rew scale is variable and can be divided on the scale of interest without losing its hydrological characteristics a rew can be subdivided into a smaller scale of rew with self similarity glacier and snow melting processes were incorporated into the threw model to improve its applicability to cold regions the evaluation of the employed hydrological model is carried out based on the kratie station and sen river that flows into the tsl see fig 1 part a since measured discharge data don t exist for other existing hydrological stations in this area although the employed model has not accurately predicted some of the fluctuations in daily discharge for sen and kratie stations the predicted daily discharge profile over the investigated periods follows relatively close to the measured one as seen in fig 2 the corresponding performance matrices i e nse and r2 for kratie and sen river highlight the reliability and capability of the employed model for tsl and its environs 4 model description this study applied four widely used ml techniques knn and ebt classification algorithms to distinguish the rf and non rf periods and anfis and lstm models to predict river water level the mechanisms of these models are described in the following subsections 4 1 k nearest neighbors knn classifier the knn is a common and nonparametric classification algorithm that has been widely used in hydrological studies due to not requiring prior assumptions or knowledge about the primary data distribution xia et al 2015 abraham et al 2020 shahabi et al 2020 the basic principle of the knn classifier is that instances of a dataset with similar properties exist in close proximity the classification label of new instances can be predicted based on the labels of its nearest neighbors using similarity indices or distance functions there are multiple distance metrics used in the knn algorithm for classification the euclidean distance for continuous variables and hamming distance for discrete variables are the most common distance metrics the other used metrics are spearman city block cosine and pearson correlation coefficients the number of neighbors k depends on the selected dataset the best choice of the chosen k depends on the data the effect of noise on the classification is reduced with a large value of k but decreases the distinction of the boundaries between the classes duda et al 2006 introduced a rule of thumb for obtaining the k value as the square root of the number of samples however this is not wholly eligible for diverse applications with different datasets in this study distance metrics of euclidean distance spearman and pearson correlation coefficients are used with various k values of 2 to 20 to find the best results in classifying rf and non rf periods 4 2 ensemble bagged tree ebt the ebt is a highly variable and unstable method that is sensitive to the training pattern therefore a completely different tree with overfitting might obtain a slight variation in data and an individual decision tree ebt improves individual decision trees performance and avoids the overfitting problem by aggregating the results of multiple decision trees which makes it the most accurate and efficient ensemble algorithm naghibi et al 2017 abraham et al 2020 chen et al 2020 fig 3 shows the distinct steps of the ebt algorithm according to fig 3 the bagging algorithm involves three different steps bui et al 2016 first the bootstrap sampling technique used in ebt is responsible for randomly re sampling the training dataset to build numerous sub datasets second a decision tree classifier is applied for each subset third all classifiers are aggregated to set the final model with the most accurate predictor the number of learners and splits are an essential part of the ebt classification method the increase in the number of learners and splits enhances the model accuracy and performance however a greater number of splits can cause model overfitting and a higher number of learners increases the processing time therefore achieving the best model results necessitates a trade off between the number of learners and a maximum number of splits for detailed information on the ebt model refer to breiman 1996 fig 3 illustrates the ebt structure employed in the present study 4 3 anfis model jang 1993 developed a model based on the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with a structure illustrated in fig 4 this model has been used widely in forecasting hydrological variables including river water level prediction chang and chang 2006 zhang et al 2016 anfis takes full advantage of both the neural networks and the fuzzy systems which combines the learning ability and the ability to model the inference of fuzzy systems to improve the decision making process in uncertain conditions the training method of the anfis model generates if then rules and optimizes the parameters of the membership function to establish a relation between the input and output variables the anfis model has five layers with several neurons that are used for different purposes the general anfis structure is shown in fig 4 suppose that an anfis model has two inputs x and y and a single output two fuzzy if then rules are expressed as follows 1 r u l e 1 i f x i s a 1 a n d y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 2 rule 2 i f x i s a 2 a n d y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 and b 2 are the membership function for inputs x and y p 1 p 2 q 1 q 2 r 1 and r 2 are the parameters of output functions the first layer is the fuzzification layer that used the predefined membership functions to convert the two input variables to a fuzzy set 3 q 1 i μ a i x q 1 i μ b i y f o r i 1 2 where non fuzzy x or y are the input nodes μ a i and μ b i are the membership functions specifying linguistic input labels of a and b respectively in the second layer the firing strength or weight w of the antecedent fuzzy rule in layer one is obtained by applying the and or the or operator to each neuron 4 o 2 i w i μ a i x μ b i y for i 1 2 the third layer calculates the average proportion of all the firing strength 5 o 3 i w i w i w 1 w 2 for i 1 2 the fourth layer calculates the contribution of the rules in the model output 6 o 4 i w i f w i p i x q i y r i for i 1 2 the fifth layer is the output node computing the overall output of the model 7 o 5 i i 1 4 w i f i 1 4 w i f i 1 4 w i the sugeno fuzzy system is usually adapted in the anfis system takagi and sugeno 1985 in this study a combination of the backpropagation gradient descent and a least squares method are utilized in the learning process to optimize the distribution of the membership functions thus various membership function types with different numbers of membership functions are evaluated 4 4 long short term memory lstm lstm network as a category of recurrent neural network rnn processes sequential data in a recursive form and it has superior performance in learning long term dependency in a sequence compared to rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the memory cells and gates in lstm have solved the vanishing gradient problem caused by the backpropagation the memory cells are self connected and can store and output the information every individual memory cell s behavior is defined by three multiplicative gates the input output and forget gates that update the cell state by their activation the gates are responsible for determining whether to forget or remember the past cell status and avoid error signal decay over long time steps gu et al 2020 lstm was initially introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which have been employed extensively in complex problems like natural language processing ma et al 2020 however lstm has only recently received increasing attention in hydrologic applications thus very limited studies have been conducted with lstm to predict water level e g jung et al 2018 liang et al 2018 faruq et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a the schematic diagram of an lstm network is illustrated in fig 5 the formulation of lstm is defined as follows 8 i t σ g w xi x t r hi h t 1 b i f t σ g w xf x t r hf h t 1 b f g t σ c w xg x t r hg h t 1 b g o t σ g w xo x t r

activation function and the state activation function respectively the term x t is the input to the memory cell layer at time t and the term h t and c t defines the hidden state and the cell state at time step t respectively w xi w xf w xg and w xo are the weight matrices from the inputs to the gates and cell candidate r hi r hf r hg and r ho are weights for the recurrent output b i b f b g and b o are bias vectors θ depicts the elementwise multiplication of vectors 5 methodology 5 1 model development fig 6 illustrates the detailed steps followed in the present study the daily streamflow dataset of 2000 to 2012 4 749 point data 2013 to 2016 1 461 point data and 2017 to 2020 june 1 276 point data were chosen as training validation and testing sample data respectively the validation dataset is part of the training process which is used to fine tune the model parameters and avoid overfitting of the model that is built using the training dataset however the testing dataset is wholly held out of the learning to independently evaluate the model output and provide an unbiased sense of model performance russell and norvig 2002 kuhn and johnson 2013 the first step in predicting daily water levels at the confluence of mr and tsr is to predict the rf period that might alter these rivers flow patterns therefore the knn and ebt classification models are used to predict the rf and non rf periods with high accuracy the classification algorithms require an input vector x and output vector y which is the labeled data here binary classification for non rf and rf periods was used the trial and error procedure was applied on different combinations of four input instances of q m q t doy and h to map the input values to the labeled output q m q t doy and h represent the mr discharge the tsr discharge the day of the water year and the daily water level above mean sea level msl respectively in the non rf period the streamflow of the mr and tsr merge and form the main mr at the confluence before it bifurcates into two arms bassac river and the main mr therefore qm qt are added together to investigate the influence of these rivers on the water level at the confluence in contrast in the rf period the diverted portion of the mr streamflow pushes the tsr streamflow to be discharged into the tsl thus the mr streamflow qm is the driving force in water level formation at the confluence therefore to predict the water level at the confluence the new daily time series discharge data corresponding to the rf and non rf periods are introduced to the regression models there are no unified methods to determine the most critical input variables that have the most influence on the final results of ml approaches as a result different structures with various input variables were considered as the trial and error procedure to find the best structure that effectively simulates the nonlinear streamflow water level relationship herein the anfis and lstm models were applied to eight different structures to predict daily river water levels using daily streamflow data the structures are considered with varying variables of input and various time lags to find the best structure the considered structures are shown in table 1 ensemble models were trained for each month s streamflow in s m 1 and s m 2 structures with no lag time and one day lag time respectively structures s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 consider the entire streamflow dataset with zero to three day lag time the day of the water year doy parameter is also applied into the modeling process as a predictor which is the number of days from the start of the water year i e 1 may is the origin in table 1 f represents the prediction model q mt and q mt 1 denote the daily streamflow of a specific month at time t and its antecedent discharge at t 1 q t q t 1 q t 2 and q t 3 show daily streamflow at time t and its three antecedent times do y t and do y t 1 are the day of the water year at time t and t 1 respectively 5 2 data normalization the raw data were normalized before applying to the classification and prediction models the advantages of normalizing data were avoiding the dominance of greater attribute data over lesser ones and alleviating numerical difficulties on the model s performance due to introducing small data values into the model the data samples were linearly mapped into the range of 0 1 using eq 9 9 x i x i x min x max x min where x and x i are the raw data and normalized data respectively x min and x max represent the minimum and maximum of the raw data respectively 5 3 model performance evaluation five performance metrics including accuracy sensitivity specificity positive predictive rates ppr and negative predictive rates npr are considered to evaluate the classifier efficiency with the help of a confusion matrix the correct classification is denoted as true and the misclassification is denoted as false in the matrix the true positives tp and false positives fp are the correct and false rf period predictions as a positive class respectively the correct and false prediction of the non rf period as the negatives class is represented by the true negatives tn and the false negative fn respectively the accuracy estimates the ratio of correct prediction by the classifier eq 10 sensitivity and specificity determine the ratio of correct classification of tp and tn respectively eq 11 and eq 12 ppr and npr are the classifier certainty of predicting the positive and negative classes respectively eq 13 and eq 14 10 accuracy tp t n tp t n f p f n 11 sensitivity tp tp f n 12 specificity tn tn f p 13 ppr tp tp f p 14 npr tn tn f n the performance efficiency of anfis and lstm models for water level prediction is evaluated with three reliable statistical indicators including the root mean squared error rmse eq 15 the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 16 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 17 choi et al 2020 faruq et al 2020 niu and feng 2021 the rmse evaluates the magnitude of error between the simulated and observed dataset showing the standard deviation of the residual the model can explain the proportion of the variance in the observed dataset by r2 value which ranges between 0 and 1 the closer the value of r2 to 1 the more reliable the forecast nse in the range of 1 represents the relative magnitude of the residual variance and the observed data variance nse shows the fitness quality of the simulated and observed data on a 1 1 line nse 0 indicates the simulation s poor performance while the nse 0 shows an acceptable simulation and the nse 1 indicates the forecasting result is perfect 15 rmse 1 t t 1 t h t h 2 16 r 2 t 1 t h h avg 2 t 1 t h t h avg 2 17 nse 1 t 1 t h t h 2 t 1 t h t h avg 2 where t is the size of the dataset h t and h t denote the observed and forecasted river water level at the time t h avg is the average value of the actual dataset 5 4 relative importance of input variable identifying the essential independent variables and their impact magnitude on the neural networks output is assessed by various methodologies olden et al 2004 refined the method proposed by scardi and harding 1999 to evaluate the relative contribution of input variables to the model output using the input perturbation method the technique has been shown to perform acceptably in determining the important parameters gevrey et al 2003 olden et al 2004 kemp et al 2007 to measure the variables contribution a series of uniformly distributed random numbers in the range of 1 to 10 000 were generated and normalized to the interval 0 1 before applying them to the network models kemp et al 2007 sequentially each variable data was replaced by the generated numbers and feed the new dataset to the originally trained model then the rmse values of the models with the generated data in relation to the reference model with original data represent the contribution of the input variables to the model s predictive ability the closer the rmse of the randomized data to the rmse of the original data the less the parameter s contribution to the output the ml models require repetitions because the outcome of the randomized models is a stochastic event based on random data and an arbitrary start point of the model therefore 100 repetitions are considered to achieve the relative importance of the input variables by ranking the rmse values 6 results and discussions 6 1 knn and ebt classification algorithms multiple combinations of input variables with various distance metrics and k values in the knn model and different numbers of splits and learners in the ebt algorithm were investigated to find the best structure the optimal structure for both classifiers contains qm qt doy and h as input variables the city block distance metric eq 18 and two neighbors were obtained for knn and for the ebt algorithm the number of splits and learners was 6 209 and 30 respectively additionally the k fold cross validation procedure is used to generalize the model on test data and obtain a more accurate performance in this process data are partitioned into k folds where k 1 sections are used for learning while one fold is held out for validation k iterations of the model with different combinations of training and validation data are performed in this study 5 fold cross validation is used 18 d st j 1 n x sj y tj where n is the number of objects xsj and ytj are two points in the data sample table 2 presents the corresponding performance metrics for each classification algorithm based on the model s training results the models show perfect performance in all indices highlighting the models accurate classification in the training process although the accuracy metric results eq 11 of the knn algorithm given in table 2 is higher than ebt one the imbalanced datasets such as the corresponding datasets to rf and non rf periods see table 3 require other metrics to be compared the rf period classification in knn shows superior performance having a sensitivity index equal to 0 967 and 0 932 compared to ebt with a sensitivity of 0 875 and 0 911 in validation and testing phases respectively both classifiers produce the same performance concerning the non rf period classification specificity 0 977 in the testing phase while a slightly better prediction is attributed to the knn 0 994 in the validation phase further the knn classifier s certainty in predicting the correct class ppr and npr is relatively higher than ebt in both the validation and testing phases in different years the observed rf period is given on the mrc website https pmfm mrcmekong org monitoring 6b table 3 shows the results of the predicted rf periods using the knn classification model in different years no discrepancy in the rf period s prediction is observed in the training phase highlighting the model s high accuracy in this phase while the given results accuracy in the training phase may be inferred as model overfitting the comparable periods yielded in the validation and testing phases indicate that the employed model gives satisfactory performance the knn model tends to overpredict the rf period with a more pronounced overprediction of the period s end in most years in the validation and testing phases please note that as we discussed earlier no study has been conducted thus far to investigate the rf and non rf periods using hydrological hydrodynamic or ml models to compare with this study s results however the current high performance of the employed classification models in predicting rf and non rf periods illustrates the efficiency of models 6 2 anfis and lstm models as discussed earlier the yielded results for rf and non rf periods are considered to re define the daily time series discharge data corresponding to the rf and non rf periods to be utilized as the input variable for anfis and lstm models to predict daily water level in the confluence for the anfis model the number and type of membership functions greatly influence the prediction of river water levels in this paper the anifs parameters effect on the model output was evaluated using a sensitivity analysis it was concluded that increasing the number of membership functions beyond 2 complicated the model unnecessarily and insignificantly increased the model s performance in addition the sensitivity analysis found that the type of membership function did not substantially influence the anfis performance these findings are supported by nayak et al 2004 and talei et al 2010 therefore a gaussian type membership function with two membership functions is employed the lstm network requires selecting and optimizing hyperparameters including optimizer number of units learning rate or number of epochs the selection of hyperparameters plays a critical role in achieving proper prediction results hutter et al 2014 often the objective functions in the optimization problem of the neural networks are stochastic that require to be solved using the stochastic gradient descent sgd optimization however it is shown that the adam algorithm provides more reliable and better results than sgd or other gradient based optimizers reimers and gurevych 2017 bakhashwain and sagheer 2021 wunsch et al 2021 the adam optimization algorithm is an efficient stochastic optimization updating network weights using the gradient first and second moments kingma and ba 2014 in order to have a smoother curve showing the change of the loss function and decrease the training process s speed the learning rate of the algorithm is considered lower than the default value of the adam algorithm 0 0001 instead of 0 001 le et al 2019 also gradient clipping is applied to the network to prevent the gradient from exploding wunsch et al 2021 there is no specific method for tuning all of the hyper parameters in the lstm network therefore the trial and error process is used based on the performance of the validation set to evaluate the effect of selecting different parameters values on predicted results table 4 in this study a hidden layer with 1 to 300 hidden units was considered and it was found that 100 hidden units to be suitable for the prediction water level the number of epochs is another hyperparameter required for the construction of the lstm network an epoch is defined as the process by which an entire dataset is passed into the network only once the obtained maximum number of epochs was 300 to record the information during training and validation effectively overfitting refers to a model that learns the details and noise in the training data that adversely affect the model performance on the validation data dropout and early stopping training are the popular methods to apply in the network and improve the model s efficiency and avoid overfitting srivastava et al 2014 early stopping is applied to stop the training process when the performance of the validation period starts to decrease here the model training stops if the validation performance shows no improvement after 100 epochs the random start point of the lstm model can often lead to sub optimal solutions to reach the optimal output results 10 identical runs were performed for each structure and the replication with the best statistical criteria in the testing process was chosen as the final model in this study the train validation test strategy is used to avoid the overfitting problem the training dataset is used to train the model and the validation dataset is used to find the best model structure and the corresponding parameters then the selected model is evaluated for the unseen test dataset the test set performance is compared with the validation set and if the results are comparable the model generalization error is low and is not overfitted table 5 provides the results of the anfis and lstm models for the eight structures discussed in table 1 the best structure is chosen based on the highest obtained performance metrics of nse and r 2 for the model while achieving comparable results between the validation and test phases to avoid model overfitting as illustrated in table 5 the nse values for sm1 and sm2 structures were lower than 0 5 for both prediction models thus the river water level could not be accurately predicted with monthly based streamflow despite these input variables the models performance improves significantly in other structures the anfis algorithm shows an increase in nse value with the rise in the number of the antecedent discharges as the input variables in structures of s1 to s3 nse 0 82 however considering streamflow up to three day lag time significantly reduces the anfis performance in predicting water level nse 0 75 this illustrates that increasing the number of inputs beyond a specific number complicates the model and decreases the model performance structures with streamflow and doy i e s5 and s6 as model input have substantially better statistical criteria nse 0 93 than other structures the anfis model with a one day lag time of the entire streamflow dataset and their doy shows the best output results as the lstm network is capable of solving complex problems it results in considerably superior performance than anfis in structures with an entire streamflow dataset nse 0 95 specifically in s4 with a high number of input variables similarly models with discharge data and their doy show the highest model performance in the lstm model with s6 as the utmost accurate model both algorithms performance criteria indicate that introducing the doy of the streamflow data can enhance the models performance with a relatively more pronounced accuracy associated with a one day lag time of data in addition the streamflow and water level data were segregated for each season and a seasonal analysis was also performed for the model structures s 2 to s 6 the results showed highly unsatisfactory performance for all the structures in the anfis and lstm models the evaluation of the structures of s1 to s6 in the testing phase is shown in fig 7 a triangle with maximum nse and r2 i e 1 and minimum rmse i e close to zero depict the best model performance the lstm model s criteria represent very close results in various structures while the anfis model s indices depict varying outcomes particularly in rmse values the performance comparison of the models in fig 7 shows a decrease in the rmse value from 0 6302 to 0 4457 and an increase in nse and r2 values from 0 9353 to 0 9676 and 0 9559 to 0 9863 respectively in the lstm model compared to the anfis the results illustrate that lstm outperforms the anfis model therefore the s6 structure in the lstm network is used for further assessment and prediction the corresponding relationship of the s6 structure yielded by the lstm model between the observed and predicted water level is shown in fig 8 in the scatter plots the 45 line indicates the graphical performance of the data pairs revealing better prediction when they are closer to the line the results show that the model has accurately predicted most of the observation values with high r 2 in the training validation and testing phases a predicted water level profile in the testing phase for the years between 2017 and 2020 at the chaktomuk station is illustrated in fig 9 comparing the predicted and observed water level profiles highlights that the lstm model can predict low mid and high water levels with high accuracy although the employed model has not accurately predicted some of the fluctuations the predicted water level profile s general shape is nearly identical to the observed one the transferability of the developed model was verified using the best model structure of the lstm model i e s6 with long data records of the observed water levels at two hydrological stations including prek kdam and neak luong located upstream of the phnom penh port station and downstream of the confluence respectively see fig 1 comparing the predicted water level data with observed ones from 2000 to june 2020 shows the high accuracy of the developed model with the corresponding nse of 0 95 and 0 94 r 2 of 0 975 and 0 974 and rmse of 0 52 and 0 41 for perk kdam and neak luong stations respectively see fig 10 as seen the model has well captured the water level fluctuations throughout the investigated period although the water level at a few stations in the mr has already been predicted in some studies see introduction which are located outside of the study area in the present work the water level at the chaktomuk station and tsl s environs have not been investigated particularly considering the effects of the rf period in the tsr and mr s discharge comparing observed and simulated water levels at the chaktomuk prek kdam and neak luong hydrological stations demonstrates the efficiency and capability of the employed models in predicting the water level at this area 6 3 quantification of relative importance of input variables the relative contribution of four independent variables to the water level prediction of the lstm model is shown in fig 11 in a box plot form rmse is the error metric used to quantify the effect of independent variables on the model output compared to the reference model with the median value of 0 32 for rmse the model yields the higher median values for streamflow with no lag time q t and one day lag time q t 1 with the corresponding values of 2 98 and 2 85 respectively highlighting the strongest relationship with the predicted water level while the doy t and doy t 1 variables show a slight contribution in the model output with a median value of 0 35 the small contribution of doy parameters on the model s performance of water level prediction can also be seen from the results provided in table 5 for example the performance of the s 6 structure with the four parameters insignificantly improves compared to the s 2 structure with only streamflow parameters 6 4 the role of tsr on rf period and water level as discussed earlier as the water level rises during the rf period a portion of the mr streamflow deviates from the main stem pushing the tsr streamflow and discharge into the tsl highlighting the mr s dominant role in the creation of the rf phenomenon although the volume of water flowing in the mr and tsr is significantly different addressing tsr streamflow qt impacts upon predicting the rf period and the water level is essential since it might alter the accumulated water in tsr and tsl therefore the knn and lstm models which yielded more accurate results in the previous sections are employed to illustrate the effect of excluding qt from the modeling process i e using qm doy and h here the previously obtained structures are used in the employed models the predicted rf periods using knn and without tsr streamflow are presented in table 6 the knn algorithm showed an accuracy of 100 which was completely similar to the results presented in table 3 thus the predicted periods for validation and testing phases having the accuracy of 97 2 and 96 8 respectively are given in table 6 comparing the errors obtained in table 6 with table 3 highlights that tsr plays a vital role in predicting the rf period these discrepancies are more pronounced at the prediction of the end of the rf period considering the excluded qt from the model the qm is used as an input variable for the lstm model to predict water level at the confluence s6 structure given in table 1 which yielded more accurate results was modeled with the same parameter settings discussed in table 4 the statistical criteria obtained in training validation and testing phases for the lstm model were 0 9887 0 9868 and 0 9878 for r2 0 3157 0 3734 and 0 4662 for rmse and 0 9881 0 9747 and 0 9646 for nse respectively although the existing performance indices show better results in the training process than table 5 a lower accuracy is attributed to the validation and testing phases 0 02 however this difference is small and negligible this highlights the insignificant role of the tsr on the water level at the confluence 7 conclusions the rf phenomenon between the mr and tsl affects a large part of cambodia s ecosystem necessitating providing a reliable model to predict the rf period and the water level influenced in doing so four widely ml models were employed knn and ebt as classification algorithms for predicting rf periods and anfis and lstm regression models for water level prediction according to the performance metrics the knn model was employed to distinguish the rf and non rf periods the obtained results were comparable compared to the observed periods these results were then used to re define the corresponding daily time series discharge data to the rf and non rf periods to be used for water level prediction through eight structures defined to identify the most influential input variables it was concluded that anfis and lstm models produced accurate results as a structure entailing streamflow dataset with their doy and one day lag time i e s 6 was utilized however a slightly better performance was attributed to the lstm model according to three quantitative statistical indexes used i e rmse r2 and nse the influence of the tsr s role in creating the rf period and the water level affected at the confluence was also investigated excluding the tsr streamflow i e qt from the classification and water level prediction processes revealed that although tsr streamflow significantly extends the rf period in some years its impact on the water level at the confluence is relatively small and negligible the transferability of the developed lstm model was also verified and revealed that the model was capable of obtaining highly accurate results for daily water level data the developed modeling framework can be used for river lake systems influenced by the rf phenomenon as well as management plans for future scenarios where reliable data would not be available

3884,different definitions of drought from multiple perspectives complicate drought studies studying droughts from an integrated perspective helps to better understand their evolutions and driving factors but few studies have taken such a comprehensive approach in china this study conducted an assessment and attribution analysis of droughts across china from 2002 to 2020 based on an integrated drought index derived from observed terrestrial water storage tws data first the latest solution of satellite gravimetry data was employed to analyze spatiotemporal changes in tws deficits second droughts associated with tws deficits were detected using the water storage deficit index wsdi third an attribution analysis was conducted using the stepwise regression method to determine the driving factors of droughts the results show that china s tws decreases at a significant rate 1 79 0 43 mm yr p 0 05 from 2002 to 2020 the droughts detected by wsdi can generally combine the durations and intensities of the meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought indices which provides a comprehensive perspective the severity and intensity of countrywide drought have been at least doubled especially in the northern regions including the northern arid and semiarid region the huang huai hai plain and the loess plateau the attribution analysis revealed that both climate change and anthropogenic impacts played a dominant role in driving intensified droughts decreasing precipitation explains 20 to nearly 100 of tws deficits across the huang huai hai plain human water use especially for agriculture has also exacerbated droughts in the water scarce northern regions of china the wsdi was highly correlated with the water supply for human activities in the northern arid and semiarid region and the loess plateau this study shows the need to adopt measures to limit human water use beyond the regional capacity keywords terrestrial water storage drought china human impact climate change 1 introduction drought is a slowly developing but widespread recurring and costly natural disaster shukla and wood 2008 nasrollahi et al 2015 herrera et al 2018 when the supply of moisture fails to meet its demand drought occurs redmond 2002 ault 2020 the specific definition of drought however varies depending on the source of demands e g atmosphere hydrology plants and human activities wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 ault 2020 generally a meteorological drought occurs when below average rainfall continues for several weeks a hydrological drought refers to a clear water shortage in the hydrological system on inner to interannual time scales an agricultural drought leads to crop failure for months and a socioeconomic drought arises when socioeconomic water demand e g municipal water supply and hydroelectric power generation exceeds the natural water supply mishra and singh 2010 ault 2020 many different approaches have been developed to determine the occurrence of drought events meteorological droughts are commonly observed with precipitation patel et al 2007 quiring 2009 hydrological droughts given limited data sources are traditionally analyzed by model simulations and field observations of surface water level streamflow and soil moisture keyantash and dracup 2002 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 mishra and singh 2010 wanders and wada 2015 zhang et al 2016 the assessment of agricultural droughts is usually based on a combination of meteorological and hydrological factors affecting plants such as precipitation temperature soil moisture and agricultural data keyantash and dracup 2002 mishra and singh 2010 zhao et al 2015b liu et al 2020b and socioeconomic droughts are widely related to water management data guo et al 2019 although the drought events determined by the above approaches are related to each other wisser et al 2010 wada et al 2013 guo et al 2020 they solely focus on parts of the hydrologic cycle zhao et al 2017b under climate change and human impact the changes in the hydrological cycle and accompanying drought evolution are multifaceted global warming intensified the global hydrological cycle in the form of producing more precipitation dore 2005 evaporation brutsaert 2017 runoff probst and tardy 1989 labat et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 etc human activities especially intensive irrigation reservoir regulation and groundwater withdrawal also alter the regional hydrological cycle by increasing soil moisture and evaporation reducing runoff and lowering groundwater levels jehanzaib et al 2020 the spatiotemporal evolutions of drought are likely to change as a consequence of the accelerated hydrological cycle however the different drought assessment approaches which concentrated on the different parts of the hydrological cycle process complicate drought studies and lead to different conclusions sheffield et al 2012 wada et al 2013 trenberth et al 2014 wanders and wada 2015 cook et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 a drought index that can comprehensively reflect changes in all of the available water helps to better understand the effects of climate change and human impacts on drought evolution since 2002 the successful application of the data from the twin gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites tapley et al 2004 has provided an alternative approach to capturing drought features from an integrated perspective across regions and periods liu et al 2020b pokhrel et al 2021 grace offers an accurate representation of surface subsurface water storage which is terrestrial water storage tws across the entire globe felfelani et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b scanlon et al 2018 large scale severe droughts are proven to be a direct cause of the substantial depletion in tws chen et al 2009 long et al 2013 tapley et al 2019 various studies have also developed drought indices using grace derived tws data yirdaw et al 2008 derived a total storage deficit index tsdi cao et al 2015 found that the grace tsdi can better monitor a large scale intergraded drought than another meteorological drought index the standardized precipitation index in the arid land of northwestern china thomas et al 2014 described an approach that combines water storage deficits with event durations to determine drought severity sinha et al 2017 developed the water storage deficit index wsdi which improved on the former approach by standardizing the calculations zhao et al 2017a also developed a drought severity index dsi which was defined as the monthly standardized anomalies of grace derived tws data generally grace based indices can capture drought features across regions and periods reflect both anthropogenic and subsurface water storage changes that are difficult to simulate and are free from the uncertainties associated with water balance based models and meteorological forcing data sinha et al 2017 zhao et al 2017b china has long suffered from drought risks according to the china statistical yearbook the average annual area of crops affected by drought in china was approximately 1 5 105 km2 during 2002 2018 the extreme drought in southwest china in 2010 alone caused at least 8 1 million people to be threatened by water security in this region qiu 2010 numerous studies revealed that the tws across china significantly changed zhao et al 2015a mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a and that the duration and severity of the associated droughts also changed qiu 2010 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 liu et al 2020b however the underlying impact factors of drought evolution have not yet been fully explored this study tried to explore and distinguish the climatic and anthropogenic effects on time varying drought across the entire country based on the integrated drought index wsdi using the latest grace derived tws data distinct from previous studies this study addressed a comprehensive analysis in a longer study period 2002 2020 that combined grace and its follow on satellite grace fo data the results of this study which provide new insight into scientifically coping with increasingly severe drought challenges under climate and human impacts will be important for preventing agricultural and socioeconomic damage 2 data and methods 2 1 data this study employed grace derived tws anomaly data provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa era5 land reanalysis datasets from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and relevant china water resource data from the china statistical yearbook grace derived tws anomaly data were used to assess tws trends tws deficits and droughts the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area index data from era5 land were used to analyze the impacts of climate change and ecological changes on tws changes the relevant chinese water resource data from the china statistical yearbook were used to assess the drought induced crop damages and the impact of human water uses on tws changes all data in this study except for the documented china water resource data were interpolated to a spatial solution of 1 1 degrees 111 km 111 km and a temporal resolution of 1 month given the limited spatial resolution only the mainland part and two largest islands i e hainan and taiwan islands of china are discussed in this study the study period spanned from april 2002 to march 2020 2 1 1 grace the grace grace fo satellites which are designed to monitor the time varying gravity field are capable of resolving spatiotemporal variability in tws there are currently two different types of solutions for grace grace fo data including mass concentration block mascon and standard spherical harmonic approaches three main grace data processing centers namely the center for space research csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the german research center for geoscience all provide grace grace fo derived tws anomalies using the standard spherical harmonic approach which is based on a spherical harmonic coefficient solution and includes the correction of atmospheric and oceanic contributions the extracted invalid signals e g n s strips are removed by postprocessing swenson and wahr 2006 including a destriping filter a 300 km wide gaussian filter a 60 degree filter etc those filters remove part of the effective signal while correcting errors landerer and swenson 2012 thus further introduced a land grid scaling approach to restoring the signals this approach includes a set of scaling coefficients which is computed by applying the same filters to a numerical land hydrology model to minimize the differences between the original and filtered signals mascon solutions are types of gravity field basis functions this approach can more easily implement geophysical constraints and apply noise removal more accurately and effectively and thus requires no additional land grid scaling mascon derived tws anomalies are characterized by 1 lower uncertainty 2 higher correlation with field observations and 3 decreased leakage from land to ocean relative to standard spherical harmonic results watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 there are three popular mascon products csr jpl and goddard space flight center gsfc since the csr and jpl mascons are available for longer periods this study employed the gridded monthly global water height anomalies relative to the average value of the period between january 2004 and december 2009 which are derived from grace and grace fo using the mascon approach from both csr and jpl the latest versions of the csr and jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions csr rl06v02 m and jpl rl06v02 m are available on their websites http www2 csr utexas edu grace and https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons respectively for csr rl06v02m all of the appropriate corrections replacement of c20 degree 2 order 0 coefficients replacement of c30 degree 3 order 0 coefficients degree 1 coefficient geocenter correction and glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction were applied to obtain tws changes in the ocean ice and hydrology csr rl06v02m does not apply any spatial smoothing and the spatial resolution was 0 25 0 25 degrees given its band limited nature grace grace fo is best applied to basins larger than approximately 200 000 km2 for jpl rl06v02m even though the spatial resolution of the provided jpl rl06v02 m was 0 5 0 5 degrees it solves monthly gravity fields with a spatial resolution of 3 3 degrees in addition a gia correction a coastal resolution improvement cri filter a land grid scaling and a land mask were applied in these data processing procedures no additional empirical destriping filters and accompanying true signal restoration measures are required thus the s n ratios are superior to those derived from conventional spherical harmonic solutions more details relating to csr and jpl mascons data are described in save et al 2016 and watkins et al 2015 respectively here two datasets are first interpolated to a smaller spatial solution of 1 1 degrees which is realized by averaging the data in each given grid then referring to the study of deng et al 2020 gaps in each dataset were filled using the lagrange interpolation method as shown in text s1 the grace derived tws anomalies are finally presented as a simple average of two processed datasets relative to the baseline average from april 2002 to march 2020 2 1 2 era5 land reanalysis data optimally combine observations and models and provide continuous atmospheric variable estimates at a global scale that strive to follow water and energy balances hersbach et al 2020 reanalysis datasets are now widely used in climate monitoring applications and services for the wmo statement on the status of the global climate and ipcc reports era5 land is the newest climate reanalysis dataset provided by ecmwf at the https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp home website the precipitation potential evapotranspiration leaf area index of high vegetation and low vegetation data from era5 land were used in this study 2 1 3 documented china water resources data the china statistical yearbook which is provided by the national bureau of statistics of china at http www stats gov cn english website is published once a year and contains statistics on the economy and society of the entire country provinces autonomous regions and municipalities of the previous year this study employed the 2002 2018 yearly data on drought affected crop areas drought induced crop failure areas the total amount of water resources including surface and groundwater water supply including surface and groundwater and water use in agriculture industry and consumption the variables of the drought affected crop areas and the drought induced crop failure areas refer to drought affected areas where crops have been reduced by more than 10 and 80 respectively the total amount of water resources refers to the total volume of natural surface runoff and groundwater supplied by rainfall in a certain year and represents the total amount of renewable water resources available in a certain year water supply represents the gross water consumption including distribution induced losses allocated to various users groundwater supply refers to the withdrawals from the supplying wells water use in agriculture industry and consumption refers to gross amounts water used for agriculture i e irrigation replenishment of fishing farms and the water used by animal husbandry industry and consumption including losses during distribution 2 1 4 agricultural regionalization to further study regional tws deficits and drought the study area was also divided into 9 subregions based on china s agricultural regionalization from peking university downloaded from http geodata pku edu cn they are the northeast china plain necp the northern arid and semiarid region nasr the huang huai hai plain hhhp the loess plateau lp and the qinghai tibet plateau qtp the middle lower yangtze plain mlyp the sichuan basin and surrounding regions sbsr the yunnan guizhou plateau ygp and southern china sc this agricultural regionalization is based on the agricultural production conditions characteristics developments major problems key measures administrative units etc since the agricultural regionalization used in this study is divided by provinces autonomous regions and municipalities subregional data were obtained by summing the values of all provinces in each subregion 2 2 methods the pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the linear correlation between two random variables the wsdi was used to study tws deficits and drought events the stepwise regression method was used in the attribution analysis 2 2 1 pearson correlation coefficient for two variables x and y with the same sample size of n their correlation coefficient r is calculated based on eq 1 and the statistical significance level of their correlation is tested based on eq 2 e g liu et al 2009 1 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 1 ϑ n 2 n 1 r 1 ϑ n 2 n 1 the bar in eq 1 represents the mean if r is outside of the interval of eq 2 the correlation is statistically significant if ϑ is 1 96 the corresponding significance level is 0 05 p 0 05 the significance of the trends is judged by calculating the deterministic coefficient r 2 i e the square of r between the variable and the time based on eqs 1 and 2 2 2 2 drought characterization analysis a drought index the wsdi sinha et al 2017 sun et al 2018 was used to quantify drought intensity and severity for each region the wsdi was computed as follows 3 twsa i res twsa i twsa j clim i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 12 4 wsdi i twsa i res twsa res σ twsa res i 1 2 3 m where twsa represents the spatially averaged monthly tws anomaly twsa clim stands for the mean monthly climatology of the tws anomaly which is calculated by averaging twsa for each calendar month over the study period from april 2002 to march 2020 and twsa res is the residual obtained by subtracting twsa clim from twsa i e deviations from the multiyear averaged annual cycle m corresponds to the size of twsa i e 216 ordinal i ranges from 1 to m and the corresponding calendar month j ranges from 1 to 12 the overline represents the mean and σ represents the standard deviation the wsdi indicates the drought conditions and intensity by its sign and magnitude as shown in table 1 sinha et al 2017 drought is inferred when the wsdi is negative and more negative wsdi values correspond to greater drought intensity a drought event is defined by sinha et al 2017 as the period over which a negative wsdi persists over three or more consecutive months although droughts with higher intensity should lead to greater damage lower intensity droughts that are longer in duration may result in similar or even greater losses the severity of a drought is therefore determined as the product of the average intensity and the number of months of its duration except for the last month keyantash and dracup 2004 2 2 3 accumulated water supply deficits this study defines the water supply minus the total amount of water resources as the water supply deficit their cumulative curves indicate to some extent the sustainability of water use 2 2 4 attribution analysis a stepwise regression method was used for the attribution analysis the explained variable was wsdi and the explanatory variables were precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the leaf area index which represented changes in both climate and ecology the explanatory variable with the largest variance contribution was considered the most important impact factor multiple linear regression can determine the linear relationships between multiple variables stepwise regression is an improvement of multiple linear regression draper and smith 1998 because it can eliminate multicollinearity and be used to select an optimal regression equation the basic steps of stepwise regression are as follows first the contributions of all explanatory variables are ranked by simple regressions of the explained variable and each explanatory variable second the other explanatory variables are introduced one by one based on the regression equation corresponding to the explanatory variable that contributes the most to the explained variable only the explanatory variables that have a significant contribution to the explained variable are selected meanwhile the old selected explanatory variable is deleted when its contribution is no longer significant due to the introduction of a new explained variable these repeated testing steps ensure that all explanatory variables in the regression model are significant to the explained variable the specific steps were conducted by the function stepwise in matlab 3 results 3 1 tws trends across china from april 2002 to march 2020 the tws spatial distribution trends in china were uneven 58 of the regions experienced losses in tws whereas the other 42 of regions experienced gains in tws fig 1 there are no significant trends in the necp 0 52 0 74 mm yr or the mlyp 1 16 1 36 mm yr the nasr 2 40 0 25 mm yr the hhhp 12 88 1 08 mm yr the lp 9 75 1 15 mm yr and the qtp 1 38 0 74 mm yr showed significantly decreasing tws trends p 0 05 the sbsr 4 21 0 90 mm yr the ygp 4 09 1 80 mm yr and the sc 2 09 1 21 mm yr showed significantly increasing tws trends p 0 05 china s total tws was decreasing the spatial pattern is similar to the findings of previous studies conducted over similar timeframes for example xu et al 2019 from 2003 to 2016 and zhao et al 2015a and mo et al 2016 from 2003 to 2013 however the decreasing tws trend of all of china 1 79 0 43 mm yr p 0 05 is accelerated when compared with that reported by xu et al 2019 approximately 0 92 mm yr the difference in magnitude is partly attributed to the recent accelerated tws decline 7 12 10 12 mm yr for april 2018 to march 2020 during the grace fo era p 0 05 and it is also related to different solutions of the grace data this study employed the grace derived tws based on rl06 solutions which according to göttl et al 2018 have been shown to be improved by 2 15 for accuracy when compared to the rl05 solutions used in previous studies the higher rate of tws decline highlights china s growing water shortage and the possible threats of intensified drought at regional and national scales 3 2 wsdi detected droughts across china fig 2 shows how the wsdi of china and its subregions have changed over time periods in which the tws deficit was three months or more are regarded as drought events overall there were a total of 8 countrywide drought events detected by the wsdi including 1 the drought of october 2007 march 2008 that occurred in the necp mlyp sbsr and sc 2 the drought of january 2009 july 2009 which mainly occurred in the necp sbsr and sc 3 the drought of september 2009 march 2010 which mainly occurred in the sbsr ygp and sc 4 the drought of april 2011 june 2012 which mainly affected the necp nasr hhhp mlyp sbsr ygp and sc 5 the drought of june 2014 september 2014 which mainly affected the nasr and hhhp 6 the drought of november 2014 october 2016 which mainly occurred in the necp nasr hhhp lp qtp and sc as well as 7 the droughts of december 2016 october 2018 and 8 april 2019 march 2020 both of which mainly affected the necp nasr hhhp lp qtp mlyp and sc the two most severe droughts the drought of november 2014 october 2016 and the drought of december 2016 october 2018 also had the longest deficit periods 24 and 23 months respectively while the most intense drought occurred from april 2019 to march 2020 according to fig 2 the wsdi detected drought events of china from the drought of 2007 2008 to the drought of 2019 2020 tended to be more frequent more intense and more severe nearly all of the tws deficits appeared in a single decade the severity increased from 2 97 to 27 27 and the intensity increased from 1 00 to 2 04 at the subregional scale detected severe drought events mostly occurred in northern china and in recent years even though most of the subregions in southern china have increasing tws trends they have also recently experienced drought events e g the qtp the mlyp and the sc thus in addition to the subregions in the north where drought events often occur drought events in other subregions are also worthy of additional study fig 2 also shows the relationship between the wsdi and crop production across china the yearly wsdi was significantly correlated with drought affected crop areas in some subregions in the south including the sbsr r 0 63 p 0 05 and ygp r 0 75 p 0 05 in the north the wsdi may be associated with drought induced crop failure areas for example there was a high correlation between the wsdi and drought induced crop failure areas in the nasr r 0 69 p 0 05 no significant correlation was found between the wsdi and drought affected crop areas in hhhp and lp which may be due to the south to north water diversion project of china 3 3 impact of climate change and human activities on wsdi attribution studies are a key step for developing scientifically based solutions for increasing drought threatens fig 3 illustrates the effects of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf areas of high and low vegetation on yearly wsdi across china along with fig 1 fig 3 shows that wetter conditions for a large proportion of regions have been driven by increasing precipitation and decreasing potential evapotranspiration for example the main impact factor affecting increased wsdi in the necp nasr and qtp is potential evapotranspiration whereas the factor affecting wsdi in the ygp mlyp and sc is mainly precipitation in contrast the drier conditions across china are mainly attributed to decreases in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area fig s1 summarizes the proportion of areas affected by each factor in each of the subregions of china areas with the most severe drought risks the hhhp and lp were the most widely affected by multiple unfavorable factors including the deterioration of the ecological environment and decreases in precipitation meanwhile subregions showing positive wsdi trends such as the mlyp ygp and sc experienced increases in precipitation significant wsdi changes were found to be closely associated with climate change however fig 4 further shows that areas primarily affected by precipitation can explain 20 to nearly 100 of wsdi changes especially in the mlyp hhhp and sc in contrast other factors cannot even explain 10 of wsdi changes since the precipitation the potential evapotranspiration and the leaf area index are more related to climate change other unexplained wsdi changes are likely to be related to human activities previous studies claimed that human activities may have changed the response of the tws to the climate in the north zhao et al 2015a xu et al 2019 to further confirm the direct impacts of human activities on droughts this study investigated the correlations between the wsdi and the relevant documented water resource data e g the total amount of water resources the amount of water supply and the accumulated water supply deficits for china and its subregions from 2002 to 2018 as shown in table 2 the yearly wsdi is significantly correlated with the yearly renewable water resources in most of the subregions except for the nasr the lp and the qtp the yearly wsdi of the nasr the lp and the qtp have more close relationship with human water uses including the groundwater supply the surface water supply and the sustainability of human water use i e the accumulated water supply deficits therefore human activities might have intensified china s droughts and exacerbated water shortages especially in the water scarce northern regions of china in addition agricultural irrigation was found to be the main use of water resources especially in northern china table s1 these subregions might be suggested to rationalize the control of agricultural water use 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons between wsdi detected droughts and other droughts as shown in table s2 the wsdi results are roughly consistent with those of other reported droughts including meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts however the wsdi detected droughts differ slightly from the others in duration and intensity for example the meteorological drought of 2009 2010 in the ygp saw its worst conditions for decades from september 2009 to march 2010 qiu 2010 lu et al 2011 barriopedro et al 2012 yang et al 2012 zhang and yamaguchi 2014 while the agricultural drought that occurred from november 2009 and september 2010 hit its most intense point in march 2010 but with a smaller magnitude zhang and yamaguchi 2014 zhao et al 2015b the differences between meteorological and agricultural droughts are reasonable on the ygp the response of the hydrological system to precipitation is a complex process with a delayed effect and a propagation threshold which mainly depends on the meteorological and underlying surface conditions guo et al 2020 perennially abundant water resources allow this region to be able to withstand deficiencies in seasonal precipitation in addition forest and shrub dominated land cover types increase resistance to water shortages nevertheless the wsdi which detected that the ygp experienced a moderate drought between august 2009 and september 2010 and hit its most intense point in march 2010 combined the results based on meteorological and agricultural drought indices moreover the wsdi is also applicable to socioeconomic management barriopedro et al 2012 found that the electricity output of china experienced a power reduction of 20 from october 2009 to april 2010 which was roughly consistent with the period of a wsdi detected drought in china september 2009 march 2010 the main advantage of the wsdi is that it captures the net change in all forms of water on the land surface or subsurface e g snow ice groundwater soil moisture and surface water hirschi et al 2007 kumar et al 2016 long et al 2017 therefore the wsdi represents an integrated drought index of the entire hydrological system including anthropogenic and underground changes and it is free of the numerous uncertainties associated with meteorological and hydrological data compared with meteorological drought indices the wsdi is more closely associated with agricultural and socioeconomic droughts in both duration and severity given that the propagation of drought is aggregated attenuated lagged and prolonged van loon et al 2012 yang et al 2017 ma et al 2019 guo et al 2020 compared with traditional hydrological drought indices that are based on streamflow the wsdi can better help the agricultural management of nonirrigated areas compared with traditional drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index standardized precipitation index and standardized runoff index the wsdi could reflect secular climate change and human impact liu et al 2020a in these cases the wsdi could be an effective index for improving large scale water management for both agriculture and the socioeconomy under the background of climate change and human activities 4 2 trends in the wsdi climate change can affect the wsdi e g el niño southern oscillation mainly affects changes in the wsdi of the sc including its trends huang et al 2021 unsustainable human water use can also lead to a form of perpetual and accelerated anthropogenic drought aghakouchak et al 2021 rateb et al 2021 therefore trends in the wsdi which include information from climate change and human activities could better help the assessment of long term droughts according to satish kumar et al 2021 only the wsdi could determine the long lasting drought event in the krishna basin which lasted 29 months when compared with other indices based on meteorological data however there is a suggestion that the wsdi trends could bias the assessment of short term droughts that are associated with meteorological conditions according to liu et al 2020a the wsdi detected a drought event in northwest india from 2002 to 2015 due to groundwater withdrawals used in irrigation but at the same time increased precipitation maintained the soil moisture liu et al 2020a suggested that the detrended wsdi could better determine drought events in china as the detrended wsdi is more consistent with precipitation or soil moisture the results presented in table 2 show that there are multiple causes that are responsible for the yearly changes in the wsdi including trends and cautious should still be exercised when removing the wsdi trends for example even though previous studies sun et al 2018 huang et al 2021 showed that human activities including dams could lead to an underestimation of the drought conditions of the mlyp and the sc a simple trend removal will also remove associated changes in meteorological conditions since their wsdi is highly correlated to yearly renewable water resources from precipitation table 2 moreover although liu et al 2020a found that the wsdi misestimated the meteorological drought event on the ygp from september 2009 to march 2010 this study further found that the wsdi combined the results of meteorological and agricultural indices during that drought singh et al 2021 also claimed that drought in regions with strong seasonal changes could last a long time even when precipitation is already above average the subregions e g nasr and lp that suffered from significant impacts from human water use might be more suitable for studying droughts that are free from direct human impacts using the trend removing approaches separating different storage components in the wsdi will further help identify different drought events under different driving factors 4 3 drought events during grace fo ran et al 2020 tried to detect drought events in the yangtze river basin based on grace fo data and suggested that grace fo data are as effective as grace data in detecting drought events across the yangtze river basin based on grace fo data this study found two countrywide drought events the droughts of december 2016 october 2018 and april 2019 march 2020 both of which mainly affected the necp nasr hhhp lp qtp mlyp and sc according to the office of state flood control and drought relief headquarters of china the drought of 2019 affected most regions due to low precipitation amounts and high temperatures especially in south china i e the mlyp hit its most severe autumn drought since 1961 this study also found that the wsdi of the mlyp also saw the lowest point at 2 20 in september 2019 during the entire study period under the impacts of climate change and human activities china s droughts seem to be more widespread intense and severe 4 4 uncertainties of the attribution analysis this study analyzes the effects of climate change and human activities on tws changes and accompanying droughts the separate attribution of natural changes or anthropogenic changes improves our understanding of the extent to which water scarcity can be alleviated however the tws change in some regions could not be explained by some of the studied factors such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area especially in some parts of the sbsr the nasr and the qtp the tws changes in these subregions also cannot be reasonably explained in the study of xu et al 2019 along with ice elevation change a possible explanation is that it is related to human activities or there might be two impact factors that separately drive different changes in different periods within this study period consequently none of them significantly contributed to tws changes individually moreover the uncertainty in the attribution analysis also stems from the variables that were studied even though the era5 land merges a large number of observations the complex terrain brings the challenge to the observation of these two subregions which increases the uncertainty the determination of the main impact factors driving the observed patterns in these two subregions thus requires further study 5 conclusions in this study the impact factors driving drought evolution across china from april 2002 to march 2020 were examined to better understand regional changes china was divided into nine subregions based on agricultural regionalization this study first analyzed the tws trends of china and its nine subregions during the study period china s overall tws decreased and the changes were unevenly distributed compared to previous studies based on other grace solutions this study found that china s tws declined at a higher rate 1 79 0 43 mm yr p 0 05 based on the latest version mascon rl06 the droughts associated with accelerated tws depletion were detected with a grace derived drought index the wsdi compared with other traditional drought indices the wsdi stands out as an integrated representation of the entire hydrological system the results based on the wsdi are roughly consistent with those based on other drought indices but the wsdi can capture the duration and intensity that combine the results of meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts for example the wsdi detected drought combines the durations of a meteorological drought september 2009 to march 2010 and an agricultural drought november 2009 and september 2010 when it shows the same lowest point as the agricultural drought march 2010 the wsdi detected countrywide drought between september 2009 and march 2010 causes a power reduction of 20 for the electricity output of china from october 2009 to april 2010 according to the wsdi the severity of the countrywide droughts from 2002 to 2020 increased from 2 97 to 27 27 and their intensities increased from 1 00 to 2 04 the droughts of the nasr the hhhp and the lp also tended to be not only more intense and more severe but also more frequent in addition to the subregions in the north where drought events often occur recent drought events in the other subregions i e the mlyp and the sc around 2019 are also worthy of additional study finally the responses of the wsdi to climate change ecological changes and human impacts namely precipitation potential evapotranspiration leaf area and human water use were assessed to provide insight into how water management could be improved the wetter conditions were primarily attributed to increasing precipitation whereas more intense droughts were mostly affected by multiple impact factors relating to decreased precipitation and human activities precipitation can explain 20 to nearly 100 of the wsdi changes in most regions of the mlyp hhhp and sc other factors cannot even explain more than 20 of the changes in most areas unexplained wsdi changes are likely related to human activities the wsdi is highly correlated with the water supply in china especially in the nasr and the lp which implies that these areas are facing direct threats from human caused water shortages this study offers key information on china s future water management the more frequent and severe drought events that are expected also threaten china s economic and social development this study shows that the decline in precipitation and the rise in human water use for agriculture might be the main factors since decreases in precipitation are uncontrollable the key strategy of water supply for local governments to ensure sustainable development must be based on the available

3884,different definitions of drought from multiple perspectives complicate drought studies studying droughts from an integrated perspective helps to better understand their evolutions and driving factors but few studies have taken such a comprehensive approach in china this study conducted an assessment and attribution analysis of droughts across china from 2002 to 2020 based on an integrated drought index derived from observed terrestrial water storage tws data first the latest solution of satellite gravimetry data was employed to analyze spatiotemporal changes in tws deficits second droughts associated with tws deficits were detected using the water storage deficit index wsdi third an attribution analysis was conducted using the stepwise regression method to determine the driving factors of droughts the results show that china s tws decreases at a significant rate 1 79 0 43 mm yr p 0 05 from 2002 to 2020 the droughts detected by wsdi can generally combine the durations and intensities of the meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought indices which provides a comprehensive perspective the severity and intensity of countrywide drought have been at least doubled especially in the northern regions including the northern arid and semiarid region the huang huai hai plain and the loess plateau the attribution analysis revealed that both climate change and anthropogenic impacts played a dominant role in driving intensified droughts decreasing precipitation explains 20 to nearly 100 of tws deficits across the huang huai hai plain human water use especially for agriculture has also exacerbated droughts in the water scarce northern regions of china the wsdi was highly correlated with the water supply for human activities in the northern arid and semiarid region and the loess plateau this study shows the need to adopt measures to limit human water use beyond the regional capacity keywords terrestrial water storage drought china human impact climate change 1 introduction drought is a slowly developing but widespread recurring and costly natural disaster shukla and wood 2008 nasrollahi et al 2015 herrera et al 2018 when the supply of moisture fails to meet its demand drought occurs redmond 2002 ault 2020 the specific definition of drought however varies depending on the source of demands e g atmosphere hydrology plants and human activities wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 ault 2020 generally a meteorological drought occurs when below average rainfall continues for several weeks a hydrological drought refers to a clear water shortage in the hydrological system on inner to interannual time scales an agricultural drought leads to crop failure for months and a socioeconomic drought arises when socioeconomic water demand e g municipal water supply and hydroelectric power generation exceeds the natural water supply mishra and singh 2010 ault 2020 many different approaches have been developed to determine the occurrence of drought events meteorological droughts are commonly observed with precipitation patel et al 2007 quiring 2009 hydrological droughts given limited data sources are traditionally analyzed by model simulations and field observations of surface water level streamflow and soil moisture keyantash and dracup 2002 nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 mishra and singh 2010 wanders and wada 2015 zhang et al 2016 the assessment of agricultural droughts is usually based on a combination of meteorological and hydrological factors affecting plants such as precipitation temperature soil moisture and agricultural data keyantash and dracup 2002 mishra and singh 2010 zhao et al 2015b liu et al 2020b and socioeconomic droughts are widely related to water management data guo et al 2019 although the drought events determined by the above approaches are related to each other wisser et al 2010 wada et al 2013 guo et al 2020 they solely focus on parts of the hydrologic cycle zhao et al 2017b under climate change and human impact the changes in the hydrological cycle and accompanying drought evolution are multifaceted global warming intensified the global hydrological cycle in the form of producing more precipitation dore 2005 evaporation brutsaert 2017 runoff probst and tardy 1989 labat et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 etc human activities especially intensive irrigation reservoir regulation and groundwater withdrawal also alter the regional hydrological cycle by increasing soil moisture and evaporation reducing runoff and lowering groundwater levels jehanzaib et al 2020 the spatiotemporal evolutions of drought are likely to change as a consequence of the accelerated hydrological cycle however the different drought assessment approaches which concentrated on the different parts of the hydrological cycle process complicate drought studies and lead to different conclusions sheffield et al 2012 wada et al 2013 trenberth et al 2014 wanders and wada 2015 cook et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 a drought index that can comprehensively reflect changes in all of the available water helps to better understand the effects of climate change and human impacts on drought evolution since 2002 the successful application of the data from the twin gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites tapley et al 2004 has provided an alternative approach to capturing drought features from an integrated perspective across regions and periods liu et al 2020b pokhrel et al 2021 grace offers an accurate representation of surface subsurface water storage which is terrestrial water storage tws across the entire globe felfelani et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b scanlon et al 2018 large scale severe droughts are proven to be a direct cause of the substantial depletion in tws chen et al 2009 long et al 2013 tapley et al 2019 various studies have also developed drought indices using grace derived tws data yirdaw et al 2008 derived a total storage deficit index tsdi cao et al 2015 found that the grace tsdi can better monitor a large scale intergraded drought than another meteorological drought index the standardized precipitation index in the arid land of northwestern china thomas et al 2014 described an approach that combines water storage deficits with event durations to determine drought severity sinha et al 2017 developed the water storage deficit index wsdi which improved on the former approach by standardizing the calculations zhao et al 2017a also developed a drought severity index dsi which was defined as the monthly standardized anomalies of grace derived tws data generally grace based indices can capture drought features across regions and periods reflect both anthropogenic and subsurface water storage changes that are difficult to simulate and are free from the uncertainties associated with water balance based models and meteorological forcing data sinha et al 2017 zhao et al 2017b china has long suffered from drought risks according to the china statistical yearbook the average annual area of crops affected by drought in china was approximately 1 5 105 km2 during 2002 2018 the extreme drought in southwest china in 2010 alone caused at least 8 1 million people to be threatened by water security in this region qiu 2010 numerous studies revealed that the tws across china significantly changed zhao et al 2015a mo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a and that the duration and severity of the associated droughts also changed qiu 2010 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 liu et al 2020b however the underlying impact factors of drought evolution have not yet been fully explored this study tried to explore and distinguish the climatic and anthropogenic effects on time varying drought across the entire country based on the integrated drought index wsdi using the latest grace derived tws data distinct from previous studies this study addressed a comprehensive analysis in a longer study period 2002 2020 that combined grace and its follow on satellite grace fo data the results of this study which provide new insight into scientifically coping with increasingly severe drought challenges under climate and human impacts will be important for preventing agricultural and socioeconomic damage 2 data and methods 2 1 data this study employed grace derived tws anomaly data provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa era5 land reanalysis datasets from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and relevant china water resource data from the china statistical yearbook grace derived tws anomaly data were used to assess tws trends tws deficits and droughts the precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area index data from era5 land were used to analyze the impacts of climate change and ecological changes on tws changes the relevant chinese water resource data from the china statistical yearbook were used to assess the drought induced crop damages and the impact of human water uses on tws changes all data in this study except for the documented china water resource data were interpolated to a spatial solution of 1 1 degrees 111 km 111 km and a temporal resolution of 1 month given the limited spatial resolution only the mainland part and two largest islands i e hainan and taiwan islands of china are discussed in this study the study period spanned from april 2002 to march 2020 2 1 1 grace the grace grace fo satellites which are designed to monitor the time varying gravity field are capable of resolving spatiotemporal variability in tws there are currently two different types of solutions for grace grace fo data including mass concentration block mascon and standard spherical harmonic approaches three main grace data processing centers namely the center for space research csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the german research center for geoscience all provide grace grace fo derived tws anomalies using the standard spherical harmonic approach which is based on a spherical harmonic coefficient solution and includes the correction of atmospheric and oceanic contributions the extracted invalid signals e g n s strips are removed by postprocessing swenson and wahr 2006 including a destriping filter a 300 km wide gaussian filter a 60 degree filter etc those filters remove part of the effective signal while correcting errors landerer and swenson 2012 thus further introduced a land grid scaling approach to restoring the signals this approach includes a set of scaling coefficients which is computed by applying the same filters to a numerical land hydrology model to minimize the differences between the original and filtered signals mascon solutions are types of gravity field basis functions this approach can more easily implement geophysical constraints and apply noise removal more accurately and effectively and thus requires no additional land grid scaling mascon derived tws anomalies are characterized by 1 lower uncertainty 2 higher correlation with field observations and 3 decreased leakage from land to ocean relative to standard spherical harmonic results watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 there are three popular mascon products csr jpl and goddard space flight center gsfc since the csr and jpl mascons are available for longer periods this study employed the gridded monthly global water height anomalies relative to the average value of the period between january 2004 and december 2009 which are derived from grace and grace fo using the mascon approach from both csr and jpl the latest versions of the csr and jpl grace grace fo mascon solutions csr rl06v02 m and jpl rl06v02 m are available on their websites http www2 csr utexas edu grace and https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons respectively for csr rl06v02m all of the appropriate corrections replacement of c20 degree 2 order 0 coefficients replacement of c30 degree 3 order 0 coefficients degree 1 coefficient geocenter correction and glacial isostatic adjustment gia correction were applied to obtain tws changes in the ocean ice and hydrology csr rl06v02m does not apply any spatial smoothing and the spatial resolution was 0 25 0 25 degrees given its band limited nature grace grace fo is best applied to basins larger than approximately 200 000 km2 for jpl rl06v02m even though the spatial resolution of the provided jpl rl06v02 m was 0 5 0 5 degrees it solves monthly gravity fields with a spatial resolution of 3 3 degrees in addition a gia correction a coastal resolution improvement cri filter a land grid scaling and a land mask were applied in these data processing procedures no additional empirical destriping filters and accompanying true signal restoration measures are required thus the s n ratios are superior to those derived from conventional spherical harmonic solutions more details relating to csr and jpl mascons data are described in save et al 2016 and watkins et al 2015 respectively here two datasets are first interpolated to a smaller spatial solution of 1 1 degrees which is realized by averaging the data in each given grid then referring to the study of deng et al 2020 gaps in each dataset were filled using the lagrange interpolation method as shown in text s1 the grace derived tws anomalies are finally presented as a simple average of two processed datasets relative to the baseline average from april 2002 to march 2020 2 1 2 era5 land reanalysis data optimally combine observations and models and provide continuous atmospheric variable estimates at a global scale that strive to follow water and energy balances hersbach et al 2020 reanalysis datasets are now widely used in climate monitoring applications and services for the wmo statement on the status of the global climate and ipcc reports era5 land is the newest climate reanalysis dataset provided by ecmwf at the https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp home website the precipitation potential evapotranspiration leaf area index of high vegetation and low vegetation data from era5 land were used in this study 2 1 3 documented china water resources data the china statistical yearbook which is provided by the national bureau of statistics of china at http www stats gov cn english website is published once a year and contains statistics on the economy and society of the entire country provinces autonomous regions and municipalities of the previous year this study employed the 2002 2018 yearly data on drought affected crop areas drought induced crop failure areas the total amount of water resources including surface and groundwater water supply including surface and groundwater and water use in agriculture industry and consumption the variables of the drought affected crop areas and the drought induced crop failure areas refer to drought affected areas where crops have been reduced by more than 10 and 80 respectively the total amount of water resources refers to the total volume of natural surface runoff and groundwater supplied by rainfall in a certain year and represents the total amount of renewable water resources available in a certain year water supply represents the gross water consumption including distribution induced losses allocated to various users groundwater supply refers to the withdrawals from the supplying wells water use in agriculture industry and consumption refers to gross amounts water used for agriculture i e irrigation replenishment of fishing farms and the water used by animal husbandry industry and consumption including losses during distribution 2 1 4 agricultural regionalization to further study regional tws deficits and drought the study area was also divided into 9 subregions based on china s agricultural regionalization from peking university downloaded from http geodata pku edu cn they are the northeast china plain necp the northern arid and semiarid region nasr the huang huai hai plain hhhp the loess plateau lp and the qinghai tibet plateau qtp the middle lower yangtze plain mlyp the sichuan basin and surrounding regions sbsr the yunnan guizhou plateau ygp and southern china sc this agricultural regionalization is based on the agricultural production conditions characteristics developments major problems key measures administrative units etc since the agricultural regionalization used in this study is divided by provinces autonomous regions and municipalities subregional data were obtained by summing the values of all provinces in each subregion 2 2 methods the pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the linear correlation between two random variables the wsdi was used to study tws deficits and drought events the stepwise regression method was used in the attribution analysis 2 2 1 pearson correlation coefficient for two variables x and y with the same sample size of n their correlation coefficient r is calculated based on eq 1 and the statistical significance level of their correlation is tested based on eq 2 e g liu et al 2009 1 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 1 ϑ n 2 n 1 r 1 ϑ n 2 n 1 the bar in eq 1 represents the mean if r is outside of the interval of eq 2 the correlation is statistically significant if ϑ is 1 96 the corresponding significance level is 0 05 p 0 05 the significance of the trends is judged by calculating the deterministic coefficient r 2 i e the square of r between the variable and the time based on eqs 1 and 2 2 2 2 drought characterization analysis a drought index the wsdi sinha et al 2017 sun et al 2018 was used to quantify drought intensity and severity for each region the wsdi was computed as follows 3 twsa i res twsa i twsa j clim i 1 2 3 m j 1 2 3 12 4 wsdi i twsa i res twsa res σ twsa res i 1 2 3 m where twsa represents the spatially averaged monthly tws anomaly twsa clim stands for the mean monthly climatology of the tws anomaly which is calculated by averaging twsa for each calendar month over the study period from april 2002 to march 2020 and twsa res is the residual obtained by subtracting twsa clim from twsa i e deviations from the multiyear averaged annual cycle m corresponds to the size of twsa i e 216 ordinal i ranges from 1 to m and the corresponding calendar month j ranges from 1 to 12 the overline represents the mean and σ represents the standard deviation the wsdi indicates the drought conditions and intensity by its sign and magnitude as shown in table 1 sinha et al 2017 drought is inferred when the wsdi is negative and more negative wsdi values correspond to greater drought intensity a drought event is defined by sinha et al 2017 as the period over which a negative wsdi persists over three or more consecutive months although droughts with higher intensity should lead to greater damage lower intensity droughts that are longer in duration may result in similar or even greater losses the severity of a drought is therefore determined as the product of the average intensity and the number of months of its duration except for the last month keyantash and dracup 2004 2 2 3 accumulated water supply deficits this study defines the water supply minus the total amount of water resources as the water supply deficit their cumulative curves indicate to some extent the sustainability of water use 2 2 4 attribution analysis a stepwise regression method was used for the attribution analysis the explained variable was wsdi and the explanatory variables were precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the leaf area index which represented changes in both climate and ecology the explanatory variable with the largest variance contribution was considered the most important impact factor multiple linear regression can determine the linear relationships between multiple variables stepwise regression is an improvement of multiple linear regression draper and smith 1998 because it can eliminate multicollinearity and be used to select an optimal regression equation the basic steps of stepwise regression are as follows first the contributions of all explanatory variables are ranked by simple regressions of the explained variable and each explanatory variable second the other explanatory variables are introduced one by one based on the regression equation corresponding to the explanatory variable that contributes the most to the explained variable only the explanatory variables that have a significant contribution to the explained variable are selected meanwhile the old selected explanatory variable is deleted when its contribution is no longer significant due to the introduction of a new explained variable these repeated testing steps ensure that all explanatory variables in the regression model are significant to the explained variable the specific steps were conducted by the function stepwise in matlab 3 results 3 1 tws trends across china from april 2002 to march 2020 the tws spatial distribution trends in china were uneven 58 of the regions experienced losses in tws whereas the other 42 of regions experienced gains in tws fig 1 there are no significant trends in the necp 0 52 0 74 mm yr or the mlyp 1 16 1 36 mm yr the nasr 2 40 0 25 mm yr the hhhp 12 88 1 08 mm yr the lp 9 75 1 15 mm yr and the qtp 1 38 0 74 mm yr showed significantly decreasing tws trends p 0 05 the sbsr 4 21 0 90 mm yr the ygp 4 09 1 80 mm yr and the sc 2 09 1 21 mm yr showed significantly increasing tws trends p 0 05 china s total tws was decreasing the spatial pattern is similar to the findings of previous studies conducted over similar timeframes for example xu et al 2019 from 2003 to 2016 and zhao et al 2015a and mo et al 2016 from 2003 to 2013 however the decreasing tws trend of all of china 1 79 0 43 mm yr p 0 05 is accelerated when compared with that reported by xu et al 2019 approximately 0 92 mm yr the difference in magnitude is partly attributed to the recent accelerated tws decline 7 12 10 12 mm yr for april 2018 to march 2020 during the grace fo era p 0 05 and it is also related to different solutions of the grace data this study employed the grace derived tws based on rl06 solutions which according to göttl et al 2018 have been shown to be improved by 2 15 for accuracy when compared to the rl05 solutions used in previous studies the higher rate of tws decline highlights china s growing water shortage and the possible threats of intensified drought at regional and national scales 3 2 wsdi detected droughts across china fig 2 shows how the wsdi of china and its subregions have changed over time periods in which the tws deficit was three months or more are regarded as drought events overall there were a total of 8 countrywide drought events detected by the wsdi including 1 the drought of october 2007 march 2008 that occurred in the necp mlyp sbsr and sc 2 the drought of january 2009 july 2009 which mainly occurred in the necp sbsr and sc 3 the drought of september 2009 march 2010 which mainly occurred in the sbsr ygp and sc 4 the drought of april 2011 june 2012 which mainly affected the necp nasr hhhp mlyp sbsr ygp and sc 5 the drought of june 2014 september 2014 which mainly affected the nasr and hhhp 6 the drought of november 2014 october 2016 which mainly occurred in the necp nasr hhhp lp qtp and sc as well as 7 the droughts of december 2016 october 2018 and 8 april 2019 march 2020 both of which mainly affected the necp nasr hhhp lp qtp mlyp and sc the two most severe droughts the drought of november 2014 october 2016 and the drought of december 2016 october 2018 also had the longest deficit periods 24 and 23 months respectively while the most intense drought occurred from april 2019 to march 2020 according to fig 2 the wsdi detected drought events of china from the drought of 2007 2008 to the drought of 2019 2020 tended to be more frequent more intense and more severe nearly all of the tws deficits appeared in a single decade the severity increased from 2 97 to 27 27 and the intensity increased from 1 00 to 2 04 at the subregional scale detected severe drought events mostly occurred in northern china and in recent years even though most of the subregions in southern china have increasing tws trends they have also recently experienced drought events e g the qtp the mlyp and the sc thus in addition to the subregions in the north where drought events often occur drought events in other subregions are also worthy of additional study fig 2 also shows the relationship between the wsdi and crop production across china the yearly wsdi was significantly correlated with drought affected crop areas in some subregions in the south including the sbsr r 0 63 p 0 05 and ygp r 0 75 p 0 05 in the north the wsdi may be associated with drought induced crop failure areas for example there was a high correlation between the wsdi and drought induced crop failure areas in the nasr r 0 69 p 0 05 no significant correlation was found between the wsdi and drought affected crop areas in hhhp and lp which may be due to the south to north water diversion project of china 3 3 impact of climate change and human activities on wsdi attribution studies are a key step for developing scientifically based solutions for increasing drought threatens fig 3 illustrates the effects of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf areas of high and low vegetation on yearly wsdi across china along with fig 1 fig 3 shows that wetter conditions for a large proportion of regions have been driven by increasing precipitation and decreasing potential evapotranspiration for example the main impact factor affecting increased wsdi in the necp nasr and qtp is potential evapotranspiration whereas the factor affecting wsdi in the ygp mlyp and sc is mainly precipitation in contrast the drier conditions across china are mainly attributed to decreases in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area fig s1 summarizes the proportion of areas affected by each factor in each of the subregions of china areas with the most severe drought risks the hhhp and lp were the most widely affected by multiple unfavorable factors including the deterioration of the ecological environment and decreases in precipitation meanwhile subregions showing positive wsdi trends such as the mlyp ygp and sc experienced increases in precipitation significant wsdi changes were found to be closely associated with climate change however fig 4 further shows that areas primarily affected by precipitation can explain 20 to nearly 100 of wsdi changes especially in the mlyp hhhp and sc in contrast other factors cannot even explain 10 of wsdi changes since the precipitation the potential evapotranspiration and the leaf area index are more related to climate change other unexplained wsdi changes are likely to be related to human activities previous studies claimed that human activities may have changed the response of the tws to the climate in the north zhao et al 2015a xu et al 2019 to further confirm the direct impacts of human activities on droughts this study investigated the correlations between the wsdi and the relevant documented water resource data e g the total amount of water resources the amount of water supply and the accumulated water supply deficits for china and its subregions from 2002 to 2018 as shown in table 2 the yearly wsdi is significantly correlated with the yearly renewable water resources in most of the subregions except for the nasr the lp and the qtp the yearly wsdi of the nasr the lp and the qtp have more close relationship with human water uses including the groundwater supply the surface water supply and the sustainability of human water use i e the accumulated water supply deficits therefore human activities might have intensified china s droughts and exacerbated water shortages especially in the water scarce northern regions of china in addition agricultural irrigation was found to be the main use of water resources especially in northern china table s1 these subregions might be suggested to rationalize the control of agricultural water use 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons between wsdi detected droughts and other droughts as shown in table s2 the wsdi results are roughly consistent with those of other reported droughts including meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts however the wsdi detected droughts differ slightly from the others in duration and intensity for example the meteorological drought of 2009 2010 in the ygp saw its worst conditions for decades from september 2009 to march 2010 qiu 2010 lu et al 2011 barriopedro et al 2012 yang et al 2012 zhang and yamaguchi 2014 while the agricultural drought that occurred from november 2009 and september 2010 hit its most intense point in march 2010 but with a smaller magnitude zhang and yamaguchi 2014 zhao et al 2015b the differences between meteorological and agricultural droughts are reasonable on the ygp the response of the hydrological system to precipitation is a complex process with a delayed effect and a propagation threshold which mainly depends on the meteorological and underlying surface conditions guo et al 2020 perennially abundant water resources allow this region to be able to withstand deficiencies in seasonal precipitation in addition forest and shrub dominated land cover types increase resistance to water shortages nevertheless the wsdi which detected that the ygp experienced a moderate drought between august 2009 and september 2010 and hit its most intense point in march 2010 combined the results based on meteorological and agricultural drought indices moreover the wsdi is also applicable to socioeconomic management barriopedro et al 2012 found that the electricity output of china experienced a power reduction of 20 from october 2009 to april 2010 which was roughly consistent with the period of a wsdi detected drought in china september 2009 march 2010 the main advantage of the wsdi is that it captures the net change in all forms of water on the land surface or subsurface e g snow ice groundwater soil moisture and surface water hirschi et al 2007 kumar et al 2016 long et al 2017 therefore the wsdi represents an integrated drought index of the entire hydrological system including anthropogenic and underground changes and it is free of the numerous uncertainties associated with meteorological and hydrological data compared with meteorological drought indices the wsdi is more closely associated with agricultural and socioeconomic droughts in both duration and severity given that the propagation of drought is aggregated attenuated lagged and prolonged van loon et al 2012 yang et al 2017 ma et al 2019 guo et al 2020 compared with traditional hydrological drought indices that are based on streamflow the wsdi can better help the agricultural management of nonirrigated areas compared with traditional drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index standardized precipitation index and standardized runoff index the wsdi could reflect secular climate change and human impact liu et al 2020a in these cases the wsdi could be an effective index for improving large scale water management for both agriculture and the socioeconomy under the background of climate change and human activities 4 2 trends in the wsdi climate change can affect the wsdi e g el niño southern oscillation mainly affects changes in the wsdi of the sc including its trends huang et al 2021 unsustainable human water use can also lead to a form of perpetual and accelerated anthropogenic drought aghakouchak et al 2021 rateb et al 2021 therefore trends in the wsdi which include information from climate change and human activities could better help the assessment of long term droughts according to satish kumar et al 2021 only the wsdi could determine the long lasting drought event in the krishna basin which lasted 29 months when compared with other indices based on meteorological data however there is a suggestion that the wsdi trends could bias the assessment of short term droughts that are associated with meteorological conditions according to liu et al 2020a the wsdi detected a drought event in northwest india from 2002 to 2015 due to groundwater withdrawals used in irrigation but at the same time increased precipitation maintained the soil moisture liu et al 2020a suggested that the detrended wsdi could better determine drought events in china as the detrended wsdi is more consistent with precipitation or soil moisture the results presented in table 2 show that there are multiple causes that are responsible for the yearly changes in the wsdi including trends and cautious should still be exercised when removing the wsdi trends for example even though previous studies sun et al 2018 huang et al 2021 showed that human activities including dams could lead to an underestimation of the drought conditions of the mlyp and the sc a simple trend removal will also remove associated changes in meteorological conditions since their wsdi is highly correlated to yearly renewable water resources from precipitation table 2 moreover although liu et al 2020a found that the wsdi misestimated the meteorological drought event on the ygp from september 2009 to march 2010 this study further found that the wsdi combined the results of meteorological and agricultural indices during that drought singh et al 2021 also claimed that drought in regions with strong seasonal changes could last a long time even when precipitation is already above average the subregions e g nasr and lp that suffered from significant impacts from human water use might be more suitable for studying droughts that are free from direct human impacts using the trend removing approaches separating different storage components in the wsdi will further help identify different drought events under different driving factors 4 3 drought events during grace fo ran et al 2020 tried to detect drought events in the yangtze river basin based on grace fo data and suggested that grace fo data are as effective as grace data in detecting drought events across the yangtze river basin based on grace fo data this study found two countrywide drought events the droughts of december 2016 october 2018 and april 2019 march 2020 both of which mainly affected the necp nasr hhhp lp qtp mlyp and sc according to the office of state flood control and drought relief headquarters of china the drought of 2019 affected most regions due to low precipitation amounts and high temperatures especially in south china i e the mlyp hit its most severe autumn drought since 1961 this study also found that the wsdi of the mlyp also saw the lowest point at 2 20 in september 2019 during the entire study period under the impacts of climate change and human activities china s droughts seem to be more widespread intense and severe 4 4 uncertainties of the attribution analysis this study analyzes the effects of climate change and human activities on tws changes and accompanying droughts the separate attribution of natural changes or anthropogenic changes improves our understanding of the extent to which water scarcity can be alleviated however the tws change in some regions could not be explained by some of the studied factors such as precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area especially in some parts of the sbsr the nasr and the qtp the tws changes in these subregions also cannot be reasonably explained in the study of xu et al 2019 along with ice elevation change a possible explanation is that it is related to human activities or there might be two impact factors that separately drive different changes in different periods within this study period consequently none of them significantly contributed to tws changes individually moreover the uncertainty in the attribution analysis also stems from the variables that were studied even though the era5 land merges a large number of observations the complex terrain brings the challenge to the observation of these two subregions which increases the uncertainty the determination of the main impact factors driving the observed patterns in these two subregions thus requires further study 5 conclusions in this study the impact factors driving drought evolution across china from april 2002 to march 2020 were examined to better understand regional changes china was divided into nine subregions based on agricultural regionalization this study first analyzed the tws trends of china and its nine subregions during the study period china s overall tws decreased and the changes were unevenly distributed compared to previous studies based on other grace solutions this study found that china s tws declined at a higher rate 1 79 0 43 mm yr p 0 05 based on the latest version mascon rl06 the droughts associated with accelerated tws depletion were detected with a grace derived drought index the wsdi compared with other traditional drought indices the wsdi stands out as an integrated representation of the entire hydrological system the results based on the wsdi are roughly consistent with those based on other drought indices but the wsdi can capture the duration and intensity that combine the results of meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic droughts for example the wsdi detected drought combines the durations of a meteorological drought september 2009 to march 2010 and an agricultural drought november 2009 and september 2010 when it shows the same lowest point as the agricultural drought march 2010 the wsdi detected countrywide drought between september 2009 and march 2010 causes a power reduction of 20 for the electricity output of china from october 2009 to april 2010 according to the wsdi the severity of the countrywide droughts from 2002 to 2020 increased from 2 97 to 27 27 and their intensities increased from 1 00 to 2 04 the droughts of the nasr the hhhp and the lp also tended to be not only more intense and more severe but also more frequent in addition to the subregions in the north where drought events often occur recent drought events in the other subregions i e the mlyp and the sc around 2019 are also worthy of additional study finally the responses of the wsdi to climate change ecological changes and human impacts namely precipitation potential evapotranspiration leaf area and human water use were assessed to provide insight into how water management could be improved the wetter conditions were primarily attributed to increasing precipitation whereas more intense droughts were mostly affected by multiple impact factors relating to decreased precipitation and human activities precipitation can explain 20 to nearly 100 of the wsdi changes in most regions of the mlyp hhhp and sc other factors cannot even explain more than 20 of the changes in most areas unexplained wsdi changes are likely related to human activities the wsdi is highly correlated with the water supply in china especially in the nasr and the lp which implies that these areas are facing direct threats from human caused water shortages this study offers key information on china s future water management the more frequent and severe drought events that are expected also threaten china s economic and social development this study shows that the decline in precipitation and the rise in human water use for agriculture might be the main factors since decreases in precipitation are uncontrollable the key strategy of water supply for local governments to ensure sustainable development must be based on the available
