23765,accurate and reliable information about ocean surface waves is crucial for marine activities in coastal regions in areas with complex coastlines where fjords islets and strong bathymetry gradients affect the wave field a high resolution computational grid is needed to generate model results that agree with observations for traditional wave modelling this requires enormous computational power often resulting in insufficient spatial resolution at the most complex fjord and coastal regions we present an alternative method for coastal wave calculation the coastex wave calculation where the wave field is calculated from a set of predefined sea states given by wave properties at an offshore position and the local wind field we assess four different versions of the coastex method using wave observations from five measurement sites at the western coast of norway and two control runs using a traditional model setup on a high resolution computational grid for our study area we find that deviations between the results of the coastex calculations and the control runs are small at the most exposed location the mean error the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the significant wave height are in the range 0 06 m to 0 10 m 0 26 to 0 28 m and 0 34 m to 0 36 m respectively coastex and 0 08 m to 0 10 m 0 24 m to 0 26 m and 0 31 m to 0 33 m for the control runs at the most sheltered location the mean error of the coastex hindcast ranges from 0 07 m to 0 02 m compared to 0 05 m for the control runs the mean absolute error is 0 08 m and 0 09 m coastex and 0 07 m control runs and the root mean square error is 0 11 m and 0 12 m coastex and 0 10 m for the control runs keywords waves wind coast high resolution stwave data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal fairways are applied frequently by passenger cargo fishing and leisure vessels and the coastal waters are also common areas for fishing aquaculture and wind energy production arslanalp et al 2019 lasselle et al 2014 sørdahl et al 2017 to improve planning with respect to safety and traffic regularity information about the local sea state is needed forecasts and statistical analyses of the wave field may provide useful information that can simplify planning with respect to the selection of fairway and the time of crossing operation whereas local ocean phenomena such as crossing waves may be a potential hazard to seafarers e g mathiesen 1987 detection of environments that should be avoided from navigation is usually determined by the significant wave height h s and the peak period t p wmo 1998 for open sea conditions the accuracy of spectral wave hindcast and forecast data has become relatively high e g jansen and bidlot 2018 bidlot et al 2002 global wave data can be obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and ncep ncar through a set of wave reanalyzes uppala et al 2005 dee et al 2011 hersbach et al 2020 and operational forecast models chen 2006 thereby increasing the maritime safety offshore despite improvements in the large scale wave models the accuracy of the wave field near shore is still insufficient cavaleri et al 2018 this is mainly due to the relatively complex bathymetry of coastal regions that may include shallow banks and shoals and coastal landforms such as islets and archipelagoes leading to rapid changes and large differences in the local wave conditions over short distances given that information about the offshore sea state and the local wind field is available a high resolution numerical wave model may be applied to calculate the near shore wave field however by increasing the spatial resolution of the model grid also the computation time increases and the hindcast forecast period will be limited by the available computer resources the computational time may be reduced by applying unstructured grids that ensure high resolution to represent complicated bathymetry in shallow areas and or irregular shoreline qi et al 2009 zijlema 2009 this procedure can be effective in terms of reducing the number of model grid cells but often results in a higher cpu cost per grid point compared to regular grids e g zijlema 2010 camus et al 2011a applied clustering and selection algorithms to compute the near shore wave field with high resolution and a low computational cost using these methods camus et al 2011b were able to accurately compute wave parameters at the northwestern coast of spain whereas these methods are efficient and useful for generating time series of wave parameters their complexity make them less transparent than a traditional down scaling approach and it may therefore be more difficult to interpret the model results and improve the model setup in this study we describe the coastex wave computation method that is based on a look up table approach to reduce the computational time of wave modeling modelling in coastal water the method can be applied to compute hindcast for statistical analyses of the wave field in complex terrain as well as for operational wave forecast since 2017 the norwegian coastal administration the national agency for coastal management and maritime safety in norway has presented a high resolution wave forecast for the norwegian coast at the barentswatch web portal https www barentswatch no bolgevarsel the barentswatch wave forecast which is generated by use of the coastex method provides a 62 h forecast of the significant wave height peak period and peak direction at a grid covering the coast of norway at a horizontal resolution equal to 100 m 100 m fig 1 the coastex method may also be applied to compute time series of historical wave data at nearshore locations for statistical analysis and specialized forecast of extreme events e g early warning systems for coastal storms with the assumption that the wave spectrum is homogenous homogeneous at deep water and that the sea state is stationary over short time periods 1 h the transformation from offshore to nearshore waves can be calculated from a set of predefined sea states similarly in regions where the contribution from locally wind generated waves may have a significant effect on the wave spectrum waves can be computed from predefined wind fields the objective of this paper is to present the coastex wave modelling method and assess the model results obtained at four locations at the western coast of norway by use of wave observations for the period december 2018 to may 2019 in section 2 a description of the wave models selection procedure and applied sea states are given four versions of the coastex method are included based on the same principle but with different model physics and boundary forcing using combinations of the half plane and full plane versions of the steady state spectral wave model stwave massey et al 2011 and computation of the offshore wave spectrum from a single or two spectral peaks high and low frequency part to give a more complete assessment of the coastex model we have also included two model setups with the simulating waves nearshore model swan booij et al 1999 for these simulations we apply spatially and temporarily varying winds and boundary conditions results are presented in section 3 whereas the validation of the method is discussed in section 4 and the paper summarized and concluded in section 5 2 methods and data 2 1 coastex wave modeling modelling method wave growth caused by local wind forcing and propagation of the offshore wave spectrum to coastal waters is calculated using the stwave model stwave is a nearshore spectral wave model based on the steady state conservation of wave action conservation of spectral wave action along a ray can be expressed massey et al 2011 c g i x i c c g cos μ α e ω α ω s ω where c and c g are the phase and group celerity respectively α the wave orthogonal direction μ the direction of ocean surface current ω is the angular frequency and s is an energy source sink term stwave can be applied to estimate wave generation and propagation over relatively short distances and includes the effects of depth induced wave refraction and shoaling wave breaking diffraction wave growth through momentum transfer from the winds to waves and white capping the stwave model may be run in half plane or full plane mode whereas the governing equations are similar between the half plane and full plane modes the full plane version of stwave allows wave transformation and generation in all directions full 360 plane for the half plane mode the angle band width is fixed at 5 whereas for the full plane mode the value is user specified further in contrast to the full plane version for the half plane mode grid cells are required to be square in this study we apply the same grid resolution along the two orthogonal axes and the band width is set equal to 5 for all stwave model setups currents are not included in the wave calculations a computational grid is made for the breisundet area at the western coast of norway fig 2 the topography of the region is relatively complex including deep fjords with several bifurcations the spatial resolution of the model grid is 100 m 100 m where the grid bathymetry has been generated from a basis provided by the norwegian mapping authority norwegian hydrographic services at the open boundaries the model is forced by a constant wave spectrum s f θ given as s f θ s f d f θ with s f being the frequency spectrum and d f θ the direction distribution for wave frequency f and wave direction θ we calculate s f using the joint north sea wave project spectrum jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 with the peak enhancement factor following torsethaugen and haver 2004 for d f θ the gaussian direction distribution is applied mathiesen 1987 where the directional spread at the peak frequency is set equal to 35 to compute the near shore wave parameters h s t p θ p a set of offshore sea states are defined that are used to determine the wave spectra at the open boundaries for every offshore peak wave direction 105 model runs defined by h s and t p are made the significant wave height ranges from 0 1 m to 15 m with steps equal to 0 2 m for h s less than 0 5 m 0 5 m for h s less than 4 m and 1 m for h s larger than 4 m for a given value of h s 5 values of t p are included using 60 years of hindcast wave data from positions offshore norway nora10 reistad et al 2011 it is found that an estimate of the peak period can be computed from the significant wave heigh according to t p exp 1 7 0 3 h s 0 45 the standard deviation of the difference between the modelled peak period and the peak period obtained from the hindcast data is equal to 2 5 s the 5 included values of t p are centered centred around t p with steps equal to 1 s the resolution of the offshore peak wave direction is 15 excluding directions from land gives a total number of 630 sea states of waves propagating from open sea to the coastal areas to obtain nearshore values of h s t p θ p at a specific time in the hindcast forecast data from an offshore wave dataset is applied linear interpolation of the sea states that minimize the difference between the data in the list of applied sea states and the offshore hindcast forecast data is used in the case of a two peaked spectrum the high and low frequency part of the offshore wave spectrum are computed separately this is also done for wave growth caused by the local wind a set of wave calculations are made for wind speeds ranging from 1 m s to 29 m s and for wind directions from 0 to 330 with 15 resolution offshore grid points are masked out so that the fetch cannot extend to open water hence there is no wind induced wave growth in the offshore part of the model domain selection of wind condition case can be done at several grid points to include the effect of spatially varying winds but in this study we apply input data from the offshore point only for wave propagation offshore waves 100 frequencies are applied ranging from 0 04 s 1 to 0 535 s 1 for locally wind generated waves the frequency ranges from 0 08 s 1 to 1 07 s 1 at the offshore positions of the model grid hindcast and forecast data of h s t p and θ p of both the combined and the high and low frequency part of the wave spectrum are available from the norwegian meteorological institute through three operational versions of the wam model at 10 km 4 km and 800 m grid resolution wamdi group 1988 carrasco and gusdal 2014 in this study data from the wam 800 model 800 m 800 m spatial resolution at 5 34 494 e 62 37 128 n selection point is applied to select the data used to generate hindcast of the coastal wave field at breisundet wind data is obtained from the norwegian meteorological institute through their operational hindcast and forecast system meps based on the arome weather prediction model seity et al 2011 brousseau et al 2016 the horizontal grid resolution of meps is 2 5 km 2 5 km the wave field in the breisundet area is calculated for the period december 2018 july 2018 july 2019 four different coastex schemes are applied based on the half and full plane version of stwave with one 1pe and two 2pe spectral peaks for the low and high frequency part of the wave spectrum details about the coastex setups are given in table 1 the wave forecast presented at barentswatch is based on the half plane version of stwave with one spectral peak and the additional three schemes are included to assess the potential for improving the coastex method 2 2 swan wave modelling to assess the coastex method additional hindcast datasets have been computed using the swan model swan is a third generation spectral wave model developed for coastal applications the model propagates the wave action balance equation forward in time and includes source terms for wave generation caused by wind white capping bottom friction depth induced wave breaking and non linear wave wave wave wave interaction christakos et al 2021 used the swan model to calculate the wave conditions in the breisundet area with three different formulations for white capping and energy transfer from the wind to the waves the komen package hasselmann 1974 komen et al 1984 the westh package van der westhuysen et al 2007 and the st6 package zieger et al 2015 it was found that in the breisundet area model setups based on the komen and westh packages provided results in the best agreement with observations in this study we include two model setups with the swan model the komen and westh packages are implemented in model setups with 10 min time steps komen10 westh10 as recommended by christakos et al 2021 wind and boundary wave data are provided by respectively the meps and the wam 800 dataset at the open boundary the jonswap spectrum is applied the spectrum is discretized with 72 equally spaced directions and 50 frequencies between 0 04hz and 2 0hz the wave field in the breisundet area is calculated for the period december 2018 july 2018 july 2019 2 3 observations and model assessment wave and wind measurement data from seawatch wavescan buoys furevik and aarnes 2021 furevik et al 2016 have been made in the breisundet area since october 2016 wave buoys a c and d are placed in sulafjorden and are partly exposed to the open sea in particular buoy d which is placed at the fjord opening in contrast buoy f has been deployed in the southern part of vartdalsfjorden and is completely sheltered from offshore waves table 2 and fig 2 in addition wave measurements with an aanderaa motus wave buoy are made at fauskane furevik et al 2019 on the banks northwest of sulafjorden table 2 buoy e the wind sensor at buoys d a c and f are placed 4 1 m above sea level whereas at buoy e it is placed at 3 m height the wind speed at 10 m height is obtained using the logarithmic wind profile with the surface roughness length set equal to 0 01 m dnv 2021 the wave observation data contains the significant wave height peak wave period and mean wave direction for the full and for the high and low frequency part of the wave spectrum data are updated two times per hour and are available via met norway thredds service met 2023 to assess the model results the mean error me the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse are computed e g wilks 2006 m e x m o d x b u o y m a e 1 n k 1 n x m o d k x b u o y k r m s e 1 n k 1 n x m o d k x b u o y k 2 where me is the difference between the

difference between the modelled and observed wave parameter for the n pairs of hindcast and observations and rmse is the square root of the average squared difference between the modelled and observed data 3 wave hindcast validation 3 1 input wave and wind data offshore wave data at fauskane using wave data from fauskane buoy e a comparison is made between the wam 800 model data and wave observations in fig 3 a time series of the observed h s b u o y and modelled h s w a m significant wave height is shown for the period december 2018 to july 2019 for most of the period differences are small except for a three days time period in december 2018 december 12 to december 15 and two days in january 2019 january 22 to january 24 where wam 800 data is about 1 m less than observations pronounced differences are only seen for time intervals of a few hours still there are several short episodes where wam 800 underestimates the significant wave height by 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 m which can occur when h s b u o y exceeds 4 m the mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of modelled significant wave height are listed in table 3 for four different wave regimes h s b u o y less than 1 5 m between 1 5 m and 3 m greater than 3 m and for all data it is seen that for all regimes me is negative indicating that at fauskane the wam 800 model underestimates the significant wave height compared to observations the mean absolute error is in the range 0 14 m for the lowest values of h s b u o y to 0 47 m for waves exceeding 3 m whereas the root mean square error ranges from 0 18 m to 0 64 m wave roses of h s b u o y and h s w a m are shown in fig 4 for the full wave spectrum and the significant wave height computed from the high and low frequency part of the spectrum the observations give dominant wave directions from west southwest and northeast for all three h s components for the wam 800 data this is only the case for the high frequency part of the wave spectrum whereas the full spectrum and the low frequency part indicate that waves also frequently propagate from northwest to further assess the accuracy of the offshore wave direction me mae and rmse of modelled wave direction are calculated results for the full spectrum and the high and low frequency part are listed in table 4 the highest bias is seen for the high frequency part of the wave spectrum with me equal to 17 compared to 1 for the low frequency part and 8 for the peak frequency also ame and rmse are largest for the high frequency waves with values equal to respectively 63 and 82 corresponding values for the peak direction full spectrum are 20 and 28 wind data in fig 5 wind roses from the wave buoys deployed in the breisundet area are shown at fauskane e and breisundet d the wind is predominately from south southwest and northeast whereas at outer and inner sulafjorden a and c the wind is aligned with the fjord in the north south direction also at vartdalsfjorden f the wind follows the topography and is in the direction of the fjord with dominant wind direction being from southeast the highest wind speed is measured at fauskane where values may exceed 24 m s at the two most sheltered sites inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f the highest measured wind speed is 21 m s fig 6 shows wind roses from the meps hindcast data unlike the observations there is no dominant wind direction and there are little differences between the five locations the wind speed is higher than indicated by observations with values exceeding 26 m s at all five positions 3 2 nearshore wave hindcast the significant wave height h s peak period t p and peak direction θ p at the four nearshore positions where wave measurements are made breisundet d outer sulafjorden a inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f fig 2 and table 2 has been calculated using the methods described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 results for h s for the period december 2018 to july 2019 are shown in figs 7 10 whereas the mean error the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the significant wave height peak period and peak direction are listed in tables 5 to 8 exposed locations breisundet d and outer sulafjorden a at the two most exposed locations breisundet d and outer sulafjorden a the highest measured significant wave height is equal to approximately 6 m and 4 m respectively figs 7 and 8 the time series indicate that the six model setups under consideration give similar results with the significant wave height being either overestimated or underestimated for the same periods in december 2018 the modelled h s is lower than observations for a time period of 3 days similar to what is seen at fauskane for the wam 800 model there are also times were the models overestimate the significant wave height at breisundet and outer sulafjorden such as the first week of march 2019 and toward the end of may 2019 in fact for all model setups there is a positive bias at both breisundet and at outer sulafjorden at breisundet the mean error ranges from 0 06 m to 0 10 m for the four coastex setups with the highest values obtained for data derived from a single peaked offshore wave spectrum and the full plane version of stwave the mean absolute error and the root mean square error are in the range 0 26 m to 0 28 m and 0 34 m to 0 36 m with values being slightly lower when two peaks are applied to generate the offshore wave spectrum for both the peak direction and peak period the bias is negative for the four coastex versions with me of t p being between 2 4 s and 2 2 s and me of θ p ranging from 8 and 4 differences in mae and rmse of the peak period are small with values in the range 2 3 s to 2 5 s mae and 2 8 s to 3 0 s rmse for the peak direction mae and rmse are largest for results based on the full plane version of stwave with ame equal to 9 full 1pe and 10 full 2pe compared to 7 and 8 for the half plane version results from outer sulafjorden are similar to those from breisundet with all four coastex setups giving positive bias for the significant wave height 0 07 m to 0 08 m and the highest values of me obtained for setups where a single spectral peak is applied the mean absolute error is equal to 0 19 m for all coastex schemes and the root mean square error is equal to 0 24 m and 0 25 m the peak period has a negative bias equal to 2 3 s and 2 2 s and ame and rmse equal to 2 4 s and 2 5 s and 2 8 s and 2 9 s respectively as was also seen at breisundet the peak direction has a negative bias for all coastex setups with values equal to 8 and 7 at the outer sulafjorden there are no differences in mae and rmse with values equal to respectively 8 and 13 also the two control runs westh10 and komen10 have positive bias for the significant wave height at the two most exposed locations with values equal to 0 08 m westh10 and 0 10 m komen10 at breisundet and 0 06 m westh10 and 0 09 m komen10 at outer sulafjorden it is further seen that like the bias also the mean absolute error and root mean square error are lower for westh10 results compared to those of komen10 with values equal to 0 26 m and 0 33 m komen10 and 0 24 m and 0 31 m westh10 at breisundet and 0 19 m and 0 25 m komen10 and 0 17 m and 0 23 m westh10 at outer sulafjorden in contrast to the hindcast data obtained with the coastex method the bias of t p is slightly positive at the two exposed locations with values in the range 0 3 s to 0 6 s both mae and rmse are lower than results based on the coastex method with values equal to 1 3 s and 1 9 s breisundet and 1 5 s and 2 0 s outer sulafjorden sheltered locations inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f the time series of the significant wave height at inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f figs 9 and 10 show that at the two most sheltered locations the significant wave height is considerably lower than at the two exposed locations breisundet and outer sulafjorden with the exception of a short time period of a few hours in january 2019 the observed h s is less than 1 m at both locations during the measurement period at inner sulafjorden the bias of the significant wave height is between 0 01 m and 0 02 m for the four coastex setups whereas komen10 and westh10 give me equal to respectively 0 05 m and 0 0 m the mean absolute error is equal to 0 07 m for all models except westh10 which gives mae equal to 0 05 m and the rmse is equal to 0 09 m for results based on the coastex method and 0 08 m westh10 and 0 10 m komen10 for the two control runs table 7 at the most sheltered location vartdalsfjorden the bias of h s is negative for all setups with values of me ranging from 0 07 m to 0 02 m table 8 highest least negative values are found for the results based on the full plane version of stwave the mean absolute error is equal to respectively 0 08 m and 0 09 m for results based on the full plane and half plane version of stwave and the root mean square error is equal to 0 11 m full plane and 0 12 m half plane whereas the mae and the rmse of the two control runs are equal to respectively 0 07 m and 0 10 m at inner sulafjorden the bias of the hindcast data based on the coastex method are negative with values between 2 6 s and 1 5 s and the lowest bias for results obtained with the half plane version of stwave the two control runs give positive values for me whereas differences between the mae and the rmse are relatively low with the mae being in the range 2 8 s to 3 3 s and the rmse 3 6 s and 4 4 s in contrast for the peak direction me ranges from 9 to 11 where the hindcast data obtained with the coastex method give positive bias for the peak direction both the mean absolute error and the root mean square error are larger at the two sheltered locations compared to breisundet and outer sulafjorden with values of mae ranging from 34 to 52 at inner sulafjorden and from 48 to 63 at vartdalsfjorden 4 discussion the coastex wave calculation method is developed as an alternative to traditional wave models where the progression of the wave field is calculated from an initial state wind forcing and the wave spectra at the open boundaries instead we compute the wave field from a set of offshore sea states and wind conditions where most of the calculations are made before the hindcast forecast is initiated in the case of hindcast data the number of model runs with the stwave model is determined by the number of sea states cases included in the coastex setup rather than the total number of time steps in the hindcast period because the coastex method significantly reduces the computational time for long time series a high resolution model grid can be applied this allows the model setup to include the effect of islets narrow banks and strong bathymetry gradients on the computed wave field the method relies on several assumptions including homogenous homogeneous wave conditions at the open boundaries spatially constant winds in the model domain and that ocean waves and locally wind generated waves can be calculated separately in the north sea and the norwegian sea large scale weather systems with horizontal scales of 100 150 km prevails barstad and grønås 2005 this indicates that for relatively small model domains the assumption of homogenous homogeneous boundary conditions is usually valid in the presence of complex terrain there may still be considerable variations in the wind field especially in fjord systems where topographic effects may modify both the wind speed and the wind direction christakos et al 2020 the wind measurements show that in sulafjorden a and c and in vartdalsfjorden f the wind is predominately aligned with the fjord which indicates that locally wind generated waves should be computed from several different input data points and not only from the offshore wind field however at present the applied wind data cannot resolve the observed wind gradients and we have therefore applied a single input data point from section 3 2 it is found that in vartdalsfjorden f where the wave field is determined solely by locally wind generated waves all model setups underestimate the significant wave height since the effect of spatially varying winds is included in the two control runs expanding the number of wind input data points in the coastex setups is not expected to improve the results in fact compared to the control runs the bias is lower for data based on the full plane version of the stwave model although the mean absolute error is somewhat higher we have further assumed that the contribution to the wave spectrum from locally wind generated waves and propagating offshore waves can be calculated separately this is done by restricting locally wind generated waves to areas not directly exposed to incoming offshore waves and therefore wave growth at offshore grid points in the model domain is neglected unless the wave field is developing rapidly from a state of rest we expect that for relatively small model domains wave growth over short distances will be insignificant compared to the offshore waves propagating shoreward in contrast to inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f both the coastex setups and the control runs appear to overestimate h s at the two most exposed locations breisundet d and outer sulafjorden a toward open waters the significant wave height becomes increasingly more affected by the accuracy of the incoming ocean waves and the positive bias may be related to deviations between the observed and modelled offshore wave spectrum at fauskane the agreement between h s from wam 800 and observations is high whereas differences in wave direction are apparent with modelled waves to a greater extent being directed toward the fjord opening at the positions most influenced by propagating ocean waves breisundet and outer sulafjorden we may therefore expect the modelled significant wave height to be overestimated applying two spectral peaks for the offshore boundary data slightly reduces the mean absolute error whereas the bias increases since the high frequency part of the offshore wave spectrum deviates considerably from observations the inclusion of two spectral peaks for the offshore spectrum will not significantly improve the model results compared to the two control runs the coastex method appears to underestimate the peak period at the two most exposed locations breisundet and outer sulafjorden here also the mean absolute error and root mean square error are larger than values obtained with the swan model at the two most sheltered locations inner sulafjorden and vartdalsfjorden where the sea state is more dominated by locally wind generated waves the error estimates are similar to those of the two control runs and the deviations from observations at the most exposed locations may therefore be caused by not including enough peak periods in the set of included wave calculations for the peak direction at the exposed locations the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the results based on the coastex method and the swan runs are similar indicating that the directional resolution in the coastex setup is sufficient at the two most sheltered locations the peak direction is found to deviate more from the observed wave direction which may result from the applied wind data not being able to resolve the observed wind gradients for the hindcast period under consideration the modelled significant wave heights based on the coastex procedure are similar to the results based on the komen wind package in terms of mean error mean absolute error and root mean square error and slightly higher compared to the hindcast data based on the westhuysen package the major advantage of the coastex method is in the time needed to generate the time series to compute the stwave wave data included in the set of predefined sea states on a hp workstation with 8 inteli9 cores takes approximately 2 5 days whereas the time needed to generate the time series of wave parameters at the four nearshore locations for the 257 days time period hindcast period is 30 min for the two control runs komen10 and westh10 the model is run using the openmp version of swan with eight computational threads on four 3 40 ghz cores intel core i7 2600 to generate a hindcast time series of 257 days with this set up takes approximately 54 days although the computational time may be reduced by increasing the number of threads results from parallel computing experiments indicate that in the case of a single computational node the time saving ratio is nearly constant when the number of threads exceeds 20 rautenbach et al 2021 for high resolution swan simulations rautenbach et al found that when the model was run using the message passing interface mpi on 20 threads the computational time was about 65 compared to openmp set ups on 8 threads assuming the same speed up ratio for the breisundet model indicates that to generate a 257 days wave hindcast requires more than 35 days computational time to compute the wave forecast presented at the barentswatch portal where the breisundet model area constitutes less than 2 of the total domain included in the forecast would therefore only be feasible by the use of highly resource intensive super computers 5 summary and conclusions in this study the coastex wave calculation procedure is presented four different coastex versions are included based on the half and full plane version of stwave and the offshore wave spectrum being computed with a single or two spectral peaks using wave observations from the west coast of norway and two control runs performed with the swan wave model the coastex method is assessed for our study area the breisundet area coastex results are similar to the results of the control runs in terms of mean error mean absolute error and root mean square error of the significant wave height the major difference between the coastex method and the traditional wave calculation procedure is the time resources needed to generate the hindcast as coastex do not require the use of energy demanding computer clusters whereas the results indicate that coastex is well suited for making high resolution coastal wave hindcast a potential for improving the method exists since the method is highly dependent on the applied input data i e the meps wind field and the wam 800 wave data further improvements of these datasets may also increase the quality of the high resolution wave data whereas the wam 800 model gives highly accurate values for the offshore significant wave height we find that there may be relatively large deviations in the wave direction especially for the high frequency part of the wave spectrum this appears to result in somewhat overestimated wave heights at the most exposed locations near the fjord opening in the most sheltered waters the significant wave height is underestimated in all datasets which may be improved by increasing the spatial resolution of the input wind data to resolve the complex terrain often found in coastal regions credit

23765,accurate and reliable information about ocean surface waves is crucial for marine activities in coastal regions in areas with complex coastlines where fjords islets and strong bathymetry gradients affect the wave field a high resolution computational grid is needed to generate model results that agree with observations for traditional wave modelling this requires enormous computational power often resulting in insufficient spatial resolution at the most complex fjord and coastal regions we present an alternative method for coastal wave calculation the coastex wave calculation where the wave field is calculated from a set of predefined sea states given by wave properties at an offshore position and the local wind field we assess four different versions of the coastex method using wave observations from five measurement sites at the western coast of norway and two control runs using a traditional model setup on a high resolution computational grid for our study area we find that deviations between the results of the coastex calculations and the control runs are small at the most exposed location the mean error the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the significant wave height are in the range 0 06 m to 0 10 m 0 26 to 0 28 m and 0 34 m to 0 36 m respectively coastex and 0 08 m to 0 10 m 0 24 m to 0 26 m and 0 31 m to 0 33 m for the control runs at the most sheltered location the mean error of the coastex hindcast ranges from 0 07 m to 0 02 m compared to 0 05 m for the control runs the mean absolute error is 0 08 m and 0 09 m coastex and 0 07 m control runs and the root mean square error is 0 11 m and 0 12 m coastex and 0 10 m for the control runs keywords waves wind coast high resolution stwave data availability data will

and wind energy production arslanalp et al 2019 lasselle et al 2014 sørdahl et al 2017 to improve planning with respect to safety and traffic regularity information about the local sea state is needed forecasts and statistical analyses of the wave field may provide useful information that can simplify planning with respect to the selection of fairway and the time of crossing operation whereas local

hersbach et al 2020 and operational forecast models chen 2006 thereby increasing the maritime safety offshore despite improvements in the large scale wave models the accuracy of the wave field near shore is still insufficient cavaleri et al 2018 this is mainly due to the relatively complex bathymetry of coastal regions that may include shallow banks and shoals and coastal landforms such as islets and archipelagoes leading to rapid changes and large differences in the local wave conditions over short distances given that information about the offshore sea state and the local wind field is available a high resolution numerical wave model may be applied to calculate the near shore wave field however by increasing the spatial resolution of the model grid also the computation time increases and the hindcast forecast period will be limited by the available computer resources the computational time may be reduced by applying unstructured grids that ensure high resolution to represent complicated bathymetry in shallow areas and or irregular shoreline qi et al 2009 zijlema 2009 this procedure can be effective in terms of reducing the number of model grid cells but often results in a higher cpu cost per grid point compared to regular grids e g zijlema 2010 camus et al 2011a applied clustering and selection algorithms to compute the near shore wave field with high resolution and a low computational cost using these methods camus et al 2011b were able to accurately compute wave parameters at the northwestern coast of spain whereas these methods are efficient and useful for generating time series of wave parameters their complexity make them less transparent than a traditional down scaling approach and it may therefore be more difficult to interpret the model results and improve the model setup in this study we describe the coastex wave computation method that is based on a look up table approach to reduce the computational time of wave modeling modelling in coastal water the method can be applied to compute hindcast for statistical analyses of the wave field in complex terrain as well as for operational wave forecast since 2017 the norwegian coastal administration the national agency for coastal management and maritime safety in norway has presented a high resolution wave forecast for the norwegian coast at the barentswatch web portal https www barentswatch no bolgevarsel the barentswatch wave forecast which is generated by use of the coastex method provides a 62 h forecast of the significant wave height peak period and peak direction at a grid covering the coast of norway at a horizontal resolution equal to 100 m 100 m fig 1 the coastex method may also be applied to compute time series of historical wave data at nearshore locations for statistical analysis and specialized forecast of extreme events e g early warning systems for coastal storms with the assumption that the wave spectrum is homogenous homogeneous at deep water and that the sea state is stationary over short time periods 1 h the transformation from offshore to nearshore waves can be calculated from a set of predefined sea states similarly in regions where the contribution from locally wind generated waves may have a significant effect on the wave spectrum waves can be computed from predefined wind fields the objective of this paper is to present the coastex wave modelling method and assess the model results obtained at four locations at the western coast of norway by use of wave observations for the period december 2018 to may 2019 in section 2 a description of the wave models selection procedure and applied sea states are given four versions of the coastex method are included based on the same principle but with different model physics and boundary forcing using combinations of the half plane and full plane versions of the steady state spectral wave model stwave massey et al 2011 and computation of the offshore wave spectrum from a single or two spectral peaks high and low frequency part to give a more complete assessment of the coastex model we have also included two model setups with the simulating waves nearshore model swan booij et al 1999 for these simulations we apply spatially and temporarily varying winds and boundary conditions results are presented in section 3 whereas the validation of the method is discussed in section 4 and the paper summarized and concluded in section 5 2 methods and data 2 1 coastex wave modeling modelling method wave growth caused by local wind forcing and propagation of the offshore wave spectrum to coastal waters is calculated using the stwave model stwave is a nearshore spectral wave model based on the steady state conservation of wave action conservation of spectral wave action along a ray can be expressed massey et al 2011 c g i x i c c g cos μ α e ω α ω s ω where c and c g are the phase and group celerity respectively α the wave orthogonal direction μ the direction of ocean surface current ω is the angular frequency and s is an energy source sink term stwave can be applied to estimate wave generation and propagation over relatively short distances and includes the effects of depth induced wave refraction and shoaling wave breaking diffraction wave growth through momentum transfer from the winds to waves and white capping the stwave model may be run in half plane or full plane mode whereas the governing equations are similar between the half plane and full plane modes the full plane version of stwave allows wave transformation and generation in all directions full 360 plane for the half plane mode the angle band width is fixed at 5 whereas for the full plane mode the value is user specified further in contrast to the full plane version for the half plane mode grid cells are required to be square in this study we apply the same grid resolution along the two orthogonal axes and the band width is set equal to 5 for all stwave model setups currents are not included in the wave calculations a computational grid is made for the breisundet area at the western coast of norway fig 2 the topography of the region is relatively complex including deep fjords with several bifurcations the spatial resolution of the model grid is 100 m 100 m where the grid bathymetry has been generated from a basis provided by the norwegian mapping authority norwegian hydrographic services at the open boundaries the model is forced by a constant wave spectrum s f θ given as s f θ s f d f θ with s f being the frequency spectrum and d f θ the direction distribution for wave frequency f and wave direction θ we calculate s f using the joint north sea wave project spectrum jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 with the peak enhancement factor following torsethaugen and haver 2004 for d f θ the gaussian direction distribution is applied mathiesen 1987 where the directional spread at the peak frequency is set equal to 35 to compute the near shore wave parameters h s t p θ p a set of offshore sea states are defined that are used to determine the wave spectra at the open boundaries for every offshore peak wave direction 105 model runs defined by h s and t p are made the significant wave height ranges from 0 1 m to 15 m with steps equal to 0 2 m for h s less than 0 5 m 0 5 m for h s less than 4 m and 1 m for h s larger than 4 m for a given value of h s 5 values of t p are included using 60 years of hindcast wave data from positions offshore norway nora10 reistad et al 2011 it is found that an estimate of the peak period can be computed from the significant wave heigh according to t p exp 1 7 0 3 h s 0 45 the standard deviation of the difference between the modelled peak period and the peak period obtained from the hindcast data is equal to 2 5 s the 5 included values of t p are centered centred around t p with steps equal to 1 s the resolution of the offshore peak wave direction is 15 excluding directions from land gives a total number of 630 sea states of waves propagating from open sea to the coastal areas to obtain nearshore values of h s t p θ p at a specific time in the hindcast forecast data from an offshore wave dataset is applied linear interpolation of the sea states that minimize the difference between the data in the list of applied sea states and the offshore hindcast forecast data is used in the case of a two peaked spectrum the high and low frequency part of the offshore wave spectrum are computed separately this is also done for wave growth caused by the local wind a set of wave calculations are made for wind speeds ranging from 1 m s to 29 m s and for wind directions from 0 to 330 with 15 resolution offshore grid points are masked out so that the fetch cannot extend to open water hence there is no wind induced wave growth in the offshore part of the model domain selection of wind condition case can be done at several grid points to include the effect of spatially varying winds but in this study we apply input data from the offshore point only for wave propagation offshore waves 100 frequencies are applied ranging from 0 04 s 1 to 0 535 s 1 for locally wind generated waves the frequency ranges from 0 08 s 1 to 1 07 s 1 at the offshore positions of the model grid hindcast and forecast data of h s t p and θ p of both the combined and the high and low frequency part of the wave spectrum are available from the norwegian meteorological institute through three operational versions of the wam model at 10 km 4 km and 800 m grid resolution wamdi group 1988 carrasco and gusdal 2014 in this study data from the wam 800 model 800 m 800 m spatial resolution at 5 34 494 e 62 37 128 n selection point is applied to select the data used to generate hindcast of the coastal wave field at breisundet wind data is obtained from the norwegian meteorological institute through their operational hindcast and forecast system meps based on the arome weather prediction model seity et al 2011 brousseau et al 2016 the horizontal grid resolution of meps is 2 5 km 2 5 km the wave field in the breisundet area is calculated for the period december 2018 july 2018 july 2019 four different coastex schemes are applied based on the half and full plane version of stwave with one 1pe and two 2pe spectral peaks for the low and high frequency part of the wave spectrum details about the coastex setups are given in table 1 the wave forecast presented at barentswatch is based on the half plane version of stwave with one spectral peak and the additional three schemes are included to assess the potential for improving the coastex method 2 2 swan wave modelling to assess the coastex method additional hindcast datasets have been computed using the swan model swan is a third generation spectral wave model developed for coastal applications the model propagates the wave action balance equation forward in time and includes source terms for wave generation caused by wind white capping bottom friction depth induced wave breaking and non linear wave wave wave wave interaction christakos et al 2021 used the swan model to calculate the wave conditions in the breisundet area with three different formulations for white capping and energy transfer from the wind to the waves the komen package hasselmann 1974 komen et al 1984 the westh package van der westhuysen et al 2007 and the st6 package zieger et al 2015 it was found that in the breisundet area model setups based on the komen and westh packages provided results in the best agreement with observations in this study we include two model setups with the swan model the komen and westh packages are implemented in model setups with 10 min time steps komen10 westh10 as recommended by christakos et al 2021 wind and boundary wave data are provided by respectively the meps and the wam 800 dataset at the open boundary the jonswap spectrum is applied the spectrum is discretized with 72 equally spaced directions and 50 frequencies between 0 04hz and 2 0hz the wave field in the breisundet area is calculated for the period december 2018 july 2018 july 2019 2 3 observations and model assessment wave and wind measurement data from seawatch wavescan buoys furevik and aarnes 2021 furevik et al 2016 have been made in the breisundet area since october 2016 wave buoys a c and d are placed in sulafjorden and are partly exposed to the open sea in particular buoy d which is placed at the fjord opening in contrast buoy f has been deployed in the southern part of vartdalsfjorden and is completely sheltered from offshore waves table 2 and fig 2 in addition wave measurements with an aanderaa motus wave buoy are made at fauskane furevik et al 2019 on the banks northwest of sulafjorden table 2 buoy e the wind sensor at buoys d a c and f are placed 4 1 m above sea level whereas at buoy e it is placed at 3 m height the wind speed at 10 m height is obtained using the logarithmic wind profile with the surface roughness length set equal to 0 01 m dnv 2021 the wave observation data contains the significant wave height peak wave period and mean wave direction for the full and for the high and low frequency part of the wave spectrum data are updated two times per hour and are available via met norway thredds service met 2023 to assess the model results the mean error me the mean absolute error mae and

data 3 wave hindcast validation 3 1 input wave and wind data offshore wave data at fauskane using wave data from fauskane buoy e a comparison is made between the wam 800 model data and wave observations in fig 3 a time series of the observed h s b u o y and modelled h s w a m significant wave height is shown for the period december 2018 to july 2019 for most of the period differences are small except for a three days time period in december 2018 december 12 to december 15 and two days in january 2019 january 22 to january 24 where wam 800 data is about 1 m less than observations pronounced differences are only seen for time intervals of a few hours still there are several short episodes where wam 800 underestimates the significant wave height by 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 m which can occur when h s b u o y exceeds 4 m the mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of modelled significant wave height are listed in table 3 for four different wave regimes h s b u o y less than 1 5 m between 1 5 m and 3 m greater than 3 m and for all data it is seen that for all regimes me is negative indicating that at fauskane the wam 800 model underestimates the significant wave height compared to observations the mean absolute error is in the range 0 14 m for the lowest values of h s b u o y to 0 47 m for waves exceeding 3 m whereas the root mean square error ranges from 0 18 m to 0 64 m wave roses of h s b u o y and h s w a m are shown in fig 4 for the full wave spectrum and the significant wave height computed from the high and low frequency part of the spectrum the observations give dominant wave directions from west southwest and northeast for all three h s components for the wam 800 data this is only the case for the high frequency part of the wave spectrum whereas the full spectrum and the low frequency part indicate that waves also frequently propagate from northwest to further assess the accuracy of the offshore wave direction me mae and rmse of modelled wave direction are calculated results for the full spectrum and the high and low frequency part are listed in table 4 the highest bias is seen for the high frequency part of the wave spectrum with me equal to 17 compared to 1 for the low frequency part and 8 for the peak frequency also ame and rmse are largest for the high frequency waves with values equal to respectively 63 and 82 corresponding values for the peak direction full spectrum are 20 and 28 wind data in fig 5 wind roses from the wave buoys deployed in the breisundet area are shown at fauskane e and breisundet d the wind is predominately from south southwest and northeast whereas at outer and inner sulafjorden a and c the wind is aligned with the fjord in the north south direction also at vartdalsfjorden f the wind follows the topography and is in the direction of the fjord with dominant wind direction being from southeast the highest wind speed is measured at fauskane where values may exceed 24 m s at the two most sheltered sites inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f the highest measured wind speed is 21 m s fig 6 shows wind roses from the meps hindcast data unlike the observations there is no dominant wind direction and there are little differences between the five locations the wind speed is higher than indicated by observations with values exceeding 26 m s at all five positions 3 2 nearshore wave hindcast the significant wave height h s peak period t p and peak direction θ p at the four nearshore positions where wave measurements are made breisundet d outer sulafjorden a inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f fig 2 and table 2 has been calculated using the methods described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 results for h s for the period december 2018 to july 2019 are shown in figs 7 10 whereas the mean error the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the significant wave height peak period and peak direction are listed in tables 5 to 8 exposed locations breisundet d and outer sulafjorden a at the two most exposed locations breisundet d and outer sulafjorden a the highest measured significant wave height is equal to approximately 6 m and 4 m respectively figs 7 and 8 the time series indicate that the six model setups under consideration give similar results with the significant wave height being either overestimated or underestimated for the same periods in december 2018 the modelled h s is lower than observations for a time period of 3 days similar to what is seen at fauskane for the wam 800 model there are also times were the models overestimate the significant wave height at breisundet and outer sulafjorden such as the first week of march 2019 and toward the end of may 2019 in fact for all model setups there is a positive bias at both breisundet and at outer sulafjorden at breisundet the mean error ranges from 0 06 m to 0 10 m for the four coastex setups with the highest values obtained for data derived from a single peaked offshore wave spectrum and the full plane version of stwave the mean absolute error and the root mean square error are in the range 0 26 m to 0 28 m and 0 34 m to 0 36 m with values being slightly lower when two peaks are applied to generate the offshore wave spectrum for both the peak direction and peak period the bias is negative for the four coastex versions with me of t p being between 2 4 s and 2 2 s and me of θ p ranging from 8 and 4 differences in mae and rmse of the peak period are small with values in the range 2 3 s to 2 5 s mae and 2 8 s to 3 0 s rmse for the peak direction mae and rmse are largest for results based on the full plane version of stwave with ame equal to 9 full 1pe and 10 full 2pe compared to 7 and 8 for the half plane version results from outer sulafjorden are similar to those from breisundet with all four coastex setups giving positive bias for the significant wave height 0 07 m to 0 08 m and the highest values of me obtained for setups where a single spectral peak is applied the mean absolute error is equal to 0 19 m for all coastex schemes and the root mean square error is equal to 0 24 m and 0 25 m the peak period has a negative bias equal to 2 3 s and 2 2 s and ame and rmse equal to 2 4 s and 2 5 s and 2 8 s and 2 9 s respectively as was also seen at breisundet the peak direction has a negative bias for all coastex setups with values equal to 8 and 7 at the outer sulafjorden there are no differences in mae and rmse with values equal to respectively 8 and 13 also the two control runs westh10 and komen10 have positive bias for the significant wave height at the two most exposed locations with values equal to 0 08 m westh10 and 0 10 m komen10 at breisundet and 0 06 m westh10 and 0 09 m komen10 at outer sulafjorden it is further seen that like the bias also the mean absolute error and root mean square error are lower for westh10 results compared to those of komen10 with values equal to 0 26 m and 0 33 m komen10 and 0 24 m and 0 31 m westh10 at breisundet and 0 19 m and 0 25 m komen10 and 0 17 m and 0 23 m westh10 at outer sulafjorden in contrast to the hindcast data obtained with the coastex method the bias of t p is slightly positive at the two exposed locations with values in the range 0 3 s to 0 6 s both mae and rmse are lower than results based on the coastex method with values equal to 1 3 s and 1 9 s breisundet and 1 5 s and 2 0 s outer sulafjorden sheltered locations inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f the time series of the significant wave height at inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f figs 9 and 10 show that at the two most sheltered locations the significant wave height is considerably lower than at the two exposed locations breisundet and outer sulafjorden with the exception of a short time period of a few hours in january 2019 the observed h s is less than 1 m at both locations during the measurement period at inner sulafjorden the bias of the significant wave height is between 0 01 m and 0 02 m for the four coastex setups whereas komen10 and westh10 give me equal to respectively 0 05 m and 0 0 m the mean absolute error is equal to 0 07 m for all models except westh10 which gives mae equal to 0 05 m and the rmse is equal to 0 09 m for results based on the coastex method and 0 08 m westh10 and 0 10 m komen10 for the two control runs table 7 at the most sheltered location vartdalsfjorden the bias of h s is negative for all setups with values of me ranging from 0 07 m to 0 02 m table 8 highest least negative values are found for the results based on the full plane version of stwave the mean absolute error is equal to respectively 0 08 m and 0 09 m for results based on the full plane and half plane version of stwave and the root mean square error is equal to 0 11 m full plane and 0 12 m half plane whereas the mae and the rmse of the two control runs are equal to respectively 0 07 m and 0 10 m at inner sulafjorden the bias of the hindcast data based on the coastex method are negative with values between 2 6 s and 1 5 s and the lowest bias for results obtained with the half plane version of stwave the two control runs give positive values for me whereas differences between the mae and the rmse are relatively low with the mae being in the range 2 8 s to 3 3 s and the rmse 3 6 s and 4 4 s in contrast for the peak direction me ranges from 9 to 11 where the hindcast data obtained with the coastex method give positive bias for the peak direction both the mean absolute error and the root mean square error are larger at the two sheltered locations compared to breisundet and outer sulafjorden with values of mae ranging from 34 to 52 at inner sulafjorden and from 48 to 63 at vartdalsfjorden 4 discussion the coastex wave calculation method is developed as an alternative to traditional wave models where the progression of the wave field is calculated from an initial state wind forcing and the wave spectra at the open boundaries instead we compute the wave field from a set of offshore sea states and wind conditions where most of the calculations are made before the hindcast forecast is initiated in the case of hindcast data the number of model runs with the stwave model is determined by the number of sea states cases included in the coastex setup rather than the total number of time steps in the hindcast period because the coastex method significantly reduces the computational time for long time series a high resolution model grid can be applied this allows the model setup to include the effect of islets narrow banks and strong bathymetry gradients on the computed wave field the method relies on several assumptions including homogenous homogeneous wave conditions at the open boundaries spatially constant winds in the model domain and that ocean waves and locally wind generated waves can be calculated separately in the north sea and the norwegian sea large scale weather systems with horizontal scales of 100 150 km prevails barstad and grønås 2005 this indicates that for relatively small model domains the assumption of homogenous homogeneous boundary conditions is usually valid in the presence of complex terrain there may still be considerable variations in the wind field especially in fjord systems where topographic effects may modify both the wind speed and the wind direction christakos et al 2020 the wind measurements show that in sulafjorden a and c and in vartdalsfjorden f the wind is predominately aligned with the fjord which indicates that locally wind generated waves should be computed from several different input data points and not only from the offshore wind field however at present the applied wind data cannot resolve the observed wind gradients and we have therefore applied a single input data point from section 3 2 it is found that in vartdalsfjorden f where the wave field is determined solely by locally wind generated waves all model setups underestimate the significant wave height since the effect of spatially varying winds is included in the two control runs expanding the number of wind input data points in the coastex setups is not expected to improve the results in fact compared to the control runs the bias is lower for data based on the full plane version of the stwave model although the mean absolute error is somewhat higher we have further assumed that the contribution to the wave spectrum from locally wind generated waves and propagating offshore waves can be calculated separately this is done by restricting locally wind generated waves to areas not directly exposed to incoming offshore waves and therefore wave growth at offshore grid points in the model domain is neglected unless the wave field is developing rapidly from a state of rest we expect that for relatively small model domains wave growth over short distances will be insignificant compared to the offshore waves propagating shoreward in contrast to inner sulafjorden c and vartdalsfjorden f both the coastex setups and the control runs appear to overestimate h s at the two most exposed locations breisundet d and outer sulafjorden a toward open waters the significant wave height becomes increasingly more affected by the accuracy of the incoming ocean waves and the positive bias may be related to deviations between the observed and modelled offshore wave spectrum at fauskane the agreement between h s from wam 800 and observations is high whereas differences in wave direction are apparent with modelled waves to a greater extent being directed toward the fjord opening at the positions most influenced by propagating ocean waves breisundet and outer sulafjorden we may therefore expect the modelled significant wave height to be overestimated applying two spectral peaks for the offshore boundary data slightly reduces the mean absolute error whereas the bias increases since the high frequency part of the offshore wave spectrum deviates considerably from observations the inclusion of two spectral peaks for the offshore spectrum will not significantly improve the model results compared to the two control runs the coastex method appears to underestimate the peak period at the two most exposed locations breisundet and outer sulafjorden here also the mean absolute error and root mean square error are larger than values obtained with the swan model at the two most sheltered locations inner sulafjorden and vartdalsfjorden where the sea state is more dominated by locally wind generated waves the error estimates are similar to those of the two control runs and the deviations from observations at the most exposed locations may therefore be caused by not including enough peak periods in the set of included wave calculations for the peak direction at the exposed locations the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the results based on the coastex method and the swan runs are similar indicating that the directional resolution in the coastex setup is sufficient at the two most sheltered locations the peak direction is found to deviate more from the observed wave direction which may result from the applied wind data not being able to resolve the observed wind gradients for the hindcast period under consideration the modelled significant wave heights based on the coastex procedure are similar to the results based on the komen wind package in terms of mean error mean absolute error and root mean square error and slightly higher compared to the hindcast data based on the westhuysen package the major advantage of the coastex method is in the time needed to generate the time series to compute the stwave wave data included in the set of predefined sea states on a hp workstation with 8 inteli9 cores takes approximately 2 5 days whereas the time needed to generate the time series of wave parameters at the four nearshore locations for the 257 days time period hindcast period is 30 min for the two control runs komen10 and westh10 the model is run using the openmp version of swan with eight computational threads on four 3 40 ghz cores intel core i7 2600 to generate a hindcast time series of 257 days with this set up takes approximately 54 days although the computational time may be reduced by increasing the number of threads results from parallel computing experiments indicate that in the case of a single computational node the time saving ratio is nearly constant when the number of threads exceeds 20 rautenbach et al 2021 for high resolution swan simulations rautenbach et al found that when the model was run using the message passing interface mpi on 20 threads the computational time was about 65 compared to openmp set ups on 8 threads assuming the same speed up ratio for the breisundet model indicates that to generate a 257 days wave hindcast requires more than 35 days computational time to compute the wave forecast presented at the barentswatch portal where the breisundet model area constitutes less than 2 of the total domain included in the forecast would therefore only be feasible by the use of highly resource intensive super computers 5 summary and conclusions in this study the coastex wave calculation procedure is presented four different coastex versions are included based on the half and full plane version of stwave and the offshore wave spectrum being computed with a single or two spectral peaks using wave observations from the west coast of norway and two control runs performed with the swan wave model the coastex method is assessed for our study area the breisundet area coastex results are similar to the results of the control runs in terms of mean error mean absolute error and root mean square error of the significant wave height the major difference between the coastex method and the traditional wave calculation procedure is the time resources needed to generate the hindcast as coastex do not require the use of energy demanding computer clusters whereas the results indicate that coastex is well suited for making high resolution coastal wave hindcast a potential for improving the method exists since the method is highly dependent on the applied input data i e the meps wind field and the wam 800 wave data further improvements of these datasets may also increase the quality of the high resolution wave data whereas the wam 800 model gives highly accurate values for the offshore significant wave height we find that there may be relatively large deviations in the wave direction especially for the high frequency part of the wave spectrum this appears to result in somewhat overestimated wave heights at the most exposed locations near the fjord opening in the most sheltered waters the significant wave height is underestimated in all datasets which may be improved by increasing the spatial resolution of the input wind data to resolve the complex terrain often found in coastal regions credit

23766,the surface roughness of sea ice is highly variable because of the diversity of discrete obstacles to the flow present on the sea ice surface these obstacles result in form drag an effect poorly accounted for in the calculation of surface fluxes over sea ice in climate models in this study we implement in the ocean sea ice model nemo lim3 a variable formulation of the atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients over sea ice that includes the form drag effect we examine the impact of this formulation on the ice cover and ocean surface properties over the past decades in the arctic and antarctic including form drag in the simulations leads to 10 50cm thinner sea ice in the peripheral arctic seas and 10cm thicker sea ice in the antarctic ice pack on annual means form drag significantly impacts summer sea surface temperatures in the marginal ice zone 0 5 to 1 5 c in the arctic and 0 5 c in the antarctic and sea surface salinities under the ice cover 0 52 to 0 89g kg in both polar regions the seasonality of the ocean surface stress under sea ice is reversed with a maximum minimum ocean surface stress under sea ice in summer winter when including form drag however this seasonal reversal is likely too intense in our simulations due to the underestimation of the prescribed mean floe lengths in summer in the arctic the long term declines in sea ice volume and multi year ice are associated with decreasing neutral drag coefficients and negative trends in ocean surface stress in the antarctic the trends in the neutral drag coefficients control the increase decrease in ocean surface stress in the weddell and ross bellingshausen and amundsen seas form drag results in a 22 38 deeper summer mixed layer under polar sea ice and a year long 10 25m deeper mixed layer in the central arctic all these impacts on the ocean surface properties demonstrate the relevance of form drag for polar ocean modelling keywords sea ice model ocean general circulation model

seventies arctic sea ice has become thinner kwok 2018 younger maslanik et al 2011 and smaller in extent serreze and meier 2018 the mean arctic sea ice drift speed has substantially increased over the past decades rampal et al 2009 tandon et al 2018 lipatov et al 2021 due to the decline in sea ice concentration and thickness olason and notz 2014 tandon et al 2018 these changes in the arctic sea ice cover have occurred in all seasons stroeve and notz 2018 on the other hand antarctic sea ice has been unexpectedly expanding comiso et al 2017 until recently with a reversal in 2014 parkinson 2019 followed by an absolute record low sea ice extent minimum in february 2022 understanding these contrasting trends and regional aspects remains an open question in both model rackow et al 2022 and observational studies fogt et al 2022 reconstructed and modelled antarctic sea ice states show a significant thickening of the sea ice cover in the weddell and ross seas but a thinning in the bellingshausen and amundsen ba seas massonnet et al 2013 holland et al 2014 changes in local winds explain most of the observed long term trends in sea ice drift around antarctica kwok et al 2017 sea ice plays a critical role in redistributing heat momentum and freshwater between the atmosphere and the ocean at high latitudes surface flux anomalies in those regions impact the large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations and thus can affect the global climate the turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum over sea ice are highly dependent on the top and bottom ice surface roughnesses these two roughnesses exert a drag on the mean air and seawater flows respectively in turn drag generates perturbation in the mean flow in the vicinity of the surface these perturbations influence the mixing of scalar properties such as horizontal flow speed temperature or humidity consequently the knowledge of the drag over sea ice helps our understanding of the effects of atmosphere ocean ice interactions in polar regions arya 1973 introduced the concept of drag partitioning over sea ice to account for the effects of small scale roughness skin drag and discrete obstacles to the flow of air form drag since then the modelling community has benefited from numerous developments relating the atmospheric drag coefficients to the morphology of the ice surface arya 1975 hanssen bauer and gjessing 1988 garbrecht et al 2002 birnbaum and lüpkes 2002 lüpkes and birnbaum 2005 lüpkes et al 2012 lüpkes et al 2012 provided a hierarchy of formulas parameterizing the atmospheric neutral drag coefficients over sea ice based on physical concepts the drag partitioning method of arya 1973 has been successfully adapted to ocean drag coefficient parameterizations lu et al 2011 this method has paved the way for comprehensive frameworks that provide the atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients over sea ice as a function of sea ice properties the scheme of steiner 2001 calculates the drag coefficients over sea ice from the deformation energy and the sea ice concentration tsamados et al 2014 proposed a parameterization based on an idealized floe schematic that connects the drag coefficients to ice surface features this latter scheme includes the effect of floe edges surface ridges or ice sails and keels melt pond edges and skin drag including form drag in sea ice models leads to significant spatial and temporal differences in the simulated arctic sea ice thickness and drift tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 ponsoni et al 2021 as shown by martin et al 2016 form drag results in a negative trend in the annual mean ocean surface stress under the arctic sea ice cover over the period 1980 2013 this trend contrasts with the moderate increase of this diagnostic when using constant drag coefficients martin et al 2014 2016 the conclusions of martin et al 2016 need to be confirmed with an interactive ocean and sea ice model setup as these authors relied on a climatological dataset to prescribe ocean surface currents additionally form drag can alter the characteristics of the mixed layer in the arctic tsamados et al 2015 castellani et al 2018 noted a net increase in the summer mean sea surface salinity and mixed layer depth in the arctic when using the form drag scheme of steiner 2001 with the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm numerical experiments carried out with the hadley centre global environment model version 3 hadgem3 support evidence of an impact of form drag on the large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations in the arctic ponsoni et al 2021 the main objective of this paper is to examine the sensitivity of the sea ice state and the ocean surface properties to the form drag over sea ice in the antarctic and arctic polar regions the intents are two fold 1 revisiting past model studies incorporating a form drag formulation for the arctic sea ice tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 and 2 taking advantage of our developments to investigate the effects of the form drag in the antarctic for the first time we address the analysis of the effects of form drag over sea ice in both polar regions our model study benefits from our global and fully coupled ocean sea ice model setup a refined vertical grid for the ocean model and an extended period of 40 years for the analysis these allow us to investigate the importance of form drag for polar sea ice and the ocean surface properties in sea ice covered regions we describe the methodology of this study in section 2 we validate the modelled sea ice and investigate its sensitivity to the form drag in section 3 1 in section 3 2 we discuss the representation of the form drag in the model next we examine the effects of form drag on the ocean surface properties under polar sea ice in section 3 3 lastly we summarize our remarks and conclude in section 4 2 methods and data 2 1 the modelling framework nemo lim3 and form drag over sea ice in this study we make use of the modelling framework nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo version 3 6 stable svn revision 7169 to couple the océan parallélisé opa ocean model with the louvain la neuve sea ice model version 3 lim3 opa is a finite difference hydrostatic primitive equation model madec et al 2017 using the boussinesq approximation lim3 is a state of the art thermodynamic dynamic sea ice model vancoppenolle et al 2009 rousset et al 2015 lim3 features notably a discrete subgrid scale ice thickness distribution itd thorndike et al 1975 an elastic viscous plastic evp rheology formulation hunke and dukowicz 1997 and an energy conserving thermodynamic model bitz and lipscomb 1999 our version of lim3 includes a lateral ice melt scheme based on the prescription of the mean floe length l f of lüpkes et al 2012 1 l f a l m i n a a a β where l m i n and l m a x are constant parameters related to the minimum 8m and maximum 300m floe lengths respectively a is the ice concentration the parameter a prevents a singularity when the ice concentration tends to zero a 1 1 l m i n l m a x 1 β eq 1 also prescribes the mean floe length in the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 according to lüpkes et al 2012 β 0 3 is more representative of sea ice conditions in the antarctic and western fram strait whereas β 1 4 better reflects sea ice conditions in eastern fram strait these different values for β highlight the limit of such formulation as eq 1 cannot express the full range of variability of the observed floe lengths we use this formulation as a first order method to represent the change in floe length across the marginal ice zone as a function of sea ice concentration we set the coefficient β equal to 0 5 as in the study of tsamados et al 2014 the atmospheric forcing follows the protocol of the second experiment from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core ii griffies et al 2009 as implemented in nemo lim3 madec et al 2017 bulk formulas define the wind stress τ a x the latent q e a x and sensible q h a x turbulent heat fluxes across the atmosphere

humidity and θ a z the air temperature at height z 2 m q x is the specific humidity and θ x the temperature at the surface ocean or sea ice the transfer coefficients for momentum c d a x latent c e a

additionally the wind velocity is assumed to exceed ocean surface currents u a u o and sea ice drift u a u i the formalism of large and yeager 2004 2008 prescribes the transfer coefficients at the atmosphere ocean interface as well as stability coefficients to account for atmospheric stratification effects over the open water fraction in the case of sea ice the transfer coefficients are set constant in the default configuration of nemo lim3 as a second formulation we prescribe the transfer coefficients over sea ice using the variable formulation of the atmospheric neutral drag coefficients of tsamados et al 2014 contrary to this study we do not consider stability effects in the atmospheric boundary layer over sea ice lastly nemo lim3 does not include stability effects in the ocean boundary layer neither for open water nor under sea ice the turbulent fluxes of momentum τ i o and heat q i o at the ice ocean interface subscript i o are prescribed using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 τ i o ρ w c w u i u o u i u o 6 q i o ρ w c w c h u i o θ i b o t t o m s s t u i u o where ρ w is the density of seawater θ i b o t t o m is the basal temperature of sea ice c h is a constant ocean heat transfer coefficient equal to 5 7 10 3 and c w is an oceanic drag coefficient the oceanic drag coefficient is either set constant or prescribed using the variable oceanic neutral drag coefficient formulation of tsamados et al 2014 the expression of q i o depends on the friction velocity u i o which uses the ice ocean root mean square velocity difference vancoppenolle et al 2009 the ocean surface stress τ o c e is computed as τ o c e 1 a τ a o a τ i o large and yeager 2008 rousset et al 2015 the ocean surface heat flux including q i o is calculated using the same ice concentration averaging method the implementation of the variable neutral drag coefficients over sea ice of tsamados et al 2014 in our setup is closely related to the implementation of this formalism in the icepack sea ice column model hunke et al 2021 part of the cice consortium see the supplementary material of this manuscript for a comprehensive list of the parameters and values used in the form drag formalism this formalism decomposes the atmospheric andc and oceanic ondc neutral drag coefficients c d a and c d w into the sum of individual form drag contributions associated with discrete obstacles to the flow of air or seawater 7 c d a c d a r d g c d a f l o e c d a s k i n c d a p n d 8 c d w c d w r d g c d w f l o e c d w s k i n the subscripts a and w are related to the

and c d w s k i n and melt pond edges c d a p n d melt ponds have no impact on the oceanic neutral drag coefficients to help the reader fig 1 presents a schematic showing the idealized floe of tsamados et al 2014 its relation with the form and skin drag coefficients as well as the turbulent fluxes of momentum latent and sensible heat exchanged between the atmosphere ocean sea ice systems the transfer coefficients for momentum latent and sensible heat fluxes at the atmosphere ice interface in eqs 2 4 are set equal to the neutral drag coefficient c d a assuming identical values for these coefficients c d a i c e a i c h a i c d a direct measurements of the atmospheric transfer coefficient over sea ice suggest smaller transfer coefficients for latent and sensible heat fluxes than for momentum schröder 2003 we leave the question of the effect of such inequality in the transfer coefficients open for future studies the oceanic drag coefficient at the ocean ice interface in eqs 5 and 6 is set equal to the neutral drag coefficient c w c d w the general expression of the form drag coefficients derives from the monin obukhov similarity theory assuming a logarithmic fluid velocity profile hanssen bauer and gjessing 1988 this expression is valid for both the ocean and the atmosphere and assumes no coriolis forces one can define this expression assuming no coriolis effect and for a reference level of 10m as 9 c d x f o r m 1 2 c s c 2 h d a ln h z 0 ln 10 z 0 2 where the superscript f o r m corresponds to the form drag contribution of ridges f o r m r d g floes f o r m f l o e or melt ponds f o r m p n d the subscript x is either for the air a or seawater w mediums c is a constant local form drag coefficient set to 0 20 in this study more recently zu et al 2021 recommended 0 57 for the local form drag coefficient of keels used in c d w r d g h is the height of the obstacles sails keels floe or melt pond edges and d is the distance separating them z 0 represents the

f l o e a p 1 10 β p n d where a p is the melt pond concentration we keep the sheltering function selected by tsamados et al 2014 for the contributions due to ridges sails and keels however we select the formulation of lüpkes et al 2012 adopted in the icepack model hunke et al 2021 regarding the sheltering functions for floe and melt pond edges these later two sheltering functions use the power coefficient β of the prescribed floe length equation eq 1 to better reflect the changes in floe length with the ice concentration lastly the general expression of the surface skin drag coefficients is 11 c d x s k i n a 1 m x h d c if h d 1 m x where m x is an atmospheric x a or oceanic x o skin drag parameter assumed constant here and c is the unobstructed skin drag coefficient h d is the ratio of the ridge height sails or keels over the distance between ridges sails or keels in our model setup the reference depth in the expression of the ocean form drag coefficients is 10m even though the ocean surface currents are defined at 0 5m depth roy et al 2015 advise against such a reference depth when the vertical resolution of the ocean model near the surface is sufficiently high 1m to resolve the planetary boundary layer of the ocean based on this study our simulations likely overestimate arctic sea ice drift roy et al 2015 proposed a method to better account for the vertical ocean velocity profile near the surface in the ocean drag definition this method may lead to numerical instabilities due to the increase in the calculated ocean drag coefficients they reduced the time step of their ocean model to 600s to solve this issue we faced similar numerical instabilities when implementing form drag in nemo lim3 because of the variability of the drag coefficients we lowered the time step of the ocean sea ice model to 900s 5400s to ensure numerical stability changing the reference depth from 10m to 0 5m in the general form drag expression eq 9 is equivalent to multiplying the ocean form drag contributions associated with keels and floes by a factor of two this would further alter the stability of the model therefore more work is needed to reconcile the definition of the variable drag coefficients with the reference depth of the ocean surface currents while maintaining the model stability in the meantime this discrepancy does not question the ability of the model to simulate the variability in the neutral drag coefficients 2 2 intermediate sea ice variables to evaluate c d a and c d w the variables needed are the freeboard h f and the draft h d of the floes the distance between floes d f the melt pond size l p and the elevation of the ice surface relative to the melt pond surface h p moreover ice ridges consist of surface ridges also named sails and bottom surface ridges or keels thus the evaluation of the neutral drag coefficients additionally requires the distance between sails d s and keels d k and the vertical height of these obstacles the sail height h s and keel depth h k have for reference the ice surface and bottom surface elevation respectively hunke et al 2021 we obtain these by subtracting the freeboard draft height from the sail keel height h f and h d are calculated from the hydrostatic balance using the mean volume of snow v s and ice v i per grid cell melt ponds are supposed to be at equilibrium with the ocean surface h p h f with no effect on the hydrostatic balance of the floes this assumption is justified in the arctic as melt ponds are above sea level only during the first weeks of their onsets eicken 2002 we keep this assumption unchanged in the southern hemisphere in the absence of observational evidence drafts may exceed the ice thickness when the mass of snow is sufficiently large to submerge the ice surface below sea level flooding of the ice surface is frequent in the antarctic e g after important snowfall events on relatively thin ice when flooding occurs a fraction of snow is converted to ice in the hydrostatic balance so that the draft equals the ice thickness leppäranta 1983 tsamados et al 2014 estimate d s d k h s and h k by identifying the simulated deformed ice volume and concentration to the total volume and area of sails and keels per grid cell using an idealized floe schematic see figure 1 of tsamados et al 2014 to estimate the deformed ice quantities we have implemented tracers of level ice volume and concentration in lim3 these tracers represent the quantities of sea ice that have not undergone ridging or rafting events the difference between the ice volume concentration and the tracer of level ice volume concentration is defined to be equal to the deformed ice volume concentration following tsamados et al 2014 we set the ratio of the keel depth to sail height equal to 4 this ratio is within the 3 5 4 5 range for the most frequent maximum keel depth to sail height ratio strub klein and sudom 2012 in the antarctic tin and jeffries 2003 estimated a keel to sail ratio of 5 6 1 8 we set the distance between keels equal to the distance between sails based on tsamados et al 2014 it excludes rubble piles and widow ridges i e keels without associated sails rubble piles have extremely low keel depth to width ratios compared to other ice ridge types tin and jeffries 2003 thus the surface skin contribution is more appropriate for accounting for the effect of rubble piles we select 22 for the slope angle of sails and keels in the implementation of the form drag formalism tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 hunke et al 2021 using the idealized floe schematic of tsamados et al 2014 and the mean width to height ratios from strub klein and sudom 2012 we find that keel slope angles are 22 and sail slope angles are 28 for arctic first year ice ridges tin and jeffries 2003 estimated keel slope angles of 15 8 and sail slope angles of 10 5 in the southern ocean the porosity of sea ice is set to 0 30 in lim3 based on in situ observations leppäranta et al 1995 høyland 2002 this value is larger than the one selected by tsamados et al 2014 for the form drag however we keep the default value from lim3 for sea ice porosity to avoid discrepancies between the simulated deformed ice quantities and the total volume and area of sails and keels identified from the idealized floe schematic of tsamados et al 2014 d f is calculated by assuming periodically distributed square floes lüpkes and birnbaum 2005 tsamados et al 2014 this method requires the floe length here prescribed by eq 1 lastly the so called topographic scheme parameterizes melt ponds in the model flocco et al 2010 sterlin et al 2021 the refreezing mechanism for melt ponds is given by holland et al 2012 using the refreezing temperature threshold of 0 15 c instead of 2 00 c the melt pond scheme provides the melt pond area fraction which is the argument of the equation for l p lüpkes et al 2012 equation 45 2 3 experimental design we perform two simulations with a global configuration of nemo lim3 from 1958 to 2019 the analysis is restricted to the last 40 years of this period to exclude spin up effects unless otherwise stated the first experiment form takes the variable neutral drag coefficients of tsamados et al 2014 to calculate the transfer coefficients over sea ice the second experiment skin uses constant drag coefficients over sea ice these constants are determined as the global means of the variable neutral drag coefficients simulated in the form run and weighted by the sea ice area over 1980 2019 the constant drag coefficients in the skin run are c d a 1 49 10 3 and c d w 6 71 10 3 as for a comparison the standard drag coefficients in lim3 are 1 40 10 3 and 5 0 10 3 for c d a and c d w respectively this choice of coefficients for the skin run allows investigating the effect of form drag rather than the differences between the form run and the standard configuration of lim3 the ocean and ice models share the same 1 curvilinear tripolar horizontal orca grid from madec and imbard 1996 this horizontal grid has a cell edge length of 112km at the equator down to 46km in the arctic ocean the vertical grid includes 75 levels in partial step z coordinates the vertical resolution of this grid decreases from 1m at the ocean surface down to 200m near the ocean floor following a double hyperbolic tangent function we select the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 to provide the atmospheric surface variables required by core ii jra 55 is a sub daily 3h high resolution 55km atmospheric reanalysis based on a 4d var data assimilation scheme performed by the japan meteorological agency this reanalysis produced reasonable representations of sea ice in polar regions using the same model configuration as ours barthélemy et al 2017 sterlin et al 2021 the reader is redirected to the study of sterlin et al 2021 for a complete description of the present model configuration 2 4 observations we evaluate the simulated sea ice concentrations in the form and skin runs against the sea ice concentrations from nimbus 7 smmr and dmsp ssm i ssmis passive microwave data product cavalieri et al 1996 the national snow and ice data center nsidc references this dataset as the nsidc 0051 product this dataset is constructed using the nasa team algorithm we assess the representation of the sea ice drift in nemo lim3 with version 4 1 of the polar pathfinder daily 25km ease grid sea ice motion vectors product tschudi et al 2019 hereafter referred to as the nsidc 0116 product one may attempt to correct the meridional drift bias in the nsidc 0116 product by multiplying the ice velocities by a factor of 1 4 haumann et al 2016 however the nsidc 0116 product remains subject to uncertainties that a constant factor cannot alone solve particularly during summer sumata et al 2015 further the errors in this product are greater when 1 the ice concentrations are lower 2 the ice thicknesses are smaller 3 the ice speeds are higher sumata et al 2014 this strongly suggests regional differences in the uncertainties of the nsidc 0116 product the qualities of the nsidc 0116 product are the long term daily frequency ice drift vector components interpolated on an eulerian grid the simulated effective sea ice thicknesses or ice thicknesses and the total sea ice volumes from nemo lim3 are evaluated against the pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assimilation system piomas and global ice ocean modeling and assimilation system giomas products zhang 2014 piomas and giomas are not pure observational products but reanalyzes of the ocean and ice systems the former assimilates observed sea ice concentrations and sea surface temperatures in the arctic whereas the latter is a global model assimilating only observed sea ice concentrations uncertainties in the piomas dataset are relatively well studied schweiger et al 2011 giomas likely inherits from some of piomas s biases as the two share the same assimilation system shi et al 2021 liao et al 2022 the knowledge of these uncertainties and the consistent approach to reconstructing the sea ice thickness over the past decades are valuable assets for our analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 sea ice state 3 1 1 sea ice concentration and total sea ice area the mean seasonal cycle of the arctic sea ice area sia is relatively well represented in the form and skin runs compared to the nsidc 0051 product cavalieri et al 1996 as shown in fig 2 a but with some differences detailed below nemo lim3 underestimates overestimates the arctic sia in summer winter by 15 to 27 12 compared to the nsidc 0051 product further the seasonal minimum in arctic sia is simulated two to three weeks in advance of the nsidc 0051 observations these issues are common to other model studies conducted with nemo lim3 and using a similar model setup to ours e g vancoppenolle et al 2009 docquier et al 2017 massonnet et al 2019 on the other hand nemo lim3 simulates the position of the ice edge here defined as the 15 ice concentration line reasonably well in the arctic fig 3 c uncertainties in the atmospheric forcing likely explain minor spatial differences between the simulated and observed sea ice concentrations in the arctic sterlin et al 2021 in the antarctic the timing of the mean seasonal cycles of the simulated sia is in phase with the observed one from the nsidc 0051 product fig 2 b nemo lim3 simulates the spatial distribution of the sea ice concentration in the antarctic relatively well fig 3 b the two model runs overestimate the sea ice concentration in most of the antarctic ice pack fig 3 c this bias was reported for simulations using various atmospheric forcings barthélemy et al 2017 and previous model versions of nemo lim3 vancoppenolle et al 2009 massonnet et al 2019 lastly our model configuration does not allow the resolution of the extrema in sea ice concentration along the coastline of antarctica the poor representation of katabatic winds in the atmospheric forcing kobayashi et al 2015 the coarse model resolution in coastal regions and the lack of land fast ice and coastal polynyas in the simulations nihashi and ohshima 2015 prevent the representation of such extrema in sea ice concentration table 1 presents the interdecadal trends in sia in the arctic and antarctic and specific regions of the southern ocean the indian sector is enclosed by the longitudes 20 e and 90 e and the pacific sector by the longitudes 90 e and 150 e the annual mean arctic sia calculated from the nsidc 0051 product steadily declined over 1980 2019 at the rate of 0 59 106 km2 per decade both runs capture the observed decline in arctic sia and its statistical significance correctly on the contrary the interdecadal trends in the observed antarctic sea ice extent are regional and weakly positive turner et al 2015 comiso et al 2017 the observed sea ice extent increased in the ross and weddell seas but decreased in the bellingshausen and amundsen ba seas over the past decades nemo lim3 reproduces the main characteristics of the regional and pan antarctic long term trends in sia the simulated trends in sia in the ross sea are significantly positive and approximately three times greater than the equivalent trend from the nsidc 0051 product the associated changes in the simulated sea ice concentration impact principally the marginal ice zone miz of the antarctic ice pack not shown where passive microwave remote sensing is prone to errors cavalieri et al 1996 the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients in nemo lim3 leads to only minor differences in terms of the simulated sia and sea ice concentration the mean seasonal cycles of the arctic sia in the form and skin runs differ in summer by a few 0 54 106 km2 fig 2 a the spatial distribution of the annual mean arctic sea ice concentration exhibits few differences between the two runs fig 3 e in the antarctic during wintertime the sia from the form run is slightly larger than the one from the skin run fig 2 b the sea ice concentration in the antarctic miz is moderately higher when including form drag fig 3 f lastly the trends in sia are nearly identical in the two simulations table 1 3 1 2 sea ice thickness and total sea ice volume the mean seasonal cycles in the arctic of the total sea ice volume siv reconstructed by piomas and giomas and simulated by nemo lim3 are comparable in summer and autumn fig 4 a the differences are significant only in winter and spring in october the differences in arctic siv from nemo lim3 and piomas are less than the uncertainty of 1 35 103 km3 given for the piomas product schweiger et al 2011 the march siv from the form run is 2 7 103 km3 greater than the siv from piomas this difference slightly exceeds the piomas uncertainty of 2 25 103 km3 schweiger et al 2011 giomas is less constrained by observations than piomas as such fig 4 a gives the seasonal climatology of the arctic siv from the giomas dataset only as an indication in the southern ocean the simulated siv replicates the climatology from the giomas dataset fig 4 b with two noticeable differences the nemo lim3 seasonal minimum in siv is approximately 60 times larger than in giomas the simulated winter maxima are lagged by one month compared to giomas piomas and giomas are not pure observations as these products rely on models with similar physics to nemo lim3 to reconstruct the sea ice state the simulated seasonal cycles of the siv from our two runs are consistent with barthélemy et al 2017 the latter authors selected the jra 55 atmospheric reanalysis to force nemo lim3 as in the present study additionally the differences between giomas and nemo lim3 are similar to the past results from massonnet et al 2019 the spatial distribution of the simulated arctic sea ice thickness sea ice volumes per grid cell area is relatively realistic fig 5 a and compares well with the principal arctic sea ice thickness observational products wang et al 2016 however the comparison of form with the piomas dataset reveals a difference in the gradient of sea ice thickness in the region of fram strait fig 5 c sensitivity studies conducted with nemo lim3 strongly point to the uncertainties in the atmospheric forcing for explaining this difference sterlin et al 2021 on the other hand observational products show that the reconstructed sea ice from piomas is too thin in the beaufort sea area and too thick north of greenland and the canadian arctic archipelago caa wang et al 2016 these biases in piomas indicate a better agreement of the form run with observations in these regions than one may infer from figs 5 a and 5 c icesat observations between 2003 and 2008 in the southern hemisphere show that sea ice is the thickest in the western regions of the southern ocean and along the coastline of antarctica kurtz and markus 2012 nemo lim3 simulates realistic thick sea ice up to 2m in the western antarctic fig 5 b the modelled sea ice is too thin along the coast of antarctica because of the coarse grid resolution the poor representation of katabatic winds and land fast ice giomas underestimates the ice thickness close to the shore of antarctica but overestimates this quantity away from the shore in the marginal seas liao et al 2022 shi et al 2021 confirmed this issue in the weddell sea these issues explain most of the spatial differences in sea ice thickness between the form run and the giomas product around antarctica fig 5 d the impacts of the neutral drag coefficient formulation on the siv and the mean ice thickness vary between the northern and southern hemispheres in the northern hemisphere the siv simulated in the form run is 1300km3 smaller than in the skin run all year round fig 4 a this difference between the two runs is due to the mean ice thickness in the form run being smaller than in the reference skin run by about 0 1 0 5m in most of the peripheral seas of the central arctic fig 5 e as a result including form drag slightly exacerbates the negative difference in mean ice thickness between the skin run and piomas in the same regions fig 5 c on the other hand the spatial pattern of the differences in arctic sea ice thickness between nemo lim3 and piomas is unchanged by the inclusion of form drag as in the study of tsamados et al 2014 thermodynamical processes rather than sea ice dynamics control the differences in mean ice thickness between our two model runs not shown in the southern hemisphere the mean siv is in winter 1300km3 higher in the form run than in the skin run fig 4 b because of thicker sea ice in the miz and a more consolidated ice pack fig 5 f these differences in ice thickness between the two runs are less significant in summer and early winter not shown additionally the sea ice thickness in the ba seas between 60 w to 120 w from the form run is smaller than in the skin run all year round fig 5 f evidence from submarine sonars and satellite altimeters shows a thinning of the sea ice cover and a decline in the arctic siv since 1958 kwok 2018 the trend in the annual mean siv from the piomas dataset is 3 13 103 km3 over 1980 2019 table 2 with an estimated uncertainty of 1 103 km3 per decade schweiger et al 2011 the simulated trends in annual mean arctic siv from the skin and form runs are close and within the uncertainty range of this trend from the piomas dataset table 2 the decline in arctic siv from icesat and cryosat 2 satellite observations 2003 2018 is 2 87 103 and 5 13 103 km3 per decade in winter and fall respectively kwok 2018 neither piomas nor nemo lim3 reproduces the observed trend in fall from the icesat and cryosat 2 satellite observations the lifespan of these satellite platforms is relatively short 15 years in total compared to the four decade long trends presented in table 2 the 2007 record minimum in sea ice extent and the associated loss in the myi area heavily influence the time series of icesat kwok 2018 the long term trend in the annual mean siv from the giomas dataset is positive in the southern hemisphere but not statistically significant table 2 in addition to the giomas product massonnet et al 2013 performed a similar model reconstruction of the antarctic sea ice thickness using an ensemble kalman filter to assimilate the ice concentration although these authors showed a positive trend in the pan antarctic siv over the past decades they pointed to high temporal variability in the time series of siv and regional dissimilarities in the calculated trends in siv we find a good correspondence between the regional trends in the antarctic siv from the form and skin runs their statistical significance and those of massonnet et al 2013 these are gains in the annual mean siv in the weddell and ross seas but a decline in the siv in the ba seas table 2 while there is good agreement in the weddell sea on the sign of the trends in siv across most modelling studies massonnet et al 2013 holland et al 2014 zhang 2014 the changes in the ross and ba seas are less clear the interpretation of the trends in siv in the ross and ba seas is complicated by the pronounced spatial heterogeneity of the local trends in sea ice thickness holland et al 2014 3 1 3 sea ice drift and speed to compute the mean ice speeds shown in fig 6 we follow the method of tandon et al 2018 this method uses daily ice drift vector components to include sub monthly variations in the ice drift direction these variations have a non negligible impact on the monthly mean ice speeds docquier et al 2017 tandon et al 2018 as the timescale for changes in the sea ice drift direction is on the order of 5 days rampal et al 2009 in the northern hemisphere the means are further restricted to the central arctic avoiding coastal areas within 150km of the shore see figure 1 of tandon et al 2018 this spatial domain aims to be representative of the ice drift in the arctic ice pack sea ice in the southern ocean is essentially seasonal therefore we only exclude coastal areas within 150km of the coast to compute the mean ice speed in the antarctic lastly the means from the two model runs are for regions where the ice concentration is at least 15 observations from the international arctic buoy programme iabp show a seasonal maximum in mean sea ice speeds in september october when sea ice is thinner olason and notz 2014 this seasonality is barely seen in the nsidc 0116 observational product fig 6 a this nsidc 0116 bias is linked to the large uncertainties occurring during the melt season in the measured sea ice drift sumata et al 2015 nemo lim3 simulates a seasonal maximum in sea ice speed in july august when the simulated ice pack tends to a free drift state fig 6 a the timing of the minimum in arctic sia from nemo lim3 is likely responsible for such a difference with the iabp observations the simulated minimum in mean ice speed occurs in april when sea ice is seasonally thickest the general shapes of the seasonal cycles of fig 6 a comply with the past study of docquier et al 2017 albeit the magnitudes of the mean ice speed are higher in our form and skin runs than in that study as for docquier et al 2017 our configuration of nemo lim3 overestimates the mean sea ice speeds from the nsidc 0116 product in the arctic in the antarctic the ratio of the winter mean sea ice speeds from nemo lim3 and the nsidc 0116 product is close to the meridional sea ice drift correction coefficient of haumann et al 2016 barthélemy et al 2017 reported during the austral summer lower mean antarctic ice speeds than in our simulations fig 6 b we find a significant effect of sub monthly variations in the ice drift direction on the mean ice speed in the southern ocean particularly in summer when sea ice is close to a free drift state these effects explain many differences between fig 6 b and the mean seasonal ice speeds detailed by barthélemy et al 2017 nemo lim3 produces a realistic spatial distribution of the annual mean ice drift in the arctic fig 7 a the spatial extent of the beaufort sea gyre in the form run is smaller than in the nsidc 0116 product fig 7 c the simulated transpolar ice drift follows a path closer to the northern coast of the caa and greenland than the observations however the spatial distribution of the modelled ice drift is in line with other cmip3 and cmip5 models in the arctic kwok 2011 tandon et al 2018 three main atmospheric lows control the three major sea ice drift gyres around antarctica kwok et al 2017 the amundsen sea low drives the ross sea gyre and the sea ice exports to the open ocean around 180 s the riiser larsen sea low at 30 e connects to the weddell sea gyre the davis sea low steers the cyclonic ice motion around 90 e nemo lim3 reproduces these three main ice drift gyres around antarctica fig 7 b the simulated ice drift near the coast of east antarctica is higher than in the nsidc 0116 product fig 7 d additionally the simulated sea ice drift in most of the miz of the southern ocean underestimates the northward component of the observed ice drift this underestimation extends to the interior of the sea ice cover in the atlantic and pacific sectors of the antarctic the modelled trends in the annual mean arctic ice drift speed underestimate the observed trend in this quantity from the nsidc 0116 product table 3 and other studies rampal et al 2009 tandon et al 2018 lipatov et al 2021 this underestimation is present in other cmip5 models and accentuates in summer tandon et al 2018 in the southern hemisphere surface winds have intensified over the past decades leading to an acceleration of the sea ice drift zhang 2014 regional changes in surface winds drive the trends in the sea ice drift in the southern ocean kwok et al 2017 the form run captures the positive trends in the annual mean ice drift speed in the ross and weddell seas these two regions of the southern hemisphere are crucial for sea ice dynamics the simulated trends in the form run are not statistically significant in other areas of the antarctic table 3 in either hemisphere the formulation of the andc and ondc leads to only minor differences in the seasonal climatology of the mean ice drift speed in the ice pack fig 6 the impact of the form drag is small on the direction and magnitude of the annual mean ice motion vectors figs 7 e and 7 f this small impact complies with the past results from castellani et al 2018 the relative differences in the yearly mean ice speeds are less than 10 in the central arctic and antarctic ice pack the representation of the trend in arctic sea ice drift speeds degrades compared to the observations when including form drag table 3 the differences in the regional trends in this diagnostic suggest a long term effect of the form drag on the sea ice drift we advise examining this form drag effect jointly with the ice strength parameterization e g chikhar et al 2019 3 2 form drag over sea ice 3 2 1 total atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients the seasonal cycles of the mean andc and ondc from the form run share some common properties between the northern and southern hemispheres fig 8 the mean neutral drag coefficients are maximum during the melt season and minimum during freezing months the seasonality of the mean andc and ondc are nearly symmetrical because of the formulation of the individual form drag contributions the contribution from melt pond edges is the only term in the formulation of the form drag without effects on the ondc the spatial distributions in the arctic of the annual mean andc fig 9 a and ondc fig 9 b are related to the sea ice thickness fig 5 a indeed arctic regions with thicker sea ice tend to have higher neutral drag coefficients than other regions with thinner sea ice in winter martin et al 2016 the spatial distributions in the antarctic of the annual mean andc fig 9 c and ondc fig 9 c confirm this correspondence with the sea ice thickness fig 5 b in the southern hemisphere the neutral drag coefficients are highest in the ba seas and parts of the ross and weddell seas where sea ice is also thickest on average in situ measurements of the andc fluctuate highly following the region the time of the year and the surface aspect of sea ice guest and davidson 1991 andreas et al 2010 andc are approximately 1 2 10 3 to 3 1 10 3 over first year ice 1 1 10 3 to 2 7 10 3 in the miz and 1 2 10 3 to 6 7 10 3 over multiyear ice myi guest and davidson 1991 schröder 2003 moreover the spatial and temporal variability of the andc is high castellani et al 2014 cole et al 2017 heorton et al 2019 petty et al 2017 produced pan arctic estimates of the andc for early spring by combining observations from icebridge topography data and existing form drag parameterizations garbrecht et al 2002 lüpkes et al 2012 castellani et al 2014 these estimates correspond to those simulated in the arctic in the form run fig 9 a the canonical value for the ondc is usually 5 5 10 3 based on measurements collected in the beaufort sea during the aidjex campaign mcphee 1980 this value is more representative of winter sea ice conditions and myi sea ice floes in general ondc observations are restricted to certain sea ice conditions for safety and logistical reasons this makes comparisons between observations and model results challenging in the form run the december january february mean ondc in the beaufort sea varies between 3 10 3 and 5 10 3 the constant ondc used in the skin run is 6 71 10 3 this constant represents the global mean ondc weighted by the sea ice concentration when including form drag in our model setup past observations of the ondc fall within the range of 1 10 3 to 20 103 some estimates exceed this range in the beaufort greenland and bering seas shirasawa and ingram 1991 lu et al 2011 more recent ondc estimates confirm this range of values for the ondc shaw et al 2008 cole et al 2014 randelhoff et al 2014 cole et al 2017 kim et al 2017 dewey 2019 heorton et al 2019 therefore the simulated ondc is within the observational uncertainty and is of the same order as the ondc canonical value of mcphee 1980 the values of the andc and ondc from the form run are in relatively good agreement with those from existing pan arctic modelling studies tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 the spatial differences in neutral drag coefficients between these studies and the form run may arise from differences in the representation of the sea ice state the magnitudes of the winter mean andc 1 25 10 3 and ondc 5 0 10 3 simulated in the form run are close to those from tsamados et al 2014 modelling studies tsamados et al 2014 chikhar et al 2019 castellani et al 2018 report various summer mean neutral drag coefficients in the arctic the summer mean ondc from the form run for the arctic regions is closer to the results of martin et al 2016 and chikhar et al 2019 the mean of the variable andc compares better with the study of tsamados et al 2014 these various mean neutral drag coefficients suggest uncertainties in current parameterizations of the drag coefficients during the melt season as stated by brenner et al 2021 the annual mean andc and ondc from the form run experience negative trends in the arctic except locally in the chukchi sea figs 10 a and 10 b the spatial distribution of these trends is consistent with the model results of tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 showed negative trends in the mean arctic ondc in winter but positive ones in summer in the form run the trends in the arctic neutral drag coefficients strengthen during summer but do not change sign seasonally in the southern hemisphere the trends in the annual mean andc fig 10 c and ondc fig 10 d are regional and statistically significant only in the western sector of the antarctic the form run presents positive trends in the neutral drag coefficients in the ross sea but negative trends in these coefficients in the ba seas according to brenner et al 2021 numerical studies using the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 simulate a maximum in the mean arctic ondc during summer tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 chikhar et al 2019 in contrast with observations in the beaufort sea of a seasonal minimum in late summer and early fall the observed ondcs in the beaufort sea by brenner et al 2021 are principally driven by the form drag contribution associated with ice keels rather than floe edges in summer this contrasts with fig 8 b which shows the opposite for the arctic ice pack eq 1 underestimates the mean floe length in most of the arctic regions bateson 2021 as a result the seasonality of the modelled neutral drag coefficients in the arctic figs 8 a and 8 b are likely overestimated in summer due to excessive contributions from floe edges in the southern ocean floes have smaller sizes notably for antarctic sea ice being surrounded by the ocean and thus exposed to the action of waves thus the underestimation of the mean floe length by eq 1 is probably more limited in antarctic than in the central arctic furthermore β 0 5 selected for this study is closer to the suggested value of 0 3 for the antarctic and western fram strait lüpkes et al 2012 the sensitivity of the neutral drag coefficients to the contribution of floe edges will be discussed in further details in section 3 2 3 observations strongly suggest that our currently used bulk formulation eq 6 overestimates the oceanic heat flux in spring when sea ice melt re stratifies the upper ocean peterson et al 2017 however the ocean stability question remains a challenge for observational studies mcphee 1992 cole et al 2017 in addition we have considered the case for atmospheric neutral stratification over sea ice only despite the importance of the atmospheric stability for the atmosphere ice turbulent fluxes lüpkes and gryanik 2015 accounting for the ocean and atmosphere stability effects should be the focus of future model studies 3 2 2 contributions associated with sails and keels the contributions from sails and keels are a function of the height to distance ratios of sails h s d s and keels h k d k which derive from the deformed ice volume v r d g and area fraction a r d g the greater the deformed ice volume over the deformed ice area v r d g a r d g the greater the aspect ratios of sails and keels and the higher the form drag contributions from sails and keels thus regions exhibiting heavily ridged sea ice tend to have higher form drag contributions associated with sails and keels than areas with thinner and more levelled sea ice in the form run the model simulates thick and highly deformed myi in the western sector of the arctic fig 11 b this sea ice transits from the central arctic to the greenland sea through fram strait in these regions the simulated contribution of sails and keels to the neutral drag coefficients is higher than in the other areas of the arctic these results are in line with other modelling studies tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 antarctic sea ice is more seasonal thinner and less deformed than in the arctic thus the annual means of the form drag contributions from sails and keels are sensibly smaller in the southern hemisphere except in the ba seas and parts of the ross and weddell seas fig 11 f in the latter regions sea ice dynamical processes are more active and yield larger volumes of deformed ice the contributions of sails and keels are more moderate in the antarctic miz because of small sea ice concentrations in the form run the contributions of sails and keels are essential for the monthly mean andc and ondc in winter fig 8 the means of these contributions are maximum in summer because of seasonal changes in the simulated volume fractions of deformed ice in our simulations sea ice after melting is principally composed of ridged ice that has shifted from thick to thinner ice categories thus the simulated height to distances ratios of sails and keels tend to be higher in summer due to large volume fractions of deformed ice the annual means of the form drag contributions from sails and keels to the total neutral drag coefficients have significantly decreased in the arctic over the past decades 0 12 10 3 per decade for c d a r d g and 0 40 10 3 per decade for c d w r d g these changes are linked to the loss of the volume fraction of arctic myi kwok 2018 and the decline in the volume fraction of deformed ice the latter drives the negative trends in the aspect ratios of sails and keels martin et al 2016 indeed the siv and the myi fraction in the arctic reduced during the satellite era kwok 2018 the decline in the fraction arctic of myi is consistent with the decrease in the ratio of the deformed ice volume over the deformed ice area simulated by nemo lim3 in the southern hemisphere local trends in the annual mean deformed ice fraction lead to regional trends in the sail and keel contributions to the neutral drag coefficients the latter is positive in the weddell sea 0 04 10 3 per decade for c d a r d g and 0 22 10 3 per decade for c d w r d g and the northern part of the ross sea but negative in the ba seas 0 05 10 3 per decade for c d a r d g and 0 18 10 3 per decade for c d w r d g in the indian and pacific sectors of the southern ocean the changes in the annual mean deformed ice volume and area fractions are close to zero consequently the sails and keels have no significant impact on the changes in form drag over the past decades in these regions 3 2 3 contributions associated with floe edges in the form run the contributions from floe edges to the andc and ondc are prevalent during the summer months fig 8 the seasonal maximum in the contributions due to floe edges represent 27 and 42 of the total andc in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively the equivalent contributions at the ocean ice interface amount to 60 of the ondc in summer in either hemisphere observations in the beaufort sea brenner et al 2021 and model evidence in the arctic bateson 2021 indicate that eq 1 poorly represents the mean floe length especially in summer due to the definition of the form drag coefficients the bias in the prescribed floe length likely impacts both the andc and ondc in winter the effects of floe edges on the neutral drag coefficients are restricted to the miz which we expect from the lesser fraction of open water in the ice pack the contributions of floe edges to the neutral drag coefficients have only a weak signature on the mean andc and ondc in winter to examine the sensitivity of the modelled neutral drag coefficients to the prescribed floe length we make use of the sea ice conditions from the form run and the formalism of tsamados et al 2014 to calculate the form drag coefficients using this approach we determine that prescribing a constant floe length of 300m reduces the andc and ondc in the arctic to 2 3 10 3 and 7 7 10 3 in august respectively thereby almost suppressing the summer peak seen in figs 8 a and 8 b this confirms the conclusions of bateson 2021 in practice setting l f 300 m is equivalent to suppressing the form drag contribution associated with floe edges as this horizontal length largely exceeds the vertical height of floe edges when varying β from 0 5 to 1 5 in eq 1 the seasonal peak in the andc ondc is decreased by 10 25 but the shape of the peak is maintained the existence of such peak arises from definition of the floe length parameterization eq 1 this parameterization returns relatively small floe lengths as soon as sea ice concentration deviates from unity a 0 8 the seasonality of the modelled form drag contribution of floe edges in the arctic needs to be re evaluated with a more realistic formulation for floe sizes the overestimation in summer of the form drag contribution associated with floe edges in the arctic raises doubts for the representation of this contribution in the southern ocean similarly to the arctic setting a constant floe length of 300m nearly suppresses the form drag contribution of floe edges when calculating form drag with sea ice conditions from the form run however floes have smaller lengths in the southern ocean than in the arctic basin roach et al 2018 thus floe edges are likely to be more important to form drag in the antarctic than the arctic changing β from 0 5 to 1 5 in eq 1 decreases the andc and ondc to 3 1 10 3 and 14 0 10 3 respectively in the southern ocean despite of the uncertainty in the mean floe length formulation the seasonal peak in the antarctic neutral drag coefficients is maintained by the contribution from surface ridges figs 8 c and 8 d consequently the uncertainty in the floe length parameterization impacts the magnitude of the summer maximum in neutral drag coefficients but not the existence of this seasonal maximum the freeboard to floe length h f l f and draft to floe length h d l f ratios hereafter referred to as aspect ratios of floe edges control the spatial distribution of the form drag coefficients due to floe edges fig 11 a the aspect ratios of floe edges are high in the arctic miz the caa and the northern coast of greenland in these regions the small sea ice concentrations and thus the short mean floe lengths lead to a strong influence of the freeboard and draft of sea ice on the aspect ratios of floe edges on the opposite the aspect ratios of floe edges are low in the arctic ice pack because of large floes as in the arctic the aspect ratios of floe edges drive the annual mean contribution from floe edges to the andc in the southern ocean fig 11 e thick sea ice in the ba seas ross weddell and the davis seas 90 e are associated with higher aspect ratios of floe edges except in the ross sea floe lengths are maximum close to the coast of antarctica and decrease northwards with sea ice concentration the spatial maximum along the coast of antarctica strongly inhibits the effect of floe edges on the andc and ondc in this area the trends in the annual mean form drag contribution from floe edges to the total neutral drag coefficients are not statistically significant when averaged over the arctic or the regions of the antarctic the lack of statistical significance in these trends takes its origin from the variability in the freeboard to floe length and draft to floe length ratios in consequence the spatial trends in the andc and ondc displayed in fig 10 may not be explained by changes in the contribution associated with floe edges we may anticipate a greater influence of floe edges on the total form drag in the arctic in future decades as arctic sea ice is transitioning to a more seasonal state 3 2 4 surface skin drag the skin drag coefficients are the second contribution in order of importance to the seasonal cycle of the andc and ondc during winter fig 8 the skin drag contributes to the andc ondc when the distance between sails keels is less than twenty ten times the vertical height of sails keels tsamados et al 2014 these conditions are satisfied in autumn and onward in winter when the density of sails and keels decreases due to the formation of levelled sea ice through thermodynamical processes in summer sea ice melt generates a decrease in the volume fraction of deformed ice leading to a higher density of sails and keels these changes diminish the overall contribution of surface skin to the neutral drag coefficients in summer the maps of the annual mean surface skin drag coefficients in the arctic fig 11 c and antarctic fig 11 g show that the spatial distribution of this coefficient is relatively homogeneous compared to other form drag contributions we expect a small spatial variability of the skin drag coefficients in the ice pack because these coefficients aim to represent the drag effect of levelled ice 3 2 5 contribution associated with melt pond edges melt ponds appear over sea ice when the surface meltwater and precipitation collect in the depression of the ice cover in the arctic the mean melt pond area fraction of sea ice reaches a maximum of 38 in july in the skin and form runs see sterlin et al 2021 this represents a form drag contribution of 10 of the arctic andc in the antarctic melt ponds are mainly non existent because of different snow and ice surface thermodynamical processes recent observations from cruise ships suggest that the effect of melt ponds in the antarctic may be more substantial than previously thought istomina 2020 for this reason the melt pond scheme remains active in the southern hemisphere in our model version of nemo lim3 the melt pond area fraction simulated in the southern hemisphere is non negligible even though the snow and ice surface melt fluxes are small and the available meltwater for ponding is little the misrepresentation of melt ponds in the southern hemisphere arises from the redistribution of meltwater among the ice thickness categories by the melt pond scheme the scheme distributes the volume of meltwater over thin ice categories first these categories extend over large areas in the antarctic due to more seasonal and less deformed sea ice compared to the arctic as a result the simulated melt ponds are shallow 5cm depth but cover large areas 20 ponded ice area in the southern hemisphere thus the effect of melt ponds on the surface albedo is weak the impact of melt ponds on the form drag may be more problematic the mean contribution of melt pond edges represents up to 6 of the total andc in the southern hemisphere the trend in the form drag contribution associated with melt pond edges is negative in the arctic in summer in our current implementation of the melt pond scheme the refreezing mechanism of melt ponds impacts the trends in the melt pond area fractions in the arctic sterlin et al 2021 this mechanism is adjusted to decrease the melt pond volume when the ice surface temperature is less than 0 15 c and to match current observations the trend in the mean arctic melt pond area fraction of sea ice during june july august is 3 13 per decade in the form run despite this positive trend the aspect ratio of melt pond edges is reducing in summer because of smaller freeboard height in turn the negative trend in the aspect ratio of melt pond edges drives the decline in the contributions of melt ponds to the andc 3 3 impact on the ocean surface properties 3 3 1 ocean surface stress in the presence of sea ice the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients modulates the effect of surface winds and sea ice drift on the ocean surface stress the constant andc ondc over sea ice makes the wind ocean surface stress in ice covered areas directly proportional to the square of the relative surface wind sea ice drift speeds in high latitudes surface wind speeds are higher in winter than in summer because of more frequent and intense storms therefore the simulated ocean surface stress in the ice pack is more important in winter than in summer when selecting constant drag coefficients over sea ice barthélemy et al 2017 on the other hand the variable andc and ondc over sea ice break this direct relation between surface stress and relative wind or ice velocities martin et al 2016 in the form run the ocean surface stress under sea ice is maximum in summer figs 12 b 12 c despite low surface wind speeds this stress is minimum in winter when surface wind speeds are higher figs 12 a 12 d the reversal of the ocean surface stress seasonality when including form drag compared to constant drag coefficients is principally dictated by the mean seasonal cycles of the neutral drag coefficients fig 8 fig 13 further illustrates the seasonality differences in ocean surface stress between the two simulations the anti cyclonic ocean surface stress driving the beaufort sea gyre intensifies in summer and lessens in winter with form drag in the skin run this ocean surface stress is minimum in summer and maximum in winter figs 13 a 13 b in addition the form run shows higher mean ocean surface stresses than the skin run in fram strait and the central arctic in both summer and winter correspondingly the variable andc and ondc in these regions are higher than the constant drag coefficients used in the skin run all year round in the southern hemisphere the andc and ondc from the form run strengthen the ocean surface stress steering the weddell and the ross sea gyres during summer figs 13 c in winter the ocean surface stress decreases in the form run compared to the reference skin run figs 13 c we anticipate that our model configuration overestimates the effect of form drag on the ocean surface stress in summer because of the misrepresentation of the form drag contribution associated with floe edges the sensitivity of the modelled ocean surface stress to the contribution of floe edges may be investigated using the sea ice conditions and ocean surface state simulated in the form run this method is equivalent to varying parameters in the form drag parameterization and assuming negligible effects on the sea ice state and ocean surface velocities while the impact of form drag on the sea ice concentration is limited the effects on the ice thickness and relative ice velocity are more significant thus this method allows only a qualitative assessment of the modelled ocean surface stress sensitivity in the arctic we determine that prescribing a constant floe length of 300m removes the reversal of seasonality in ocean surface stress varying β from 0 5 to 1 5 decreases the summer maximum in the mean arctic ocean surface stress by 0 02n m 2 these results are in line with the suppression of the seasonal maximum in ondc when prescribing a constant floe length of 300meter and the decreased seasonal maximum in ondc when increasing β in the antarctic prescribing a constant floe length of 300meter or varying β modify the magnitude of the maximum in ocean surface stress during the austral summer nevertheless this seasonal maximum is calculated even without the contributions from floe edges due to the contribution from ice keels in our setup the model computes the heat and momentum fluxes at the ice ocean interface using the ice velocity relative to the ocean surface velocity this method enables the representation of the negative feedback between the ekman pumping and the relative surface velocities in polar ocean gyres namely the ice ocean stress governor mechanism meneghello et al 2018 2020 when a polar ocean gyre driven by surface stress spins up the ice velocity equalizes with the ocean surface velocity turning off the surface stress observational studies exploring the dynamic of the beaufort gyre rely on constant drag coefficients for sea ice without form drag e g meneghello et al 2017 in our model setup the curl of the ocean surface stress τ o c e shows evidence of a form drag effect on the ekman pumping in polar oceans especially in summer not shown form drag enhances the downwelling in the beaufort gyre in summer but reduces it in winter while the magnitude of the downwelling is likely biased by the prescribed mean floe length during summer we may have more confidence in the modelled upwelling during winter in the southern ocean form drag leads to a more efficient downwelling along the coastline of antarctica and a larger upwelling in the ice pack during the melt season as for the arctic regions the seasonal peak in neutral drag coefficients enhances the momentum fluxes between the ocean and sea ice systems on the other hand form drag reduces the efficiency of the ekman pumping under antarctic sea ice in winter we advise investigating ekman pumping rates with a variable formulation of the neutral drag coefficient and a more accurate floe size formulation than eq 1 the simulated interdecadal trends in the annual mean ocean surface stress exhibit stark contrasts in the ice pack depending on the formulation of the andc and ondc in the simulations fig 14 the trend in the arctic ocean surface stress is negative when selecting the parameterization of tsamados et al 2014 but positive when using constant neutral drag coefficients martin et al 2016 we confirm this result using our fully coupled ocean sea ice model in the form run the trend in ocean surface stress is 4 94 10 3 n m 2 per decade in the arctic ice pack fig 14 a the corresponding value in the skin run is 0 35 10 3 n m 2 per decade fig 14 b the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients leads to pronounced regional differences in the simulated ocean surface stress in the western sector of the antarctic notably the trend in ocean surface stress from the form run is positive in the western ross sea and the weddell sea but negative in the ba seas fig 14 c in the skin run the annual mean ocean surface stress declined in the western ross sea and increased in the weddell sea and the ba seas fig 14 d the simulated trends in ocean surface stress are similar in the eastern sector of the antarctic the trends in andc and ondc fig 10 are the main drivers of the changes in the annual mean ocean surface stress simulated in the form run in polar regions indeed the atmospheric forcing of the two model runs is identical there are only minor differences in sea ice drift between the form and skin runs because sea ice dissipates the effect of form drag on the wind stress through mechanical ice deformation the representation of the sea ice concentration in the form run is close to the one in the skin run therefore the atmospheric momentum input through the open water fraction is nearly unchanged by form drag thus the changes in ice ocean surface stress τ i o explain the differences in the total ocean surface stress τ o c e between the two simulations consequently the ondc controls τ i o and subsequently impacts τ o c e the modelled trends in the form drag contribution of keels principally explain the trends in ondc the trends of the contribution associated with floe edges being not statistically significant 3 3 2 sea surface temperature and salinity the simulated sst under polar ice differs during the melt season and in the miz essentially not shown in almost all the arctic miz the mean june july august sst in the form run is 0 5 to 1 5 c higher than in the reference skin run the interior of the arctic ice cover shows a better agreement between the two simulations in terms of sst these are close to the freezing point of seawater in the arctic miz the differences in the simulated sea ice thickness fig 5 e and sea ice concentration fig 3 f are spatially co locating with the differences in sst the thinner sea ice cover and the less consolidated miz simulated in the form run allow more heat exchanges between the ocean surface and the atmosphere than in the skin run the impact of the changes in sea ice properties on the sst concerns also the antarctic sea ice cover regions the sst in antarctic ice covered areas is generally lower during the austral summer with form drag this changes in winter when the simulated sst is close to the freezing point of seawater in the two model runs in the southern hemisphere the sea ice cover tends to be thicker fig 5 f and more consolidated fig 3 f with the variable neutral drag coefficient formulation in turn this hinders the heat exchanges between the atmosphere and the ocean leading to a lower summer sst in almost all the antarctic miz castellani et al 2018 reported higher summer mean sea surface temperature in the arctic miz when including form drag in their fully coupled ocean sea ice model in their implementation form drag acts on the transfer coefficient for momentum only the transfer coefficients for latent and sensible heat fluxes being constant these authors argue that the warming of the arctic miz is an indirect effect of changes in sea ice properties rather than a direct effect of form drag on the sst in our implementation form drag acts on the transfer coefficients for momentum latent and sensible heat fluxes over sea ice and the oceanic heat and momentum fluxes under sea ice however the impact of form drag on the simulated arctic sst is close to the one obtained by castellani et al 2018 this suggests a similar indirect effect of form drag on the sst through changes in sea ice properties form drag impacts the simulated sea ice concentration and thickness these changes in sea ice properties influence the modelled sst in summer the maps of the differences in mean sss between the form and skin runs fig 15 reveal a net increase in the sss in most ice covered areas during summer when activating the form drag scheme the mean sss is 0 89g kg and 0 52g kg higher in summer when using the formulation of tsamados et al 2014 in the arctic and antarctic respectively the increase remains visible in the central arctic and the coastal regions of the east siberian sea during winter the sss in the beaufort gyre and the caa is smaller in the form run compared to the skin run except for july and august in the southern hemisphere the higher summer mean sss simulated in the form run is predominantly observed in the vicinity of the coast and the western regions of the antarctic the sss in the antarctic miz is smaller during summer when using the form drag scheme two mechanisms involving the neutral drag coefficients may explain the higher summer mean sss simulated when activating the form drag scheme firstly the melting and freezing of sea ice control the seasonality of the sss in polar regions peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 our current implementation of the form drag impacts the turbulent heat fluxes over and under sea ice these heat fluxes affect the thermodynamics of sea ice and hence the exchange of freshwater between the ocean and ice systems secondly the form drag formalism impacts the ocean surface stress in the ice pack this stress controls the mixing of the ocean properties in the surface mixed layer enabling mixing in the upper ocean surface and the underlying water masses the net upward ocean surface freshwater flux f w allows investigating the seasonal impact of form drag on the sss through changes in sea ice melt f w includes the mass fluxes associated with evaporation precipitation river runoff and the ice ocean mass fluxes although this flux is sensitive to the form drag formalism in nemo lim3 the differences in f w between the two model runs may not alone explain the changes in sss the spatial distributions of the differences in f w between the two runs do not coincide not shown with the ones in sss fig 15 the form drag formulation enhances the freshwater input to the ocean surface in the caa and the peripheral arctic seas but damps this input in the central arctic in the antarctic the two simulations exhibit regional differences in the summer mean of f w when including form drag the freshwater input to the ocean surface is higher in the weddell and davis seas around 90 e but is smaller in the other antarctic regions these differences disagree with the near ubiquitous increase in sss in the antarctic ice pack and the freshening of the antarctic miz during the austral summer does form drag impact the seasonality of the sss through changes in ocean surface stresses castellani et al 2018 simulated an increase in the mean arctic sss in summer and a fresher beaufort gyre when selecting the form drag scheme of steiner 2001 in their model these findings agree with the form drag effects on the simulated sss in the northern hemisphere the differences in the form drag implementation between our study and the one of castellani et al 2018 point to an effect of the form drag on the ocean surface stress to explain the changes in arctic sss we find a spatial correspondence between the seasonal differences in ocean surface stress fig 13 and the differences in sss fig 15 the fresher beaufort gyre simulated when activating the form drag scheme is consistent with the increased ocean surface stress roy et al 2015 the higher summer mean ocean surface stress in the form run leads to a more efficient mixing of the water masses and a less stratified ocean surface layer than in the reference skin run obviously the underestimation of the prescribed floe lengths in the arctic likely plays a role in the summer intensification of the ocean surface stress this issue is probably less important in the antarctic the agreement of our results with the ones of castellani et al 2018 confirms the importance of form drag for the seasonality of form drag for the sss under sea ice 3 3 3 mixed layer depth the ocean mixed layer depth denoted ml hereafter corresponds to the thickness of the quasi homogeneous layer in the upper ocean ocean surface fluxes of heat momentum and mass control the seasonal cycle of the ml depth sea ice mediates the ocean surface fluxes in the polar regions the melting and freezing of sea ice act on the upper ocean stratification the sea ice concentration modulates the heat exchanges between the atmosphere and the ocean the ice ocean drag stirs the upper ocean surface usually a property difference or a gradient criterion relative to a reference depth defines the ml depth kara et al 2000 we define the ml depth in nemo lim3 as the depth at which the density is 0 01kg m 3 higher than the density at 10m depth this definition likely overestimates the simulated ml depth in deep convection regions courtois et al 2017 but is appropriate for polar regions peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 the seasonal changes in ml depth are more intense in the open ocean at high latitudes such as in the norwegian sea or the southern ocean the presence of sea ice strongly inhibits these seasonal changes in ml depth in the form run the arctic mean ml depth under sea ice is 13m in summer and 36m in winter fig 16 the simulated ml depth reaches 70m during winter in the central arctic these results agree with observed arctic ml depths over the past decades peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 in the antarctic the mean ml depth under sea ice is 17m in summer and 83m in winter in the form run the simulated ml is deeper along the coast of antarctica during winter fig 16 d pellichero et al 2017 found using various observations similar spatial distributions of the antarctic ml depth during the summer and winter months the form drag scheme strongly influences the simulation of the ml depth in ice covered regions especially in summer fig 17 the summer mean ml depths under sea ice are 22 to 38 larger in the form run with respect to the skin run in the arctic and antarctic respectively the overestimation of the summer neutral drag coefficients likely enhances these modelled differences nonetheless the form run exhibits a year long deep ml in the central arctic not featured in the skin run such a deep ml in the form run agrees with the observations of a mean ml depth between 50 and 70m during winter in the makarov and eurasian basin peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 moreover castellani et al 2018 reported a seasonal deepening of the arctic ml when using the form drag scheme of steiner 2001 the base of the winter ml under the antarctic sea ice is 10m shallower in the form run than in the reference skin run fig 17 c the changes in the ml depth along the coastline of antarctica are evidence of the strong sensitivity of the ml to the form drag formalism hydrographic profiles show a nearly ubiquitous shoaling of the arctic ml from 1979 to 2012 peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 according to these authors and petty et al 2014 winds affect the ml only in the absence of sea ice nemo lim3 captures the observed shoaling of the ml in the central arctic only fig 18 a in the model the arctic regions experiencing ml deepening correspond to regions undergoing significant negative trends in sea ice concentration the modelled sea ice losses in the peripheral arctic seas allow for a greater action of wind stress over the open water fractions and hence ml deepening the spatial distribution of the trends in arctic ml depth is similar in the form and skin runs however the modelled trends differ in magnitude fig 19 a in the central arctic the trends in ml depth are approximately 11m per decade in the form run and 4m per decade in the skin run these modelled trends are close to the observed rate of 10m to 5m reported by peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 these authors claim that the freshening of the arctic ml is the principal driver of the ml shoaling in the arctic in our model runs the trends in the annual mean arctic sss are nearly equal in the two runs 0 11g kg per decade in the form run and 0 10g kg per decade in the skin run consequently the form drag parameterization does not question the model s ability to represent the freshening of the arctic ocean close to the surface on the other hand form drag modulates the trends in arctic ml depth in our model setup in the southern hemisphere the modelled interdecadal trends in ml depth have almost the same spatial distribution except in the bellingshausen sea the modelled ml in the form run shoals in the weddell and ross seas but deepens in the ba seas fig 19 b in the skin run the trend in the mean ba seas ml depth is not significant the ml depth trends from the two simulations differ locally by about 10m per decade along the coastline of antarctica fig 19 b these differences drop to levels below 2m in the antarctic ice pack 4 conclusion in this study we implemented the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 into the fully coupled ocean sea ice model nemo lim3 using a global configuration of this model we performed one simulation accounting for the form drag over sea ice and a second with constant neutral drag coefficients over sea ice in the second simulation the drag coefficients over sea ice are set equal to the mean of the variable neutral drag coefficients over sea ice from the first simulation using these two simulations we investigated the effect of the form drag on the sea ice cover and ocean surface properties in both the arctic and antarctic over the past four decades past model studies showed the interest in including form drag over sea ice in climate models tsamados et al 2014 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 martin et al 2016 and their predecessors tsamados et al 2014 relied on a stand alone version of cice this excludes feedback mechanisms between the ocean and sea ice or the atmosphere our configuration of nemo lim3 features a full coupling of ocean and sea ice models forced by an atmospheric reanalysis surface product as in the model studies of castellani et al 2018 and chikhar et al 2019 we improve upon the study of castellani et al 2018 thanks to our refined ocean vertical grid the integration of a sea ice strength parameterization and an itd in the model moreover the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 is conceptually different from the scheme of steiner 2001 used by castellani et al 2018 lastly our simulations are global allowing investigation of the form drag effect in the antarctic and arctic regions the salient points of our study are 1 the form drag scheme significantly affects the modelled sea ice thickness and volume in nemo lim3 sea ice is 0 1 0 5m thinner in the peripheral seas of the arctic basin and the coastal region of the ba seas but generally 0 1m thicker in the antarctic ice pack with form drag the impact is small on the simulated sea ice concentration and area with only very small differences in the peripheral seas of the arctic basin and the antarctic miz these differences relate to the ones in sea ice thickness 2 the form drag formulation weakly impacts the simulated sea ice drift the relative difference between the two model runs in sea ice drift speed is less than 10 in the central arctic and antarctic ice pack sea ice drift speeds in the caa are sensibly higher when activating the form drag scheme the differences in the simulated trend in sea ice drift speed suggest a long term effect of the form drag on the sea ice drift 3 the simulated andc and ondc exhibit a spatial and seasonal variability pertinent for sea ice and ocean modelling the simulated coefficients are maximum in summer and minimum in winter however form drag is in all likelihood overestimated in summer because of the prescribed floe length formulation of lüpkes et al 2012 brenner et al 2021 bateson 2021 the coefficients are high in the caa fram strait and the western sector of the antarctic weddell ba and ross seas these coefficients experience a negative trend in the arctic over 1980 2019 in the antarctic the trends in these coefficients are positive in the ross and weddell seas and negative in the ba seas the trends in the neutral drag coefficients are principally driven by the form drag contribution of sails and keels 4 the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients strongly impacts the ocean surface stress in polar regions in our model runs the seasonality of the variable andc and ondc damps enhances the ocean surface stress under sea ice in winter summer the enhanced summer ocean surface stress simulated with form drag needs to be confirmed with a more realistic floe size formulation on the other hand the simulated decrease in deformed ice fractions the associated decline in form drag and the negative trend in the ocean surface stress in the arctic regions show some correspondence with the observed decline in arctic myi over 1980 2019 this confirms the results of martin et al 2016 for the arctic regions the regional trends in the antarctic ocean surface stress differ significantly depending on the inclusion of form drag the annual mean ocean surface stress increases with time in the weddell and ross seas but decreases in the ba seas with form drag the signs of these regional trends agree with the changes in the variable neutral drag coefficients 5 the simulated sst in polar regions differs in summer and in the miz the summer mean sst in the arctic miz is 0 5 to 1 5 c higher with form drag whereas the summer mean sst is approximately 0 5 c smaller in the antarctic miz indirect changes in sea ice properties caused by the inclusion of form drag explain nearly all the differences in sst between the two simulations form drag increases the sss by 0 89g kg and 0 52g kg in summer under the arctic and antarctic ice pack respectively in the form run the increased summer mean ocean surface stress leads to enhanced vertical mixing altering the re stratification of the ocean surface under sea ice during the melt season the alteration of the arctic sss persists in winter suggesting significant changes in the freshwater content in the arctic ocean the effects of form drag on the arctic sst and sss are in line with the results of castellani et al 2018 based on a conceptually different form drag scheme 6 the inclusion of the form drag scheme effectively impacts the simulated ml depth in winter and summer keeping in mind that the neutral drag coefficients are likely overestimated in summer these results support the conclusions of castellani et al 2018 on the arctic ml the summer ml is 22 and 38 thicker in the arctic and antarctic with form drag respectively the form drag induces a year long deeper ml in the central arctic as seen in observations the differences in the simulated antarctic ml depth indicate a strong sensitivity of the ml to the inclusion of form drag the magnitude of the simulated trends in ml depth in both hemispheres is equally sensitive to the form drag we have not examined the stability effect in the ocean and atmospheric boundary layers a stable unstable stratification in the boundary layer enhances damps turbulent surface fluxes birnbaum and lüpkes 2002 mcphee 2012 the addition of stability effects in form drag parameterizations has a non negligible impact on the transfer coefficients in both the ocean and atmosphere mcphee 2012 lüpkes and gryanik 2015 however these effects are difficult to evaluate in the upper ocean boundary layer mcphee 1992 cole et al 2017 the simulated ondc during summer and in the miz suffer from uncertainties associated with the prescribed floe length formulation brenner et al 2021 these uncertainties also influence the simulation of lateral ice melt in the model the floe size distribution provides a feedback mechanism linking the lateral ice melt and the form drag contribution associated with floe edges therefore we advise future studies to revisit our results with a realistic floe size distribution more recently horvat and tziperman 2015 and zhang et al 2016 introduced prognostic floe size distributions for sea ice models that limit assumptions on the statistics of floes either prescribed or prognostic floe size distributions are promising in better representing floe sizes in climate models bateson et al 2022 the impact of form drag on the ocean surface is significant in our simulations with the following caveat that our study is more a sensitivity study than a modelling study aiming for performance against observations furthermore our conclusions might change in a fully coupled ocean ice atmosphere model setup recent experiments performed with such model setups show effects on the large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations ponsoni et al 2021

23766,the surface roughness of sea ice is highly variable because of the diversity of discrete obstacles to the flow present on the sea ice surface these obstacles result in form drag an effect poorly accounted for in the calculation of surface fluxes over sea ice in climate models in this study we implement in the ocean sea ice model nemo lim3 a variable formulation of the atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients over sea ice that includes the form drag effect we examine the impact of this formulation on the ice cover and ocean surface properties over the past decades in the arctic and antarctic including form drag in the simulations leads to 10 50cm thinner sea ice in the peripheral arctic seas and 10cm thicker sea ice in the antarctic ice pack on annual means form drag significantly impacts summer sea surface temperatures in the marginal ice zone 0 5 to 1 5 c in the arctic and 0 5 c in the antarctic and sea surface salinities under the ice cover 0 52 to 0 89g kg in both polar regions the seasonality of the ocean surface stress under sea ice is reversed with a maximum minimum ocean surface stress under sea ice in summer winter when including form drag however this seasonal reversal is likely too intense in our simulations due to the underestimation of the prescribed mean floe lengths in summer in the arctic the long term declines in sea ice volume and multi year ice are associated with decreasing neutral drag coefficients and negative trends in ocean surface stress in the antarctic the trends in the neutral drag coefficients control the increase decrease in ocean surface stress in the weddell and ross bellingshausen and amundsen seas form drag results in a 22 38 deeper summer mixed layer under polar sea ice and a year long 10 25m deeper mixed layer in the central arctic all these impacts on the ocean surface properties demonstrate the relevance of form drag for polar ocean modelling keywords sea ice model ocean general circulation model

followed by an absolute record low sea ice extent minimum in february 2022 understanding these contrasting trends and regional aspects remains an open question in both model rackow et al 2022 and observational studies fogt et al 2022 reconstructed and modelled antarctic sea ice states show a significant thickening of the sea ice cover in the weddell and ross seas but a thinning in the bellingshausen and amundsen ba seas massonnet et al 2013 holland et al 2014 changes in local winds explain most of the observed long term trends in sea ice drift around antarctica kwok et al 2017 sea ice plays a critical role in redistributing heat momentum and freshwater between the atmosphere and the ocean at high latitudes surface flux anomalies in those regions impact the large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations and thus can affect the global climate the turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum over sea ice are highly dependent on the top and bottom ice surface roughnesses these two roughnesses exert a drag on the mean air and seawater flows respectively in turn drag generates perturbation in the mean flow in the vicinity of the surface these perturbations influence the mixing of scalar properties such as horizontal flow speed temperature or humidity consequently the knowledge of the drag over sea ice helps our understanding of the effects of atmosphere ocean ice interactions in polar regions arya 1973 introduced the concept of drag partitioning over sea ice to account for the effects of small scale roughness skin drag and discrete obstacles to the flow of air form drag since then the modelling community has benefited from numerous developments relating the atmospheric drag coefficients to the morphology of the ice surface arya 1975 hanssen bauer and gjessing 1988 garbrecht et al 2002 birnbaum and lüpkes 2002 lüpkes and birnbaum 2005 lüpkes et al 2012 lüpkes et al 2012 provided a hierarchy of formulas parameterizing the atmospheric neutral drag coefficients over sea ice based on physical concepts the drag partitioning method of arya 1973 has been successfully adapted to ocean drag coefficient parameterizations lu et al 2011 this method has paved the way for comprehensive frameworks that provide the atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients over sea ice as a function of sea ice properties the scheme of steiner 2001 calculates the drag coefficients over sea ice from the deformation energy and the sea ice concentration tsamados et al 2014 proposed a parameterization based on an idealized floe schematic that connects the drag coefficients to ice surface features this latter scheme includes the effect of floe edges surface ridges or ice sails and keels melt pond edges and skin drag including form drag in sea ice models leads to significant spatial and temporal differences in the simulated arctic sea ice thickness and drift tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 ponsoni et al 2021 as shown by martin et al 2016 form drag results in a negative trend in the annual mean ocean surface stress under the arctic sea ice cover over the period 1980 2013 this trend contrasts with the moderate increase of this diagnostic when using constant drag coefficients martin et al 2014 2016 the conclusions of martin et al 2016 need to be confirmed with an interactive ocean and sea ice model setup as these authors relied on a climatological dataset to prescribe ocean surface currents additionally form drag can alter the characteristics of the mixed layer in the arctic tsamados et al 2015 castellani et al 2018 noted a net increase in the summer mean sea surface salinity and mixed layer depth in the arctic when using the form drag scheme of steiner 2001 with the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm numerical experiments carried out with the hadley centre global environment model version 3 hadgem3 support evidence of an impact of form drag on the large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulations in the arctic ponsoni et al 2021 the main objective of this paper is to examine the sensitivity of the sea ice state and the ocean surface properties to the form drag over sea ice in the antarctic and arctic polar regions the intents are two fold 1 revisiting past model studies incorporating a form drag formulation for the arctic sea ice tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 and 2 taking advantage of our developments to investigate the effects of the form drag in the antarctic for the first time we address the analysis of the effects of form drag over sea ice in both polar regions our model study benefits from our global and fully coupled ocean sea ice model setup a refined vertical grid for the ocean model and an extended period of 40 years for the analysis these allow us to investigate the importance of form drag for polar sea ice and the ocean surface properties in sea ice covered regions we describe the methodology of this study in section 2 we validate the modelled sea ice and investigate its sensitivity to the form drag in section 3 1 in section 3 2 we discuss the representation of the form drag in the model next we examine the effects of form drag on the ocean surface properties under polar sea ice in section 3 3 lastly we summarize our remarks and conclude in section 4 2

β eq 1 also prescribes the mean floe length in the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 according to lüpkes et al 2012 β 0 3 is more representative of sea ice conditions in the antarctic and western fram strait whereas β 1 4 better reflects sea ice conditions in eastern fram strait these different values for β highlight the limit of such formulation as eq 1 cannot express the full range of variability of the observed floe lengths we use this formulation as a first order method to represent the change in floe length across the marginal ice zone as a function of sea ice concentration we set the coefficient β equal to 0 5 as in the study of tsamados et al 2014 the atmospheric forcing follows the protocol of the second experiment from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments

additionally the wind velocity is assumed to exceed ocean surface currents u a u o and sea ice drift u a u i the formalism of large and yeager 2004 2008 prescribes the transfer coefficients at the atmosphere ocean interface as well as stability coefficients to account for atmospheric stratification effects over the open water fraction in the case of sea ice the transfer coefficients are set constant in the default configuration of nemo lim3 as a second formulation we prescribe the transfer coefficients over sea ice using the variable formulation of the atmospheric neutral drag coefficients of tsamados et al 2014 contrary to this study we do not consider stability effects in the atmospheric boundary layer over sea ice lastly nemo lim3 does not include stability effects in the ocean boundary layer neither for open water nor under sea ice the turbulent fluxes of momentum τ i o and heat q i o at the ice ocean interface subscript i o are prescribed using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 τ i o ρ w c w u i u o u i u o 6 q i o ρ w c w c h u i o θ i b o t t o m s s t u i u o where ρ w is the density of seawater θ i b o t t o m is the basal temperature of sea ice c h is a

drag coefficient formulation of tsamados et al 2014 the expression of q i o depends on the friction velocity u i o which uses the ice ocean root mean square velocity difference vancoppenolle et al 2009 the ocean surface stress τ o c e is computed as τ o c e 1 a τ a o a τ i o large and yeager 2008 rousset et al 2015 the ocean surface heat flux including q i o is calculated using the same ice concentration averaging method the implementation of the variable neutral drag coefficients over sea ice of tsamados et al 2014 in our setup is closely related to the implementation of this formalism in the icepack sea ice column model hunke et al 2021 part of the cice consortium see the supplementary material of this manuscript for a comprehensive list of the parameters and values used in the form drag formalism this formalism decomposes the atmospheric andc and oceanic ondc neutral drag coefficients c d a and c d w into the sum of individual form drag contributions associated with discrete obstacles to the flow of air or seawater 7 c d a c d a r d g c d a f l o e c d a s k i n c d a p n d 8 c d w c d w r d g c d w f l o e c d w s k i n the subscripts a and w are related to the

and c d w s k i n and melt pond edges c d a p n d melt ponds have no impact on the oceanic neutral drag coefficients to help the reader fig 1 presents a schematic showing the idealized floe of tsamados et al 2014 its relation with the form and skin drag coefficients as well as the turbulent fluxes of momentum latent and sensible heat exchanged between the atmosphere ocean sea ice systems the transfer coefficients for momentum latent and sensible heat fluxes at the atmosphere ice interface in eqs 2 4 are set equal to the neutral drag coefficient c d a assuming identical values for these coefficients c d a i c e a i c h a i c d a direct measurements of the atmospheric transfer coefficient over sea ice suggest smaller transfer coefficients for latent and sensible heat fluxes than for momentum schröder 2003 we leave the question of the effect of such inequality in the transfer coefficients open for future studies the oceanic drag coefficient at the ocean ice interface in eqs 5 and 6 is set equal to the neutral drag coefficient c w c d w the general expression of the form drag coefficients derives from the monin obukhov similarity theory assuming a logarithmic fluid velocity profile hanssen bauer and gjessing 1988 this expression is valid for both the ocean and the atmosphere and assumes no coriolis forces one can define this expression assuming no coriolis effect and for a reference level of 10m as 9 c d x f o r m 1 2 c s c 2 h d a ln h z 0 ln 10 z 0 2 where the superscript f o r m corresponds to the form drag contribution of ridges f o r m r d g floes f o r m f l o e or melt ponds f o r m p n d the subscript x is either for the air a or seawater w mediums c is a constant local form drag coefficient set to 0 20 in this study more recently zu et al 2021 recommended 0 57 for the local form drag coefficient of keels used in c d w r d g h is the height of the obstacles sails keels floe or melt pond edges and d is the distance separating them z 0 represents the roughness length of the upstream surface type moreover eq 9 relies on sheltering functions s c expressing the flow attenuation downstream of the obstacles 10 s c 2 1 exp 0 18 d h r d g 1 exp 22 β 1 a f l o e a p 1 10 β p n d where a p is the melt pond concentration we keep the sheltering function selected by tsamados et al 2014 for the contributions due to ridges sails and keels however we select the formulation of lüpkes et al 2012 adopted in the icepack model hunke et al 2021 regarding the sheltering functions for floe and melt pond edges these later two sheltering functions use the power coefficient β of the prescribed floe length equation eq 1 to better reflect the changes in floe length with the ice concentration lastly the general expression of the surface skin drag coefficients is 11 c d x s k i n a 1 m x h d c if h d 1 m x where m x is an atmospheric x a or oceanic x o skin drag parameter assumed constant here and c is the unobstructed skin drag coefficient h d is the ratio of the ridge height sails or keels over the distance between ridges sails or keels in our model setup the reference depth in the expression of the ocean form drag coefficients is 10m even though the ocean surface currents are defined at 0 5m depth roy et al 2015 advise against such a reference depth when the vertical resolution of the ocean model near the surface is sufficiently high 1m to resolve the planetary boundary layer of the ocean based on this study our simulations likely overestimate arctic sea ice drift roy et al 2015 proposed a method to better account for the vertical ocean velocity profile near the surface in the ocean drag definition this method may lead to numerical instabilities due to the increase in the calculated ocean drag coefficients they reduced the time step of their ocean model to 600s to solve this issue we faced similar numerical instabilities when implementing form drag in nemo lim3 because of the variability of the drag coefficients we lowered the time step of the ocean sea ice model to 900s 5400s to ensure numerical stability changing the reference depth from 10m to 0 5m in the general form drag expression eq 9 is equivalent to multiplying the ocean form drag contributions associated with keels and floes by a factor of two this would further alter the stability of the model therefore more work is needed to reconcile the definition of the variable drag coefficients with the reference depth of the ocean surface currents while maintaining the model stability in the meantime this discrepancy does not question the ability of the model to simulate the variability in the neutral drag coefficients 2 2 intermediate sea ice variables to evaluate c d a and c d w the variables needed are the freeboard h f and the draft h d of the floes the distance between floes d f the melt pond size l p and the elevation of the ice surface relative to the melt pond surface h p moreover ice ridges consist of surface ridges also named sails and bottom surface ridges or keels thus the evaluation of the neutral drag coefficients additionally requires the distance between sails d s and keels d k and the vertical height of these obstacles the sail height h s and keel depth h k have for reference the ice surface and bottom surface elevation respectively hunke et al 2021 we obtain these by subtracting the freeboard draft height from the sail keel height h f and h d are calculated from the hydrostatic balance using the mean volume of snow v s and ice v i per grid cell melt ponds are supposed to be at equilibrium with the ocean surface h p h f with no effect on the hydrostatic balance of the floes this assumption is justified in the arctic as melt ponds are above sea level only during the first weeks of their onsets eicken 2002 we keep this assumption unchanged in the southern hemisphere in the absence of observational evidence drafts may exceed the ice thickness when the mass of snow is sufficiently large to submerge the ice surface below sea level flooding of the ice surface is frequent in the antarctic e g after important snowfall events on relatively thin ice when flooding occurs a fraction of snow is converted to ice in the hydrostatic balance so that the draft equals the ice thickness leppäranta 1983 tsamados et al 2014 estimate d s d k h s and h k by identifying the simulated deformed ice volume and concentration to the total volume and area of sails and keels per grid cell using an idealized floe schematic see figure 1 of tsamados et al 2014 to estimate the deformed ice quantities we have implemented tracers of level ice volume and concentration in lim3 these tracers represent the quantities of sea ice that have not undergone ridging or rafting events the difference between the ice volume concentration and the tracer of level ice volume concentration is defined to be equal to the deformed ice volume concentration following tsamados et al 2014 we set the ratio of the keel depth to sail height equal to 4 this ratio is within the 3 5 4 5 range for the most frequent maximum keel depth to sail height ratio strub klein and sudom 2012 in the antarctic tin and jeffries 2003 estimated a keel to sail ratio of 5 6 1 8 we set the distance between keels equal to the distance between sails based on tsamados et al 2014 it excludes rubble piles and widow ridges i e keels without associated sails rubble piles have extremely low keel depth to width ratios compared to other ice ridge types tin and jeffries 2003 thus the surface skin contribution is more appropriate for accounting for the effect of rubble piles we select 22 for the slope angle of sails and keels in the implementation of the form drag formalism tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 hunke et al 2021 using the idealized floe schematic of tsamados et al 2014 and the mean width to height ratios from strub klein and sudom 2012 we find that keel slope angles are 22 and sail slope angles are 28 for arctic first year ice ridges tin and jeffries 2003 estimated keel slope angles of 15 8 and sail slope angles of 10 5 in the southern ocean the porosity of sea ice is set to 0 30 in lim3 based on in situ observations leppäranta et al 1995 høyland 2002 this value is larger than the one selected by tsamados et al 2014 for the form drag however we keep the default value from lim3 for sea ice porosity to avoid discrepancies between the simulated deformed ice quantities and the total volume and area of sails and keels identified from the idealized floe schematic of tsamados et al 2014 d f is calculated by assuming periodically distributed square floes lüpkes and birnbaum 2005 tsamados et al 2014 this method requires the floe length here prescribed by eq 1 lastly the so called topographic scheme parameterizes melt ponds in the model flocco et al 2010 sterlin et al 2021 the refreezing mechanism for melt ponds is given by holland et al 2012 using the refreezing temperature threshold of 0 15 c instead of 2 00 c the melt pond scheme provides the melt pond area fraction which is the argument of the equation for l p lüpkes et al 2012 equation 45 2 3 experimental design we perform two simulations with a global configuration of nemo lim3 from 1958 to 2019 the analysis is restricted to the last 40 years of this period to exclude spin up effects unless otherwise stated the first experiment form takes the variable neutral drag coefficients of tsamados et al 2014 to calculate the transfer coefficients over sea ice the second experiment skin uses constant drag coefficients over sea ice these constants are determined as the global means of the variable neutral drag coefficients simulated in the form run and weighted by the sea ice area over 1980 2019 the constant drag coefficients in the skin run are c d a 1 49 10 3 and c d w 6 71 10 3 as for a comparison the standard drag coefficients in lim3 are 1 40 10 3 and 5 0 10 3 for c d a and c d w respectively this choice of coefficients for the skin run allows investigating the effect of form drag rather than the differences between the form run and the standard configuration of lim3 the ocean and ice models share the same 1 curvilinear tripolar horizontal orca grid from madec and imbard 1996 this horizontal grid has a cell edge length of 112km at the equator down to 46km in the arctic ocean the vertical grid includes 75 levels in partial step z coordinates the vertical resolution of this grid decreases from 1m at the ocean surface down to 200m near the ocean floor following a double hyperbolic tangent function we select the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 to provide the atmospheric surface variables required by core ii jra 55 is a sub daily 3h high resolution 55km atmospheric reanalysis based on a 4d var data assimilation scheme performed by the japan meteorological agency this reanalysis produced reasonable representations of sea ice in polar regions using the same model configuration as ours barthélemy et al 2017 sterlin et al 2021 the reader is redirected to the study of sterlin et al 2021 for a complete description of the present model configuration 2 4 observations we evaluate the simulated sea ice concentrations in the form and skin runs against the sea ice concentrations from nimbus 7 smmr and dmsp ssm i ssmis passive microwave data product cavalieri et al 1996 the national snow and ice data center nsidc references this dataset as the nsidc 0051 product this dataset is constructed using the nasa team algorithm we assess the representation of the sea ice drift in nemo lim3 with version 4 1 of the polar pathfinder daily 25km ease grid sea ice motion vectors product tschudi et al 2019 hereafter referred to as the nsidc 0116 product one may attempt to correct the meridional drift bias in the nsidc 0116 product by multiplying the ice velocities by a factor of 1 4 haumann et al 2016 however the nsidc 0116 product remains subject to uncertainties that a constant factor cannot alone solve particularly during summer sumata et al 2015 further the errors in this product are greater when 1 the ice concentrations are lower 2 the ice thicknesses are smaller 3 the ice speeds are higher sumata et al 2014 this strongly suggests regional differences in the uncertainties of the nsidc 0116 product the qualities of the nsidc 0116 product are the long term daily frequency ice drift vector components interpolated on an eulerian grid the simulated effective sea ice thicknesses or ice thicknesses and the total sea ice volumes from nemo lim3 are evaluated against the pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assimilation system piomas and global ice ocean modeling and assimilation system giomas products zhang 2014 piomas and giomas are not pure observational products but reanalyzes of the ocean and ice systems the former assimilates observed sea ice concentrations and sea surface temperatures in the arctic whereas the latter is a global model assimilating only observed sea ice concentrations uncertainties in the piomas dataset are relatively well studied schweiger et al 2011 giomas likely inherits from some of piomas s biases as the two share the same assimilation system shi et al 2021 liao et al 2022 the knowledge of these uncertainties and the consistent approach to reconstructing the sea ice thickness over the past decades are valuable assets for our analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 sea ice state 3 1 1 sea ice concentration and total sea ice area the mean seasonal cycle of the arctic sea ice area sia is relatively well represented in the form and skin runs compared to the nsidc 0051 product cavalieri et al 1996 as shown in fig 2 a but with some differences detailed below nemo lim3 underestimates overestimates the arctic sia in summer winter by 15 to 27 12 compared to the nsidc 0051 product further the seasonal minimum in arctic sia is simulated two to three weeks in advance of the nsidc 0051 observations these issues are common to other model studies conducted with nemo lim3 and using a similar model setup to ours e g vancoppenolle et al 2009 docquier et al 2017 massonnet et al 2019 on the other hand nemo lim3 simulates the position of the ice edge here defined as the 15 ice concentration line reasonably well in the arctic fig 3 c uncertainties in the atmospheric forcing likely explain minor spatial differences between the simulated and observed sea ice concentrations in the arctic sterlin et al 2021 in the antarctic the timing of the mean seasonal cycles of the simulated sia is in phase with the observed one from the nsidc 0051 product fig 2 b nemo lim3 simulates the spatial distribution of the sea ice concentration in the antarctic relatively well fig 3 b the two model runs overestimate the sea ice concentration in most of the antarctic ice pack fig 3 c this bias was reported for simulations using various atmospheric forcings barthélemy et al 2017 and previous model versions of nemo lim3 vancoppenolle et al 2009 massonnet et al 2019 lastly our model configuration does not allow the resolution of the extrema in sea ice concentration along the coastline of antarctica the poor representation of katabatic winds in the atmospheric forcing kobayashi et al 2015 the coarse model resolution in coastal regions and the lack of land fast ice and coastal polynyas in the simulations nihashi and ohshima 2015 prevent the representation of such extrema in sea ice concentration table 1 presents the interdecadal trends in sia in the arctic and antarctic and specific regions of the southern ocean the indian sector is enclosed by the longitudes 20 e and 90 e and the pacific sector by the longitudes 90 e and 150 e the annual mean arctic sia calculated from the nsidc 0051 product steadily declined over 1980 2019 at the rate of 0 59 106 km2 per decade both runs capture the observed decline in arctic sia and its statistical significance correctly on the contrary the interdecadal trends in the observed antarctic sea ice extent are regional and weakly positive turner et al 2015 comiso et al 2017 the observed sea ice extent increased in the ross and weddell seas but decreased in the bellingshausen and amundsen ba seas over the past decades nemo lim3 reproduces the main characteristics of the regional and pan antarctic long term trends in sia the simulated trends in sia in the ross sea are significantly positive and approximately three times greater than the equivalent trend from the nsidc 0051 product the associated changes in the simulated sea ice concentration impact principally the marginal ice zone miz of the antarctic ice pack not shown where passive microwave remote sensing is prone to errors cavalieri et al 1996 the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients in nemo lim3 leads to only minor differences in terms of the simulated sia and sea ice concentration the mean seasonal cycles of the arctic sia in the form and skin runs differ in summer by a few 0 54 106 km2 fig 2 a the spatial distribution of the annual mean arctic sea ice concentration exhibits few differences between the two runs fig 3 e in the antarctic during wintertime the sia from the form run is slightly larger than the one from the skin run fig 2 b the sea ice concentration in the antarctic miz is moderately higher when including form drag fig 3 f lastly the trends in sia are nearly identical in the two simulations table 1 3 1 2 sea ice thickness and total sea ice volume the mean seasonal cycles in the arctic of the total sea ice volume siv reconstructed by piomas and giomas and simulated by nemo lim3 are comparable in summer and autumn fig 4 a the differences are significant only in winter and spring in october the differences in arctic siv from nemo lim3 and piomas are less than the uncertainty of 1 35 103 km3 given for the piomas product schweiger et al 2011 the march siv from the form run is 2 7 103 km3 greater than the siv from piomas this difference slightly exceeds the piomas uncertainty of 2 25 103 km3 schweiger et al 2011 giomas is less constrained by observations than piomas as such fig 4 a gives the seasonal climatology of the arctic siv from the giomas dataset only as an indication in the southern ocean the simulated siv replicates the climatology from the giomas dataset fig 4 b with two noticeable differences the nemo lim3 seasonal minimum in siv is approximately 60 times larger than in giomas the simulated winter maxima are lagged by one month compared to giomas piomas and giomas are not pure observations as these products rely on models with similar physics to nemo lim3 to reconstruct the sea ice state the simulated seasonal cycles of the siv from our two runs are consistent with barthélemy et al 2017 the latter authors selected the jra 55 atmospheric reanalysis to force nemo lim3 as in the present study additionally the differences between giomas and nemo lim3 are similar to the past results from massonnet et al 2019 the spatial distribution of the simulated arctic sea ice thickness sea ice volumes per grid cell area is relatively realistic fig 5 a and compares well with the principal arctic sea ice thickness observational products wang et al 2016 however the comparison of form with the piomas dataset reveals a difference in the gradient of sea ice thickness in the region of fram strait fig 5 c sensitivity studies conducted with nemo lim3 strongly point to the uncertainties in the atmospheric forcing for explaining this difference sterlin et al 2021 on the other hand observational products show that the reconstructed sea ice from piomas is too thin in the beaufort sea area and too thick north of greenland and the canadian arctic archipelago caa wang et al 2016 these biases in piomas indicate a better agreement of the form run with observations in these regions than one may infer from figs 5 a and 5 c icesat observations between 2003 and 2008 in the southern hemisphere show that sea ice is the thickest in the western regions of the southern ocean and along the coastline of antarctica kurtz and markus 2012 nemo lim3 simulates realistic thick sea ice up to 2m in the western antarctic fig 5 b the modelled sea ice is too thin along the coast of antarctica because of the coarse grid resolution the poor representation of katabatic winds and land fast ice giomas underestimates the ice thickness close to the shore of antarctica but overestimates this quantity away from the shore in the marginal seas liao et al 2022 shi et al 2021 confirmed this issue in the weddell sea these issues explain most of the spatial differences in sea ice thickness between the form run and the giomas product around antarctica fig 5 d the impacts of the neutral drag coefficient formulation on the siv and the mean ice thickness vary between the northern and southern hemispheres in the northern hemisphere the siv simulated in the form run is 1300km3 smaller than in the skin run all year round fig 4 a this difference between the two runs is due to the mean ice thickness in the form run being smaller than in the reference skin run by about 0 1 0 5m in most of the peripheral seas of the central arctic fig 5 e as a result including form drag slightly exacerbates the negative difference in mean ice thickness between the skin run and piomas in the same regions fig 5 c on the other hand the spatial pattern of the differences in arctic sea ice thickness between nemo lim3 and piomas is unchanged by the inclusion of form drag as in the study of tsamados et al 2014 thermodynamical processes rather than sea ice dynamics control the differences in mean ice thickness between our two model runs not shown in the southern hemisphere the mean siv is in winter 1300km3 higher in the form run than in the skin run fig 4 b because of thicker sea ice in the miz and a more consolidated ice pack fig 5 f these differences in ice thickness between the two runs are less significant in summer and early winter not shown additionally the sea ice thickness in the ba seas between 60 w to 120 w from the form run is smaller than in the skin run all year round fig 5 f evidence from submarine sonars and satellite altimeters shows a thinning of the sea ice cover and a decline in the arctic siv since 1958 kwok 2018 the trend in the annual mean siv from the piomas dataset is 3 13 103 km3 over 1980 2019 table 2 with an estimated uncertainty of 1 103 km3 per decade schweiger et al 2011 the simulated trends in annual mean arctic siv from the skin and form runs are close and within the uncertainty range of this trend from the piomas dataset table 2 the decline in arctic siv from icesat and cryosat 2 satellite observations 2003 2018 is 2 87 103 and 5 13 103 km3 per decade in winter and fall respectively kwok 2018 neither piomas nor nemo lim3 reproduces the observed trend in fall from the icesat and cryosat 2 satellite observations the lifespan of these satellite platforms is relatively short 15 years in total compared to the four decade long trends presented in table 2 the 2007 record minimum in sea ice extent and the associated loss in the myi area heavily influence the time series of icesat kwok 2018 the long term trend in the annual mean siv from the giomas dataset is positive in the southern hemisphere but not statistically significant table 2 in addition to the giomas product massonnet et al 2013 performed a similar model reconstruction of the antarctic sea ice thickness using an ensemble kalman filter to assimilate the ice concentration although these authors showed a positive trend in the pan antarctic siv over the past decades they pointed to high temporal variability in the time series of siv and regional dissimilarities in the calculated trends in siv we find a good correspondence between the regional trends in the antarctic siv from the form and skin runs their statistical significance and those of massonnet et al 2013 these are gains in the annual mean siv in the weddell and ross seas but a decline in the siv in the ba seas table 2 while there is good agreement in the weddell sea on the sign of the trends in siv across most modelling studies massonnet et al 2013 holland et al 2014 zhang 2014 the changes in the ross and ba seas are less clear the interpretation of the trends in siv in the ross and ba seas is complicated by the pronounced spatial heterogeneity of the local trends in sea ice thickness holland et al 2014 3 1 3 sea ice drift and speed to compute the mean ice speeds shown in fig 6 we follow the method of tandon et al 2018 this method uses daily ice drift vector components to include sub monthly variations in the ice drift direction these variations have a non negligible impact on the monthly mean ice speeds docquier et al 2017 tandon et al 2018 as the timescale for changes in the sea ice drift direction is on the order of 5 days rampal et al 2009 in the northern hemisphere the means are further restricted to the central arctic avoiding coastal areas within 150km of the shore see figure 1 of tandon et al 2018 this spatial domain aims to be representative of the ice drift in the arctic ice pack sea ice in the southern ocean is essentially seasonal therefore we only exclude coastal areas within 150km of the coast to compute the mean ice speed in the antarctic lastly the means from the two model runs are for regions where the ice concentration is at least 15 observations from the international arctic buoy programme iabp show a seasonal maximum in mean sea ice speeds in september october when sea ice is thinner olason and notz 2014 this seasonality is barely seen in the nsidc 0116 observational product fig 6 a this nsidc 0116 bias is linked to the large uncertainties occurring during the melt season in the measured sea ice drift sumata et al 2015 nemo lim3 simulates a seasonal maximum in sea ice speed in july august when the simulated ice pack tends to a free drift state fig 6 a the timing of the minimum in arctic sia from nemo lim3 is likely responsible for such a difference with the iabp observations the simulated minimum in mean ice speed occurs in april when sea ice is seasonally thickest the general shapes of the seasonal cycles of fig 6 a comply with the past study of docquier et al 2017 albeit the magnitudes of the mean ice speed are higher in our form and skin runs than in that study as for docquier et al 2017 our configuration of nemo lim3 overestimates the mean sea ice speeds from the nsidc 0116 product in the arctic in the antarctic the ratio of the winter mean sea ice speeds from nemo lim3 and the nsidc 0116 product is close to the meridional sea ice drift correction coefficient of haumann et al 2016 barthélemy et al 2017 reported during the austral summer lower mean antarctic ice speeds than in our simulations fig 6 b we find a significant effect of sub monthly variations in the ice drift direction on the mean ice speed in the southern ocean particularly in summer when sea ice is close to a free drift state these effects explain many differences between fig 6 b and the mean seasonal ice speeds detailed by barthélemy et al 2017 nemo lim3 produces a realistic spatial distribution of the annual mean ice drift in the arctic fig 7 a the spatial extent of the beaufort sea gyre in the form run is smaller than in the nsidc 0116 product fig 7 c the simulated transpolar ice drift follows a path closer to the northern coast of the caa and greenland than the observations however the spatial distribution of the modelled ice drift is in line with other cmip3 and cmip5 models in the arctic kwok 2011 tandon et al 2018 three main atmospheric lows control the three major sea ice drift gyres around antarctica kwok et al 2017 the amundsen sea low drives the ross sea gyre and the sea ice exports to the open ocean around 180 s the riiser larsen sea low at 30 e connects to the weddell sea gyre the davis sea low steers the cyclonic ice motion around 90 e nemo lim3 reproduces these three main ice drift gyres around antarctica fig 7 b the simulated ice drift near the coast of east antarctica is higher than in the nsidc 0116 product fig 7 d additionally the simulated sea ice drift in most of the miz of the southern ocean underestimates the northward component of the observed ice drift this underestimation extends to the interior of the sea ice cover in the atlantic and pacific sectors of the antarctic the modelled trends in the annual mean arctic ice drift speed underestimate the observed trend in this quantity from the nsidc 0116 product table 3 and other studies rampal et al 2009 tandon et al 2018 lipatov et al 2021 this underestimation is present in other cmip5 models and accentuates in summer tandon et al 2018 in the southern hemisphere surface winds have intensified over the past decades leading to an acceleration of the sea ice drift zhang 2014 regional changes in surface winds drive the trends in the sea ice drift in the southern ocean kwok et al 2017 the form run captures the positive trends in the annual mean ice drift speed in the ross and weddell seas these two regions of the southern hemisphere are crucial for sea ice dynamics the simulated trends in the form run are not statistically significant in other areas of the antarctic table 3 in either hemisphere the formulation of the andc and ondc leads to only minor differences in the seasonal climatology of the mean ice drift speed in the ice pack fig 6 the impact of the form drag is small on the direction and magnitude of the annual mean ice motion vectors figs 7 e and 7 f this small impact complies with the past results from castellani et al 2018 the relative differences in the yearly mean ice speeds are less than 10 in the central arctic and antarctic ice pack the representation of the trend in arctic sea ice drift speeds degrades compared to the observations when including form drag table 3 the differences in the regional trends in this diagnostic suggest a long term effect of the form drag on the sea ice drift we advise examining this form drag effect jointly with the ice strength parameterization e g chikhar et al 2019 3 2 form drag over sea ice 3 2 1 total atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag coefficients the seasonal cycles of the mean andc and ondc from the form run share some common properties between the northern and southern hemispheres fig 8 the mean neutral drag coefficients are maximum during the melt season and minimum during freezing months the seasonality of the mean andc and ondc are nearly symmetrical because of the formulation of the individual form drag contributions the contribution from melt pond edges is the only term in the formulation of the form drag without effects on the ondc the spatial distributions in the arctic of the annual mean andc fig 9 a and ondc fig 9 b are related to the sea ice thickness fig 5 a indeed arctic regions with thicker sea ice tend to have higher neutral drag coefficients than other regions with thinner sea ice in winter martin et al 2016 the spatial distributions in the antarctic of the annual mean andc fig 9 c and ondc fig 9 c confirm this correspondence with the sea ice thickness fig 5 b in the southern hemisphere the neutral drag coefficients are highest in the ba seas and parts of the ross and weddell seas where sea ice is also thickest on average in situ measurements of the andc fluctuate highly following the region the time of the year and the surface aspect of sea ice guest and davidson 1991 andreas et al 2010 andc are approximately 1 2 10 3 to 3 1 10 3 over first year ice 1 1 10 3 to 2 7 10 3 in the miz and 1 2 10 3 to 6 7 10 3 over multiyear ice myi guest and davidson 1991 schröder 2003 moreover the spatial and temporal variability of the andc is high castellani et al 2014 cole et al 2017 heorton et al 2019 petty et al 2017 produced pan arctic estimates of the andc for early spring by combining observations from icebridge topography data and existing form drag parameterizations garbrecht et al 2002 lüpkes et al 2012 castellani et al 2014 these estimates correspond to those simulated in the arctic in the form run fig 9 a the canonical value for the ondc is usually 5 5 10 3 based on measurements collected in the beaufort sea during the aidjex campaign mcphee 1980 this value is more representative of winter sea ice conditions and myi sea ice floes in general ondc observations are restricted to certain sea ice conditions for safety and logistical reasons this makes comparisons between observations and model results challenging in the form run the december january february mean ondc in the beaufort sea varies between 3 10 3 and 5 10 3 the constant ondc used in the skin run is 6 71 10 3 this constant represents the global mean ondc weighted by the sea ice concentration when including form drag in our model setup past observations of the ondc fall within the range of 1 10 3 to 20 103 some estimates exceed this range in the beaufort greenland and bering seas shirasawa and ingram 1991 lu et al 2011 more recent ondc estimates confirm this range of values for the ondc shaw et al 2008 cole et al 2014 randelhoff et al 2014 cole et al 2017 kim et al 2017 dewey 2019 heorton et al 2019 therefore the simulated ondc is within the observational uncertainty and is of the same order as the ondc canonical value of mcphee 1980 the values of the andc and ondc from the form run are in relatively good agreement with those from existing pan arctic modelling studies tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 the spatial differences in neutral drag coefficients between these studies and the form run may arise from differences in the representation of the sea ice state the magnitudes of the winter mean andc 1 25 10 3 and ondc 5 0 10 3 simulated in the form run are close to those from tsamados et al 2014 modelling studies tsamados et al 2014 chikhar et al 2019 castellani et al 2018 report various summer mean neutral drag coefficients in the arctic the summer mean ondc from the form run for the arctic regions is closer to the results of martin et al 2016 and chikhar et al 2019 the mean of the variable andc compares better with the study of tsamados et al 2014 these various mean neutral drag coefficients suggest uncertainties in current parameterizations of the drag coefficients during the melt season as stated by brenner et al 2021 the annual mean andc and ondc from the form run experience negative trends in the arctic except locally in the chukchi sea figs 10 a and 10 b the spatial distribution of these trends is consistent with the model results of tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 showed negative trends in the mean arctic ondc in winter but positive ones in summer in the form run the trends in the arctic neutral drag coefficients strengthen during summer but do not change sign seasonally in the southern hemisphere the trends in the annual mean andc fig 10 c and ondc fig 10 d are regional and statistically significant only in the western sector of the antarctic the form run presents positive trends in the neutral drag coefficients in the ross sea but negative trends in these coefficients in the ba seas according to brenner et al 2021 numerical studies using the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 simulate a maximum in the mean arctic ondc during summer tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 chikhar et al 2019 in contrast with observations in the beaufort sea of a seasonal minimum in late summer and early fall the observed ondcs in the beaufort sea by brenner et al 2021 are principally driven by the form drag contribution associated with ice keels rather than floe edges in summer this contrasts with fig 8 b which shows the opposite for the arctic ice pack eq 1 underestimates the mean floe length in most of the arctic regions bateson 2021 as a result the seasonality of the modelled neutral drag coefficients in the arctic figs 8 a and 8 b are likely overestimated in summer due to excessive contributions from floe edges in the southern ocean floes have smaller sizes notably for antarctic sea ice being surrounded by the ocean and thus exposed to the action of waves thus the underestimation of the mean floe length by eq 1 is probably more limited in antarctic than in the central arctic furthermore β 0 5 selected for this study is closer to the suggested value of 0 3 for the antarctic and western fram strait lüpkes et al 2012 the sensitivity of the neutral drag coefficients to the contribution of floe edges will be discussed in further details in section 3 2 3 observations strongly suggest that our currently used bulk formulation eq 6 overestimates the oceanic heat flux in spring when sea ice melt re stratifies the upper ocean peterson et al 2017 however the ocean stability question remains a challenge for observational studies mcphee 1992 cole et al 2017 in addition we have considered the case for atmospheric neutral stratification over sea ice only despite the importance of the atmospheric stability for the atmosphere ice turbulent fluxes lüpkes and gryanik 2015 accounting for the ocean and atmosphere stability effects should be the focus of future model studies 3 2 2 contributions associated with sails and keels the contributions from sails and keels are a function of the height to distance ratios of sails h s d s and keels h k d k which derive from the deformed ice volume v r d g and area fraction a r d g the greater the deformed ice volume over the deformed ice area v r d g a r d g the greater the aspect ratios of sails and keels and the higher the form drag contributions from sails and keels thus regions exhibiting heavily ridged sea ice tend to have higher form drag contributions associated with sails and keels than areas with thinner and more levelled sea ice in the form run the model simulates thick and highly deformed myi in the western sector of the arctic fig 11 b this sea ice transits from the central arctic to the greenland sea through fram strait in these regions the simulated contribution of sails and keels to the neutral drag coefficients is higher than in the other areas of the arctic these results are in line with other modelling studies tsamados et al 2014 martin et al 2016 castellani et al 2018 antarctic sea ice is more seasonal thinner and less deformed than in the arctic thus the annual means of the form drag contributions from sails and keels are sensibly smaller in the southern hemisphere except in the ba seas and parts of the ross and weddell seas fig 11 f in the latter regions sea ice dynamical processes are more active and yield larger volumes of deformed ice the contributions of sails and keels are more moderate in the antarctic miz because of small sea ice concentrations in the form run the contributions of sails and keels are essential for the monthly mean andc and ondc in winter fig 8 the means of these contributions are maximum in summer because of seasonal changes in the simulated volume fractions of deformed ice in our simulations sea ice after melting is principally composed of ridged ice that has shifted from thick to thinner ice categories thus the simulated height to distances ratios of sails and keels tend to be higher in summer due to large volume fractions of deformed ice the annual means of the form drag contributions from sails and keels to the total neutral drag coefficients have significantly decreased in the arctic over the past decades 0 12 10 3 per decade for c d a r d g and 0 40 10 3 per decade for c d w r d g these changes are linked to the loss of the volume fraction of arctic myi kwok 2018 and the decline in the volume fraction of deformed ice the latter drives the negative trends in the aspect ratios of sails and keels martin et al 2016 indeed the siv and the myi fraction in the arctic reduced during the satellite era kwok 2018 the decline in the fraction arctic of myi is consistent with the decrease in the ratio of the deformed ice volume over the deformed ice area simulated by nemo lim3 in the southern hemisphere local trends in the annual mean deformed ice fraction lead to regional trends in the sail and keel contributions to the neutral drag coefficients the latter is positive in the weddell sea 0 04 10 3 per decade for c d a r d g and 0 22 10 3 per decade for c d w r d g and the northern part of the ross sea but negative in the ba seas 0 05 10 3 per decade for c d a r d g and 0 18 10 3 per decade for c d w r d g in the indian and pacific sectors of the southern ocean the changes in the annual mean deformed ice volume and area fractions are close to zero consequently the sails and keels have no significant impact on the changes in form drag over the past decades in these regions 3 2 3 contributions associated with floe edges in the form run the contributions from floe edges to the andc and ondc are prevalent during the summer months fig 8 the seasonal maximum in the contributions due to floe edges represent 27 and 42 of the total andc in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively the equivalent contributions at the ocean ice interface amount to 60 of the ondc in summer in either hemisphere observations in the beaufort sea brenner et al 2021 and model evidence in the arctic bateson 2021 indicate that eq 1 poorly represents the mean floe length especially in summer due to the definition of the form drag coefficients the bias in the prescribed floe length likely impacts both the andc and ondc in winter the effects of floe edges on the neutral drag coefficients are restricted to the miz which we expect from the lesser fraction of open water in the ice pack the contributions of floe edges to the neutral drag coefficients have only a weak signature on the mean andc and ondc in winter to examine the sensitivity of the modelled neutral drag coefficients to the prescribed floe length we make use of the sea ice conditions from the form run and the formalism of tsamados et al 2014 to calculate the form drag coefficients using this approach we determine that prescribing a constant floe length of 300m reduces the andc and ondc in the arctic to 2 3 10 3 and 7 7 10 3 in august respectively thereby almost suppressing the summer peak seen in figs 8 a and 8 b this confirms the conclusions of bateson 2021 in practice setting l f 300 m is equivalent to suppressing the form drag contribution associated with floe edges as this horizontal length largely exceeds the vertical height of floe edges when varying β from 0 5 to 1 5 in eq 1 the seasonal peak in the andc ondc is decreased by 10 25 but the shape of the peak is maintained the existence of such peak arises from definition of the floe length parameterization eq 1 this parameterization returns relatively small floe lengths as soon as sea ice concentration deviates from unity a 0 8 the seasonality of the modelled form drag contribution of floe edges in the arctic needs to be re evaluated with a more realistic formulation for floe sizes the overestimation in summer of the form drag contribution associated with floe edges in the arctic raises doubts for the representation of this contribution in the southern ocean similarly to the arctic setting a constant floe length of 300m nearly suppresses the form drag contribution of floe edges when calculating form drag with sea ice conditions from the form run however floes have smaller lengths in the southern ocean than in the arctic basin roach et al 2018 thus floe edges are likely to be more important to form drag in the antarctic than the arctic changing β from 0 5 to 1 5 in eq 1 decreases the andc and ondc to 3 1 10 3 and 14 0 10 3 respectively in the southern ocean despite of the uncertainty in the mean floe length formulation the seasonal peak in the antarctic neutral drag coefficients is maintained by the contribution from surface ridges figs 8 c and 8 d consequently the uncertainty in the floe length parameterization impacts the magnitude of the summer maximum in neutral drag coefficients but not the existence of this seasonal maximum the freeboard to floe length h f l f and draft to floe length h d l f ratios hereafter referred to as aspect ratios of floe edges control the spatial distribution of the form drag coefficients due to floe edges fig 11 a the aspect ratios of floe edges are high in the arctic miz the caa and the northern coast of greenland in these regions the small sea ice concentrations and thus the short mean floe lengths lead to a strong influence of the freeboard and draft of sea ice on the aspect ratios of floe edges on the opposite the aspect ratios of floe edges are low in the arctic ice pack because of large floes as in the arctic the aspect ratios of floe edges drive the annual mean contribution from floe edges to the andc in the southern ocean fig 11 e thick sea ice in the ba seas ross weddell and the davis seas 90 e are associated with higher aspect ratios of floe edges except in the ross sea floe lengths are maximum close to the coast of antarctica and decrease northwards with sea ice concentration the spatial maximum along the coast of antarctica strongly inhibits the effect of floe edges on the andc and ondc in this area the trends in the annual mean form drag contribution from floe edges to the total neutral drag coefficients are not statistically significant when averaged over the arctic or the regions of the antarctic the lack of statistical significance in these trends takes its origin from the variability in the freeboard to floe length and draft to floe length ratios in consequence the spatial trends in the andc and ondc displayed in fig 10 may not be explained by changes in the contribution associated with floe edges we may anticipate a greater influence of floe edges on the total form drag in the arctic in future decades as arctic sea ice is transitioning to a more seasonal state 3 2 4 surface skin drag the skin drag coefficients are the second contribution in order of importance to the seasonal cycle of the andc and ondc during winter fig 8 the skin drag contributes to the andc ondc when the distance between sails keels is less than twenty ten times the vertical height of sails keels tsamados et al 2014 these conditions are satisfied in autumn and onward in winter when the density of sails and keels decreases due to the formation of levelled sea ice through thermodynamical processes in summer sea ice melt generates a decrease in the volume fraction of deformed ice leading to a higher density of sails and keels these changes diminish the overall contribution of surface skin to the neutral drag coefficients in summer the maps of the annual mean surface skin drag coefficients in the arctic fig 11 c and antarctic fig 11 g show that the spatial distribution of this coefficient is relatively homogeneous compared to other form drag contributions we expect a small spatial variability of the skin drag coefficients in the ice pack because these coefficients aim to represent the drag effect of levelled ice 3 2 5 contribution associated with melt pond edges melt ponds appear over sea ice when the surface meltwater and precipitation collect in the depression of the ice cover in the arctic the mean melt pond area fraction of sea ice reaches a maximum of 38 in july in the skin and form runs see sterlin et al 2021 this represents a form drag contribution of 10 of the arctic andc in the antarctic melt ponds are mainly non existent because of different snow and ice surface thermodynamical processes recent observations from cruise ships suggest that the effect of melt ponds in the antarctic may be more substantial than previously thought istomina 2020 for this reason the melt pond scheme remains active in the southern hemisphere in our model version of nemo lim3 the melt pond area fraction simulated in the southern hemisphere is non negligible even though the snow and ice surface melt fluxes are small and the available meltwater for ponding is little the misrepresentation of melt ponds in the southern hemisphere arises from the redistribution of meltwater among the ice thickness categories by the melt pond scheme the scheme distributes the volume of meltwater over thin ice categories first these categories extend over large areas in the antarctic due to more seasonal and less deformed sea ice compared to the arctic as a result the simulated melt ponds are shallow 5cm depth but cover large areas 20 ponded ice area in the southern hemisphere thus the effect of melt ponds on the surface albedo is weak the impact of melt ponds on the form drag may be more problematic the mean contribution of melt pond edges represents up to 6 of the total andc in the southern hemisphere the trend in the form drag contribution associated with melt pond edges is negative in the arctic in summer in our current implementation of the melt pond scheme the refreezing mechanism of melt ponds impacts the trends in the melt pond area fractions in the arctic sterlin et al 2021 this mechanism is adjusted to decrease the melt pond volume when the ice surface temperature is less than 0 15 c and to match current observations the trend in the mean arctic melt pond area fraction of sea ice during june july august is 3 13 per decade in the form run despite this positive trend the aspect ratio of melt pond edges is reducing in summer because of smaller freeboard height in turn the negative trend in the aspect ratio of melt pond edges drives the decline in the contributions of melt ponds to the andc 3 3 impact on the ocean surface properties 3 3 1 ocean surface stress in the presence of sea ice the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients modulates the effect of surface winds and sea ice drift on the ocean surface stress the constant andc ondc over sea ice makes the wind ocean surface stress in ice covered areas directly proportional to the square of the relative surface wind sea ice drift speeds in high latitudes surface wind speeds are higher in winter than in summer because of more frequent and intense storms therefore the simulated ocean surface stress in the ice pack is more important in winter than in summer when selecting constant drag coefficients over sea ice barthélemy et al 2017 on the other hand the variable andc and ondc over sea ice break this direct relation between surface stress and relative wind or ice velocities martin et al 2016 in the form run the ocean surface stress under sea ice is maximum in summer figs 12 b 12 c despite low surface wind speeds this stress is minimum in winter when surface wind speeds are higher figs 12 a 12 d the reversal of the ocean surface stress seasonality when including form drag compared to constant drag coefficients is principally dictated by the mean seasonal cycles of the neutral drag coefficients fig 8 fig 13 further illustrates the seasonality differences in ocean surface stress between the two simulations the anti cyclonic ocean surface stress driving the beaufort sea gyre intensifies in summer and lessens in winter with form drag in the skin run this ocean surface stress is minimum in summer and maximum in winter figs 13 a 13 b in addition the form run shows higher mean ocean surface stresses than the skin run in fram strait and the central arctic in both summer and winter correspondingly the variable andc and ondc in these regions are higher than the constant drag coefficients used in the skin run all year round in the southern hemisphere the andc and ondc from the form run strengthen the ocean surface stress steering the weddell and the ross sea gyres during summer figs 13 c in winter the ocean surface stress decreases in the form run compared to the reference skin run figs 13 c we anticipate that our model configuration overestimates the effect of form drag on the ocean surface stress in summer because of the misrepresentation of the form drag contribution associated with floe edges the sensitivity of the modelled ocean surface stress to the contribution of floe edges may be investigated using the sea ice conditions and ocean surface state simulated in the form run this method is equivalent to varying parameters in the form drag parameterization and assuming negligible effects on the sea ice state and ocean surface velocities while the impact of form drag on the sea ice concentration is limited the effects on the ice thickness and relative ice velocity are more significant thus this method allows only a qualitative assessment of the modelled ocean surface stress sensitivity in the arctic we determine that prescribing a constant floe length of 300m removes the reversal of seasonality in ocean surface stress varying β from 0 5 to 1 5 decreases the summer maximum in the mean arctic ocean surface stress by 0 02n m 2 these results are in line with the suppression of the seasonal maximum in ondc when prescribing a constant floe length of 300meter and the decreased seasonal maximum in ondc when increasing β in the antarctic prescribing a constant floe length of 300meter or varying β modify the magnitude of the maximum in ocean surface stress during the austral summer nevertheless this seasonal maximum is calculated even without the contributions from floe edges due to the contribution from ice keels in our setup the model computes the heat and momentum fluxes at the ice ocean interface using the ice velocity relative to the ocean surface velocity this method enables the representation of the negative feedback between the ekman pumping and the relative surface velocities in polar ocean gyres namely the ice ocean stress governor mechanism meneghello et al 2018 2020 when a polar ocean gyre driven by surface stress spins up the ice velocity equalizes with the ocean surface velocity turning off the surface stress observational studies exploring the dynamic of the beaufort gyre rely on constant drag coefficients for sea ice without form drag e g meneghello et al 2017 in our model setup the curl of the ocean surface stress τ o c e shows evidence of a form drag effect on the ekman pumping in polar oceans especially in summer not shown form drag enhances the downwelling in the beaufort gyre in summer but reduces it in winter while the magnitude of the downwelling is likely biased by the prescribed mean floe length during summer we may have more confidence in the modelled upwelling during winter in the southern ocean form drag leads to a more efficient downwelling along the coastline of antarctica and a larger upwelling in the ice pack during the melt season as for the arctic regions the seasonal peak in neutral drag coefficients enhances the momentum fluxes between the ocean and sea ice systems on the other hand form drag reduces the efficiency of the ekman pumping under antarctic sea ice in winter we advise investigating ekman pumping rates with a variable formulation of the neutral drag coefficient and a more accurate floe size formulation than eq 1 the simulated interdecadal trends in the annual mean ocean surface stress exhibit stark contrasts in the ice pack depending on the formulation of the andc and ondc in the simulations fig 14 the trend in the arctic ocean surface stress is negative when selecting the parameterization of tsamados et al 2014 but positive when using constant neutral drag coefficients martin et al 2016 we confirm this result using our fully coupled ocean sea ice model in the form run the trend in ocean surface stress is 4 94 10 3 n m 2 per decade in the arctic ice pack fig 14 a the corresponding value in the skin run is 0 35 10 3 n m 2 per decade fig 14 b the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients leads to pronounced regional differences in the simulated ocean surface stress in the western sector of the antarctic notably the trend in ocean surface stress from the form run is positive in the western ross sea and the weddell sea but negative in the ba seas fig 14 c in the skin run the annual mean ocean surface stress declined in the western ross sea and increased in the weddell sea and the ba seas fig 14 d the simulated trends in ocean surface stress are similar in the eastern sector of the antarctic the trends in andc and ondc fig 10 are the main drivers of the changes in the annual mean ocean surface stress simulated in the form run in polar regions indeed the atmospheric forcing of the two model runs is identical there are only minor differences in sea ice drift between the form and skin runs because sea ice dissipates the effect of form drag on the wind stress through mechanical ice deformation the representation of the sea ice concentration in the form run is close to the one in the skin run therefore the atmospheric momentum input through the open water fraction is nearly unchanged by form drag thus the changes in ice ocean surface stress τ i o explain the differences in the total ocean surface stress τ o c e between the two simulations consequently the ondc controls τ i o and subsequently impacts τ o c e the modelled trends in the form drag contribution of keels principally explain the trends in ondc the trends of the contribution associated with floe edges being not statistically significant 3 3 2 sea surface temperature and salinity the simulated sst under polar ice differs during the melt season and in the miz essentially not shown in almost all the arctic miz the mean june july august sst in the form run is 0 5 to 1 5 c higher than in the reference skin run the interior of the arctic ice cover shows a better agreement between the two simulations in terms of sst these are close to the freezing point of seawater in the arctic miz the differences in the simulated sea ice thickness fig 5 e and sea ice concentration fig 3 f are spatially co locating with the differences in sst the thinner sea ice cover and the less consolidated miz simulated in the form run allow more heat exchanges between the ocean surface and the atmosphere than in the skin run the impact of the changes in sea ice properties on the sst concerns also the antarctic sea ice cover regions the sst in antarctic ice covered areas is generally lower during the austral summer with form drag this changes in winter when the simulated sst is close to the freezing point of seawater in the two model runs in the southern hemisphere the sea ice cover tends to be thicker fig 5 f and more consolidated fig 3 f with the variable neutral drag coefficient formulation in turn this hinders the heat exchanges between the atmosphere and the ocean leading to a lower summer sst in almost all the antarctic miz castellani et al 2018 reported higher summer mean sea surface temperature in the arctic miz when including form drag in their fully coupled ocean sea ice model in their implementation form drag acts on the transfer coefficient for momentum only the transfer coefficients for latent and sensible heat fluxes being constant these authors argue that the warming of the arctic miz is an indirect effect of changes in sea ice properties rather than a direct effect of form drag on the sst in our implementation form drag acts on the transfer coefficients for momentum latent and sensible heat fluxes over sea ice and the oceanic heat and momentum fluxes under sea ice however the impact of form drag on the simulated arctic sst is close to the one obtained by castellani et al 2018 this suggests a similar indirect effect of form drag on the sst through changes in sea ice properties form drag impacts the simulated sea ice concentration and thickness these changes in sea ice properties influence the modelled sst in summer the maps of the differences in mean sss between the form and skin runs fig 15 reveal a net increase in the sss in most ice covered areas during summer when activating the form drag scheme the mean sss is 0 89g kg and 0 52g kg higher in summer when using the formulation of tsamados et al 2014 in the arctic and antarctic respectively the increase remains visible in the central arctic and the coastal regions of the east siberian sea during winter the sss in the beaufort gyre and the caa is smaller in the form run compared to the skin run except for july and august in the southern hemisphere the higher summer mean sss simulated in the form run is predominantly observed in the vicinity of the coast and the western regions of the antarctic the sss in the antarctic miz is smaller during summer when using the form drag scheme two mechanisms involving the neutral drag coefficients may explain the higher summer mean sss simulated when activating the form drag scheme firstly the melting and freezing of sea ice control the seasonality of the sss in polar regions peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 our current implementation of the form drag impacts the turbulent heat fluxes over and under sea ice these heat fluxes affect the thermodynamics of sea ice and hence the exchange of freshwater between the ocean and ice systems secondly the form drag formalism impacts the ocean surface stress in the ice pack this stress controls the mixing of the ocean properties in the surface mixed layer enabling mixing in the upper ocean surface and the underlying water masses the net upward ocean surface freshwater flux f w allows investigating the seasonal impact of form drag on the sss through changes in sea ice melt f w includes the mass fluxes associated with evaporation precipitation river runoff and the ice ocean mass fluxes although this flux is sensitive to the form drag formalism in nemo lim3 the differences in f w between the two model runs may not alone explain the changes in sss the spatial distributions of the differences in f w between the two runs do not coincide not shown with the ones in sss fig 15 the form drag formulation enhances the freshwater input to the ocean surface in the caa and the peripheral arctic seas but damps this input in the central arctic in the antarctic the two simulations exhibit regional differences in the summer mean of f w when including form drag the freshwater input to the ocean surface is higher in the weddell and davis seas around 90 e but is smaller in the other antarctic regions these differences disagree with the near ubiquitous increase in sss in the antarctic ice pack and the freshening of the antarctic miz during the austral summer does form drag impact the seasonality of the sss through changes in ocean surface stresses castellani et al 2018 simulated an increase in the mean arctic sss in summer and a fresher beaufort gyre when selecting the form drag scheme of steiner 2001 in their model these findings agree with the form drag effects on the simulated sss in the northern hemisphere the differences in the form drag implementation between our study and the one of castellani et al 2018 point to an effect of the form drag on the ocean surface stress to explain the changes in arctic sss we find a spatial correspondence between the seasonal differences in ocean surface stress fig 13 and the differences in sss fig 15 the fresher beaufort gyre simulated when activating the form drag scheme is consistent with the increased ocean surface stress roy et al 2015 the higher summer mean ocean surface stress in the form run leads to a more efficient mixing of the water masses and a less stratified ocean surface layer than in the reference skin run obviously the underestimation of the prescribed floe lengths in the arctic likely plays a role in the summer intensification of the ocean surface stress this issue is probably less important in the antarctic the agreement of our results with the ones of castellani et al 2018 confirms the importance of form drag for the seasonality of form drag for the sss under sea ice 3 3 3 mixed layer depth the ocean mixed layer depth denoted ml hereafter corresponds to the thickness of the quasi homogeneous layer in the upper ocean ocean surface fluxes of heat momentum and mass control the seasonal cycle of the ml depth sea ice mediates the ocean surface fluxes in the polar regions the melting and freezing of sea ice act on the upper ocean stratification the sea ice concentration modulates the heat exchanges between the atmosphere and the ocean the ice ocean drag stirs the upper ocean surface usually a property difference or a gradient criterion relative to a reference depth defines the ml depth kara et al 2000 we define the ml depth in nemo lim3 as the depth at which the density is 0 01kg m 3 higher than the density at 10m depth this definition likely overestimates the simulated ml depth in deep convection regions courtois et al 2017 but is appropriate for polar regions peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 the seasonal changes in ml depth are more intense in the open ocean at high latitudes such as in the norwegian sea or the southern ocean the presence of sea ice strongly inhibits these seasonal changes in ml depth in the form run the arctic mean ml depth under sea ice is 13m in summer and 36m in winter fig 16 the simulated ml depth reaches 70m during winter in the central arctic these results agree with observed arctic ml depths over the past decades peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 in the antarctic the mean ml depth under sea ice is 17m in summer and 83m in winter in the form run the simulated ml is deeper along the coast of antarctica during winter fig 16 d pellichero et al 2017 found using various observations similar spatial distributions of the antarctic ml depth during the summer and winter months the form drag scheme strongly influences the simulation of the ml depth in ice covered regions especially in summer fig 17 the summer mean ml depths under sea ice are 22 to 38 larger in the form run with respect to the skin run in the arctic and antarctic respectively the overestimation of the summer neutral drag coefficients likely enhances these modelled differences nonetheless the form run exhibits a year long deep ml in the central arctic not featured in the skin run such a deep ml in the form run agrees with the observations of a mean ml depth between 50 and 70m during winter in the makarov and eurasian basin peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 moreover castellani et al 2018 reported a seasonal deepening of the arctic ml when using the form drag scheme of steiner 2001 the base of the winter ml under the antarctic sea ice is 10m shallower in the form run than in the reference skin run fig 17 c the changes in the ml depth along the coastline of antarctica are evidence of the strong sensitivity of the ml to the form drag formalism hydrographic profiles show a nearly ubiquitous shoaling of the arctic ml from 1979 to 2012 peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 according to these authors and petty et al 2014 winds affect the ml only in the absence of sea ice nemo lim3 captures the observed shoaling of the ml in the central arctic only fig 18 a in the model the arctic regions experiencing ml deepening correspond to regions undergoing significant negative trends in sea ice concentration the modelled sea ice losses in the peripheral arctic seas allow for a greater action of wind stress over the open water fractions and hence ml deepening the spatial distribution of the trends in arctic ml depth is similar in the form and skin runs however the modelled trends differ in magnitude fig 19 a in the central arctic the trends in ml depth are approximately 11m per decade in the form run and 4m per decade in the skin run these modelled trends are close to the observed rate of 10m to 5m reported by peralta ferriz and woodgate 2015 these authors claim that the freshening of the arctic ml is the principal driver of the ml shoaling in the arctic in our model runs the trends in the annual mean arctic sss are nearly equal in the two runs 0 11g kg per decade in the form run and 0 10g kg per decade in the skin run consequently the form drag parameterization does not question the model s ability to represent the freshening of the arctic ocean close to the surface on the other hand form drag modulates the trends in arctic ml depth in our model setup in the southern hemisphere the modelled interdecadal trends in ml depth have almost the same spatial distribution except in the bellingshausen sea the modelled ml in the form run shoals in the weddell and ross seas but deepens in the ba seas fig 19 b in the skin run the trend in the mean ba seas ml depth is not significant the ml depth trends from the two simulations differ locally by about 10m per decade along the coastline of antarctica fig 19 b these differences drop to levels below 2m in the antarctic ice pack 4 conclusion in this study we implemented the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 into the fully coupled ocean sea ice model nemo lim3 using a global configuration of this model we performed one simulation accounting for the form drag over sea ice and a second with constant neutral drag coefficients over sea ice in the second simulation the drag coefficients over sea ice are set equal to the mean of the variable neutral drag coefficients over sea ice from the first simulation using these two simulations we investigated the effect of the form drag on the sea ice cover and ocean surface properties in both the arctic and antarctic over the past four decades past model studies showed the interest in including form drag over sea ice in climate models tsamados et al 2014 castellani et al 2018 chikhar et al 2019 martin et al 2016 and their predecessors tsamados et al 2014 relied on a stand alone version of cice this excludes feedback mechanisms between the ocean and sea ice or the atmosphere our configuration of nemo lim3 features a full coupling of ocean and sea ice models forced by an atmospheric reanalysis surface product as in the model studies of castellani et al 2018 and chikhar et al 2019 we improve upon the study of castellani et al 2018 thanks to our refined ocean vertical grid the integration of a sea ice strength parameterization and an itd in the model moreover the form drag formalism of tsamados et al 2014 is conceptually different from the scheme of steiner 2001 used by castellani et al 2018 lastly our simulations are global allowing investigation of the form drag effect in the antarctic and arctic regions the salient points of our study are 1 the form drag scheme significantly affects the modelled sea ice thickness and volume in nemo lim3 sea ice is 0 1 0 5m thinner in the peripheral seas of the arctic basin and the coastal region of the ba seas but generally 0 1m thicker in the antarctic ice pack with form drag the impact is small on the simulated sea ice concentration and area with only very small differences in the peripheral seas of the arctic basin and the antarctic miz these differences relate to the ones in sea ice thickness 2 the form drag formulation weakly impacts the simulated sea ice drift the relative difference between the two model runs in sea ice drift speed is less than 10 in the central arctic and antarctic ice pack sea ice drift speeds in the caa are sensibly higher when activating the form drag scheme the differences in the simulated trend in sea ice drift speed suggest a long term effect of the form drag on the sea ice drift 3 the simulated andc and ondc exhibit a spatial and seasonal variability pertinent for sea ice and ocean modelling the simulated coefficients are maximum in summer and minimum in winter however form drag is in all likelihood overestimated in summer because of the prescribed floe length formulation of lüpkes et al 2012 brenner et al 2021 bateson 2021 the coefficients are high in the caa fram strait and the western sector of the antarctic weddell ba and ross seas these coefficients experience a negative trend in the arctic over 1980 2019 in the antarctic the trends in these coefficients are positive in the ross and weddell seas and negative in the ba seas the trends in the neutral drag coefficients are principally driven by the form drag contribution of sails and keels 4 the formulation of the neutral drag coefficients strongly impacts the ocean surface stress in polar regions in our model runs the seasonality of the variable andc and ondc damps enhances the ocean surface stress under sea ice in winter summer the enhanced summer ocean surface stress simulated with form drag needs to be confirmed with a more realistic floe size formulation on the other hand the simulated decrease in deformed ice fractions the associated decline in form drag and the negative trend in the ocean surface stress in the arctic regions show some correspondence with the observed decline in arctic myi over 1980 2019 this confirms the results of martin et al 2016 for the arctic regions the regional trends in the antarctic ocean surface stress differ significantly depending on the inclusion of form drag the annual mean ocean surface stress increases with time in the weddell and ross seas but decreases in the ba seas with form drag the signs of these regional trends agree with the changes in the variable neutral drag coefficients 5 the simulated sst in polar regions differs in summer and in the miz the summer mean sst in the arctic miz is 0 5 to 1 5 c higher with form drag whereas the summer mean sst is approximately 0 5 c smaller in the antarctic miz indirect changes in sea ice properties caused by the inclusion of form drag explain nearly all the differences in sst between the two simulations form drag increases the sss by 0 89g kg and 0 52g kg in summer under the arctic and antarctic ice pack respectively in the form run the increased summer mean ocean surface stress leads to enhanced vertical mixing altering the re stratification of the ocean surface under sea ice during the melt season the alteration of the arctic sss persists in winter suggesting significant changes in the freshwater content in the arctic ocean the effects of form drag on the arctic sst and sss are in line with the results of castellani et al 2018 based on a conceptually different form drag scheme 6 the inclusion of the form drag scheme effectively impacts the simulated ml depth in winter and summer keeping in mind that the neutral drag coefficients are likely overestimated in summer these results support the conclusions of castellani et al 2018 on the arctic ml the summer ml is 22 and 38 thicker in the arctic and antarctic with form drag respectively the form drag induces a year long deeper ml in the central arctic as seen in observations the differences in the simulated antarctic ml depth indicate a strong sensitivity of the ml to the inclusion of form drag the magnitude of the simulated trends in ml depth in both hemispheres is equally sensitive to the form drag we have not examined the stability effect in the ocean and atmospheric boundary layers a stable unstable stratification in the boundary layer enhances damps turbulent surface fluxes birnbaum and lüpkes 2002 mcphee 2012 the addition of stability effects in form drag parameterizations has a non negligible impact on the transfer coefficients in both the ocean and atmosphere mcphee 2012 lüpkes and gryanik 2015 however these effects are difficult to evaluate in the upper ocean boundary layer mcphee 1992 cole et al 2017 the simulated ondc during summer and in the miz suffer from uncertainties associated with the prescribed floe length formulation brenner et al 2021 these uncertainties also influence the simulation of lateral ice melt in the model the floe size distribution provides a feedback mechanism linking the lateral ice melt and the form drag contribution associated with floe edges therefore we advise future studies to revisit our results with a realistic floe size distribution more recently horvat and tziperman 2015 and zhang et al 2016 introduced prognostic floe size distributions for sea ice models that limit assumptions on the statistics of floes either prescribed or prognostic floe size distributions are promising in better representing floe sizes in climate models bateson et al 2022 the impact of form drag on the ocean surface is significant in our simulations with the following caveat that our study is more a sensitivity study than a modelling study aiming for performance against observations furthermore our conclusions might change in a fully coupled ocean ice atmosphere model setup recent experiments performed with such model setups show effects on the large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulations ponsoni et al 2021 accounting for form drag over sea ice is one step towards a better computation of the turbulent fluxes in polar regions credit authorship contribution statement jean sterlin conceptualization

23767,despite the increasing volume of oceanographic data the available ocean salinity data remains patently insufficient which limits studying ocean dynamics climate change and the calculation of salinity related ocean elements considering that traditional salinity reconstruction methods often suffer from various factors such as additional constraints priori physical assumptions and large of specific regression coefficients a generative adversarial networks gans based deep learning dl framework is proposed to directly construct a near real time high resolution daily three dimensional ocean subsurface salinity 3d oss dataset from a data driven perspective in this study four models with different structural combinations are designed in the china s marginal seas experimental results demonstrate that the models can successfully reconstruct the high precision and high resolution 3d oss on a daily scale in 12 depth levels from 2 m to 200 m the asymmetric inception 3dgan model with all enhanced structures has the highest accuracy the average root mean squared error rmse is 0 135psu the average coefficient of determination r2 is 0 5641 and the percent bias is 0 436 comparing with model without enhanced structures the average rmse is decreased by 22 41 when adding all the enhancement structures besides temporal and spatial error analysis are also conducted to evaluate the models performance from different aspects finally the model results are used to analyze common ocean elements such as water mass properties dynamic fields and geostrophic velocity fields demonstrating that the 3d oss dataset construction approach proposed in this study not only provides some new insights into ocean observations but also has high application values keywords deep learning ocean subsurface salinity data driven generative adversarial networks t s mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salinity is one of the fundamental and commonly measured oceanic variables apart from extensive use in climate studies williams et al 2010 salinity is also employed to indicate changes in sea level over long term understand global water cycle and improve the performances to predict the el niño southern oscillation enso hasson et al 2013 liu et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 in addition salinity is the key information for calculating the ocean density geostrophic circulation the depth of mixed layer and sonic layer etc helber et al 2010 studies at the basin scale have also emphasized the significance of salinity to halosteric variations for various time frames llovel and lee 2015 currently observational datasets different types of gridded ocean products and reconstructed salinity profiles from other ocean variables e g temperature are three main data sources for ocean salinity researches of these available observational datasets are traditionally relied upon to describe ocean salinity variations however in situ salinity observations are relatively scarce especially in comparison to temperature observations bao et al 2019 hasson et al 2013 he et al 2021 early stage salinity observations are primarily collected by ships along major trade routes or scientific research vessels in key research areas there are few direct salinity observations outside these areas bagnell and devries 2021 talley et al 2011 however a large part of these observations only contains temperature and no salinity which is due to the usage of expendable bathythermographs xbts at relatively low cost nowadays the argo program as a principal part of the global ocean observing system goos has been proposed for nearly 20 years and most of the temperature and salinity observations in the upper oceans are provided by it liang et al 2021 roemmich et al 2019 although the argo program alleviates the lack of salinity observations to some extent conventional argo floats which currently observe the open ocean volume s upper half only jayne et al 2017 are still insufficient in temporal and spatial distribution especially in the near shore areas different types of gridded ocean salinity products are another important data source to study the climate change monitor marine environment and apply in operational oceanography bagnell and devries 2021 liu et al 2020 roemmich et al 2017 tian et al 2022 for salinity fields estimation there exist two main approaches 1 objective analysis oa methods and 2 data assimilation da methods tian et al 2022 oa data products accuracy are basically relied on information propagates rules which are determined by the coverage of the observations as well as the reliability of the spatial covariance von schuckmann et al 2014 following these rules gridded salinity fields can be obtained by disseminating information from data rich areas to data sparse areas da methods creating so called reanalysis products which are impacted by model biases and assimilated observations by da algorithms forget et al 2015 stammer 2005 tian et al 2022 when producing reliable reanalysis products it is critical to reconstruct the gridded subsurface salinity which can be used as background fields to assimilate the rare observations through advanced da algorithms despite the constraints of specific algorithms and numerical models the gridded reanalysis salinity products are developed and disseminated by many institutions for operational oceanographic applications cheng et al 2020 besides obtaining salinity data directly methods of obtaining salinity data indirectly through salinity related variables are also widely explored several approaches have been adopted to reconstruct the ocean subsurface salinity oss structures involving dynamical physical and statistical meng et al 2022 2021 tian et al 2022 the physical dynamical dynamical method is over rely on simplified physical assumptions these are always the physical relationships between surface and subsurface variables guinehut et al 2012 liu et al 2019 su et al 2019b wang et al 2013 the traditional statistical approaches dependent on established surface and subsurface statistical relationships from historical observations by using multiple linear regressions and empirical modes chen et al 2020 fox et al 2002 guinehut et al 2012 han et al 2004 he et al 2021 jeong et al 2019 klemas and yan 2014 maes and behringer 2000 nardelli and santoleri 2005 sun and watts 2001 moreover researches have also proposed the variational methods with additional constraints and vertical projection operators to reconstruct oss he et al 2021 besides traditional machine learning ml methods with simple multi layer connections which form linear or nonlinear mappings from input to output variables can also be considered as statistical approaches such as the feed forward neural network random forest rf self organization mapping som and extreme gradient boosting xgboost gueye et al 2014 pauthenet et al 2022 su et al 2019a b tian et al 2022 nevertheless most of these methods need to introduce sea surface salinity sss or other variables as constraints to obtain 3d oss results for high accuracy traditional approaches also perform to heavily rely on thermodynamics and various statistical properties of temperature and salinity data there exist a large number of dynamic parameters and regression coefficients related to specific research areas which leads to the results suffer from high computational complexity computational instability and poor adaptability therefore applying these methods can be time consuming and it is difficult to achieve high precision and rapid end to end 3d oss reconstruction furthermore timeliness is also the defect of traditional methods for example as an important constraint sss cannot be obtained in real time which makes it impractical to obtain near real time high precision 3d oss reconstruction results by traditional methods thus there is a need for a data driven model which is a fast and constraint free reconstruction model with reasonable accuracy over the past decades data driven deep learning dl models have gained more and more popularity in reconstructing ocean internal variables firstly data driven dl models have flexible structures which can be used to identify non linear and complex mapping between input and output data at different scales secondly data driven dl models are less constrained by additional information and potential complex mappings of data can be extracted by stacking only multiple nonlinear layers data driven dl models have already exhibited encouraging achievements in ocean subsurface variables reconstructing such as salinity in the recent literatures meng et al proposed convolutional neural networks cnns based dl models to accurately retrieve high resolution ocean subsurface temperature and salinity parameters in monthly scale meng et al 2022 2021 song et al adopted a convolutional long short term memory network convlstm to invert ocean subsurface thermohaline fields using satellite observations song et al 2022 an improved dl model which combined light gradient boosting machine lightgbm and deep forest network was developed by dong et al to estimate the oss structure in south china sea dong et al 2022 su et al proposed a dl model for predicting global monthly ocean subsurface thermohaline structure by using bi directional long short term memory bi lstm neural networks su et al 2021 despite many successful advances and practical values have been made most of the oss reconstruction dl models are accompanied by temperature reconstructions these results are mostly focused on monthly fields or coarser temporal scales which have deficiencies for synoptic scale oceanic processes and smaller scale signals research in addition most of the proposed dl methods utilize sea surface information to obtain the salinity of a specific depth layer and cannot directly reconstruct the entire 3d structure which may lead to the reconstruction results ignoring internal relationship between vertical layers on the other hand when reconstructing the oss the existing dl models often need the sss as training input which further limits the application of these methods in real time reconstructions in comparison with temperature there have been relatively few efforts to reconstruct oss using dl models reliable and intelligent data driven dl models for accuracy 3d oss reconstruction were largely unexplored in this work a 3d data driven model is proposed within the framework of generative adversarial network gans to address the deficiencies in existing studies as a powerful dl model for data generation gan can be a promising solution to keep the spatial relationship and reconstruct higher accuracy output on a daily scale the idea of 3d gan was firstly proposed by wu et al in 2016 wu et al 2016 to generate variable and realistic 3d objects from a probabilistic space 3d gans have realized remarkable success in computer vision and geometric data modeling chan et al 2022 chu et al 2020 he et al 2016 as far as we are aware no related studies have been performed to reconstruct the ocean 3d salinity fields using 3d gan based models here we retrieve the ocean 3d salinity at 12 depth levels from ocean 3d temperature in china s marginal seas and the horizontal resolution is 1 12 given the great variability of salinity in chinese marginal seas powerful enhancement schemes such as residual structures he et al 2016 inception modules and asymmetric convolutions längkvist et al 2014 wu et al 2019 zeng et al 2016 are incorporated into our 3d gan modeling it has been shown that residual or skip connections can enhance deeper networks performance by avoiding the disappearance of small gradients the inception modules are able to capture features from different receptive fields in parallel by applying convolutions with different kernels at the same level therefore intercorrelated features in horizontal and vertical and the underlying complex t s mappings can be effectively extracted and better learned by the proposed models to perform high precision reconstruction to explore the performances of different enhancement techniques when extending the 3d gan based model for salinity reconstructing task four 3d gan based models are proposed by using different structures the core architecture of the four 3d gan based models is the same but added different enhanced structures in turn then the performances and effectiveness are verified by comparison specifically this study also utilizes a traditional tool modular ocean data assimilation system modas fox et al 2002 as a comparison benchmark to further evaluate the proposed novel 3d gan based models the daily 3d gridded thermohaline analysis fields produced by modas are deriving by near real time oceanic observations and climatological information the subsurface temperature is firstly derived by sst and ssh observations via regression relationships then oss are derived by further relationships at each depth the proposed reconstruction model in this study enriches data sources for ocean salinity research in terms of vertical dimension and horizontal resolution and it also can be applied to any other sea areas overall the innovations and contributions of this study can be summarized as the following five points 1 a high precision near real time daily frequency 3d oss reconstruction framework 3d gan was firstly proposed for operational oceanography and related applications 2 two modern enhancement structures residual connection and inception structure are creatively introduced to the 3d gan framework for dealing with complex 3d data structures vertically and horizontally while also taking into account the lightweight of the model 3 the 3d gan based models learn end to end 3d t s mapping relationships from a data driven perspective which avoids complex specific regression coefficients or physical modeling and enables better reconstruction performances for unknown mechanisms and regions with drastic changes and the reconstruction framework is highly portable 4 the proposed reconstruction framework only requires temperature without sss as a constraint so it is advantageous with high real time performance 5 the results of the model reconstruction proposed in this study are compared with the statistical based modas model which has been widely applied operationally and its accuracy and value in operational applications have been comprehensively evaluated the rest of the paper is organized as follows the study area and data are presented in section 2 the detailed statement of the proposed 3d gan based models experimental design and evaluation metrics are given in section 3 the reconstruction performance application values and discussions are assessed in section 4 finally the study is summarized and concluded in section 5 2 study area and data our study area is china s marginal seas 117 e 130 e and 24 n 41 n which is an important part northwest pacific shown in fig 1 china s marginal sea is vast and includes the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea most of the coastal waters off china are low salinity systems formed by river runoff while the outer seas are high salinity systems brought by kuroshio and its branches the waxing and waning movements of these two water systems with different natures constitute the spatial distribution characteristics of salinity with depth and location differences therefore the proposed model can be well validated by selecting the chinese marginal sea which has a strong salinity variation and regional distribution differences for the purposes of this study we employed the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom reanalysis data yu et al 2015 for models training and testing the hycom reanalysis data is produced by the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system the ncoda assimilated different types of available observations for obtaining high accuracy reanalysis products which contains temperature and salinity variables with a horizontal resolution of 1 12 the temporal resolution is 3 h the vertical levels are 41 and there are 15 year data from 2000 2015 the hycom reanalysis data is a widely recognized reanalysis product often used to generate the initial fields for forecast models training models using hycom reanalysis data is a preferable choice for models training and testing the temperature and salinity data have been daily averaged to build the suitable datasets all salinity fields are reconstructed at standard depths and the depth layers for usage are 2 10 15 20 25 35 50 70 100 125 150 and 200 m to ensure consistency it should be noted that data points were removed if any variable was empty in them the example input 3d temperature data and the 3d salinity data as labels is shown in fig 2 in addition to evaluate the reconstruction results from the proposed 3d gan based models the integrated temperature salinity dataset http mds nmdis org cn from national marine data information center nmdis of china is introduced the dataset contains salinity observations obtained from international business international exchange and cooperation institutions or projects a large number of observed salinity profiles located in china s marginal seas are available in this dataset for model accuracy validation 3 method this study explores four 3d gan based models for accurately mapping daily 3d temperature to daily 3d oss with high resolution in this section we first present the overall architecture of 3d gan model explaining the design of the original conv3d block and a performance enhanced block by using residual connections then the convolution block is future extended by advanced inception modules following experimental setup and evaluation metrics for the proposed 3d gan based models are also detailed explanation 3 1 3d gan model in our proposed 3d gan framework the generator g maps a 3d temperature data to the corresponding 3d salinity data in the same 3d space the discriminator implements a binary classification and a probability value d x is output to indicate whether the input 3d data x is real or reconstructed the proposed 3d gan framework employed leaky relu layers as activation maas et al 2013 and no pooling or linear layers are added in the proposed framework the u net navab et al 2015 is the core architecture of g the classical u net model consists two components encoder down sampling and decoder up sampling the encoder part is used to extract features and capture associated information of input data by stacked convolution blocks the decode part unites the extracted features from encode part with corresponding up sampled outputs in decode part via skip connections to achieve more accurate reconstruction this design allows the network to capture spatial dependencies in the contracting part the architecture of the u net is shown in fig 3 in the u net based g we designed six conv3d deconv3d blocks are used in the encoding and decoding process each conv3d block input is concatenated with the respective encoder output layer to avoid the vanishing of gradients the conv3d block is shown in fig 4 the designed conv3d block using one convolutional layer and same padding followed by batch normalization bn the dropout layer shown in fig 4 is applied to realize regularization and leaky relu function is finally used as activation as is shown in fig 3 the input size of the generator is levels latitude longitude where levels are the depth levels of the 3d data latitude is the input latitude size and the longitude is the input latitude size in encoding process the reduction in the first three dimensions is carried out by conv3d in our case but feature maps number grows in the fourth dimension by convolutional filters those extracted and composed features are subsequently utilized to reconstruct output data in decoding process corresponding to this is the decoding process the deconv3d block increases the number of the first three dimensions while the feature maps number reduces in the fourth dimension then the skip connection is achieved via the same number of feature maps obtained from the encoding and decoding process since proposed 3d gan based models contain two networks g and d two loss functions are used the original gan model uses cross entropy loss to realize the adversarial training of two networks eq 1 presents the loss function of g 1 min g v g d e x p d a t a x log d x e x p z z 1 log d g z eq 2 expresses the loss function of d 2 max d v g d e x p d a t a x log d x e z p z z 1 log d g z where x p d a t a x represents the distribution of real input data x z is a randomly sampled noise vector from a distribution p z through adversarial training the two networks can reach nash equilibrium state that is the d cannot judge the data generated by g due to the input of our proposed 3d gan based models are not random noise and labeled with 3d oss data following mirza and osindero 2014 the binary cross entropy loss presents as 3 l 3 d g a n g d e x y log d x y e x z log 1 d x g x z where x is the input temperature data in a levels latitude longitude space y is labeled salinity data in the same space corresponding to the input data z represents randomly sampled noise but added in form of some dropout layers in the proposed 3d gan based models in addition to cross entropy loss reconstruction loss isola et al 2017 is introduced for g which are the differences between the original salinity data and the reconstructed salinity data this g loss can be expressed as 4 l g rloss g e x y z y g x z 1 overall the loss function can be written as 5 l g d l 3 d g a n g d α l g rloss g g tries to minimize this objective function against an adversarial d that tries to maximize it 6 g arg min g max d l 3 d g a n g d α l g rloss g where α is a hyperparameter to adjust the weight of the l1 loss for stronger reconstruction performance a residual structure is introduced to the conv3d block to form the residual block the residual block includes two convolutional layers to augment its learning capacity so that more temporal and spatial information in the inputs can be preserved previous studies have shown that blindly increasing network depth does not improve network performance and also makes the network difficult to optimize the introduction of the residual structure effectively alleviates this problem the residual structure adopting skip connection can realize an identity mapping that is the newly added layers of each residual block only focus on the current residual mapping and do not affect the achieved network performance as shown in fig 5 the residual block can be seen as the conv3d block s extension specifically we use two convolutional layers followed by bn layers seeking to enhance the network s robustness as well as alleviate the vanishing gradient problem besides the kernel size and loss function are consistent with the ones utilized in 3d gan model 3 2 inception 3dgan model in addition to deepening the network by stacking convolution blocks to obtain better performances enlargement the width of the network that is performing multiple scale convolution block operations on the same convolution layer for input data in parallel will obtain better data representation in this study the 3d oss fields are reconstructed by the 3d temperature fields the temperature and salinity s characteristics in the study area are complex and changeable throughout the entire space time scale therefore it is difficult capture both global and local feature information using only a single kernel size driven by the validity of inception modules in fernández et al 2022 szegedy et al 2016 we introduce inception modules to get more powerful convolution blocks the inception structure has excellent topological characteristics which can obtain different information from input data in parallel and output results are concatenated into a very deep feature map which in essence will make the network wider adopting this module parallel convolutions firstly split the input data stream by different kernel sizes then a 1 1 1 convolution is employed to concatenate the parallel branches thus the network learns to prefer branches with the best fitting kernels over time in essence this scheme lets the network use different kernels to accomplish tasks and the most relevant kernels will be given more weights given the residual block mentioned above the inception structure is introduced in order to further improve the reconstruction performance it is worth noting that the inception structure proposed by googlenet in the early stage uses the kernel size of n n which will cause the bottleneck of characterization and large amount of computation consumption motivated by the need for parameters reduction in the inception 3dgan model we introduce a lightweight but more efficient inception residual block accordingly asymmetric convolutions are utilized to reduce the complexity of the parallel convolutions wu et al 2019 the kernel size of n n is decomposed into 1 n and n 1 which keeps the same performances with considerably fewer parameters the inception residual block is shown in fig 6 each parallel branch is composed of three simplified asymmetric convolutions and residual connection is applied by skips the parallel branches here in particular an inception block without convolution simplification is designed for comparison the same parallel branches as the inception residual block shown in fig 6 but two consecutive 3 3 3 convolution operations are employed to approximated represent the 5 5 5 convolution making the computational cost relatively reduced 3 3 experimental setup in this work we designed four 3d gan based models for daily 3d oss reconstruction the four models and experiment cases are shown in table 1 table 1 shows that case a and case b correspond to 3d gan model and residual 3d gan model expressed in section 3 1 case c correspond to inception 3dgan model with unsimplified convolutions and case d correspond to asymmetric inception 3dgan model with asymmetric convolutions the designs have all expressed in section 3 2 the four designed reconstruction models aim to build the relationships between the 3d temperature data and corresponding 3d oss data more precisely these 3d gan based models map the input temperature data to the target oss data there exist two steps for reconstruction model building and model reconstruction the flowchart is shown in fig 7 in model building the model is trained and evaluated based on the hycom reanalysis data from 2000 2013 and 2015 the resolution of all data is 1 12 and some days with bad quality grid points has been deleted after quality control the inputs of model training are the temperature and corresponding salinity fields with 12 depth levels of china s marginal seas which are used as training inputs and training labels respectively through adversarial learning 3d gan based models gs learned mapping relationships from temperature to salinity in step two of model estimation 3d oss fields in 2014 are reconstructed by inputting corresponding 3d temperature fields then the reconstructed 3d oss fields are evaluated by field observations in the study areas moreover the hycom reanalysis salinity data in 2014 are also used for accuracy evaluation all the proposed 3d gan based models are trained with the same data and parameters both g and d are updated through a direct training procedure in every batch however the learning speed of d is usually higher than that of g probably because 3d space data generation is more challenging than distinguishing whether the data is real or reconstructed wu et al 2016 then it is difficult for g to get effective improvement feedbacks from a far ahead d since all the samples it generated would be correctly distinguished as reconstructed to keep the training of both networks synchronized the decaying learning rate is employed for d during the training process which is helpful for training stability and getting better results both g and d are trained using the adam optimizer hyperparameters may affect model performance the setting of some hyperparameters are given in table 2 3 4 evaluation metrics the performances of the proposed 3d gan based models are assessed by the root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r 2 and percent bias the three statistical metrics evaluates the reconstructed salinity results from different perspectives rmse is a commonly used evaluation metric that represents the errors between the model output and the label data the strength of the linear relationship between model output and the label data are quantified by r 2 and the over or underestimated of the model results are indicated by percent bias for rmse and percent bias a well performing model will get a value close to 0 for r 2 a well performing model will get a value close to 1 the definitions of the three evaluation metrics are described in eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 7 r m s e i 1 n s o b s e r v e d i s m o d e l i 2 i 1 n s o b s e r v e d i s o b s e r v e d i 2 8 r 2 1 i 1 n s o b

salinity value in the same depth levels as s the 3d gan based model reconstructed and observed salinity are respectively represented by the subscripts model and observed i represents the ith validation point and n is the number of validation points 4 results and discussions the validity of the reconstructed data needs to be interpreted and verified in two main aspects namely accuracy and the ability to correctly represent the salinity characteristics of the study area where accuracy verification is assessed in terms of overall accuracy temporal error distributions and spatial error distributions using the salinity profiles provided by nmdis as the true values salinity phenomena and ocean related elements are calculated based on the reconstructed salinity data compared with the calculated results from hycom reanalysis data this section provides the salinity reconstruction results at 12 different depth levels of case a to case d and modas model in china s marginal seas in 2014 firstly the overall performances of all five models are carefully evaluated in terms of the evaluation metrics described in section 3 4 by using all available salinity observations next the performance and robustness of all the models are evaluated from temporal and spatial analysis finally as a further check on the accuracy of the reconstruction results and their applied value the water mass characteristics dynamic height as well as geostrophic velocity fields are calculated and analyzed in the study areas 4 1 overall reconstruction performance to quantify the overall reconstruction performance the averaged rmse r2 and percent bias of case a to case d as well as modas are shown in table 3 the statistical examination results are all layers from the surface 2 m down to 200 m over the china s marginal seas during 2014 compared with in situ observations as shown in table 3 the averaged rmses of all models have reached below 0 2 psu the smallest averaged rmse is apparent for case d which is 0 135 psu at all 12 vertical depths the averaged rmse of modas is slightly higher than that of case d which is 0 146 psu the accuracy of case a is the lowest and the averaged rmse is 0 174 psu from case a to case d there is a significant improvement in accuracy the averaged rmses of case b case c and case d are decreased by 5 17 10 34 and 22 41 respectively which using case a as a benchmark this indicates that including residual structure and inception structure can make the model learn more effective mapping relationships thus significantly promoting the model s performance therefore the case d model with the most complex structure can obtain the optimal performance and surpass the traditional modas model in overall performance the results of averaged r2 are basically consistent with averaged rmses the highest averaged r2 is case d with 0 5641 but the averaged r2 of modas is lower than case b and case c which indicates that modas s reconstructed and target salinity have relatively poor linear relationships percent bias indicates whether the models reconstruction of salinity is biased or not it can be seen from table 3 percent bias of all the models are close to zero percent indicating excellent reconstruction performance without obvious deviations percent bias of case d is the lowest only 0 436 generally speaking model performance rises steadily with the increment of the enhanced structure and all metrics fall within reasonable limits fig 8 shows the overall reconstruction performances of case a to case d and the traditional modas model using the averaged rmses at 12 different depths as shown in fig 9 the overall trend of averaged rmses from case a to case d is consistent at 12 depth layers and the averaged rmse values fluctuate slightly at 2 35 m but decrease overall the averaged rmses at the depth of 35 m to 100 m decreased significantly and then increased slightly at the depth of 125 m but then decreased reaching the minimum value at the depth of 150 m about 0 075 psu this further proves that case d has the best performance under the same conditions the averaged rmse values of the modas are close to case d at the depth of 2 70 m and the accuracy is slightly higher than case d at some depth layers such as 15 m and 70 m however the averaged rmse value of modas increased significantly at 100 m reaching close to 0 15 psu this is probably because 70 m is the depth with drastic changes in this study areas then the averaged rmses decreased at the depth of 125 200 m the accuracy of these layers is somewhat different from that of case d and close to that of case c this indicates that the traditional modas are excellent in the shallow layers but the results are not satisfactory in the deeper layers and some layers with more drastically changes it also shows that the case d can accurately reconstruct the oss of china s marginal seas using 3d temperature data with outstanding performance the density scatter plots are also a widely used method to directly evaluate the reconstruction performance here the performance of the case d is future evaluated by the density scatter plots the scatter distribution of the salinity from case d reconstruction and in situ observations at 25 m 50 m 70 m and 100 m for all available observational points in 2014 is shown in fig 9 for scatter plots any errors between the observations and reconstructions may lead to a spread in the distribution it is can be seen from fig 9 most of the points are around the diagonal line indicating a perfect match between observations and reconstructed results in all four sampling depths although there are relatively large errors between the reconstruction results and the actual observations in a few points most differences of the reconstruction observations appear to be within 0 2 psu for a well performing dl model not only a good structural design is required but also the use of a suitable loss function therefore here this study adopts the structural design of the case d model that has been verified to be optimal and train the model using only the adversarial loss i e remove the l1 loss and design a new case d base model to verify the effect of reconstructing the loss function on the model reconstruction effect based on the optimal structure the overall evaluation results of case d base are shown in table 4 from table 4 we can see that the rmse of case d base is 0 167 psu which is higher than the rmse of case d the r 2 is 0 478 which also has some difference compared with the reconstruction result of case d the percent bias is 0 45 which indicates that the case d base model has no over or underestimated the reconstruction results the comparisons between case d and case d base models show that the reconstruction loss function has a positive effect on the reconstruction results of the model 4 2 temporal error analysis after the overall performance evaluations this part will further verify the performance of case a to case d and model according to different time scales firstly the performance of all the models in different seasons are discussed fig 10 a d shows the accuracy of salinity reconstruction results from case a to case d and modas in spring summer autumn and winter of 2014 respectively here the results at the different depth levels 2 10 15 20 25 35 50 70 100 125 150 and 200 m in terms of the averaged rmse are shown for illustration as it is shown in this figure that the accuracy of salinity reconstruction results in winter is the highest and the averaged rmses of salinity reconstruction from case a to case d and modas are all below 0 15 psu except for the averaged rmse values of case a at 10 m 15 m and 70 m which are significantly higher than those of other models there is no significant difference in the accuracy of these models at different layers this is mainly because salinity in winter is not significantly different in each layer and all the models can well reconstruct the winter salinity of the study area although the advantages of case d are not well reflected in winter the overall trend of accuracy is still gradually improving from case a to case d while the accuracy of modas is close to that of case d spring is the season with the second highest accuracy of salinity reconstruction as shown in fig 10 a the averaged rmse values of all models are below 0 25 psu it is notable that in spring the accuracy of case a to case d is not gradually improved in each layer and the accuracy of case a and case b is better in some layers although the accuracy of case d cannot reach the highest level in each layer in spring the accuracy of its reconstruction results can remain stable in all depth layers without obvious jump which indicates that case d has very stable performance and strong robustness at different depths and times the modas results show a significant jump at 150 m and its averaged rmse value is significantly higher than the averaged rmse values from case a to case d this illustrates that compared with the deep learning based models the robustness of the modas model is poor fig 10 b shows the results in summer as can be seen from this figure the accuracy of modas results is significantly different from case a to case d at 2 10 m and 100 m the averaged rmse values of modas are significantly higher than that of other models especially at 2 m where the averaged rmse value exceeds 0 3 psu the results of case a to case d are relatively stable in summer and case d has the highest accuracy in all layers which shows superior performance of case d the results in autumn are shown in fig 10 c in this figure case a and case b have the worst reconstructed salinity results in this time period and the reconstruction accuracy is far from that of case c and case d the performance of modas model in autumn is not satisfactory especially the averaged rmse values of 15 m 35 m are significantly higher than that of case c and case d however the accuracy of case d remains stable in autumn and the averaged rmse values are below 0 2 psu in all 12 depth layers through seasonal analysis it can be concluded that case d not only has the advantage of high reconstruction accuracy but also has good robustness and can still obtain satisfactory results for the time or depth with relatively severe salinity changes in order to further verify the reconstruction performance the rmse comparisons between the five models on daily scale are carried out according to the previous analysis the reconstruction results of case d model are the best so in the daily analysis we compared the reconstruction results of each model with case d the comparison results for a total of 266 days are shown in fig 11 fig 11 a is a comparison between case d and case a it can be seen from this figure that the averaged rmse values of the two models at daily scale are all below 0 5 psu and the trend of the averaged rmse curve is consistent but case d has obviously higher accuracy similarly comparing case d with case b fig 11 b shows the same trend of averaged rmse curve and case d has higher accuracy fig 11 c shows the comparison results of case d and case c on daily scale which is slightly different from figs 11 a and 11 b while the trend of averaged rmse curves is basically consistent and the accuracy is almost the same on some days there are still large gaps on several days it can be seen from the comparison that case d still maintains its advantages fig 11 d shows the comparison results of case d and modas model on daily scale as shown in this figure the averaged rmse value of modas model has a significant jump on some days with the highest value exceeding 0 8 psu on some days the result of modas model is slightly better than that of case d in short time series plots reveal that case d can satisfactorily reconstruct 3d oss in almost all days while achieving better performance compared with other models the 3d gan model with a combination of residual structure and asymmetric inception has a relatively simple structure and better performance compared to the conventional modas generally all models performances are best in days with uniform salinity distributions and degrades in days with salinity variability but case d is more stable 4 3 spatial error analysis next to further assess the reconstruction results of different models we also compared the models reconstructed 3d oss with the salinity profiles in typical regions the selection of areas is based on the distribution of available profile data due to the available profile data are mainly concentrated in the southern ys and the ecs we divide the area where the profile is concentrated into three square areas 123 130e 24 27n 123 130e 27 30n and 123 130e 30 33n which are named squares a b and c fig 12 displays the spatial distribution of observation profiles and regional division in the whole study areas in 2014 fig 13 shows the averaged rmse values at 12 depth levels from 2 m to 200 m of three different square areas from all observations in 2014 the averaged rmse values in vertical between the five models and the in situ observations are all less 0 2 psu for square a as shown in fig 13 a in the whole depth layer the overall changes trend from case a to case d are basically consistent at 2 m the result of modas is relatively poor but the accuracy of other depth layers is closest to case d although there are some differences all models reconstructed salinity fields are in good consistency with the observed salinity profiles as shown in figs 13 b and 13 c the reconstruction results of square b and square c are not as accurate as square a especially for the modas model at 2 35 m the averaged rmse values of modas differ greatly from other models with the maximum error reached 0 4 psu at approximately 10 m depth fig 10c this is due to the fact that square b and c contain the east china sea kuroshio which changes the hydrographic conditions through thermal salt exchange when it flows through the east china sea resulting in drastic changes in salinity distribution within the area the models are affected by complex internal ocean processes and the accuracy of the reconstruction results is slightly degraded in addition we selected a specific profile in one day through the study area to show the reconstruction results of the five models fig 14 shows the comparison of the specific in situ profile 128 101 e 28 601 n and model estimated oss in october 16 2014 it can be seen from fig 14 that the result of case d is the most consistent with the measured salinity profile data although the results of other models are consistent with the measured data in the overall change trend the accuracy is slightly insufficient fig 15 displays the error maps of reconstructed oss by case d model and in situ profiles at 7 depth levels 2 15 25 35 50 100 and 200 m these error maps are the errors between the reconstructed results and the field observations on october 16 2014 fig 15 a indicates locations of these verification profiles as shown in fig 15 b h there are no significant differences between the reconstructed salinity and ground truth observations the major differences are less than 0 15 psu moreover to analyze the overall salinity distribution of case d in the entire study area fig 16 shows the distributions of labeled data hycom reanalysis data case d and the salinity differences namely labeled data minus case d estimation in january 1 2014 and the selected depth levels are 25 m 50 m and 100 m as a whole the model reconstructed salinity patterns fig 16 b e and h are almost the same as the labeled ones fig 16 a d and g implying an excellent performance of case d model fig 16 c f and i display the salinity differences of 25 m 50 m and 100 m respectively it can be seen from these figures that the major differences are appeared at depths 25 m and 50 m in ys area around 32 n to 35 n the reconstructed salinity values in the east china sea region are in good agreement with the label data in all layers and the maximum error is below 0 4 psu overall the reconstructed salinity patterns from case d agree well with the reanalysis data and correctly reflects most features and details fig 17 shows the cross section maps of the labeled data case d and their differences in january 1 2014 from this figure it can be seen that the salinity patterns in fig 17 a and b are highly consistent and the error range shown in fig 17 c is below 0 15 psu through spatial error analysis the results of the five reconstructed models are presented in their whole spatial distribution especially the case d the outstanding effect of case d model is strongly validated by the observed salinity profile data and the corresponding reanalysis data fig 18 shows the spatial distribution of rmses between case d results and hycom at some depths for year 2014 it can be seen from this figure that the rmses of each layer are have the smallest rmses in the range of 24 n 30 n while the 25 m layer in fig 18 a has larger rmses values in the rectangular region of 30 n 34 n 123 e 126 e which may be due to the more drastic variation of salinity in this rectangular region the rmses of 100 m shown in fig 18 c are basically around 0 1 psu indicating that the case d reconstructed results of the deep layers are in better agreement with hycom 4 4 application of reconstructed salinity data after error analysis the reconstruction results of case d have the highest accuracy and stability in both time and space in this part we will analyze and calculate the properties of marine elements based on the reconstructed salinity by case d and further verify the application values of the reconstructed salinity in marine scientific research and marine elements due to most of the ocean elements also need temperature for calculation and analysis hycom temperature reanalysis data is used in the following calculations 4 4 1 presentation of water mass characteristics water mass is defined by its temperature and salinity and its characteristics often play important roles in oceanographic research emery 2001 analysis of the t s diagrams allows us to come to the several conclusions about the thermohaline water mass structure and its seasonal variability given the number of observations and hydrological properties the study areas water mass characteristics in different seasons are investigated by using case d s reconstruction meanwhile the observed t s profiles and hycom reanalysis data are adopted for comparison figs 19 a i show the t s diagrams of observed profiles reconstruction and hycom data at all 12 depths from 2 m to 200 m during 2014 the potential density is also shown in fig 19 as contour it can be seen from fig 18 that in the four seasons both the reconstructed salinity and hycom reanalysis data have high consistency t s scatter diagrams with the measured data in spring fig 19 a b the salinity changes primarily between 34 0 psu and 34 5 psu similar to the hycom reanalysis data the reconstructed field is consistent with the observed data and reflects the hydrological characteristics well the t s diagrams for summer is clearly clustered shown in fig 19 c and d in summer the temperature changes much with concerting around 10 c 25 c but its salinity does not exhibit a relatively obvious variation in autumn and winter t s diagrams in fig 19 e f and g i show relative dispersion with different densities from the other two seasons overall the t s diagrams plotted from the salinity results of case d agree well with the reanalysis data and field observations indicating that the model results can be used as a data source for ocean properties 4 4 2 dynamic height to further apply the reconstructed salinity by case d model the dynamic height dh of the study areas is calculated dh is the density related ocean element which can be calculated from temperature and salinity fields in this study the temperature fields are from hycom data and salinity fields are from case d reconstructed results and the hycom data hence two different dh fields for comparison are then obtained the definition of dh is 10 d h p 1 p 2 δ t s p d p where δ represents the specific volume anomaly and the definition of it is 11 δ t s p γ t s p γ 0 c 35 p s u p γ is the specific volume of seawater dh can serve as the streamfunction of the geostrophic velocity shear δ v 12 f δ v g d h where g and f represent the acceleration of gravity and coriolis parameter vector respectively here the surface level is selected as the reference level according to the reference level geostrophic velocity at each level is then obtained fig 20 shows the dh map at four sampled depth levels 25 m 50 m and 100 m in january 1 2014 the salinity fields are deriving from the hycom data and reconstructed the dh maps prepared from reconstructed data fig 20 a c and e have patterns similar to the dh map calculated from hycom data fig 20 b d and f the key differences between the different source dh maps are in ys area around 32 n to 35 n while the results are consistent with previous analysis fig 20 shows the dh maps at four sampled depth levels 25 m 50 m and 100 m in january 1 2014 the salinity fields are derived from the hycom data and reconstructed one the dh maps prepared from reconstructed data fig 20 a c and e have patterns similar to the dh map calculated from hycom data fig 20 b d and f the key differences between the different source dh maps are in the ys area around 32 n to 35 n while the results are consistent with previous analysis the distributions of these layers are similar as seen in fig 20 which indicates continuity in the vertical direction and relatively low temperature and salinity gradients in these layers however they still differ in detail as well as in the range of values indicating a non uniform distribution of temperature and salinity between these depths high dh is caused by high temperature or low salinity while low dh is the opposite for example from fig 20 a and b it can be found that the higher values at 123 e 126 e and 24 n 27 n located in the east china sea region are the combined result of temperature and salinity distribution at 100 m fig 20 e f the area of high dh values decreases relative to the shallow layer which also indicates the continuity and relative thermohaline gradient between different depths after examining the winter dh distribution characteristics a further analysis was conducted in the study on june 10 2014 which is in summer fig 21 shows the dh maps at three sampled depth levels 25 m 50 m and 100 m in june 10 2014 it can be seen from fig 21 that the dh maps derived from reconstructed salinity as well as hycom salinity calculations are similar in general but there are local differences unlike fig 19 in winter there are more obvious differences in the distribution of dh maps in different layers which indicates that the temperature and salinity change drastically in the summertime and there are significant gradient changes between different layers geostrophic velocities at one depth relative to the counterparts at another are calculated with dynamic heights where the dynamic height or geopotential anomalies are integrated vertically from p1 to p2 the surface p1 is the reference level the dh is the streamfunction for the difference between geostrophic flows from one depth to another figs 22 and 23 exhibit the cross section of the geostrophic velocity fields derived from both the hycom and the reconstructed data in january 1 and june 10 2014 respectively there is almost no difference in geostrophic velocity fields between hycom data calculation figs 22 a 23 a and the reconstructed salinity of case d calculation figs 22 b 23 b from the comparison of figs 22 and 23 it can be found that there are obvious differences in geostrophic velocity fields in different seasons which is consistent with the analysis results of dh distributions in different seasons for example the results in figs 22 and 23 show large differences near 100 m depth indicating that the gradient is small large near this depth in winter summer overall the results suggest that the reconstructed salinity can also be adapted to the estimation and analysis of common ocean elements 5 conclusion in this study a novel 3d gan based framework is proposed for 3d oss reconstruction from ocean 3d temperature data in a daily scale the proposed framework is in a data driven aspect which aims to directly learn underlying complex 3d mapping from ocean temperature to salinity through training without additional constraints priori physical assumptions and large of specific regression coefficients for more reliable and precision reconstruction results residual connections and inception modules are added to the 3d gan based framework due to their powerful enhancement capabilities more precisely the 3d gan based framework can be efficiently extended both in depth and width by using the two structures taking the china s marginal seas as the modeling area four salinity reconstruction models are designed using 3d gan as the core framework and combining two augmentation techniques namely case a case b case c and case d as described in section 3 3 the four designed models are progressively built from simple to advanced and the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework and network designs are verified by comparison in addition the 3d oss reconstructions of statistical based modas tool is used as a comparative benchmark to further validate the advantages of the data driven model the performances of four 3d gan based models as well as modas tool are evaluated in different perspectives by using rmse r2 and percent bias overall the comparisons results showed that the oss reconstructed by the case d model with residual connections and asymmetric convolutions in parallelly have the lowest averaged rmse value of 0 135 psu and the lowest averaged percent bias value of 0 436 the overall averaged r2 value is the highest at 0 564l indicating that the case d model accurately reconstructed the oss of china s marginal seas and outperformed the other models the overall average rmse of case d is 22 41 lower than that of case a without enhanced structures which demonstrates that adding the extended structures can effectively and more often extract interrelated features from horizontal or vertical directions to achieve higher accuracy of 3d temperature to salinity mapping next the results of the analysis at different spatial and temporal scales further validate that 3d gan framework core with addition enhanced structures can reconstruct the 3d salinity field with high accuracy during the study the reconstruction accuracy of each model was detailed analyzed in different seasons different partitions different days and even different layers on the same day although the performances of case d model do not perform optimally in some cases for example modas performs slightly better in spring the overall case d model was still absolutely superior and the accuracy increased sequentially from case a to case d in addition from the previous analysis results we can also conclude that case d has strong robustness and the reconstruction results remain stable across days and layers unlike the modas results where the accuracy values jump i e the accuracy of a layer on some days decreases sharply and is much lower than other results finally the results of case d are employed to participate in the analysis and calculation of some common marine elements as a way to show its application values through the comparative analysis of water mass properties dynamic fields and geostrophic velocity fields it is found that the results obtained by using case d are highly consistent with those obtained by using the reanalysis data which shows that the reconstructed results of proposed data driven dl model are not inferior to those of the reanalysis data this study provides a new high precision and high resolution near real time data source constructing approach for ocean salinity studies from a data driven aspect remarkable performances for reconstruction oss on a daily time scale are found in our proposed 3d gan based model which can be used to build daily time scale datasets in different ocean areas for synoptic scale ocean processes studies in general in situ salinity data are scarce and traditional salinity reconstruction methods are often limited by complex and incompletely physical or statistical parameters which are still not fully understood in big data era data driven dl models provides some new insights and show exhibit great potential for dl based generative models the newly proposed diffusion generative model framework is developing rapidly in recent years and has shown a tendency to surpass the gan model framework it is necessary to keep pace with the times and keep exploring under the diffusion model framework for different reconstruction tasks different model frameworks need to be carefully evaluated and compared to obtain more advanced improved and well performing models besides the ever advancing space remote sensing technologies will further promote the acquisition of multiple earth resource data and in the near future high accurate sss data are likely to be available in real time which will bring new opportunities and challenges for the progress of data driven

23767,despite the increasing volume of oceanographic data the available ocean salinity data remains patently insufficient which limits studying ocean dynamics climate change and the calculation of salinity related ocean elements considering that traditional salinity reconstruction methods often suffer from various factors such as additional constraints priori physical assumptions and large of specific regression coefficients a generative adversarial networks gans based deep learning dl framework is proposed to directly construct a near real time high resolution daily three dimensional ocean subsurface salinity 3d oss dataset from a data driven perspective in this study four models with different structural combinations are designed in the china s marginal seas experimental results demonstrate that the models can successfully reconstruct the high precision and high resolution 3d oss on a daily scale in 12 depth levels from 2 m to 200 m the asymmetric inception 3dgan model with all enhanced structures has the highest accuracy the average root mean squared error rmse is 0 135psu the average coefficient of determination r2 is 0 5641 and the percent bias is 0 436 comparing with model without enhanced structures the average rmse is decreased by 22 41 when adding all the enhancement structures besides temporal and spatial error analysis are also conducted to evaluate the models performance from different aspects finally the model results are used to analyze common ocean elements such as water mass properties dynamic fields and geostrophic velocity fields demonstrating that the 3d oss dataset construction approach proposed in this study not only provides some new insights into ocean observations but also has high application values keywords deep learning ocean subsurface salinity data driven generative adversarial networks t s mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salinity is one of the fundamental and commonly measured oceanic variables apart from extensive use in climate studies williams et al 2010 salinity is also employed to indicate changes in sea level over long term understand global water cycle and improve the performances to predict the el niño southern oscillation enso hasson et al 2013 liu et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 in addition salinity is the key information for calculating the ocean density geostrophic circulation the depth of mixed layer and sonic layer etc helber et al 2010 studies at the basin scale have also emphasized the significance of salinity to halosteric variations for various time frames llovel and lee 2015 currently observational datasets different types of gridded ocean products and reconstructed salinity profiles from other ocean variables e g temperature are three main data sources for ocean salinity researches of these available observational datasets are traditionally relied upon to describe ocean salinity variations however in situ salinity observations are relatively scarce especially in comparison to temperature observations bao et al 2019 hasson et al 2013 he et al 2021 early stage salinity observations are primarily collected by ships along major trade routes or scientific research vessels in key research areas there are few direct salinity observations outside these areas bagnell and devries 2021 talley et al 2011 however a large part of these observations only contains temperature and no salinity which is due to the usage of expendable bathythermographs xbts at relatively low cost nowadays the argo program as a principal part of the global ocean observing system goos has been proposed for nearly 20 years and most of the temperature and salinity observations in the upper oceans are provided by it liang et al 2021 roemmich et al 2019 although the argo program alleviates the lack of salinity observations to some extent conventional argo floats which currently observe the open ocean volume s upper half only jayne et al 2017 are still insufficient in temporal and spatial distribution especially in the near shore areas different types of gridded ocean salinity products are another important data source to study the climate change monitor marine environment and apply in operational oceanography bagnell and devries 2021 liu et al 2020 roemmich et al 2017 tian et al 2022 for salinity fields estimation there exist two main approaches 1 objective analysis oa methods and 2 data assimilation da methods tian et al 2022 oa data products accuracy are basically relied on information propagates rules which are determined by the coverage of the observations as well as the reliability of the spatial covariance von schuckmann et al 2014 following these rules gridded salinity fields can be obtained by disseminating information from data rich areas to data sparse areas da methods creating so called reanalysis products which are impacted by model biases and assimilated observations by da algorithms forget et al 2015 stammer 2005 tian et al 2022 when producing reliable reanalysis products it is critical to reconstruct the gridded subsurface salinity which can be used as background fields to assimilate the rare observations through advanced da algorithms despite the constraints of specific algorithms and numerical models the gridded reanalysis salinity products are developed and disseminated by many institutions for operational oceanographic applications cheng et al 2020 besides obtaining salinity data directly methods of obtaining salinity data indirectly through salinity related variables are also widely explored several approaches have been adopted to reconstruct the ocean subsurface salinity oss structures involving dynamical physical and statistical meng et al 2022 2021 tian et al 2022 the physical dynamical dynamical method is over rely on simplified physical assumptions these are always the physical relationships between surface and subsurface variables guinehut et al 2012 liu et al 2019 su et al 2019b wang et al 2013 the traditional statistical approaches dependent on established surface and subsurface statistical relationships from historical observations by using multiple linear regressions and empirical modes chen et al 2020 fox et al 2002 guinehut et al 2012 han et al 2004 he et al 2021 jeong et al 2019 klemas and yan 2014 maes and behringer 2000 nardelli and santoleri 2005 sun and watts 2001 moreover researches have also proposed the variational methods with additional constraints and vertical projection operators to reconstruct oss he et al 2021 besides traditional machine learning ml methods with simple multi layer connections which form linear or nonlinear mappings from input to output variables can also be considered as statistical approaches such as the feed forward neural network random forest rf self organization mapping som and extreme gradient boosting xgboost gueye et al 2014 pauthenet et al 2022 su et al 2019a b tian et al 2022 nevertheless most of these methods need to introduce sea surface salinity sss or other variables as constraints to obtain 3d oss results for high accuracy traditional approaches also perform to heavily rely on thermodynamics and various statistical properties of temperature and salinity data there exist a large number of dynamic parameters and regression coefficients related to specific research areas which leads to the results suffer from high computational complexity computational instability and poor adaptability therefore applying these methods can be time consuming and it is difficult to achieve high precision and rapid end to end 3d oss reconstruction furthermore timeliness is also the defect of traditional methods for example as an important constraint sss cannot be obtained in real time which makes it impractical to obtain near real time high precision 3d oss reconstruction results by traditional methods thus there is a need for a data driven model which is a fast and constraint free reconstruction model with reasonable accuracy over the past decades data driven deep learning dl models have gained more and more popularity in reconstructing ocean internal variables firstly data driven dl models have flexible structures which can be used to identify non linear and complex mapping between input and output data at different scales secondly data driven dl models are less constrained by additional information and potential complex mappings of data can be extracted by stacking only multiple nonlinear layers data driven dl models have already exhibited encouraging achievements in ocean subsurface variables reconstructing such as salinity in the recent literatures meng et al proposed convolutional neural networks cnns based dl models to accurately retrieve high resolution ocean subsurface temperature and salinity parameters in monthly scale meng et al 2022 2021 song et al adopted a convolutional long short term memory network convlstm to invert ocean subsurface thermohaline fields using satellite observations song et al 2022 an improved dl model which combined light gradient boosting machine lightgbm and deep forest network was developed by dong et al to estimate the oss structure in south china sea dong et al 2022 su et al proposed a dl model for predicting global monthly ocean subsurface thermohaline structure by using bi directional long short term memory bi lstm neural networks su et al 2021 despite many successful advances and practical values have been made most of the oss reconstruction dl models are accompanied by temperature reconstructions these results are mostly focused on monthly fields or coarser temporal scales which have deficiencies for synoptic scale oceanic processes and smaller scale signals research in addition most of the proposed dl methods utilize sea surface information to obtain the salinity of a specific depth layer and cannot directly reconstruct the entire 3d structure which may lead to the reconstruction results ignoring internal relationship between vertical layers on the other hand when reconstructing the oss the existing dl models often need the sss as training input which further limits the application of these methods in real time reconstructions in comparison with temperature there have been relatively few efforts to reconstruct oss using dl models reliable and intelligent data driven dl models for accuracy 3d oss reconstruction were largely unexplored in this work a 3d data driven model is proposed within the framework of generative adversarial network gans to address the deficiencies in existing studies as a powerful dl model for data generation gan can be a promising solution to keep the spatial relationship and reconstruct higher accuracy output on a daily scale the idea of 3d gan was firstly proposed by wu et al in 2016 wu et al 2016 to generate variable and realistic 3d objects from a probabilistic space 3d gans have realized remarkable success in computer vision and geometric data modeling chan et al 2022 chu et al 2020 he et al 2016 as far as we are aware no related studies have been performed to reconstruct the ocean 3d salinity fields using 3d gan based models here we retrieve the ocean 3d salinity at 12 depth levels from ocean 3d temperature in china s marginal seas and the horizontal resolution is 1 12 given the great variability of salinity in chinese marginal seas powerful enhancement schemes such as residual structures he et al 2016 inception modules and asymmetric convolutions längkvist et al 2014 wu et al 2019 zeng et al 2016 are incorporated into our 3d gan modeling it has been shown that residual or skip connections can enhance deeper networks performance by avoiding the disappearance of small gradients the inception modules are able to capture features from different receptive fields in parallel by applying convolutions with different kernels at the same level therefore intercorrelated features in horizontal and vertical and the underlying complex t s mappings can be effectively extracted and better learned by the proposed models to perform high precision reconstruction to explore the performances of different enhancement techniques when extending the 3d gan based model for salinity reconstructing task four 3d gan based models are proposed by using different structures the core architecture of the four 3d gan based models is the same but added different enhanced structures in turn then the performances and effectiveness are verified by comparison specifically this study also utilizes a traditional tool modular ocean data assimilation system modas fox et al 2002 as a comparison benchmark to further evaluate the proposed novel 3d gan based models the daily 3d gridded thermohaline analysis fields produced by modas are deriving by near real time oceanic observations and climatological information the subsurface temperature is firstly derived by sst and ssh observations via regression relationships then oss are derived by further relationships at each depth the proposed reconstruction model in this study enriches data sources for ocean salinity research in terms of vertical dimension and horizontal resolution and it also can be applied to any other sea areas overall the innovations and contributions of this study can be summarized as the following five points 1 a high precision near real time daily frequency 3d oss reconstruction framework 3d gan was firstly proposed for operational oceanography and related applications 2 two modern enhancement structures residual connection and inception structure are creatively introduced to the 3d gan framework for dealing with complex 3d data structures vertically and horizontally while also taking into account the lightweight of the model 3 the 3d gan based models learn end to end 3d t s mapping relationships from a data driven perspective which avoids complex specific regression coefficients or physical modeling and enables better reconstruction performances for unknown mechanisms and regions with drastic changes and the reconstruction framework is highly portable 4 the proposed reconstruction framework only requires temperature without sss as a constraint so it is advantageous with high real time performance 5 the results of the model reconstruction proposed in this study are compared with the statistical based modas model which has been widely applied operationally and its accuracy and value in operational applications have been comprehensively evaluated the rest of the paper is organized as follows the study area and data are presented in section 2 the detailed statement of the proposed 3d gan based models experimental design and evaluation metrics are given in section 3 the reconstruction performance application values and discussions are assessed in section 4 finally the study is summarized and concluded in section 5 2 study area and data our study area is china s marginal seas 117 e 130 e and 24 n 41 n which is an important part northwest pacific shown in fig 1 china s marginal sea is vast and includes the bohai sea the yellow sea and the east china sea most of the coastal waters off china are low salinity systems formed by river runoff while the outer seas are high salinity systems brought by kuroshio and its branches the waxing and waning movements of these two water systems with different natures constitute the spatial distribution characteristics of salinity with depth and location differences therefore the proposed model can be well validated by selecting the chinese marginal sea which has a strong salinity variation and regional distribution differences for the purposes of this study we employed the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom reanalysis data yu et al 2015 for models training and testing the hycom reanalysis data is produced by the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system the ncoda assimilated different types of available observations for obtaining high accuracy reanalysis products which contains temperature and salinity variables with a horizontal resolution of 1 12 the temporal resolution is 3 h the vertical levels are 41 and there are 15 year data from 2000 2015 the hycom reanalysis data is a widely recognized reanalysis product often used to generate the initial fields for forecast models training models using hycom reanalysis data is a preferable choice for models training and testing the temperature and salinity data have been daily averaged to build the suitable datasets all salinity fields are reconstructed at standard depths and the depth layers for usage are 2 10 15 20 25 35 50 70 100 125 150 and 200 m to ensure consistency it should be noted that data points were removed if any variable was empty in them the example input 3d temperature data and the 3d salinity data as labels is shown in fig 2 in addition to evaluate the reconstruction results from the proposed 3d gan based models the integrated temperature salinity dataset http mds nmdis org cn from national marine data information center nmdis of china is introduced the dataset contains salinity observations obtained from international business international exchange and cooperation institutions or projects a large number of observed salinity profiles located in china s marginal seas are available in this dataset for model accuracy validation 3 method this study explores four 3d gan based models for accurately mapping daily 3d temperature to daily 3d oss with high resolution in this section we first present the overall architecture of 3d gan model explaining the design of the original conv3d block and a performance enhanced block by using residual connections then the convolution block is future extended by advanced inception modules following experimental setup and evaluation metrics for the proposed 3d gan based models are also detailed explanation 3 1 3d gan model in our proposed 3d gan framework the generator g maps a 3d temperature data to the corresponding 3d salinity data in the same 3d space the discriminator implements a binary classification and a probability value d x is output to indicate whether the input 3d data x is real or reconstructed the proposed 3d gan framework employed leaky relu layers as activation maas et al 2013 and no pooling or linear layers are added in the proposed framework the u net navab et al 2015 is the core architecture of g the classical u net model consists two components encoder down sampling and decoder up sampling the encoder part is used to extract features and capture associated information of input data by stacked convolution blocks the decode part unites the extracted features from encode part with corresponding up sampled outputs in decode part via skip connections to achieve more accurate reconstruction this design allows the network to capture spatial dependencies in the contracting part the architecture of the u net is shown in fig 3 in the u net based g we designed six conv3d deconv3d blocks are used in the encoding and decoding process each conv3d block input is concatenated with the respective encoder output layer to avoid the vanishing of gradients the conv3d block is shown in fig 4 the designed conv3d block using one convolutional layer and same padding followed by batch normalization bn the dropout layer shown in fig 4 is applied to realize regularization and leaky relu function is finally used as activation as is shown in fig 3 the input size of the generator is levels latitude longitude where levels are the depth levels of the 3d data latitude is the input latitude size and the longitude is the input latitude size in encoding process the reduction in the first three dimensions is carried out by conv3d in our case but feature maps number grows in the fourth dimension by convolutional filters those extracted and composed features are subsequently utilized to reconstruct output data in decoding process corresponding to this is the decoding process the deconv3d block increases the number of the first three dimensions while the feature maps number reduces in the fourth dimension then the skip connection is achieved via the same number of feature maps obtained from the encoding and decoding process since proposed 3d gan based models contain two networks g and d two loss functions are used the original gan model uses cross entropy loss to realize the adversarial training of two networks eq 1 presents the loss function of g 1 min g v g d e x p d a t a x log d x e x p z z 1 log d g z eq 2 expresses the loss function of d 2 max d v g d e x p d a t a x log d x e z p z z 1 log d g z where x p d a t a x represents the distribution of real input data x z is a randomly sampled noise vector from a distribution p z through adversarial training the two networks can reach nash equilibrium state that is the d cannot judge the data generated by g due to the input of our proposed 3d gan based models are not random noise and labeled with 3d oss data following mirza and osindero 2014 the binary cross entropy loss presents as 3 l 3 d g a n g d e x y log d x y e x z log 1 d x g x z where x is the input temperature data in a levels latitude longitude space y is labeled salinity data in the same space corresponding to the input data z represents randomly sampled noise but added in form of some dropout layers in the proposed 3d gan based models in addition to cross entropy loss reconstruction loss isola et al 2017 is introduced for g which are the differences between the original salinity data and the reconstructed salinity data this g loss can be expressed as 4 l g rloss g e x y z y g x z 1 overall the loss function can be written as 5 l g d l 3 d g a n g d α l g rloss g g tries to minimize this objective function against an adversarial d that tries to maximize it 6 g arg min g max d l 3 d g a n g d α l g rloss g where α is a hyperparameter to adjust the weight of the l1 loss for stronger reconstruction performance a residual structure is introduced to the conv3d block to form the residual block the residual block includes two convolutional layers to augment its learning capacity so that more temporal and spatial information in the inputs can be preserved previous studies have shown that blindly increasing network depth does not improve network performance and also makes the network difficult to optimize the introduction of the residual structure effectively alleviates this problem the residual structure adopting skip connection can realize an identity mapping that is the newly added layers of each residual block only focus on the current residual mapping and do not affect the achieved network performance as shown in fig 5 the residual block can be seen as the conv3d block s extension specifically we use two convolutional layers followed by bn layers seeking to enhance the network s robustness as well as alleviate the vanishing gradient problem besides the kernel size and loss function are consistent with the ones utilized in 3d gan model 3 2 inception 3dgan model in addition to deepening the network by stacking convolution blocks to obtain better performances enlargement the width of the network that is performing multiple scale convolution block operations on the same convolution layer for input data in parallel will obtain better data representation in this study the 3d oss fields are reconstructed by the 3d temperature fields the temperature and salinity s characteristics in the study area are complex and changeable throughout the entire space time scale therefore it is difficult capture both global and local feature information using only a single kernel size driven by the validity of inception modules in fernández et al 2022 szegedy et al 2016 we introduce inception modules to get more powerful convolution blocks the inception structure has excellent topological characteristics which can obtain different information from input data in parallel and output results are concatenated into a very deep feature map which in essence will make the network wider adopting this module parallel convolutions firstly split the input data stream by different kernel sizes then a 1 1 1 convolution is employed to concatenate the parallel branches thus the network learns to prefer branches with the best fitting kernels over time in essence this scheme lets the network use different kernels to accomplish tasks and the most relevant kernels will be given more weights given the residual block mentioned above the inception structure is introduced in order to further improve the reconstruction performance it is worth noting that the inception structure proposed by googlenet in the early stage uses the kernel size of n n which will cause the bottleneck of characterization and large amount of computation consumption motivated by the need for parameters reduction in the inception 3dgan model we introduce a lightweight but more efficient inception residual block accordingly asymmetric convolutions are utilized to reduce the complexity of the parallel convolutions wu et al 2019 the kernel size of n n is decomposed into 1 n and n 1 which keeps the same performances with considerably fewer parameters the inception residual block is shown in fig 6 each parallel branch is composed of three simplified asymmetric convolutions and residual connection is applied by skips the parallel branches here in particular an inception block without convolution simplification is designed for comparison the same parallel branches as the inception residual block shown in fig 6 but two consecutive 3 3 3 convolution operations are employed to approximated represent the 5 5 5 convolution making the computational cost relatively reduced 3 3 experimental setup in this work we designed four 3d gan based models for daily 3d oss reconstruction the four models and experiment cases are shown in table 1 table 1 shows that case a and case b correspond to 3d gan model and residual 3d gan model expressed in section 3 1 case c correspond to inception 3dgan model with unsimplified convolutions and case d correspond to asymmetric inception 3dgan model with asymmetric convolutions the designs have all expressed in section 3 2 the four designed reconstruction models aim to build the relationships between the 3d temperature data and corresponding 3d oss data more precisely these 3d gan based models map the input temperature data to the target oss data there exist two steps for reconstruction model building and model reconstruction the flowchart is shown in fig 7 in model building the model is trained and evaluated based on the hycom reanalysis data from 2000 2013 and 2015 the resolution of all data is 1 12 and some days with bad quality grid points has been deleted after quality control the inputs of model training are the temperature and corresponding salinity fields with 12 depth levels of china s marginal seas which are used as training inputs and training labels respectively through adversarial learning 3d gan based models gs learned mapping relationships from temperature to salinity in step two of model estimation 3d oss fields in 2014 are reconstructed by inputting corresponding 3d temperature fields then the reconstructed 3d oss fields are evaluated by field observations in the study areas moreover the hycom reanalysis salinity data in 2014 are also used for accuracy evaluation all the proposed 3d gan based models are trained with the same data and parameters both g and d are updated through a direct training procedure in every batch however the learning speed of d is usually higher than that of g probably because 3d space data generation is more challenging than distinguishing whether the data is real or reconstructed wu et al 2016 then it is difficult for g to get effective improvement feedbacks from a far ahead d since all the samples it generated would be correctly distinguished as reconstructed to keep the training of both networks synchronized the decaying learning rate is employed for d during the training process which is helpful for training stability and getting better results both g and d are trained using the adam optimizer hyperparameters may affect model performance the setting of some hyperparameters are given in table 2 3 4 evaluation metrics the performances of the proposed 3d gan based models are assessed by the root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r 2 and percent bias the three statistical metrics evaluates the reconstructed salinity results from different perspectives rmse is a commonly used evaluation metric that represents the errors between the model output and the label data the strength of the linear relationship between model output and the label data are quantified by r 2 and the over or underestimated of the model results are indicated by percent bias for rmse and percent bias a well performing model will get a value close to 0 for r 2 a well performing model will get a value close to 1 the definitions of the three evaluation metrics are described in eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 7 r m s e i 1 n s o b s e r v e d i s m o d e l i 2 i 1 n s o b s e r v e d i s o b s e r v e d i 2 8 r 2 1 i 1 n s o b

salinity value in the same depth levels as s the 3d gan based model reconstructed and observed salinity are respectively represented by the subscripts model and observed i represents the ith validation point and n is the number of validation points 4 results and discussions the validity of the reconstructed data needs to be interpreted and verified in two main aspects namely accuracy and the ability to correctly represent the salinity characteristics of the study area where accuracy verification is assessed in terms of overall accuracy temporal error distributions and spatial error distributions using the salinity profiles provided by nmdis as the true values salinity phenomena and ocean related elements are calculated based on the reconstructed salinity data compared with the calculated results from hycom reanalysis data this section provides the salinity reconstruction results at 12 different depth levels of case a to case d and modas model in china s marginal seas in 2014 firstly the overall performances of all five models are carefully evaluated in terms of the evaluation metrics described in section 3 4 by using all available salinity observations next the performance and robustness of all the models are evaluated from temporal and spatial analysis finally as a further check on the accuracy of the reconstruction results and their applied value the water mass characteristics dynamic height as well as geostrophic velocity fields are calculated and analyzed in the study areas 4 1 overall reconstruction performance to quantify the overall reconstruction performance the averaged rmse r2 and percent bias of case a to case d as well as modas are shown in table 3 the statistical examination results are all layers from the surface 2 m down to 200 m over the china s marginal seas during 2014 compared with in situ observations as shown in table 3 the averaged rmses of all models have reached below 0 2 psu the smallest averaged rmse is apparent for case d which is 0 135 psu at all 12 vertical depths the averaged rmse of modas is slightly higher than that of case d which is 0 146 psu the accuracy of case a is the lowest and the averaged rmse is 0 174 psu from case a to case d there is a significant improvement in accuracy the averaged rmses of case b case c and case d are decreased by 5 17 10 34 and 22 41 respectively which using case a as a benchmark this indicates that including residual structure and inception structure can make the model learn more effective mapping relationships thus significantly promoting the model s performance therefore the case d model with the most complex structure can obtain the optimal performance and surpass the traditional modas model in overall performance the results of averaged r2 are basically consistent with averaged rmses the highest averaged r2 is case d with 0 5641 but the averaged r2 of modas is lower than case b and case c which indicates that modas s reconstructed and target salinity have relatively poor linear relationships percent bias indicates whether the models reconstruction of salinity is biased or not it can be seen from table 3 percent bias of all the models are close to zero percent indicating excellent reconstruction performance without obvious deviations percent bias of case d is the lowest only 0 436 generally speaking model performance rises steadily with the increment of the enhanced structure and all metrics fall within reasonable limits fig 8 shows the overall reconstruction performances of case a to case d and the traditional modas model using the averaged rmses at 12 different depths as shown in fig 9 the overall trend of averaged rmses from case a to case d is consistent at 12 depth layers and the averaged rmse values fluctuate slightly at 2 35 m but decrease overall the averaged rmses at the depth of 35 m to 100 m decreased significantly and then increased slightly at the depth of 125 m but then decreased reaching the minimum value at the depth of 150 m about 0 075 psu this further proves that case d has the best performance under the same conditions the averaged rmse values of the modas are close to case d at the depth of 2 70 m and the accuracy is slightly higher than case d at some depth layers such as 15 m and 70 m however the averaged rmse value of modas increased significantly at 100 m reaching close to 0 15 psu this is probably because 70 m is the depth with drastic changes in this study areas then the averaged rmses decreased at the depth of 125 200 m the accuracy of these layers is somewhat different from that of case d and close to that of case c this indicates that the traditional modas are excellent in the shallow layers but the results are not satisfactory in the deeper layers and some layers with more drastically changes it also shows that the case d can accurately reconstruct the oss of china s marginal seas using 3d temperature data with outstanding performance the density scatter plots are also a widely used method to directly evaluate the reconstruction performance here the performance of the case d is future evaluated by the density scatter plots the scatter distribution of the salinity from case d reconstruction and in situ observations at 25 m 50 m 70 m and 100 m for all available observational points in 2014 is shown in fig 9 for scatter plots any errors between the observations and reconstructions may lead to a spread in the distribution it is can be seen from fig 9 most of the points are around the diagonal line indicating a perfect match between observations and reconstructed results in all four sampling depths although there are relatively large errors between the reconstruction results and the actual observations in a few points most differences of the reconstruction observations appear to be within 0 2 psu for a well performing dl model not only a good structural design is required but also the use of a suitable loss function therefore here this study adopts the structural design of the case d model that has been verified to be optimal and train the model using only the adversarial loss i e remove the l1 loss and design a new case d base model to verify the effect of reconstructing the loss function on the model reconstruction effect based on the optimal structure the overall evaluation results of case d base are shown in table 4 from table 4 we can see that the rmse of case d base is 0 167 psu which is higher than the rmse of case d the r 2 is 0 478 which also has some difference compared with the reconstruction result of case d the percent bias is 0 45 which indicates that the case d base model has no over or underestimated the reconstruction results the comparisons between case d and case d base models show that the reconstruction loss function has a positive effect on the reconstruction results of the model 4 2 temporal error analysis after the overall performance evaluations this part will further verify the performance of case a to case d and model according to different time scales firstly the performance of all the models in different seasons are discussed fig 10 a d shows the accuracy of salinity reconstruction results from case a to case d and modas in spring summer autumn and winter of 2014 respectively here the results at the different depth levels 2 10 15 20 25 35 50 70 100 125 150 and 200 m in terms of the averaged rmse are shown for illustration as it is shown in this figure that the accuracy of salinity reconstruction results in winter is the highest and the averaged rmses of salinity reconstruction from case a to case d and modas are all below 0 15 psu except for the averaged rmse values of case a at 10 m 15 m and 70 m which are significantly higher than those of other models there is no significant difference in the accuracy of these models at different layers this is mainly because salinity in winter is not significantly different in each layer and all the models can well reconstruct the winter salinity of the study area although the advantages of case d are not well reflected in winter the overall trend of accuracy is still gradually improving from case a to case d while the accuracy of modas is close to that of case d spring is the season with the second highest accuracy of salinity reconstruction as shown in fig 10 a the averaged rmse values of all models are below 0 25 psu it is notable that in spring the accuracy of case a to case d is not gradually improved in each layer and the accuracy of case a and case b is better in some layers although the accuracy of case d cannot reach the highest level in each layer in spring the accuracy of its reconstruction results can remain stable in all depth layers without obvious jump which indicates that case d has very stable performance and strong robustness at different depths and times the modas results show a significant jump at 150 m and its averaged rmse value is significantly higher than the averaged rmse values from case a to case d this illustrates that compared with the deep learning based models the robustness of the modas model is poor fig 10 b shows the results in summer as can be seen from this figure the accuracy of modas results is significantly different from case a to case d at 2 10 m and 100 m the averaged rmse values of modas are significantly higher than that of other models especially at 2 m where the averaged rmse value exceeds 0 3 psu the results of case a to case d are relatively stable in summer and case d has the highest accuracy in all layers which shows superior performance of case d the results in autumn are shown in fig 10 c in this figure case a and case b have the worst reconstructed salinity results in this time period and the reconstruction accuracy is far from that of case c and case d the performance of modas model in autumn is not satisfactory especially the averaged rmse values of 15 m 35 m are significantly higher than that of case c and case d however the accuracy of case d remains stable in autumn and the averaged rmse values are below 0 2 psu in all 12 depth layers through seasonal analysis it can be concluded that case d not only has the advantage of high reconstruction accuracy but also has good robustness and can still obtain satisfactory results for the time or depth with relatively severe salinity changes in order to further verify the reconstruction performance the rmse comparisons between the five models on daily scale are carried out according to the previous analysis the reconstruction results of case d model are the best so in the daily analysis we compared the reconstruction results of each model with case d the comparison results for a total of 266 days are shown in fig 11 fig 11 a is a comparison between case d and case a it can be seen from this figure that the averaged rmse values of the two models at daily scale are all below 0 5 psu and the trend of the averaged rmse curve is consistent but case d has obviously higher accuracy similarly comparing case d with case b fig 11 b shows the same trend of averaged rmse curve and case d has higher accuracy fig 11 c shows the comparison results of case d and case c on daily scale which is slightly different from figs 11 a and 11 b while the trend of averaged rmse curves is basically consistent and the accuracy is almost the same on some days there are still large gaps on several days it can be seen from the comparison that case d still maintains its advantages fig 11 d shows the comparison results of case d and modas model on daily scale as shown in this figure the averaged rmse value of modas model has a significant jump on some days with the highest value exceeding 0 8 psu on some days the result of modas model is slightly better than that of case d in short time series plots reveal that case d can satisfactorily reconstruct 3d oss in almost all days while achieving better performance compared with other models the 3d gan model with a combination of residual structure and asymmetric inception has a relatively simple structure and better performance compared to the conventional modas generally all models performances are best in days with uniform salinity distributions and degrades in days with salinity variability but case d is more stable 4 3 spatial error analysis next to further assess the reconstruction results of different models we also compared the models reconstructed 3d oss with the salinity profiles in typical regions the selection of areas is based on the distribution of available profile data due to the available profile data are mainly concentrated in the southern ys and the ecs we divide the area where the profile is concentrated into three square areas 123 130e 24 27n 123 130e 27 30n and 123 130e 30 33n which are named squares a b and c fig 12 displays the spatial distribution of observation profiles and regional division in the whole study areas in 2014 fig 13 shows the averaged rmse values at 12 depth levels from 2 m to 200 m of three different square areas from all observations in 2014 the averaged rmse values in vertical between the five models and the in situ observations are all less 0 2 psu for square a as shown in fig 13 a in the whole depth layer the overall changes trend from case a to case d are basically consistent at 2 m the result of modas is relatively poor but the accuracy of other depth layers is closest to case d although there are some differences all models reconstructed salinity fields are in good consistency with the observed salinity profiles as shown in figs 13 b and 13 c the reconstruction results of square b and square c are not as accurate as square a especially for the modas model at 2 35 m the averaged rmse values of modas differ greatly from other models with the maximum error reached 0 4 psu at approximately 10 m depth fig 10c this is due to the fact that square b and c contain the east china sea kuroshio which changes the hydrographic conditions through thermal salt exchange when it flows through the east china sea resulting in drastic changes in salinity distribution within the area the models are affected by complex internal ocean processes and the accuracy of the reconstruction results is slightly degraded in addition we selected a specific profile in one day through the study area to show the reconstruction results of the five models fig 14 shows the comparison of the specific in situ profile 128 101 e 28 601 n and model estimated oss in october 16 2014 it can be seen from fig 14 that the result of case d is the most consistent with the measured salinity profile data although the results of other models are consistent with the measured data in the overall change trend the accuracy is slightly insufficient fig 15 displays the error maps of reconstructed oss by case d model and in situ profiles at 7 depth levels 2 15 25 35 50 100 and 200 m these error maps are the errors between the reconstructed results and the field observations on october 16 2014 fig 15 a indicates locations of these verification profiles as shown in fig 15 b h there are no significant differences between the reconstructed salinity and ground truth observations the major differences are less than 0 15 psu moreover to analyze the overall salinity distribution of case d in the entire study area fig 16 shows the distributions of labeled data hycom reanalysis data case d and the salinity differences namely labeled data minus case d estimation in january 1 2014 and the selected depth levels are 25 m 50 m and 100 m as a whole the model reconstructed salinity patterns fig 16 b e and h are almost the same as the labeled ones fig 16 a d and g implying an excellent performance of case d model fig 16 c f and i display the salinity differences of 25 m 50 m and 100 m respectively it can be seen from these figures that the major differences are appeared at depths 25 m and 50 m in ys area around 32 n to 35 n the reconstructed salinity values in the east china sea region are in good agreement with the label data in all layers and the maximum error is below 0 4 psu overall the reconstructed salinity patterns from case d agree well with the reanalysis data and correctly reflects most features and details fig 17 shows the cross section maps of the labeled data case d and their differences in january 1 2014 from this figure it can be seen that the salinity patterns in fig 17 a and b are highly consistent and the error range shown in fig 17 c is below 0 15 psu through spatial error analysis the results of the five reconstructed models are presented in their whole spatial distribution especially the case d the outstanding effect of case d model is strongly validated by the observed salinity profile data and the corresponding reanalysis data fig 18 shows the spatial distribution of rmses between case d results and hycom at some depths for year 2014 it can be seen from this figure that the rmses of each layer are have the smallest rmses in the range of 24 n 30 n while the 25 m layer in fig 18 a has larger rmses values in the rectangular region of 30 n 34 n 123 e 126 e which may be due to the more drastic variation of salinity in this rectangular region the rmses of 100 m shown in fig 18 c are basically around 0 1 psu indicating that the case d reconstructed results of the deep layers are in better agreement with hycom 4 4 application of reconstructed salinity data after error analysis the reconstruction results of case d have the highest accuracy and stability in both time and space in this part we will analyze and calculate the properties of marine elements based on the reconstructed salinity by case d and further verify the application values of the reconstructed salinity in marine scientific research and marine elements due to most of the ocean elements also need temperature for calculation and analysis hycom temperature reanalysis data is used in the following calculations 4 4 1 presentation of water mass characteristics water mass is defined by its temperature and salinity and its characteristics often play important roles in oceanographic research emery 2001 analysis of the t s diagrams allows us to come to the several conclusions about the thermohaline water mass structure and its seasonal variability given the number of observations and hydrological properties the study areas water mass characteristics in different seasons are investigated by using case d s reconstruction meanwhile the observed t s profiles and hycom reanalysis data are adopted for comparison figs 19 a i show the t s diagrams of observed profiles reconstruction and hycom data at all 12 depths from 2 m to 200 m during 2014 the potential density is also shown in fig 19 as contour it can be seen from fig 18 that in the four seasons both the reconstructed salinity and hycom reanalysis data have high consistency t s scatter diagrams with the measured data in spring fig 19 a b the salinity changes primarily between 34 0 psu and 34 5 psu similar to the hycom reanalysis data the reconstructed field is consistent with the observed data and reflects the hydrological characteristics well the t s diagrams for summer is clearly clustered shown in fig 19 c and d in summer the temperature changes much with concerting around 10 c 25 c but its salinity does not exhibit a relatively obvious variation in autumn and winter t s diagrams in fig 19 e f and g i show relative dispersion with different densities from the other two seasons overall the t s diagrams plotted from the salinity results of case d agree well with the reanalysis data and field observations indicating that the model results can be used as a data source for ocean properties 4 4 2 dynamic height to further apply the reconstructed salinity by case d model the dynamic height dh of the study areas is calculated dh is the density related ocean element which can be calculated from temperature and salinity fields in this study the temperature fields are from hycom data and salinity fields are from case d reconstructed results and the hycom data hence two different dh fields for comparison are then obtained the definition of dh is 10 d h p 1 p 2 δ t s p d p where δ represents the specific volume anomaly and the definition of it is 11 δ t s p γ t s p γ 0 c 35 p s u p γ is the specific volume of seawater dh can serve as the streamfunction of the geostrophic velocity shear δ v 12 f δ v g d h where g and f represent the acceleration of gravity and coriolis parameter vector respectively here the surface level is selected as the reference level according to the reference level geostrophic velocity at each level is then obtained fig 20 shows the dh map at four sampled depth levels 25 m 50 m and 100 m in january 1 2014 the salinity fields are deriving from the hycom data and reconstructed the dh maps prepared from reconstructed data fig 20 a c and e have patterns similar to the dh map calculated from hycom data fig 20 b d and f the key differences between the different source dh maps are in ys area around 32 n to 35 n while the results are consistent with previous analysis fig 20 shows the dh maps at four sampled depth levels 25 m 50 m and 100 m in january 1 2014 the salinity fields are derived from the hycom data and reconstructed one the dh maps prepared from reconstructed data fig 20 a c and e have patterns similar to the dh map calculated from hycom data fig 20 b d and f the key differences between the different source dh maps are in the ys area around 32 n to 35 n while the results are consistent with previous analysis the distributions of these layers are similar as seen in fig 20 which indicates continuity in the vertical direction and relatively low temperature and salinity gradients in these layers however they still differ in detail as well as in the range of values indicating a non uniform distribution of temperature and salinity between these depths high dh is caused by high temperature or low salinity while low dh is the opposite for example from fig 20 a and b it can be found that the higher values at 123 e 126 e and 24 n 27 n located in the east china sea region are the combined result of temperature and salinity distribution at 100 m fig 20 e f the area of high dh values decreases relative to the shallow layer which also indicates the continuity and relative thermohaline gradient between different depths after examining the winter dh distribution characteristics a further analysis was conducted in the study on june 10 2014 which is in summer fig 21 shows the dh maps at three sampled depth levels 25 m 50 m and 100 m in june 10 2014 it can be seen from fig 21 that the dh maps derived from reconstructed salinity as well as hycom salinity calculations are similar in general but there are local differences unlike fig 19 in winter there are more obvious differences in the distribution of dh maps in different layers which indicates that the temperature and salinity change drastically in the summertime and there are significant gradient changes between different layers geostrophic velocities at one depth relative to the counterparts at another are calculated with dynamic heights where the dynamic height or geopotential anomalies are integrated vertically from p1 to p2 the surface p1 is the reference level the dh is the streamfunction for the difference between geostrophic flows from one depth to another figs 22 and 23 exhibit the cross section of the geostrophic velocity fields derived from both the hycom and the reconstructed data in january 1 and june 10 2014 respectively there is almost no difference in geostrophic velocity fields between hycom data calculation figs 22 a 23 a and the reconstructed salinity of case d calculation figs 22 b 23 b from the comparison of figs 22 and 23 it can be found that there are obvious differences in geostrophic velocity fields in different seasons which is consistent with the analysis results of dh distributions in different seasons for example the results in figs 22 and 23 show large differences near 100 m depth indicating that the gradient is small large near this depth in winter summer overall the results suggest that the reconstructed salinity can also be adapted to the estimation and analysis of common ocean elements 5 conclusion in this study a novel 3d gan based framework is proposed for 3d oss reconstruction from ocean 3d temperature data in a daily scale the proposed framework is in a data driven aspect which aims to directly learn underlying complex 3d mapping from ocean temperature to salinity through training without additional constraints priori physical assumptions and large of specific regression coefficients for more reliable and precision reconstruction results residual connections and inception modules are added to the 3d gan based framework due to their powerful enhancement capabilities more precisely the 3d gan based framework can be efficiently extended both in depth and width by using the two structures taking the china s marginal seas as the modeling area four salinity reconstruction models are designed using 3d gan as the core framework and combining two augmentation techniques namely case a case b case c and case d as described in section 3 3 the four designed models are progressively built from simple to advanced and the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework and network designs are verified by comparison in addition the 3d oss reconstructions of statistical based modas tool is used as a comparative benchmark to further validate the advantages of the data driven model the performances of four 3d gan based models as well as modas tool are evaluated in different perspectives by using rmse r2 and percent bias overall the comparisons results showed that the oss reconstructed by the case d model with residual connections and asymmetric convolutions in parallelly have the lowest averaged rmse value of 0 135 psu and the lowest averaged percent bias value of 0 436 the overall averaged r2 value is the highest at 0 564l indicating that the case d model accurately reconstructed the oss of china s marginal seas and outperformed the other models the overall average rmse of case d is 22 41 lower than that of case a without enhanced structures which demonstrates that adding the extended structures can effectively and more often extract interrelated features from horizontal or vertical directions to achieve higher accuracy of 3d temperature to salinity mapping next the results of the analysis at different spatial and temporal scales further validate that 3d gan framework core with addition enhanced structures can reconstruct the 3d salinity field with high accuracy during the study the reconstruction accuracy of each model was detailed analyzed in different seasons different partitions different days and even different layers on the same day although the performances of case d model do not perform optimally in some cases for example modas performs slightly better in spring the overall case d model was still absolutely superior and the accuracy increased sequentially from case a to case d in addition from the previous analysis results we can also conclude that case d has strong robustness and the reconstruction results remain stable across days and layers unlike the modas results where the accuracy values jump i e the accuracy of a layer on some days decreases sharply and is much lower than other results finally the results of case d are employed to participate in the analysis and calculation of some common marine elements as a way to show its application values through the comparative analysis of water mass properties dynamic fields and geostrophic velocity fields it is found that the results obtained by using case d are highly consistent with those obtained by using the reanalysis data which shows that the reconstructed results of proposed data driven dl model are not inferior to those of the reanalysis data this study provides a new high precision and high resolution near real time data source constructing approach for ocean salinity studies from a data driven aspect remarkable performances for reconstruction oss on a daily time scale are found in our proposed 3d gan based model which can be used to build daily time scale datasets in different ocean areas for synoptic scale ocean processes studies in general in situ salinity data are scarce and traditional salinity reconstruction methods are often limited by complex and incompletely physical or statistical parameters which are still not fully understood in big data era data driven dl models provides some new insights and show exhibit great potential for dl based generative models the newly proposed diffusion generative model framework is developing rapidly in recent years and has shown a tendency to surpass the gan model framework it is necessary to keep pace with the times and keep exploring under the diffusion model framework for different reconstruction tasks different model frameworks need to be carefully evaluated and compared to obtain more advanced improved and well performing models besides the ever advancing space remote sensing technologies will further promote the acquisition of multiple earth resource data and in the near future high accurate sss data are likely to be available in real time which will bring new opportunities and challenges for the progress of data driven

23768,accurate and high resolution wave statistics are critical for regional hazard mapping and planning however long term simulations at high spatial resolution are often computationally prohibitive here multiple rapid frameworks including fetch limited look up table lut and linear propagation are combined and tested in a large estuary exposed to both remotely swell and locally generated waves predictions are compared with observations and a traditional swan implementation coupled to a regional hydrodynamic model fetch limited and lut approaches both perform well where local winds dominate with errors about 10 20 larger than traditional swan predictions combinations of these rapid approaches with linear propagation methods where remotely generated energy is present also perform well with errors 0 20 larger than traditional swan predictions model model comparisons exhibit lower variance than comparisons to observations suggesting that while model implementation impacts prediction skill model boundary conditions winds offshore waves may be a dominant source of error overall results suggest that with a relatively small loss in prediction accuracy simulations computation cost can be significantly reduced by 2 4 orders of magnitude allowing for high resolution and long term predictions to adequately define regional wave statistics keywords ocean waves prediction validation reduced computation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate long term and high resolution wave predictions are needed to assess the flood risk at the coast where rising sea levels and changing coastal conditions may alter wave propagation generation and extreme conditions on the shoreline erikson et al 2015 sweet et al 2022 phase averaged numerical models e g simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 are the defacto approach to predicting wave generation and transformation at the coast while rapidly implemented when boundary forcing is available models like swan require large amount computation for high resolution simulation over long time periods to reduce the computational cost the standard swan implementation may be replaced by faster reduced physics model e g o reilly and guza 1993 leijnse et al 2021 or by utilizing a look up table lut approach e g hegermiller et al 2017 by neglecting the physics of sources sinks and non linear interactions wave energy is rapidly transformation is rapidly computed longuet higgins 1957 dorrestein 1960 crosby et al 2018 this reduced physics approach is skillful where neglected terms are small such as locations like the u s west coast where low frequency energy dominates here the coastal data information program cdip https cdip ucsd edu makes operational wave predictions from buoy observations and linearly propagating wave energy to the shore o reilly and guza 1993 o reilly et al 2016 prior work has also shown that along the shelf of oregon and washington wind wave generation is small compared to remotely generated swell garcía medina et al 2013 illustrating why these rapid transformation approaches are so successful in contrast a look up table lut is typically a suite of simulations for a variety of forcing combinations with the complete model physics the computation reduction comes from discretizing the range of possible forcings this finite set of simulations is computed once and then predictions are simply queried for a given forcing condition for example in a small enclosed basin where wind conditions are spatially homogeneous wind speeds and directions can be binned into discrete values covering the expected range and used as the set of plausible forcings waves are modeled for finite combination of speeds and directions forming a look up table from which to generate rapid predictions golshani 2011 elliott and neill 2015 similar approaches have been applied to the transformation of offshore waves to the nearshore hegermiller et al 2017 but difficulties arise when the range of forcing conditions cannot be characterized within a manageable dimension and total number of required simulations for example if local wind conditions and offshore waves are relatively uncorrelated the number of dissimilar forcing conditions i e offshore wave height period direction wind speed wind direction becomes large additionally offshore waves may not be well represented by a single set of bulk wave parameters kumar et al 2017 or require additional spectral details crosby et al 2016 increasingly sophisticated statistical modeling approaches have been developed to classify weather patterns and using clustering and dissimilarity algorithms to generate a suite of possible model forcing camus et al 2011 2013 however such approaches may fail with novel forcing conditions reduced physics and lut approaches both provide a trade off between accuracy and the required computation and may be more appropriate in specific regions or frequencies here we quantify the trade off between accuracy and computational cost for several model implementations in a semi enclosed estuary where both remotely and locally generated waves are significant section 2 introduces the region and prior wave studies are reviewed observations sites and data are reviewed in section 3 1 and the varying modeling approaches are described in section 3 model skill and

exposed partially to the ne pacific ocean both locally and remotely generated waves are observed with their relative impact depending on exposure strong currents up to 5 m s in narrow tidal channels occur due to a large tidal range 3 4 m and tidal prism thompson and thomson 1994 waves in the salish sea contribute to flooding at high water levels erode unconsolidated shorelines bluffs and marshes drive nearshore transport of sediments and pollutants important to shellfish forage fish and salmon habitats and affect recreational and commercial boating activities that provide critical access to the many islands in the puget sound accurate high resolution long term wave predictions are thus critical to support shoreline planning ecosystem restoration and regional navigation and transportation finlayson 2006b yang et al 2019 battalio et al 2005 gerstel et al 1997 prior wave modeling studies despite the region s complexities show good predictive skill early predictions at cama beach located on camano island fig 1 showed wave conditions are well modeled under stationary assumptions likely because in the enclosed region with relatively short fetches local wind wave generation reaches saturation rapidly finlayson 2006a a more recent regional wave study shows good skill at three moored buoy locations in the strait of juan de fuca sjf and strait of georgia sog with an unstructured grid and non stationary model physics yang et al 2019 the authors note the need to downscale wind predictions from 32 to 12 km to capture wind speeds in the region and derive a regional climatology based on a computationally costly 5 year model simulation though initial studies show predictive skill comparison were made at the few wave observation sites and uncertainties remain regarding the impact of water levels and currents early observations suggest strong modulation of wave heights by tidal currents in the sjf lambrakos 1981 but model studies are still lacking recent work has shown significant impacts to waves by currents globally ardhuin et al 2017 gallet and young 2014 and in the gulf stream hegermiller et al 2019 given the magnitude of currents in the region significant wave impacts are probable to date model validation of nearshore waves and their transformation and impacts across the shoreface are limited to the cama beach study finlayson 2006a despite recent flood impacts associated with waves rapid accurate and high resolution approaches are needed to support ongoing flood hazard risk assessment 3 methods several wave modeling approaches were implemented ranging in complexity from simple parameterized fetch and depth limited predictions to numerical coupled hydrodynamic and wave simulations and are detailed below in most cases waves were simulated

flexible mesh hydrodynamic model delft3d fm kernkamp et al 2011 was developed with a spatial resolution varying from 150 to 1000 m surface and pressure forcing was derived from hrpds forecasts offshore water levels were prescribed with tidal harmonics lyard et al 2017 fes2014b and non tidal water levels derived from hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom https www hycom org because hycom predictions do not include the inverse barometer effect a reference pressure of 1017 mb is used in the model to capture changing water levels owing to atmospheric pressure adjustments fluvial forcing

predictions have average errors of 15 cm 3 3 2 linear shoaling refraction lsr shoaling and refraction processes dominate wave propagation when wind wave generation and non linear processes are small o reilly and guza 1993 this is often the case on the u s west coast when long period remotely generated wave energy propagates in deep water over the relatively short continental shelf several prior studies have shown that good predictive skill is achieved with simple shoaling and refraction transformation of wave energy o reilly and guza 1991 1993 crosby et al 2016 and these techniques are currently used operationally by the cdip to make accurate nearshore wave predictions o reilly et al 2016 by ignoring wind wave generation and non linear interactions nearshore and offshore wave energy can be related through a simple linear transformation historically this transformation was estimated by backward ray tracing longuet higgins 1957 dorrestein 1960 mehaute et al 1982 more recently transformations derived from phase averaged wave modeling were shown to be similar when spatial resolution was sufficient crosby et al 2018 here the phase averaged wave model simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 is used to relate offshore and nearshore wave energy in the sjf fig 1 by simulating incoming wave energy from the range of possible directions the swan model domain covers the portion of the salish sea exposed to remote wave energy propagation through the sjf fig 1 blue box the model is run with varying incident wave direction from 180 to 360 degrees at a 2 deg increments covering the range of possible incident directions e g fig 2 incoming wave energy equivalent to 1 m in wave height is prescribed at the boundary in a narrow 2 degree direction bin uniformly distributed across frequency for each simulation similar to the approach in crosby et al 2018 the model is run in stationary mode ignoring estimated propagation time lags of 3 4 h with 180 direction bins 2 deg resolution and 48 frequency bins spaced logarithmically from 0 04 hz to 0 5 hz and at a spatial resolution of 100 m table 2 simulations were run with constant water level equal to mean sea

scaling parameter α determines the emphasis of peaks in f θ where a large alpha weights peaks more heavily than valleys small values of β result in a wide weighting function that considers a larger range of fetch values surrounding a given wind direction e g a1 the largest x ˆ are therefore derived from large α and small β values by allowing for a broad weighting function and weight peaks heavily fig 3b the weighting in 7 results in a smoother change in fetch with direction and tends to ignore small islands that wave energy is likely to refract or diffract around o reilly and guza 1993 additionally α and β allow for tuning based on observations optimal values of β 1 and α 1 were selected based on overall agreement with observations see appendix a 2 wind direction θ w and speed u

location are used water depths at each modeled time step d are derived from numerical hydrodynamic simulations described in section 3 3 1 3 3 4 look up table lut an alternative to the simple and computationally fast fdl approach is the incrementally more sophisticated and computationally taxing method of creating a look up table lut of pre computed wave simulations a lut is an approach to reducing computation when forcing conditions can be parameterized into a small number of variables and those forcing combinations can be pre computed over the range of expected values when the number of combinations is less than the time steps of the simulation computation costs are reduced prior wave studies have applied a lut approach to transform waves nearshore hegermiller et al 2017 and predict wind wave generation in enclosed basins elliott and neill 2015 golshani 2011 for wind wave generation wind conditions are assumed homogeneous across the model domain and a range of wind speeds

regional wind wave generation these calculations are done under the following assumptions 1 wind wave generation is unaffected by existing sea state 2 nonlinear wave wave interactions between locally generated and remotely generated waves are insignificant and 3 that all simplifying assumptions in lsr and lut are additionally valid under these assumptions wave energy spectra from remote and local generation is simply additive in practice file storage limitations do not allow for saving frequency directional spectra at all time steps and model locations however where only bulk parameter predictions are saved wave heights can be added in quadrature e g h s 3 2 h s 1 2 h s 2 2 and mean frequency f m is determined by a weighted average 9 f m 3 h s 1 2 f m 1 h s 2 2 f m 2 h s 1 2 h s 2 2 mean wave directions can be similarly estimated by a weighted average but with care taken to use a circular mean however this was not done here 3 3 6 stationary and non stationary wave model swn swm c nwm a more robust but computationally demanding approach to wave prediction is implementation of a phase averaged wave model for continuous simulation here swan was coupled to the regional hydrodynamic model of water level and currents section 3 3 1 with the delft3d flexible mesh modeling suite developed by deltares swan was configured in both stationary and non stationary modes as well as with and without coupling to depth averaged currents spatially varying winds from hrdps section 3 2 1 provide input to local wind wave generation and waves observed at 46087 section 3 2 3 provide offshore spectral forcing to allow for feasible computation a large overall swan domain was created at 1 km spatial resolution with several nested and sub nested domains table 2 fig 1 at resolutions increasing with a factor 5 to 200 m nested and 50 m sub nested nested domains are created at locations with available observations and much of the larger region was not resolved beyond the relatively coarse 1 km to evaluate differences and model skill three configurations were simulated stationary numerics without wave current interactions swm stationary numerics with wave current interactions swm c and non stationary numerics with wave current interactions nwm c a time step of 10 min was used in non stationary simulations while outputs and stationary simulations were computed at hourly intervals the models are similar to lut simulations section 3 3 4 however the number of direction bins was reduced to 36 10 deg resolution to lower computational expense convergence criteria were set similarly to lsr simulations section 3 3 2 but with a maximum number of iteration of 50 in the stationary simulations it was found to be necessary in non stationary simulations to increase the maximum number of iterations from the default of 1 to 10 3 4 simulation time periods wave simulations were performed over two time periods table 3 owing to computational constraints swm swm c and nwn c simulations were completed during the comparatively short 2 month period from october to november of 2019 longer 5 year simulation were computed for swm c and all rapid approaches fdl lsr lut from 2016 2020 where both hrdps wind forcing section 3 2 1 and regional wave observations were available table 1 4 results and discussion overall results suggest that including additional physics in numerical models tends to improve prediction skill however this improvement is in some cases marginal and may not be worth the computational expense below predictions with stationary and non stationary numerics are compared the impact of wave current interactions are evaluated and reduced physics model implementations are compared 4 1 non stationary vs stationary stationary and non stationary simulations should begin to diverge where the domain is large enough such that the sea state does not fully develop within the model time step 1 h comparisons of swm c and nwm c significant wave height h s predictions from oct nov 2019 show the largest root mean squared differences rmsd of 5 10 cm in the regions with the largest basins such as the sog and sjf and smaller differences 0 5 cm in smaller basins such as those within near seattle fig 5 fig 1 these differences appear to be primarily a result of timing as mean bias between swm c and nwm c are comparatively small 0 2 cm on average swm c simulations produce slightly higher wave heights resulting in a consistent negative bias across the domain fig 5b prediction errors are also examined for both models root mean squared error rmse at three observation sites with data during this period are lower by 1 5 cm for nwm c predictions compared to swm c predictions table 4 the largest improvement is observed at 46257 and 46146 both located in larger open basins fig 1 bias at observations sites is relatively similar for nwm c and swm c within 1 2 cm and range from 3 to 8 cm table 4 overall the error with observations is larger than the differences between models suggesting the dominant error terms are not stationary non stationary assumptions while accuracy is improved with non stationary assumptions the computational cost of non stationary simulations were approximately 3x that of stationary simulations 4 2 current effects over the shorter simulation period oct nov 2019 stationary simulations swm are compared with and without currents table 3 mean normalized bias appendix a 1 swm c swm varies from 10 40 with the strongest negative values east and west of dungeness spit where depth averaged mean currents show a clockwise circulation pattern fig 6a mean wave heights are generally 10 20 higher for swm c predictions in the northern part of domain d2 fig 6 here the region is sheltered from offshore energy in the sjf by the southern most tip of vancouver island current refraction is likely increasing the directional spread in wave conditions allowing for additional energy penetration into sheltered regions ardhuin et al 2017 differences between mean wave heights in domains d3 and d4 are much smaller as currents at these locations are slower fig 6b c similar patterns of root mean squared differences rmsd in wave heights are observed with differences ranging from 0 50 in domain d2 and much less in domains d3 and d4 fig 6 prediction errors for swm and swm c at observation sites available during the simulation period are surprisingly similar table 4 while swm c errors are slightly larger at 46257 this difference is not likely significant this prediction error similarity is likely because 46257 is at site of strong current shear fig 7 further study is needed to quantify both the accuracy of current predictions and the potential improvement in prediction accuracy possible by including currents in wave simulations 4 3 accuracy at observation locations overall predictions during the nearly 5 year simulation period table 3 were skilled with increasingly complex and computationally costly models performing slightly better fourteen day time series at observation locations illustrate some differences and deficiencies fig 8 at locations partially sheltered to offshore wave energy 46088 w1 w2 w3 lsr under predicted because of the lack of local wind wave generation fig 8a i m n at the relatively exposed location 46257 lsr predictions showed better agreement with observations at most times but local wind waves appeared important as well as indicated by fdl and lut predictions fig 8d modeled wave heights at completely sheltered locations i e not exposed to remote wave energy were most similar predictions in bellingham and skagit bays in general show good agreement with observations and between models swan c lut and fdl with the exception of locations s1 and s2 where all models were biased low fig 8i j under predicted wind speeds are suspected as the primary drive of this bias however robust wind observations were not available at this location to confirm this hypothesis in larger basins such as the sog and inside the sjf peak wave heights appeared over predicted by the lut approach but fdl and swan c were similar and more closely aligned with observations fig 8a b c predictions at 46257 were examined more closely as the site is most exposed to remotely generated energy while local generation still relatively important lsr lut and lsr fdl wave height predictions showed good agreement with swan c despite the simplifications employed fig 9a overall swm c predictions appeared slightly higher during this time period while lsr lut and lsr fdl appeared more closely aligned with observations mean wave period was also well predicted by lsr lut and lsr fdl and showed clearly the oscillation between remotely and locally generated wave conditions fig 9b mean wave direction was also well predicted though it is clear that nw energy both from local winds and offshore waves tend to dominate across observation locations swan c and lsr lut wave height predictions showed the best agreement with observations fig 10 at most locations lsr fdl predictions had a negative bias indicated by quantile quantile curves magenta fig 10 at some locations lsr lut wave height distributions appeared closest to observations while at others swm predictions appeared best at s1 and s2 a clear negative bias was present for all model configurations confirming that the observed biases in fig 8 were typical throughout the record wave height root mean squared error rmse varied across locations but was lowest for swm c predictions at most sites green bars in fig 11a this was similarly true for mean wave periods fig 11b while lsr lut wave height errors were lower than lsr fdl mean wave period errors were higher larger lsr lut rmse occurred most strongly at sites 46088 w1 w2 and w3 located just inside the sjf this appears driven by larger negative bias in mean wave height prediction fig 11d wave height biases varied but are mostly consistent between models suggesting that either models contain a very similar bias or that model forcing biases are driving these errors fig 11c for example the largest biases were observed at w1 w3 where small amounts of offshore energy propagation may be difficult to resolve and highly influence by directional details not resolved well by the directional coefficients measured by 46087 ochoa and delgado gonzález 1990 median rmse from all observations sites except for b3 where swm c predictions are not available for swm c and lsr lut were similar 17 cm table 5 median rmse was 21 cm for lsr fdl and slightly higher for fdl alone 22 cm lowest errors for mean period were achieved by swm c followed by lsr fdl with the exception of lsr median bias for wave height and mean period were small as positive bias in some regions tended to cancel out negative biases in others median wave height rmse in lut only predictions was relatively low because most observation sites were not exposed to remote energy overall prediction error was low for the combined models lsr fdl and lsr lut and was similar to swm c accuracy when averaged across locations and conditions 17 21 cm wave height rmse table 5 errors and biases increase when limiting the error analysis to waves conditions where hs 0 5 m but the comparison between models stays mainly the same surprisingly wave height errors and bias are slightly lower for lsr lut predictions compared to swm c but swm c mean period predictions are still more skilled table 5 mean observed and predicted energy as a function of frequency illustrate where offshore energy and local wind generation tend to dominate observations and predictions fig 12 at 46257 the site most exposed to offshore wave energy 10 s energy was the largest contributor and was under predicted by both swm c and lsr fig 12a the combined lsr lut mean energy predictions agree better with observations than swm c predictions that appeared biased high at higher frequency and biased slightly lower at lower frequency while lsr lut appeared best at exposed site 46257 at the mostly sheltered 46088 location mean swm c predictions agreed better with observations fig 12b this is likely due to the lsr predictions underestimating remotely generated energy propagation and the neglected non linear interactions between remotely and locally generated energy in lsr lut in contrast results at w1 w3 were more similar for swm c and lsr lut models fig 12c e at sheltered sites the lut and swm c spectral predictions were mostly similar and agree generally with observations at 46146 mean swm c predictions were closer to observations while lut predictions exceed observed values fig 12f in larger basin winds are much more likely to be spatially heterogeneous and lut assumptions will more often be violated in smaller embayments such as bellingham bay observations and models agree quite closely with the exception of b3 that is very close to shore and likely not well resolved by the model spatial resolution fig 12h k 4 4 model model differences in most cases model model differences are smaller than model errors with observations root mean squared differences rmsd are estimated between swm c and lsr fdl and lsr lut models at observation locations and shown in red outlines in fig 11a b with the exception of s1 s3 wave height and mean period errors between these reduced physics models lsr fdl lsr lut and swm c are lower than errors with the observations themselves this suggests that either the models are prone to errors in very similar ways or that uncertainty in the model forcing dominates prediction error e g biases in wind predictions errors in bathymetry or poorly resolved directional wave spectra offshore results are similar for model biases but less consistent and in some locations model model bias and mode observation is similar median rmsd and bias across observation sites are consistent with these findings indicating that model model differences are generally lower than model errors to observations table 5 while observation sites are sparsely dispersed across the domain model model comparisons illustrate differences spatially across the complex region owing to data constraints spatial outputs were compared over the shorter 2 month time period during october and november of 2019 mean wave heights during this time vary between models but are similar for swm c and lsr lut predictions fig 13a d mean bias between simplified models and swm c shows clearly where offshore energy lsr and locally generated energy lut dominate fig 13e f in the sjf bias between lsr and swm c is relatively small up to 0 30 of the mean wave height while root mean squared differences rmsd normalized by mean swm c wave heights fig 13a are 0 50 fig 13e h in the sog and protected part of puget sound errors and bias between swm c and lut are small 10 30 the combined model lsr lut misfit to swm c is relatively small in most places with bias and rmsds just 10 20 of the mean wave height some exceptions are observed in narrow bays and inlets where swm c spatial resolution was too coarse to resolve wave generation table 2 it is likely the higher resolution lut predictions more correctly represent wave conditions in these locations in the lee of vancouver island eastward just inside the sjf lsr lut predicted wave height are slightly smaller 10 30 than swm c appearing to diffuse less northward energy into basin the north south gradient caused by the sheltering by vancouver island is sharper for lsr lut than for swm c while diffraction is not used in any models non linear wave wave interactions not captured in lsr lut may increase directional spreading breaking down sharp sheltering gradients additionally model spatial and directional resolutions vary significantly and model numerics may also be responsible for reducing gradients in comparatively coarser resolutions 4 5 trade offs non stationary swan simulations at the spatial resolution needed to resolve details of a domain such as the salish sea are currently impractical for long term simulations while the use of unstructured grids has allowed for some progress yang et al 2019 it is unclear whether sheltering details in the sjf are properly resolved or if such a method is practical for much longer simulations the relatively short 2 month non stationary simulations presented here required 9 days to complete on a 2 intel xeon processor e3 1276 v3 nodes 4 cores each a computational cost approximately 3x that of comparable stationary simulations this 3x increase in required expense reduced wave height errors by a relatively modest 1 2 cm at 46257 and spot 1 observation sites table 4 and exhibited relatively small root mean squared differences of 0 10 cm between models across the domain fig 5c while comparatively faster 5 year stationary simulations swm c required 14 days to complete on 12 nodes 4 cores each for many this represents an insignificant computational cost in addition traditional swan implementations must be run again to revise predictions if input forcing is updated or modified this is not uncommon in climate change scenario downscaling where new global forcings become available with each iteration of model development typically these simulations are long 100 years and have multiple scenarios e g representative concentration pathways rcps a significant advantage of the rapid approaches presented here fdl lsr and lut is the insignificant computational cost of producing updated predictions after required simulations are completed though not insignificant the construction of the lut suite of simulations 1 728 in total required approximately 30 days to complete on one intel ivy bridge node 20 cores about 1 2 of the compute time required by the 5 year stationary model swm c albeit computational expense is not directly comparable between the two due to difference in it infrastructure swan simulations required by lsr transformation estimates was comparatively trivial running overnight on a 12 core desktop machine fdl predictions required the most trivial computational cost as no numerical simulations were needed for all of these methods the initial computation was needed only once once simulations were completed predictions were rapidly made for any set of forcing conditions 5 year interpolations can be completed in minutes at observation sites considered here rmse of lsr lut and lsr fdl methods were within 4 cm and 0 5 s of swm c errors for wave height and mean period respectively normalized bias and rmsd between these reduced physics models and swm c range from 0 30 in most of the regions in terms of absolute error to observations the relative gain in accuracy with a traditional swan implementation was found to be considerably small differences between models varied over the region in modestly sized bays with minimal exposure to remotely generated waves differences were quite small while larger differences were observed in more dynamic regions such as the sjf fig 7 without additional observations conclusions about absolute errors and improvement cannot made in addition to computational savings lsr and lut approaches allow for higher spatial resolution than what is practical in traditional swan implementations while resolution varied from 50 1 000 meters in nested swm c domains lsr and lut predictions were made on 50 m and 100 m resolution grids across the puget sound l2 and larger salish sea region l1 lsr table 2 with the potential to resolve nearshore wave conditions more accurately overall these rapid approaches reduce computation cost by 2 4 orders of magnitude while incurring a relatively small loss in accuracy table 5 that may be larger in highly dynamic regions implementation is relatively straightforward but more complex than traditional model building such rapid frameworks excel most strongly where high resolution and very long predictions are required 5 summary in the salish sea region stationary swan assumptions result in only minor skill degradation table 4 swan simulations show that while including currents effects had negligible impact to skill at observation sites available table 4 spatial wave are likely significantly effected in the sjf near dungeness spit fig 6 overall rapid implementations of fetch limited look up table and linear spectral refraction are skill full in much of the region as compared to traditional swan simulations table 5 combinations of these methods appear to capture both remotely and locally generated waves well despite missing non linear interactions between them additionally model model comparisons show lower root mean squared differences than compared with observations fig 11 suggesting that prediction error may be due to uncertainties in model boundary forcing e g errors in wind predictions uncertainties in directional details of offshore waves and errors in bathymetry the rapid approaches presented here may server as a framework for rapid coastal prediction where local remote or both types of wave energy are prevalent the methods require orders of magnitude 2 4 less computation than traditional swan implementations and are well suited to support both rapid near term forecast systems and long term high resolution historical or future

oceanographic deployments on their tidal lands appendix a 1 error metrics the error metrics used throughout are defined here mean bias is defined as 10 bias 1 t i 1 t p i o i where predictions p and observations o are taken from each valid time step i similarly root mean square error rmse is estimated by 11 rmse 1 t i 1 t p i o i 2 normalized metrics are estimated by dividing by mean values after computation rather than determining mean errors from normalized values at each time step these definitions weight larger values more heavily ignoring large relative errors during periods of low energy here normalized bias nbias is defined as 12 nbias 100 1 t i 1 t p i o i 1 t i 1 t o i and normalized root mean squared error nrmse is defined as 13 nrmse 100 1 t i 1 t p i o i 2 1 t i 1 t o i here errors are considered as the difference between model and observations additionally we consider the difference between models such as the bias and normalized root mean squared difference rmsd these consider same formula above but swap o with some reference model prediction e g p r e f here the reference model is typically the more complex model where the goal is to determine what is missing error wise in the simplified model a 2 fetch depth limited optimization fdl predictions can be made rapidly and with two free parameters α and β may be optimized here lsr predictions are added lsr fdl for locations exposed to remotely generated energy wave height rmse vary for lsr fdl predictions over a range of α and β values fig a1 optimal α and β values minimize wave height rmse and are indicated by red circles in fig a1 at varying observation location optimal values were not consistent between observation locations table 1 despite occupying similar large basins without offshore wave exposure lowest rmses at 46146 were observed with small β values while 46131 indicated a larger β yielded better skill fig a1b c observations in bellingham bay b1 b3 show similar disagreement for preferred α and β values the observed lack of agreement of optimal α and β values even in similar locations suggest that these parameters are compensating for wind forcing uncertainties or limitations of the empirical method itself additionally while here wind input is taken at the nearest over water prediction location to the prediction location a more sophisticated approach would be take a weighted average of up wind wind conditions and an optimization of plausible weight parameters may yield more consistent results nonetheless for simplicity here errors were averaged across all sites and an optimal average value of β 1 and α 1 fig a1o was therefore used in the following analysis across the region 
23768,accurate and high resolution wave statistics are critical for regional hazard mapping and planning however long term simulations at high spatial resolution are often computationally prohibitive here multiple rapid frameworks including fetch limited look up table lut and linear propagation are combined and tested in a large estuary exposed to both remotely swell and locally generated waves predictions are compared with observations and a traditional swan implementation coupled to a regional hydrodynamic model fetch limited and lut approaches both perform well where local winds dominate with errors about 10 20 larger than traditional swan predictions combinations of these rapid approaches with linear propagation methods where remotely generated energy is present also perform well with errors 0 20 larger than traditional swan predictions model model comparisons exhibit lower variance than comparisons to observations suggesting that while model implementation impacts prediction skill model boundary conditions winds offshore waves may be a dominant source of error overall results suggest that with a relatively small loss in prediction accuracy simulations computation cost can be significantly reduced by 2 4 orders of magnitude allowing for high resolution and long term predictions to adequately define regional wave statistics keywords ocean waves prediction validation reduced computation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate long term and high resolution wave predictions are needed to assess the flood risk at the coast where rising sea levels and changing coastal conditions may alter wave propagation generation and extreme conditions on the shoreline erikson et al 2015 sweet et al 2022 phase averaged numerical models e g simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 are the defacto approach to predicting wave generation and transformation at the coast while rapidly implemented when boundary forcing is available models like swan require large amount computation for high resolution simulation over long time periods to reduce the computational cost the standard swan implementation may be replaced by faster reduced physics model e g o reilly and guza 1993 leijnse et al 2021 or by utilizing a look up table lut approach e g hegermiller et al 2017 by neglecting the physics of sources sinks and non linear interactions wave energy is rapidly transformation is rapidly computed longuet higgins 1957 dorrestein 1960 crosby et al 2018 this reduced physics approach is skillful where neglected terms are small such as locations like the u s west coast where low frequency energy dominates here the coastal data information program cdip https cdip ucsd edu makes operational wave predictions from buoy observations and linearly propagating wave energy to the shore o reilly and guza 1993 o reilly et al 2016 prior work has also shown that along the shelf of oregon and washington wind wave generation is small compared to remotely generated swell garcía medina et al 2013 illustrating why these rapid transformation approaches are so successful in contrast a look up table lut is typically a suite of simulations for a variety of forcing combinations with the complete model physics the computation reduction comes from discretizing the range of possible forcings this finite set of simulations is computed once and then predictions are simply queried for a given forcing condition for example in a small enclosed basin where wind conditions are spatially homogeneous wind speeds and directions can be binned into discrete values covering the expected range and used as the set of plausible forcings waves are modeled for finite combination of speeds and directions forming a look up table from which to generate rapid predictions golshani 2011 elliott and neill 2015 similar approaches have been applied to the transformation of offshore waves to the nearshore hegermiller et al 2017 but difficulties arise when the range of forcing conditions cannot be characterized within a manageable dimension and total number of required simulations for example if local wind conditions and offshore waves are relatively uncorrelated the number of dissimilar forcing conditions i e offshore wave height period direction wind speed wind direction becomes large additionally offshore waves may not be well represented by a single set of bulk wave parameters kumar et al 2017 or require additional spectral details crosby et al 2016 increasingly sophisticated statistical modeling approaches have been developed to classify weather patterns and using clustering and dissimilarity algorithms to generate a suite of possible model forcing camus et al 2011 2013 however such approaches may fail with novel forcing conditions reduced physics and lut approaches both provide a trade off between accuracy and the required computation and may be more appropriate in specific regions or frequencies here we quantify the trade off between accuracy and computational cost for several model implementations in a semi enclosed estuary where both remotely and locally generated waves are significant section 2 introduces the region and prior wave studies are reviewed observations sites and data are reviewed in section 3 1 and the varying modeling approaches are described in section 3 model skill and comparison throughout the region are assessed in section 4 including the impacts of currents on waves in the region lastly conclusions and results are summarized in section 5 2 regional background the salish sea is a semi protected estuary on the washington and british columbia coast glacially carved it is a system of narrow straits islands sills and basins all at varying spatial scales fig 1 exposed partially to the ne pacific ocean both locally and remotely generated waves are observed with their relative impact depending on exposure strong currents up to 5 m s in narrow tidal channels occur due to a large tidal range 3 4 m and tidal prism thompson and thomson 1994 waves in the salish sea contribute to flooding at high water levels erode unconsolidated shorelines bluffs and marshes drive nearshore transport of sediments and pollutants important to shellfish forage fish and salmon habitats and affect recreational and commercial boating activities that provide critical access to the many islands in the puget sound accurate high resolution long term wave predictions are thus critical to support shoreline planning ecosystem restoration and regional navigation and transportation finlayson 2006b yang et al 2019 battalio et al 2005 gerstel et al 1997 prior wave modeling studies despite the region s complexities show good predictive skill early predictions at cama beach located on camano island fig 1 showed wave conditions are well modeled under stationary assumptions likely because in the enclosed region with relatively short fetches local wind wave generation reaches saturation rapidly finlayson 2006a a more recent regional wave study shows good skill at three moored buoy locations in the strait of juan de fuca sjf and strait of georgia sog with an unstructured grid and non stationary model physics yang et al 2019 the authors note the need to downscale wind predictions from 32 to 12 km to capture wind speeds in the region and derive a regional climatology based on a computationally costly 5 year model simulation though initial studies show predictive skill comparison were made at the few wave observation sites and uncertainties remain regarding the impact of water levels and currents early observations suggest strong modulation of wave heights by tidal currents in the sjf lambrakos 1981 but model studies are still lacking recent work has shown significant impacts to waves by currents globally ardhuin et al 2017 gallet and young 2014 and in the gulf stream hegermiller et al 2019 given the magnitude of currents in the region significant wave impacts are probable to date model validation of nearshore waves and their transformation and impacts across the shoreface are limited to the cama beach study finlayson 2006a despite recent flood impacts associated with waves rapid accurate and high resolution approaches are needed to support ongoing flood hazard risk assessment 3 methods several wave modeling approaches were implemented ranging in complexity from simple parameterized fetch and depth limited predictions to numerical coupled hydrodynamic and wave simulations and are detailed below in most cases waves were simulated

varying exposure to locally and remotely generated waves fig 1 wave conditions from pressure sensor observations were estimated following jones and monismith 2007 3 2 model inputs test 3 2 1

reilly and guza 1993 this is often the case on the u s west coast when long period remotely generated wave energy propagates in deep water over the relatively short continental shelf several prior studies have shown that good predictive skill is achieved with simple shoaling and refraction transformation of wave energy o reilly and guza 1991 1993 crosby et al 2016 and these techniques are currently used operationally by the cdip to make accurate nearshore wave predictions o reilly et al 2016 by ignoring wind wave generation and non linear interactions nearshore and offshore wave energy can be related through a simple linear transformation historically this transformation was estimated by backward ray tracing longuet higgins 1957 dorrestein 1960 mehaute et al 1982 more recently transformations derived from phase averaged wave modeling were shown to be similar when spatial resolution was sufficient crosby et al 2018 here the phase averaged wave model simulating waves

from hrdps forecasts are extracted at the prediction location the argument may be made for extracting wind speed from some upwind direction but for simplicity only wind conditions at the prediction location are used water depths at each modeled time step d are derived from numerical hydrodynamic simulations described in section 3 3 1 3 3 4 look up table lut an alternative to the simple and computationally fast fdl approach is the incrementally more sophisticated and computationally taxing method of creating a look up table lut of pre computed wave simulations a lut is an approach to reducing computation when forcing conditions can be parameterized into a small number of variables and those forcing combinations can be pre computed over the range of expected values when the number of combinations is less than the time steps of the simulation computation costs are reduced prior wave studies have applied a lut approach to transform waves nearshore hegermiller et al 2017 and predict wind wave generation in enclosed basins elliott and neill 2015 golshani 2011 for wind wave generation wind conditions are assumed homogeneous across the model domain and a range of wind speeds and directions are simulated here stationary swan simulations are computed for a suite of wind speeds 0 to 30 m s in 2 5 m s increments wind directions 0 to 360 in 20 increments and water levels 2 to 8 5 m navd88 in 1 5 m increments for a total of 1 728 model runs e g fig 4 two model domains cover the region l1 and l2 with directional resolution of 100 m and 50 m respectively tables 2 and 3 domain l2 is nested inside of domain l1 along the north west boundary fig 1 the models are run in stationary mode with 72 direction bins 5 deg resolution and 45 frequency bins spaced logarithmically from 0

forecasts 2016 2020 3 3 5 lsr fdl and lsr lut combining the lsr predictions with fdl or lut predictions offers a computationally rapid approach to capturing both offshore energy penetration and regional wind wave generation these calculations are done under the following assumptions 1 wind wave generation is unaffected by existing sea state 2 nonlinear wave wave interactions between locally generated and remotely generated waves are insignificant and 3 that all simplifying assumptions in lsr and lut are additionally valid under these assumptions wave energy spectra from remote and local generation is simply additive in practice file storage limitations do not allow for saving frequency directional spectra at all time steps and model locations however where only bulk parameter predictions are saved wave heights can be added in quadrature e g h s 3 2 h s 1 2 h s 2 2 and mean frequency f m is determined by a weighted average 9 f m 3 h s 1 2 f m 1 h s 2 2 f m 2 h s 1 2 h s 2 2 mean wave directions can be similarly estimated by a weighted average but with care taken to use a circular mean however this was not done here 3 3 6 stationary and non stationary wave model swn swm c nwm a more robust but computationally demanding approach to wave prediction is implementation of a phase averaged wave model for continuous simulation here swan was coupled to the regional hydrodynamic model of water level and currents section 3 3 1 with the delft3d flexible mesh modeling suite developed by deltares swan was configured in both stationary and non stationary modes as well as with and without coupling to depth averaged currents spatially varying winds from hrdps section 3 2 1 provide input to local wind wave generation and waves observed at 46087 section 3 2 3 provide offshore spectral forcing to allow for feasible computation a large overall swan domain was created at 1 km spatial resolution with several nested and sub nested domains table 2 fig 1 at resolutions increasing with a factor 5 to 200 m nested and 50 m sub nested nested domains are created at locations with available observations and much of the larger region was not resolved beyond the relatively coarse 1 km to evaluate differences and model skill three configurations were simulated stationary numerics without wave current interactions swm stationary numerics with wave current interactions swm c and non stationary numerics with wave current interactions nwm c a time step of 10 min was used in non stationary simulations while outputs and stationary simulations were computed at hourly intervals the models are similar to lut simulations section 3 3 4 however the number of direction bins was reduced to 36 10 deg resolution to lower computational expense convergence criteria were set similarly to lsr simulations section 3 3 2 but with a maximum number of iteration of 50 in the stationary simulations it was found to be necessary in non stationary simulations to increase the maximum number of iterations from the default of 1 to 10 3 4 simulation time periods wave simulations were performed over two time periods table 3 owing to computational constraints swm swm c and nwn c simulations were completed during the comparatively short 2 month period from october to november of 2019 longer 5 year simulation were computed for swm c and all rapid approaches fdl lsr lut from 2016 2020 where both hrdps wind forcing section 3 2 1 and regional wave observations were available table 1 4 results and discussion overall results suggest that including additional physics in numerical models tends to improve prediction skill however this improvement is in some cases marginal and may not be worth the computational expense below predictions with stationary and non stationary numerics are compared the impact of wave current interactions are evaluated and reduced physics model implementations are compared 4 1 non stationary vs stationary stationary and non stationary simulations should begin to diverge where the domain is large enough such that the sea state does not fully develop within the model time step 1 h comparisons of swm c and nwm c significant wave height h s predictions from oct nov 2019 show the largest root mean squared differences rmsd of 5 10 cm in the regions with the largest basins such as the sog and sjf and smaller differences 0 5 cm in smaller basins such as those within near seattle fig 5 fig 1 these differences appear to be primarily a result of timing as mean bias between swm c and nwm c are comparatively small 0 2 cm on average swm c simulations produce slightly higher wave heights resulting in a consistent negative bias across the domain fig 5b prediction errors are also examined for both models root mean squared error rmse at three observation sites with data during this period are lower by 1 5 cm for nwm c predictions compared to swm c predictions table 4 the largest improvement is observed at 46257 and 46146 both located in larger open basins fig 1 bias at observations sites is relatively similar for nwm c and swm c within 1 2 cm and range from 3 to 8 cm table 4 overall the error with observations is larger than the differences between models suggesting the dominant error terms are not stationary non stationary assumptions while accuracy is improved with non stationary assumptions the computational cost of non stationary simulations were approximately 3x that of stationary simulations 4 2 current effects over the shorter simulation period oct nov 2019 stationary simulations swm are compared with and without currents table 3 mean normalized bias appendix a 1 swm c swm varies from 10 40 with the strongest negative values east and west of dungeness spit where depth averaged mean currents show a clockwise circulation pattern fig 6a mean wave heights are generally 10 20 higher for swm c predictions in the northern part of domain d2 fig 6 here the region is sheltered from offshore energy in the sjf by the southern most tip of vancouver island current refraction is likely increasing the directional spread in wave conditions allowing for additional energy penetration into sheltered regions ardhuin et al 2017 differences between mean wave heights in domains d3 and d4 are much smaller as currents at these locations are slower fig 6b c similar patterns of root mean squared differences rmsd in wave heights are observed with differences ranging from 0 50 in domain d2 and much less in domains d3 and d4 fig 6 prediction errors for swm and swm c at observation sites available during the simulation period are surprisingly similar table 4 while swm c errors are slightly larger at 46257 this difference is not likely significant this prediction error similarity is likely because 46257 is at site of strong current shear fig 7 further study is needed to quantify both the accuracy of current predictions and the potential improvement in prediction accuracy possible by including currents in wave simulations 4 3 accuracy at observation locations overall predictions during the nearly 5 year simulation period table 3 were skilled with increasingly complex and computationally costly models performing slightly better fourteen day time series at observation locations illustrate some differences and deficiencies fig 8 at locations partially sheltered to offshore wave energy 46088 w1 w2 w3 lsr under predicted because of the lack of local wind wave generation fig 8a i m n at the relatively exposed location 46257 lsr predictions showed better agreement with observations at most times but local wind waves appeared important as well as indicated by fdl and lut predictions fig 8d modeled wave heights at completely sheltered locations i e not exposed to remote wave energy were most similar predictions in bellingham and skagit bays in general show good agreement with observations and between models swan c lut and fdl with the exception of locations s1 and s2 where all models were biased low fig 8i j under predicted wind speeds are suspected as the primary drive of this bias however robust wind observations were not available at this location to confirm this hypothesis in larger basins such as the sog and inside the sjf peak wave heights appeared over predicted by the lut approach but fdl and swan c were similar and more closely aligned with observations fig 8a b c predictions at 46257 were examined more closely as the site is most exposed to remotely generated energy while local generation still relatively important lsr lut and lsr fdl wave height predictions showed good agreement with swan c despite the simplifications employed fig 9a overall swm c predictions appeared slightly higher during this time period while lsr lut and lsr fdl appeared more closely aligned with observations mean wave period was also well predicted by lsr lut and lsr fdl and showed clearly the oscillation between remotely and locally generated wave conditions fig 9b mean wave direction was also well predicted though it is clear that nw energy both from local winds and offshore waves tend to dominate across observation locations swan c and lsr lut wave height predictions showed the best agreement with observations fig 10 at most locations lsr fdl predictions had a negative bias indicated by quantile quantile curves magenta fig 10 at some locations lsr lut wave height distributions appeared closest to observations while at others swm predictions appeared best at s1 and s2 a clear negative bias was present for all model configurations confirming that the observed biases in fig 8 were typical throughout the record wave height root mean squared error rmse varied across locations but was lowest for swm c predictions at most sites green bars in fig 11a this was similarly true for mean wave periods fig 11b while lsr lut wave height errors were lower than lsr fdl mean wave period errors were higher larger lsr lut rmse occurred most strongly at sites 46088 w1 w2 and w3 located just inside the sjf this appears driven by larger negative bias in mean wave height prediction fig 11d wave height biases varied but are mostly consistent between models suggesting that either models contain a very similar bias or that model forcing biases are driving these errors fig 11c for example the largest biases were observed at w1 w3 where small amounts of offshore energy propagation may be difficult to resolve and highly influence by directional details not resolved well by the directional coefficients measured by 46087 ochoa and delgado gonzález 1990 median rmse from all observations sites except for b3 where swm c predictions are not available for swm c and lsr lut were similar 17 cm table 5 median rmse was 21 cm for lsr fdl and slightly higher for fdl alone 22 cm lowest errors for mean period were achieved by swm c followed by lsr fdl with the exception of lsr median bias for wave height and mean period were small as positive bias in some regions tended to cancel out negative biases in others median wave height rmse in lut only predictions was relatively low because most observation sites were not exposed to remote energy overall prediction error was low for the combined models lsr fdl and lsr lut and was similar to swm c accuracy when averaged across locations and conditions 17 21 cm wave height rmse table 5 errors and biases increase when limiting the error analysis to waves conditions where hs 0 5 m but the comparison between models stays mainly the same surprisingly wave height errors and bias are slightly lower for lsr lut predictions compared to swm c but swm c mean period predictions are still more skilled table 5 mean observed and predicted energy as a function of frequency illustrate where offshore energy and local wind generation tend to dominate observations and predictions fig 12 at 46257 the site most exposed to offshore wave energy 10 s energy was the largest contributor and was under predicted by both swm c and lsr fig 12a the combined lsr lut mean energy predictions agree better with observations than swm c predictions that appeared biased high at higher frequency and biased slightly lower at lower frequency while lsr lut appeared best at exposed site 46257 at the mostly sheltered 46088 location mean swm c predictions agreed better with observations fig 12b this is likely due to the lsr predictions underestimating remotely generated energy propagation and the neglected non linear interactions between remotely and locally generated energy in lsr lut in contrast results at w1 w3 were more similar for swm c and lsr lut models fig 12c e at sheltered sites the lut and swm c spectral predictions were mostly similar and agree generally with observations at 46146 mean swm c predictions were closer to observations while lut predictions exceed observed values fig 12f in larger basin winds are much more likely to be spatially heterogeneous and lut assumptions will more often be violated in smaller embayments such as bellingham bay observations and models agree quite closely with the exception of b3 that is very close to shore and likely not well resolved by the model spatial resolution fig 12h k 4 4 model model differences in most cases model model differences are smaller than model errors with observations root mean squared differences rmsd are estimated between swm c and lsr fdl and lsr lut models at observation locations and shown in red outlines in fig 11a b with the exception of s1 s3 wave height and mean period errors between these reduced physics models lsr fdl lsr lut and swm c are lower than errors with the observations themselves this suggests that either the models are prone to errors in very similar ways or that uncertainty in the model forcing dominates prediction error e g biases in wind predictions errors in bathymetry or poorly resolved directional wave spectra offshore results are similar for model biases but less consistent and in some locations model model bias and mode observation is similar median rmsd and bias across observation sites are consistent with these findings indicating that model model differences are generally lower than model errors to observations table 5 while observation sites are sparsely dispersed across the domain model model comparisons illustrate differences spatially across the complex region owing to data constraints spatial outputs were compared over the shorter 2 month time period during october and november of 2019 mean wave heights during this time vary between models but are similar for swm c and lsr lut predictions fig 13a d mean bias between simplified models and swm c shows clearly where offshore energy lsr and locally generated energy lut dominate fig 13e f in the sjf bias between lsr and swm c is relatively small up to 0 30 of the mean wave height while root mean squared differences rmsd normalized by mean swm c wave heights fig 13a are 0 50 fig 13e h in the sog and protected part of puget sound errors and bias between swm c and lut are small 10 30 the combined model lsr lut misfit to swm c is relatively small in most places with bias and rmsds just 10 20 of the mean wave height some exceptions are observed in narrow bays and inlets where swm c spatial resolution was too coarse to resolve wave generation table 2 it is likely the higher resolution lut predictions more correctly represent wave conditions in these locations in the lee of vancouver island eastward just inside the sjf lsr lut predicted wave height are slightly smaller 10 30 than swm c appearing to diffuse less northward energy into basin the north south gradient caused by the sheltering by vancouver island is sharper for lsr lut than for swm c while diffraction is not used in any models non linear wave wave interactions not captured in lsr lut may increase directional spreading breaking down sharp sheltering gradients additionally model spatial and directional resolutions vary significantly and model numerics may also be responsible for reducing gradients in comparatively coarser resolutions 4 5 trade offs non stationary swan simulations at the spatial resolution needed to resolve details of a domain such as the salish sea are currently impractical for long term simulations while the use of unstructured grids has allowed for some progress yang et al 2019 it is unclear whether sheltering details in the sjf are properly resolved or if such a method is practical for much longer simulations the relatively short 2 month non stationary simulations presented here required 9 days to complete on a 2 intel xeon processor e3 1276 v3 nodes 4 cores each a computational cost approximately 3x that of comparable stationary simulations this 3x increase in required expense reduced wave height errors by a relatively modest 1 2 cm at 46257 and spot 1 observation sites table 4 and exhibited relatively small root mean squared differences of 0 10 cm between models across the domain fig 5c while comparatively faster 5 year stationary simulations swm c required 14 days to complete on 12 nodes 4 cores each for many this represents an insignificant computational cost in addition traditional swan implementations must be run again to revise predictions if input forcing is updated or modified this is not uncommon in climate change scenario downscaling where new global forcings become available with each iteration of model development typically these simulations are long 100 years and have multiple scenarios e g representative concentration pathways rcps a significant advantage of the rapid approaches presented here fdl lsr and lut is the insignificant computational cost of producing updated predictions after required simulations are completed though not insignificant the construction of the lut suite of simulations 1 728 in total required approximately 30 days to complete on one intel ivy bridge node 20 cores about 1 2 of the compute time required by the 5 year stationary model swm c albeit computational expense is not directly comparable between the two due to difference in it infrastructure swan simulations required by lsr transformation estimates was comparatively trivial running overnight on a 12 core desktop machine fdl predictions required the most trivial computational cost as no numerical simulations were needed for all of these methods the initial computation was needed only once once simulations were completed predictions were rapidly made for any set of forcing conditions 5 year interpolations can be completed in minutes at observation sites considered here rmse of lsr lut and lsr fdl methods were within 4 cm and 0 5 s of swm c errors for wave height and mean period respectively normalized bias and rmsd between these reduced physics models and swm c range from 0 30 in most of the regions in terms of absolute error to observations the relative gain in accuracy with a traditional swan implementation was found to be considerably small differences between models varied over the region in modestly sized bays with minimal exposure to remotely generated waves differences were quite small while larger differences were observed in more dynamic regions such as the sjf fig 7 without additional observations conclusions about absolute errors and improvement cannot made in addition to computational savings lsr and lut approaches allow for higher spatial resolution than what is practical in traditional swan implementations while resolution varied from 50 1 000 meters in nested swm c domains lsr and lut predictions were made on 50 m and 100 m resolution grids across the puget sound l2 and larger salish sea region l1 lsr table 2 with the potential to resolve nearshore wave conditions more accurately overall these rapid approaches reduce computation cost by 2 4 orders of magnitude while incurring a relatively small loss in accuracy table 5 that may be larger in highly dynamic regions implementation is relatively straightforward but more complex than traditional model building such rapid frameworks excel most strongly where high resolution and very long predictions are required 5 summary in the salish sea region stationary swan assumptions result in only minor skill degradation table 4 swan simulations show that while including currents effects had negligible impact to skill at observation sites available table 4 spatial wave are likely significantly effected in the sjf near dungeness spit fig 6 overall rapid implementations of fetch limited look up table and linear spectral refraction are skill full in much of the region as compared to traditional swan simulations table 5 combinations of these methods appear to capture both remotely and locally generated waves well despite missing non linear interactions between them additionally model model comparisons show lower root mean squared differences than compared with observations fig 11 suggesting that prediction error may be due to uncertainties in model boundary forcing e g errors in wind predictions uncertainties in directional details of offshore waves and errors in bathymetry the rapid approaches presented here may server as a framework for rapid coastal prediction where local remote or both types of wave energy are prevalent the methods require orders of magnitude 2 4 less computation than traditional swan implementations and are well suited to support both rapid near term forecast systems and long term high resolution historical or future

observations o are taken from each valid time step i similarly root mean square error rmse is estimated by 11 rmse 1 t i 1 t p i o i 2 normalized metrics are estimated by dividing by mean values after

error wise in the simplified model a 2 fetch depth limited optimization fdl predictions can be made rapidly and with two free parameters α and β may be optimized here lsr predictions are added lsr fdl for locations exposed to remotely generated energy wave height rmse vary for lsr fdl predictions over a range of α and β values fig a1 optimal α and β values minimize wave height rmse and are indicated by red circles in fig a1 at varying observation location optimal values were not consistent between observation locations table 1 despite occupying similar large basins without offshore wave exposure lowest rmses at 46146 were observed with small β values while 46131 indicated a larger β yielded better skill fig a1b c observations in bellingham bay b1 b3 show similar disagreement for preferred α and β values the observed lack of agreement of optimal α and β values even in similar locations suggest that these parameters are compensating for wind forcing uncertainties or limitations of the empirical method itself additionally while here wind input is taken at the nearest over water prediction location to the prediction location a more sophisticated approach would be take a weighted average of up wind wind conditions and an optimization of plausible weight parameters may yield more consistent results nonetheless for simplicity here errors were averaged across all sites and an optimal average value of β 1 and α 1 fig a1o was therefore used in the following analysis across the region 
23769,the process of eddy shedding from the kuroshio loop current lc into the south china sea via the luzon strait is highly variable and significantly controlled by the uncertainties in the western pacific wp currents this study investigates the forecast of a strong eddy shedding event from the kuroshio lc during the winter 2016 2017 using the regional ocean modeling system and ensemble kalman filter assimilation method experiments are conducted to explore the sensitivity of forecasts to the assimilation of satellite sea surface height anomaly data from different key regions of the wp such as the subtropical countercurrent stcc and northern equatorial current nec regions the results indicate that the improved forecast performance of the strong kuroshio lc eddy shedding event is mainly attributed to assimilation in the stcc region and partly owing to assimilation in the nec region specifically assimilation in the stcc region reproduces a westward propagating cyclonic eddy that collides with the kuroshio in the luzon strait blocking the kuroshio northward flow and causing kuroshio lc eddy shedding furthermore assimilation in the nec region enhances the simulation of the weak kuroshio background current which further facilitates the formation of a strong kuroshio background lc and the occurrence of kuroshio lc eddy shedding keywords ensemble kalman filter enkf eddy shedding forecast kuroshio intrusion data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the luzon strait ls is a key water exchange channel between the south china sea scs and the western pacific wp the kuroshio intrusion into the scs through the ls shows distinct seasonal characteristics which are stronger in winter and weaker in summer hu et al 2000 qu 2000 xue et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 in winter the enhanced kuroshio intrusion into the scs can form a strong anticyclone loop current lc to the west of the ls leading to strong lc eddy shedding gan et al 2006 wang et al 2008 nan et al 2011 this shedding phenomenon significantly triggers active mesoscale eddies and intra seasonal variability in the northern scs wang et al 2003 chen et al 2012 sun et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that local wind can play a crucial role in the formation of the kuroshio lc and eddy shedding metzger and hurlburt 1996 jia et al 2005 nof et al 2011 hsin et al 2012 in particular jia and chassignet 2011 note that eddy shedding is induced by the expanded loop owing to enhanced westward ekman transport through the ls however in addition to local wind ocean internal processes especially those originating from the wp such as the kuroshio background current upstream of the ls and westward propagating eddies in the subtropical countercurrent stcc region are also significant driving factors in eddy shedding from the lc wu and chiang 2007 xie et al 2016 xu et al 2021 according to the teapot effect the kuroshio background current upstream of the ls controls the kuroshio inflow into the scs and further modulates the kuroshio lc sheremet 2001 wang et al 2006 xiao et al 2018 when the kuroshio background current is weak the kuroshio inflow into the scs tends to be strengthened furthermore mesoscale eddies propagating westward towards the ls from the eastern basin can also affect the growth or decay of anticyclonic intrusions of the kuroshio yuan et al 2006 yuan and wang 2011 it has been reported that cyclonic eddies ces from the east can contribute to enhancing the looping path and facilitating the detachment of the anticyclonic loop from the kuroshio

this study two possible predictors were considered for the eddy shedding in the lc the kuroshio background current upstream of the ls and westward propagating eddies in the stcc region to investigate these predictors two sensitive regions in the wp fig 3a were selected one covered the northern equatorial current nec and the other covered the stcc the study was designed with five experiments a control experiment ctl without data assimilation and four forecast experiments in the first forecast experiment da nec observations only from the nec region were assimilated while in the second da stcc observations only from the stcc region were assimilated the third experiment da nec stcc assimilated observations from both the nec and stcc regions while the fourth experiment da all assimilated observations from the entire model region each experiment comprised of an ensemble of 27 members with initial members randomly sampled from the daily outputs of the roms runs between september 1 to november 31 2016 with a minimum time interval of 3 days the runs of the 27 members were started on october 16 2016 identical atmospheric forcing and boundary conditions were used for all experimental runs in each forecast experiment aviso ssha data were assimilated every 6 days spanning the period from october 16 2016 to february 1 2017 following this a four week forecast was conducted from february 1 2017 to february 28 2017 to avoid introducing spurious geostrophic currents at the edges of the assimilated region which may arise due to the assimilation of ssha solely within a confined region of the model domain we conducted a bias calculation this bias was defined as the mean difference between the observed and modeled ssha over the entire model domain during the experimental period prior to assimilation into the model aviso ssha measurements were adjusted by subtracting the calculated bias the observation error of assimilation was set to 3 cm the vertical and horizontal localized radii were set to 600 m and 100 km respectively in this study our primary focus was on ctl and the first three assimilation experiments the purpose of setting up da all was to discuss the influence of uncertainties in local regions on the forecast of kuroshio lc eddy shedding 4 results 4 1 forecast performance the ensemble spread which represents the uncertainties of the ensemble leeuwenburgh 2007 shu et al 2011a is calculated as the standard deviation the spatial distributions of adt spreads on the first day of the experiment october 16 2016 in the ctl are shown in fig 3a the large spreads in wp are primarily concentrated in two sensitive regions the nec region and the stcc region fig 3b depicts the time series of the area averaged ensemble spreads of adt over these two sensitive regions in ctl owing to the identical ocean boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing in all ensemble runs the spreads initially decrease in both two sensitive regions however ocean intrinsic variability leads to a gradual increase in the spreads therefore assimilation is necessary to reduce simulation errors in these two sensitive regions to evaluate the effectiveness of data assimilation the time series of the root mean square error rmse of ssha in the nec and stcc regions for the ctl and data assimilation experiment da nec stcc are presented in fig 4 the results demonstrate the significant reduction in simulation errors of ssha in both nec and stcc regions due to assimilation during the four week forecast period the forecast errors in da nec stcc gradually increased in both regions but remained lower than those in ctl these findings not only underscore the effectiveness of assimilation but also suggest that the initial conditions had a persistent impact on the forecast for at least four weeks fig 5 presents the adt and agc fields from different experiments and aviso the aviso data clearly reflect the kuroshio lc eddy shedding process specifically on february 1st 2017 a strong anticyclonic loop formed which gradually separated from the kuroshio as an anticyclonic eddy ae during february fig 5d in contrast the simulated anticyclonic loop in ctl black line in fig 5 was relatively weak and did not shed into the scs in ctl although the assimilation of aviso ssha in the nec region enhanced the kuroshio lc during february 2017 da nec still failed to forecast the lc eddy shedding fig 5a it is worth noting that da stcc and da nec stcc successfully predicted the ae shedding process figs 5b and 5c in contrast to da stcc da nec stcc had an earlier and more accurate prediction of the ae shedding time which could be attributed to the combined effects of the assimilation in the nec and stcc regions together the time series of the assimilation increments for the kuroshio surface intrusion through ls and kwi in the above three da experiments are shown in fig 6 the kuroshio surface intrusion is defined by the integral of zonal surface agc along the section across the ls the black line in fig 7 where negative values indicate an intrusion from the wp to the scs assimilation in the stcc and nec regions together significantly intensified the kuroshio surface intrusion during january 3 february 6 2017 leading to a subsequent enhancement of the lc pink line in fig 6a and b the enhancement of the lc favored the occurrence of the kuroshio lc eddy shedding event in february 2017 the peak value of the intensified kuroshio surface intrusion and kwi in the da nec stcc occurred on january 18 2017 and february 6 2017 respectively reflecting an approximately 19 day lag relationship between the variation in the kuroshio surface intrusion and lc among the peak values of the intensified kuroshio surface intrusion and kwi in all three da experiments the strongest was obtained in da nec stcc pink line in fig 6 this was followed by the one in da stcc green line in fig 6 while the weakest was found in da nec brown line in fig 6 these results demonstrated that assimilation in the stcc region played a dominant role in improving the forecast performance of the strong kuroshio lc eddy shedding event with some contributions also coming from assimilation in the nec region 4 2 effect of uncertainties in the stcc region on eddy shedding as described above assimilation in the stcc region played a main role in improving the forecast accuracy of kuroshio lc eddy shedding to explain the reason ssha fields with the induced surface geostrophic current anomaly are presented in fig 7 the observed ssha field revealed the presence of a preexisting strong cyclonic eddy ce using the winding angle method sadarjoen and post 2000 we tracked this eddy as it moved westward and reached near the ls in early january 2017 fig 7c by calculating the kuroshio surface inflow through the ls using aviso data a distinct negative peak was observed on january 26 2017 as depicted by the black line in fig 8 this indicated that as the ce approached the kuroshio it gradually blocked the northward flow of the kuroshio resulting in an increase of the kuroshio inflow zheng et al 2019 the intensified kuroshio inflow was able to further expand the lc and trigger eddy shedding considering that the generation of eddies in the stcc region was caused by strong ocean instability the ctl could hardly reproduce observed eddies without assimilation fig 7a however by assimilating aviso ssha in the stcc region the westward movement of the strong ce could be reproduced fig 7b it should be noted that the observed strong kuroshio inflow around january 26 2017 was also well presented in da stcc and da stcc nec while it was not captured in da nec fig 8 these results suggested that the intensified kuroshio inflow was a response to the interaction between the westward propagating ce and kuroshio therefore the assimilation of aviso observation data in the stcc region improved the forecast performance of kuroshio lc eddy shedding by successfully reproducing the westward movement of the ce 4 3 effect of uncertainties in the nec region on eddy shedding in addition to the uncertainties of the westward propagating ce in the stcc region the forecast of eddy shedding from the kuroshio lc was also partly influenced by the uncertainties in the nec region fig 9 displays the standardized time series of the roms simulated and aviso observed kuroshio surface meridional agc velocity anomaly averaged along the 16 5 n section as indicated by pink line in fig 2a the solid line is a linear fit of the daily velocity anomaly representing the kuroshio background current velocity prior to february 1 2017 the aviso observed kuroshio background current velocity black solid line in fig 9 was generally weaker than that of the simulated kuroshio background current velocity in ctl blue solid line in fig 9 this weakened kuroshio background current could enhance kuroshio intrusion into the scs and result in an anomalously strong kuroshio lc due to the teapot effect by assimilating the aviso ssha data in the nec region both the da nec and da nec stcc exhibited weaker kuroshio background currents in comparison to ctl prior to february 1 2017 which was consistent with the aviso observations the simulated anomalously weak kuroshio background current led to the strengthening of kuroshio intrusion after december 21 2016 brown line in fig 6a and enhancement of kuroshio lc after january 23 2017 brown line in fig 6b it is worth mentioning that during the period from september 2016 to january 2017 the kuroshio background current was observed to be at its weakest compared to the same timeframe from 2010 to 2020 fig 10 the low frequency variability of the kuroshio background current is primarily influenced by large scale wind forcing qiu and lukas 1996 the abnormally weak kuroshio background current prior to february 1 2017 created favorable conditions for the occurrence of intense kuroshio eddy shedding events in february 2017 consequently the assimilation in the nec region facilitated the separation of the eddy in da nec stcc from the kuroshio lc more readily than that in da stcc 4 4 effect of local uncertainties on eddy shedding the above studies clearly showed the effects of the uncertainties in the modeled nec and stcc regions on the forecasts of the strong kuroshio lc eddy shedding event in the winter of 2016 2017 however the separated ae from the kuroshio lc in da nec stcc did not exhibit a clearly defined westward propagating feature when compared to aviso data to address this limitation a 4 week forecast experiment assimilating the observations in the entire region denoted da all was conducted the lc in the initial field of da all matched well with the aviso observed lc fig 11a furthermore da all predicted a more distinct westward propagation of the ae in the scs after its shedding than da nec stcc it is important to note that the westward propagation of eddies along the slope is significantly influenced by local eddy self dissipation and the surrounding background current in the scs zu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 shu et al 2019 therefore the state of local circulation in the scs plays a key role in predicting westward propagation of the ae after its shedding when compared to the circulation in the wp moreover the predictability of oceanic processes was found to be closely linked to the persistence of assimilation information fu et al 2011 in da nec stcc forecasting accuracy could be compromised when assimilation information was transferred from the assimilated region into the ls through model integration this issue was further compounded by the complex interactions between eddies and the kuroshio current future studies could partially address this problem by using higher resolution models and observations 5 conclusion and discussion in the present study enkf with eddy resolved roms was applied to forecast the state of a strong kuroshio lc and its accompanying eddy shedding process during the winter of 2016 2017 the relationship between the kwi and ekman transport through ls revealed that this eddy shedding process was significantly governed by internal dynamics of the ocean by assimilating aviso ssha data on different sensitive regions we evaluated the effects of the uncertainties of different ocean internal processes within the wp on the forecast accuracy of this eddy shedding event one sensitive region covered the nec which corresponded to the kuroshio background current whereas the other sensitive region encompassed the stcc which corresponded to the westward propagating eddy the results showed that the occurrence of eddy shedding in the forecast was strongly connected to the enhancement of the kuroshio lc primarily due to the reduced uncertainties in the stcc region and partially due to the reduced uncertainties in the nec region specifically assimilation of ssha observations in the stcc region helped identify the observed westward propagating ce which collided with the kuroshio near the ls causing eddy shedding by enhancing the kuroshio inflow this phenomenon was supported by observational evidence from aviso data on the other hand although the assimilation of the aviso ssha observations in the nec region alone could not forecast the eddy shedding it did reproduce the observed low frequency weak anomaly of the kuroshio background current and promote the formation of a strong kuroshio background lc to some extent this suggested that when the kuroshio background lc was stronger the lc would shed more easily during a ce kuroshio collision in the ls therefore assimilation in the nec and stcc regions together presented a better forecast performance more accurately predicting the occurrence time of eddy shedding than did the assimilation in the stcc region only from the perspective of data assimilation we explained the synergistic effects of the two main controlling factors in the wp on the kuroshio lc eddy shedding process in the winter of 2016 2017 the stronger ce momentum in the stcc region relative to the kuroshio momentum is likely the primary factor contributing to the greater significance of assimilation in the stcc region compared to the nec region for forecasting kuroshio lc eddy shedding zheng et al 2019 however since the focus of our study is solely on predicting kuroshio lc eddy shedding for a typical case through sensitive forecast experiments it is important to quantify the contributions of various controlling factors to this process for additional cases in the future furthermore a more comprehensive analysis including examining the interactions between different controlling factors is also essential for gaining a deeper understanding of the kuroshio lc eddy

23769,the process of eddy shedding from the kuroshio loop current lc into the south china sea via the luzon strait is highly variable and significantly controlled by the uncertainties in the western pacific wp currents this study investigates the forecast of a strong eddy shedding event from the kuroshio lc during the winter 2016 2017 using the regional ocean modeling system and ensemble kalman filter assimilation method experiments are conducted to explore the sensitivity of forecasts to the assimilation of satellite sea surface height anomaly data from different key regions of the wp such as the subtropical countercurrent stcc and northern equatorial current nec regions the results indicate that the improved forecast performance of the strong kuroshio lc eddy shedding event is mainly attributed to assimilation in the stcc region and partly owing to assimilation in the nec region specifically assimilation in the stcc region reproduces a westward propagating cyclonic eddy that collides with the kuroshio in the luzon strait blocking the kuroshio northward flow and causing kuroshio lc eddy shedding furthermore assimilation in the nec region enhances the simulation of the weak kuroshio background current which further facilitates the formation of a strong kuroshio background lc and the occurrence of kuroshio lc eddy shedding keywords ensemble kalman filter enkf eddy shedding forecast kuroshio intrusion data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the luzon strait ls is a key water exchange channel between the south china sea scs and the western pacific wp the kuroshio intrusion into the scs through the ls shows distinct seasonal characteristics which are stronger in winter and weaker in summer hu et al 2000 qu 2000 xue et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 in winter the enhanced kuroshio intrusion into the scs can form a strong anticyclone loop current lc to the west of the ls leading to strong lc eddy shedding gan et al 2006 wang et al 2008 nan et al 2011 this shedding phenomenon significantly triggers active mesoscale eddies and intra seasonal variability in the northern scs wang et al 2003 chen et al 2012 sun et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that local wind can play a crucial role in the formation of the kuroshio lc and eddy shedding metzger and hurlburt 1996 jia et al 2005 nof et al 2011 hsin et al 2012 in particular jia and chassignet 2011 note that eddy shedding is induced by the expanded loop owing to enhanced westward ekman transport through the ls however in addition to local wind ocean internal processes especially those originating from the wp such as the kuroshio background current upstream of the ls and westward propagating eddies in the subtropical countercurrent stcc region are also significant driving factors in eddy shedding from the lc wu and chiang 2007 xie et al 2016 xu et al 2021 according to the teapot effect the kuroshio background current upstream of the ls controls the kuroshio inflow into the scs and further modulates the kuroshio lc sheremet 2001 wang et al 2006 xiao et al 2018 when the kuroshio background current is weak the kuroshio inflow into the scs tends to be strengthened furthermore mesoscale eddies propagating westward towards the ls from the eastern basin can also affect the growth or decay of anticyclonic intrusions of the kuroshio yuan et al 2006 yuan and wang 2011 it has been reported that cyclonic eddies ces from the east can contribute to enhancing the looping path and facilitating the detachment of the anticyclonic loop from the kuroshio

localized radii were set to 600 m and 100 km respectively in this study our primary focus was on ctl and the first three assimilation experiments the purpose of setting up da all was to discuss the influence of uncertainties in local regions on the forecast of kuroshio lc eddy shedding 4 results 4 1 forecast performance the ensemble spread which represents the uncertainties of the ensemble leeuwenburgh 2007 shu et al 2011a is calculated as the standard deviation the spatial distributions of adt spreads on the first day of the experiment october 16 2016 in the ctl are shown in fig 3a the large spreads in wp are primarily concentrated in two sensitive regions the nec region and the stcc region fig 3b depicts the time series of the area averaged ensemble spreads of adt over these two sensitive regions in ctl owing to the identical ocean boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing in all ensemble runs the spreads initially decrease in both two sensitive regions however ocean intrinsic variability leads to a gradual increase in the spreads therefore assimilation is necessary to reduce simulation errors in these two sensitive regions to evaluate the effectiveness of data assimilation the time series of the root mean square error rmse of ssha in the nec and stcc regions for the ctl and data assimilation experiment da nec stcc are presented in fig 4 the results demonstrate the significant reduction in simulation errors of ssha in both nec and stcc regions due to assimilation during the four week forecast period the forecast errors in da nec stcc gradually increased in both regions but remained lower than those in ctl these findings not only underscore the effectiveness of assimilation but also suggest that the initial conditions had a persistent impact on the forecast for at least four weeks fig 5 presents the adt and agc fields from different experiments and aviso the aviso data clearly reflect the kuroshio lc eddy shedding process specifically on february 1st 2017 a strong anticyclonic loop formed which gradually separated from the kuroshio as an anticyclonic eddy ae during february fig 5d in contrast the simulated anticyclonic loop in ctl black line in fig 5 was relatively weak and did not shed into the scs in ctl although the assimilation of aviso ssha in the nec region enhanced the kuroshio lc during february 2017 da nec still failed to forecast the lc eddy shedding fig 5a it is worth noting that da stcc and da nec stcc successfully predicted the ae shedding process figs 5b and 5c in contrast to da stcc da nec stcc had an earlier and more accurate prediction of the ae shedding time which could be attributed to the combined effects of the assimilation in the nec and stcc regions together the time series of the assimilation increments for the kuroshio surface intrusion through ls and kwi in the above three da experiments are shown in fig 6 the kuroshio surface intrusion is defined by the integral of zonal surface agc along the section across the ls the black line in fig 7 where negative values indicate an intrusion from the wp to the scs assimilation in the stcc and nec regions together significantly intensified the kuroshio surface intrusion during january 3 february 6 2017 leading to a subsequent enhancement of the lc pink line in fig 6a and b the enhancement of the lc favored the occurrence of the kuroshio lc eddy shedding event in february 2017 the peak value of the intensified kuroshio surface intrusion and kwi in the da nec stcc occurred on january 18 2017 and february 6 2017 respectively reflecting an approximately 19 day lag relationship between the variation in the kuroshio surface intrusion and lc among the peak values of the intensified kuroshio surface intrusion and kwi in all three da experiments the strongest was obtained in da nec stcc pink line in fig 6 this was followed by the one in da stcc green line in fig 6 while the weakest was found in da nec brown line in fig 6 these results demonstrated that assimilation in the stcc region played a dominant role in improving the forecast performance of the strong kuroshio lc eddy shedding event with some contributions also coming from assimilation in the nec region 4 2 effect of uncertainties in the stcc region on eddy shedding as described above assimilation in the stcc region played a main role in improving the forecast accuracy of kuroshio lc eddy shedding to explain the reason ssha fields with the induced surface geostrophic current anomaly are presented in fig 7 the observed ssha field revealed the presence of a preexisting strong cyclonic eddy ce using the winding angle method sadarjoen and post 2000 we tracked this eddy as it moved westward and reached near the ls in early january 2017 fig 7c by calculating the kuroshio surface inflow through the ls using aviso data a distinct negative peak was observed on january 26 2017 as depicted by the black line in fig 8 this indicated that as the ce approached the kuroshio it gradually blocked the northward flow of the kuroshio resulting in an increase of the kuroshio inflow zheng et al 2019 the intensified kuroshio inflow was able to further expand the lc and trigger eddy shedding considering that the generation of eddies in the stcc region was caused by strong ocean instability the ctl could hardly reproduce observed eddies without assimilation fig 7a however by assimilating aviso ssha in the stcc region the westward movement of the strong ce could be reproduced fig 7b it should be noted that the observed strong kuroshio inflow around january 26 2017 was also well presented in da stcc and da stcc nec while it was not captured in da nec fig 8 these results suggested that the intensified kuroshio inflow was a response to the interaction between the westward propagating ce and kuroshio therefore the assimilation of aviso observation data in the stcc region improved the forecast performance of kuroshio lc eddy shedding by successfully reproducing the westward movement of the ce 4 3 effect of uncertainties in the nec region on eddy shedding in addition to the uncertainties of the westward propagating ce in the stcc region the forecast of eddy shedding from the kuroshio lc was also partly influenced by the uncertainties in the nec region fig 9 displays the standardized time series of the roms simulated and aviso observed kuroshio surface meridional agc velocity anomaly averaged along the 16 5 n section as indicated by pink line in fig 2a the solid line is a linear fit of the daily velocity anomaly representing the kuroshio background current velocity prior to february 1 2017 the aviso observed kuroshio background current velocity black solid line in fig 9 was generally weaker than that of the simulated kuroshio background current velocity in ctl blue solid line in fig 9 this weakened kuroshio background current could enhance kuroshio intrusion into the scs and result in an anomalously strong kuroshio lc due to the teapot effect by assimilating the aviso ssha data in the nec region both the da nec and da nec stcc exhibited weaker kuroshio background currents in comparison to ctl prior to february 1 2017 which was consistent with the aviso observations the simulated anomalously weak kuroshio background current led to the strengthening of kuroshio intrusion after december 21 2016 brown line in fig 6a and enhancement of kuroshio lc after january 23 2017 brown line in fig 6b it is worth mentioning that during the period from september 2016 to january 2017 the kuroshio background current was observed to be at its weakest compared to the same timeframe from 2010 to 2020 fig 10 the low frequency variability of the kuroshio background current is primarily influenced by large scale wind forcing qiu and lukas 1996 the abnormally weak kuroshio background current prior to february 1 2017 created favorable conditions for the occurrence of intense kuroshio eddy shedding events in february 2017 consequently the assimilation in the nec region facilitated the separation of the eddy in da nec stcc from the kuroshio lc more readily than that in da stcc 4 4 effect of local uncertainties on eddy shedding the above studies clearly showed the effects of the uncertainties in the modeled nec and stcc regions on the forecasts of the strong kuroshio lc eddy shedding event in the winter of 2016 2017 however the separated ae from the kuroshio lc in da nec stcc did not exhibit a clearly defined westward propagating feature when compared to aviso data to address this limitation a 4 week forecast experiment assimilating the observations in the entire region denoted da all was conducted the lc in the initial field of da all matched well with the aviso observed lc fig 11a furthermore da all predicted a more distinct westward propagation of the ae in the scs after its shedding than da nec stcc it is important to note that the westward propagation of eddies along the slope is significantly influenced by local eddy self dissipation and the surrounding background current in the scs zu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 shu et al 2019 therefore the state of local circulation in the scs plays a key role in predicting westward propagation of the ae after its shedding when compared to the circulation in the wp moreover the predictability of oceanic processes was found to be closely linked to the persistence of assimilation information fu et al 2011 in da nec stcc forecasting accuracy could be compromised when assimilation information was transferred from the assimilated region into the ls through model integration this issue was further compounded by the complex interactions between eddies and the kuroshio current future studies could partially address this problem by using higher resolution models and observations 5 conclusion and discussion in the present study enkf with eddy resolved roms was applied to forecast the state of a strong kuroshio lc and its accompanying eddy shedding process during the winter of 2016 2017 the relationship between the kwi and ekman transport through ls revealed that this eddy shedding process was significantly governed by internal dynamics of the ocean by assimilating aviso ssha data on different sensitive regions we evaluated the effects of the uncertainties of different ocean internal processes within the wp on the forecast accuracy of this eddy shedding event one sensitive region covered the nec which corresponded to the kuroshio background current whereas the other sensitive region encompassed the stcc which corresponded to the westward propagating eddy the results showed that the occurrence of eddy shedding in the forecast was strongly connected to the enhancement of the kuroshio lc primarily due to the reduced uncertainties in the stcc region and partially due to the reduced uncertainties in the nec region specifically assimilation of ssha observations in the stcc region helped identify the observed westward propagating ce which collided with the kuroshio near the ls causing eddy shedding by enhancing the kuroshio inflow this phenomenon was supported by observational evidence from aviso data on the other hand although the assimilation of the aviso ssha observations in the nec region alone could not forecast the eddy shedding it did reproduce the observed low frequency weak anomaly of the kuroshio background current and promote the formation of a strong kuroshio background lc to some extent this suggested that when the kuroshio background lc was stronger the lc would shed more easily during a ce kuroshio collision in the ls therefore assimilation in the nec and stcc regions together presented a better forecast performance more accurately predicting the occurrence time of eddy shedding than did the assimilation in the stcc region only from the perspective of data assimilation we explained the synergistic effects of the two main controlling factors in the wp on the kuroshio lc eddy shedding process in the winter of 2016 2017 the stronger ce momentum in the stcc region relative to the kuroshio momentum is likely the primary factor contributing to the greater significance of assimilation in the stcc region compared to the nec region for forecasting kuroshio lc eddy shedding zheng et al 2019 however since the focus of our study is solely on predicting kuroshio lc eddy shedding for a typical case through sensitive forecast experiments it is important to quantify the contributions of various controlling factors to this process for additional cases in the future furthermore a more comprehensive analysis including examining the interactions between different controlling factors is also essential for gaining a deeper understanding of the kuroshio lc eddy
