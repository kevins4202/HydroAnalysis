4765,flash floods are a worldwide threat to humans which is why they are being intensively studied using historical event records as measurements and event data increase databases are becoming increasingly important for flash flood research however the recent literature on flood databases lacks technical details as well as discussions about a suitable database design for scientific investigations in this paper we thus show how an event database for the investigation of heavy rain induced flood occurrences can be created based on the hios dataset a german dataset with 23 800 flash flood and pluvial flood events we exemplify the database design and explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of floods caused by heavy rain in germany we outline all aspects relevant to database setup from database requirements and system architecture through table and attribute design to a key and relationship definition furthermore we clarify why a spatial database with interfaces for gis softwares should be chosen why a damage based event definition is preferable to a hydrometeorological definition and how table attributes support differentiated analyses by means of the database we investigated frequency temporal evolution spatial distribution and patterns fatalities and injuries as well as the seasonality of heavy rain induced floods in germany the results indicate that floods caused by heavy rain occur throughout germany but with a tendency toward fewer events in the northern direction across the country we identified seven hot spots in urbanized and mountainous regions although heavy rain induced floods in germany take place mostly between noon and late afternoon most people are injured and killed in events starting in the evening our investigation indicates an increased incidence of flash flood and pluvial flood related injuries and fatalities in the identified hot spots overall we observe a pronounced summer seasonality of the heavy rain induced flood events this study highlights the importance of event databases for flash flood research and advances our understanding of heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany keywords flash flood pluvial flood national analysis hot spots seasonality 1 introduction flash flood research requires a comprehensive documentation of past events with the help of measurements

2018 segura beltrán et al 2016 and damage modeling e g arrighi et al 2020 alipour et al 2020 due to the need for event data more and more researchers and institutions have begun to compile flash flood inventories during the last decade some thematic event databases and inventories already exist such as eswd dotzek et al 2009 shave ortega et al 2009 flash gourley et al 2017 and hydrate gaume et al 2009 however the existing flash flood datasets differ greatly regarding scope content and usability and not all of them are accessible kaiser et al 2020b although most existing flash flood inventories are organized in databases little or nothing is known about their underlying database designs as the current literature on flash flood datasets primarily focuses on dataset evaluation data management is scarcely addressed in addition database setup is probably considered known not relevant or not of interest furthermore the enormous effort required to generate an event dataset and build a database is seldom recognized llasat et al 2013 kaiser et al 2020b these reasons probably explain the knowledge gap regarding scientific flash flood database design databases are crucial for effectively collecting and analyzing flash flood events not only do databases facilitate data collection and management but they also support data investigation by linking event information and geodata databases enable spatiotemporal analyses and damage assessments since the database design affects data preparation and aggregation its design significantly influences the analysis however despite its influence the table and attribute design of event databases has hardly been discussed in the literature so far although germany has been affected by flash floods in the past the frequency temporal occurrence spatial distribution and seasonality of floods caused by heavy rain in germany have not yet been investigated so far only a few event specific studies have been conducted for germany e g for the braunsbach bronstert et al 2018 laudan et al 2017 lucía et al 2018 vogel et al 2017 or simbach flash flood events hübl 2018 mayr et al 2020 and the starzel river basin ruiz villanueva et al 2012 further studies have examined individual pluvial flood events in germany e g rözer et al 2016 spekkers et al 2017 in a joint project the german insurance association gdv and the german weather service dwd recently investigated the relationship between insured losses and small scale heavy rain events in germany gdv and dwd 2020 in this project context lengfeld et al 2019 evaluated radar data regarding the characteristic spatial extent of hourly and daily rain events in germany to answer these fundamental questions about the spatiotemporal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods in germany and thus provide background information for a better risk assessment we need a database for flood events caused by heavy rain in this paper we illustrate how to design a database for heavy rain induced floods that supports the systematic collection of event information and a wide range of spatiotemporal analyses to enhance the understanding of the flood hazards from extreme precipitation in germany by means of the hios database a german event database with 23 800 flood events caused by heavy rain abbreviation for hi nweiskarte o berflächenabfluss und s turzflut we explain the database structure and illustrate the database s use for flood hazard evaluation in germany first we specify the database purpose and requirements as well as the system architecture of the hios database section 2 then we outline the database design considerations section 3 and the methods applied section 4 subsequently we perform spatiotemporal analyses on heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany using the hios database section 5 finally we discuss our findings from database design and spatiotemporal investigations section 6 and give concluding remarks section 7 2 the hios database in may and june 2016 a series of extreme flash flood events occurred in southern and central germany causing a flood loss of 2 6billion munich re 2017 the german state of bavaria experienced a multitude of events which claimed seven lives lfu 2017c the loss of the worst affected administrative district in bavaria was estimated at 1 25billion lfu 2017c as a consequence of these flash flood events the bavarian state ministry of the environment and consumer protection funded the hios project hi nweiskarte o berflächenabfluss und s turzflut reference map for surface runoff and flash floods the main project objective is the creation of a reference map for bavaria which indicates possible hazards from pluvial floods and flash floods triggered by heavy rain for the investigation of the characteristics and triggering factors of heavy rain induced floods we compiled a dataset comprising about 23 800 german flash flood and pluvial flood events cf kaiser et al 2020b to enable spatiotemporal analyses that improve our understanding of the hazards from heavy precipitation in germany we designed a database that effectively manages event information and geodata it is planned to publish the hios dataset after the end of the project prior to the publication however publication rights of the individual datasets have to be checked as varying legal restrictions may apply 2 1 database purpose and required data we pursue two goals with the hios database the systematic collection and the scientific evaluation of past flood events triggered by heavy rain the database must therefore support the systematic documentation and organization of event data from sources as diverse as reports newspaper articles storm spotter networks and mission archives this requires a table and attribute design that enables unified storage of event information while maintaining the spatial temporal and content related accuracy of the event information furthermore the database is used to investigate frequency temporal evolution spatial distribution and patterns fatalities and injuries as well as the seasonality of heavy rain induced floods in germany to support spatial analysis the database must be able to aggregate datasets based on linking event information with geographical data such as political boundaries or catchments since we process geodata like digital elevation models the database s ability to handle large data volumes and return spatial queries quickly is a prerequisite the various spatiotemporal analyses require different event information and geodata sets information about the date of the event and the affected location is the prerequisite for the evaluation of historical events with regard to frequency spatial distribution hot spots and seasonality more detailed temporal analyses require additional information on the beginning and end of the triggering rain and the resulting flooding based on losses damage descriptions and the number of injuries and fatalities a damage analysis can be performed to classify events in a hydrometeorological context we need event information on the amount duration and intensity of the triggering precipitation and or discharge and water level measurements or estimates furthermore for spatial event aggregation in these analyses we require data on political boundaries convective cell extents or catchments 2 2 system architecture and interfaces the implemented system consists of a relational database management system that is accessible via various front end software fig 1 we made several demands on the chosen database management system dbms the dbms should i be able to store and process geographic data in vector and raster format ii should be supported by arcgis pro and qgis and iii should be free and open source due to these requirements we selected the relational dbms postgresql version 12 3 64 bit with its geospatial extension postgis version 2 5 the applied system architecture retains flexibility regarding data entry manipulation and retrieval as well as connection to other applications depending on the investigation objective the hios database can be accessed via different front end software for database development and administration for example we use the management tool pgadmin 4 for postgresql databases to carry out spatial analyses or create maps the gis software arcgis pro and qgis are suitable moreover the python scripting language offers a variety of options for database editing and analyses we access the hios database via the library psycopg 2 and perform spatial operations on geographic data using the library geopandas using the open source web application jupyter notebook we run analyses and create maps directly in the browser 3 design and implementation of the hios database our objective was to develop an effective and sustainable database system that supports systematic event collection and spatiotemporal hazard analyses by effective we mean a flexible database system that enables the targeted analyses a flexible database system can answer all possible questions and is easy to expand or adapt to new datasets to be effective the database system needs to return query results quickly and assist in performing event analyses by providing aggregated and systematic datasets in addition to effectiveness the sustainability of the database design is vital to ensure long term use the database structure must be easy for third parties to understand and expand in addition a comprehensible and detailed documentation of the database structure with its tables attributes and relationships is essential 3 1 event definition to obtain a consistent dataset we have to define which flood events are considered in the database the hios dataset includes flood events that have been caused by heavy precipitation i e flash flood and pluvial flood events a pluvial flood occurs when heavy precipitation triggers a flood event independent of an overflowing water body pluvial flooding is usually caused by infiltration excess and overwhelmed drainage systems flash floods are triggered by short but high intensity rainfall which causes a torrent of high velocity although flash floods and pluvial floods are both triggered by heavy precipitation they behave differently while flash flooding usually arises from a watercourse pluvial flooding is caused by water flowing towards watercourses since flash floods and pluvial floods can occur simultaneously and the available event information usually does not allow a distinct assignment we do not differentiate between flash floods and pluvial floods in our database therefore to address both flood types we speak of heavy rain induced floods in our database we apply the flash flood definition outlined by kaiser et al 2020b which is adapted to continental conditions since most of our event data containing precipitation information originates from the eswd we have adopted the eswd precipitation threshold to obtain an overall dataset that is as uniform as possible therefore according to our definition a flash flood event is triggered by a heavy rainfall event that lasts between 30 min and 24 h and exceeds a given minimum rain amount according to essl 2014 we define as the threshold for a heavy precipitation event 1 p 2 5 d where p is the precipitation amount in mm and d is the duration in min regarding spatiotemporal occurrence kaiser et al 2020b limit flash flood occurrence to catchments of up to 500 km2 in size and to the period between april and october in case the precipitation amount is unknown a short flooding rise time and or little to no warning time as well as a small catchment size are used as proxy indicators kaiser et al 2020b we apply the same thresholds for the identification of pluvial floods with the difference that if no precipitation measurement is available the heavy precipitation event must have caused flooding and an extreme impact to be documented according to essl 2014 extreme impacts are characterized by several firefighting operations cascade effects such as landslides flooded basements disruption of public transport or closed roads for the database the way a flash flood or pluvial flood event is uniquely stored also needs to be defined according to kaiser et al 2020b an event can be uniquely identified by the affected city and the occurrence date in this context the term city stands for any settlement size ranging from a village to a city that can still be uniquely identified since we consider it highly unlikely that two heavy rain induced flood events will occur on the same day at the same location we consider our definition valid according to this definition the relationship between the cities and events tables is a one to many relationship a flash flood or pluvial flood event occurs in one city and a city has experienced zero one or more flash flood pluvial flood events 3 2 database tables for comprehensive analyses the hios database combines information on flash flood and pluvial flood events with relevant geographic data geographic information relevant for flood investigations includes catchment information and measurements information on administrative structures geodata such as maps and digital elevation models in total the hios database consists of 34 tables four of which are pure geodata tables the database tables can be grouped into the following categories event description event documentation administration structure catchment information measurements claims geodata and metainformation table 1 the database tables are either reference or data tables reference tables contain general steady information related to an object the federal states table for example holds information on each federal state including name official code population and size data tables in contrast contain the collected measurements and event information that may change with each entry as an example each flood event is documented as a new event entry in the events table including occurrence date city name and official municipality code in the following we explain the database tables of each category in detail for reasons of clarity we write table names in italics and enclose attributes in quotation marks below the central component of the hios database is the collection of event information in the tables of the event description a flood event is described via entries in the events space time meteorology hydrology damage entries and sources tables in the events table we list all events by date and location in the space time table we describe the event s spatiotemporal extent and evaluate the temporal and spatial accuracy of the event information we document the event s meteorological conditions in the meteorology table not only is information on the heavy rain event recorded e g duration amount intensity start end but also the information on the accompanying phenomena of thunderstorms such as hail lightning and storms documenting the meteorological conditions helps to better assess the occurred damage and its cause in the hydrology table we specify the hydrological effects of the heavy rain event in addition to information on flooding and discharge e g highest affected floor water level discharge we document the occurrence of cascade effects such as flotsam landslides or dike breaches all losses and damages are recorded in the damage table we document financial losses and describe the occurred damages separated for buildings businesses infrastructure forestry and agriculture furthermore we record the number of injuries and fatalities documenting early warnings disaster alerts or evacuations helps to better assess the event magnitude and the occurred damage in addition we specify the accuracy of measurements and estimates in the comment attributes of the meteorology hydrology and damage tables the sources and entries tables store important metainformation we store information about the used sources regarding usage rights citations as well as a dataset description in the reference sources table metainformation about the event entry is recorded in the entries table in addition to the editor we store the source type the entry date and the last review date for each event entry furthermore we evaluate the quality of the event information in addition to event information we also archive information on the source documents in our database for event documentation the documents videos websites and photos tables are available in these tables we archive important metainformation about the source documents and the accompanying material of the event the tables not only indicate the usage rights citation author and quality of the source document but also describe the source file and the storage location videos and photos of flash flood and pluvial flood events are important because they provide much better insight into the event s course and severity than a purely textual event description for later analyses it is essential to document the original sources adequately we use the federal states government districts rural districts municipalities cities and zip codes tables to classify the events into the german administrative structure since germany is a federal republic it is divided into 16 federal states the four federal states of baden wuerttemberg bavaria hesse and north rhine westphalia are further subdivided into government districts which serve as mid level local government units the next subdivision level of the federal states or government districts is the rural district rural districts in turn are composed of municipalities which can include several villages towns and cities major cities in germany usually form their own rural district the table rural districts thus contains both rural districts which are composed of municipalities and major cities with district status for reasons of simplicity we call the table cities although it includes settlements of any size the administrative structure tables contain the official names abbreviations and identification numbers as well as the bounding shapefiles and population numbers the geographical dimension of cities towns villages is specified by official bounding boxes regarding geographic information we indicate the center and average altitude of each city zip codes and associated shapefiles are stored in the zip codes table in the water authorities table we reference information on the bavarian water authorities whose areas of responsibility are based on the government districts due to the federal system the water management administration is organized differently in the 16 federal states within the scope of the project we only had access to official detailed information about the bavarian water management administration the catchments watercourses lakes gauges and gauge catchments tables enable the hydrological classification of flood events in the lakes and watercourses table we store official information on the german lakes and watercourses along with their delimiting polygons and polylines the information available in the lakes table includes e g the number of inflows the maximum depth and the residence time for watercourses we hold information on e g the river order length and width in the database in the catchments table we describe the characteristics of the german catchments using parameters such as mean slope form factor and relief in addition the catchments table holds the official catchment polygons which were provided by the respective federal states in the gauge catchments table we store the catchments of the gauging stations in addition to the gauge location we store information such as catchment area gauge type gauge quality or gauge zero in the gauges table the category measurements include the discharge measurements discharge investigation and heavy rain hours tables since we could only obtain the discharge measurements for bavaria the discharge measurements and discharge investigation tables only contain information about the state of bavaria the heavy rain hours table on the other hand reflects all of germany for 486 bavarian gauges we save the discharge time series in hourly resolution for their entire measurement periods in the discharge measurements table the discharge investigation table contains the results of a discharge study the study by kaiser et al 2020a investigated the discharge time series of 342 gauging stations regarding flash floods the flash flood determination was based on the discharge characteristics defined by a specific peak discharge 0 3 m3s 1km2 a time to peak 20 h and a period of occurrence from april to october kaiser et al 2020a in the discharge investigation table we save each identified flash flood hydrograph of this study along with the identified event begin peak and end as well as the discharge values of begin peak and end furthermore we indicate the hydrograph describing parameters which are percent increase time to peak specific peak discharge gradient volume peak to volume return period and corresponding flood discharge in addition we store the results of a freely available dataset from the gdv and the dwd in the heavy rain hours table this dataset sums up all periods of heavy rain in germany based on the weather radar records from 2001 to 2016 the claims frequency table contains information on insurance claims due to heavy rain in germany for the years 2002 2017 the insurance claims are aggregated at the rural district level this dataset by the gdv and dwd specifies the number of heavy rain events the damages per building the average damage as well as the number of affected buildings per 1 000 buildings geodatasets for spatial analyses are in separate tables in the hios database the geodata group includes the elevation model natural region landcover and soil tables we store both vector and raster datasets since the table attributes are dataset specific they are not described further here information about the database design is stored in the table descriptions attribute descriptions and geodata descriptions tables these tables support the sustainability of the database as they contain important metainformation for understanding the database structure in table descriptions we indicate the content of each database table similarly the attribute descriptions table describes each table attribute regarding content unit and if applicable the underlying dataset and source accordingly the geodata descriptions table contains the official names and abbreviations as well as a brief description of the datasets 3 3 table attributes and attribute domains the table attributes significantly influence the later analysis options the choice of the non key attributes is essential since the descriptive attributes determine which questions can be answered when choosing the non key attributes it is of fundamental importance to anticipate potential questions and to know the information and datasets to be stored to answer future questions attributes must provide flexibility attributes that are too general entail the risk of losing information and restricting analyses whereas attributes that are too specific complicate analyses therefore ensuring flexibility often implies an increased complexity and number of attributes we chose the table attributes based on the used datasets and collected information as well as on potential questions table a 1 in the appendix lists the table attributes together with their data type constraints and keys however we do not list the attributes of the geodata tables in table a 1 as their attributes are dataset specific and therefore not of general interest we adopted nationwide reference systems such as state codes names and abbreviations information from various datasets was standardized and summarized in attributes due to german federalism each state provided differently organized hydrological information to obtain a german dataset we therefore had to summarize the information for the catchments watercourses and lakes tables the challenge of homogenization is to define attributes that summarize the information without overly generalizing it to facilitate the automated evaluation of stored information we defined attribute domains for most non key attributes this domain specification is particularly important for the attributes of the event description tables since this information forms the basis of the analyses free text is generally hard to evaluate as it is unstructured therefore kaiser et al 2020b suggest using fixed categories besides free text for attribute description they propose three types of attribute domains i yes no null ii given attribute values and iii text blocks the yes no and null attribute values document for example the occurrence or non occurrence of sedimentation landslides or dike failures kaiser et al 2020b further suggest attribute specific domains such as basement first floor second floor third floor for the highest affected floor attribute or oil sewage chemicals other to describe the type of contamination for damage description kaiser et al 2020b use text blocks consisting of an adjective and a noun where the adjective describes the extent of the damage and the noun specifies the affected object possible attribute values are for example destroyed houses flooded streets or eroded agricultural land the attribute domains proposed in kaiser et al 2020b were applied to the attributes of the space time hydrology meteorology and damage tables 3 4 table relationships and keys most entities in the hios database are connected by a one to many relationship a one to one relationship exists only between the claims frequency and rural districts heavy rain hours and zip codes gauges and gauge catchments entities due to high maintenance efforts we largely avoided the use of many to many associations however a few many to many relationships exist such as between the event documentation entities e g documents videos and the events entity fig 2 shows the entity relationship er diagram which represents the associations between the entities of the hios database thematically related entities are grouped and marked with the same color cf table 1 for reasons of clarity we only listed the key attributes of the entities regarding manageability and consistency we implemented only the necessary relationships between the database entities and not all the possible ones therefore for some queries detours via other entities have to be accepted when no direct association is implemented however entities holding geographic data can also be linked via spatial relationships for example the lakes and catchments entities can be connected using the postgis function st within the only entities without association are the metainformation entities since the table descriptions geodata descriptions and attribute descriptions entities serve as pure information tables to increase the usability of the hios database we employed simple intuitive and non composed primary keys wherever possible to this end we inherited natural keys that were already contained in the datasets such as the 12 digit municipality keys or the state names adopting natural keys has the advantage that the key also has a meaning outside the database and is therefore often easier for the user to remember and interpret we only introduced surrogate sequential primary keys when merging different datasets in one table as in the catchment information tables or when creating an own new dataset the table descriptions geodata descriptions and attribute descriptions entities are an exception to this rule since these entities have the entity and attribute names they describe as primary keys table a 1 and fig 2 indicate the primary and foreign keys of the database tables in eight tables we use composite primary keys consisting of two or four attributes for example the primary key of the cities entity is composed of the name and the 12 digit municipality no in the attribute descriptions table table and attribute together form the primary key since some attribute names occur in several tables the discharge measurements entity contains the discharge time series of the bavarian gauging stations to uniquely identify a measured discharge value we query the gauge no and the timestamp the discharge investigation table holds discharge parameters on identified flash flood events from kaiser et al 2020a by using the gauge no and number attributes we retrieve discharge information on a specific flash flood hydrograph the space time meteorology hydrology and damage tables use the same compound key the compound key consists of the four attributes event no source no info no and zip code we will clarify the use and advantages of this composite key in section 3 5 3 5 documentation of event information to guarantee sustainability it is important to ensure traceability comprehensibility and editability of the generated event dataset for this reason we document metainformation about the event information and sources and store source documents if available although this metainformation may seem unnecessary for the event investigation it contributes to an understandable and editable event dataset most importantly this metainformation allows users to get the most out of the dataset for their purposes the sources table contains information about the sources used their usage rights and citation and gives a dataset description to comply with formalities we document specifications on data sharing and publication in the usage rights attribute in addition we use the dataset description attribute to describe the dataset creation and the changes we have made to it by not allowing null entries in the sources table we force editors to think about the underlying publication rights and restrictions of the datasets used overall the sources table supports compliance with good scientific practice which in turn contributes to a responsible and sustainable dataset generation and use like the sources table we store metainformation about each event entry in the entries table where we specify the source type as literature report website newspaper article damage report photo video tv radio with the quality level attribute we assess the quality of the event information using the four categories qc0 qc0 qc1 qc2 as proposed by dotzek et al 2009 qc0 stands for event information that is adopted as received qc0 describes events that are plausibility checked qc1 stands for event confirmed and qc2 means event fully verified dotzek et al 2009 considering the source type and quality assessment we can better estimate the reliability of the event information furthermore we note the editor of each event entry together with the entry date and the last review date specifying the editor maintains the flexibility to alter event entries if for example an editor applied a different flood definition or made a systematic mistake in event documentation the indication of the last review date further allows retracing when the event information was last changed the documents videos websites and photos tables serve a purpose similar to the sources table in these tables metainformation about the original documents regarding author usage rights citation quality and storage location is stored we also note a description and comment about the source documents since event documentation for scientific investigations is a central task of the database we attached particular importance to the flexible design of the involved tables we use a primary key composed of four attributes for the space time hydrology meteorology and damage tables the compound key uses the event no source no info no and zip code attributes and allows for different aggregation levels of the event dataset the event no uniquely identifies each event in the events table to query all available information about one specific event regardless of the source we search for the event number using the event number we can aggregate all event information stored in the database on a specific event for each event entry we indicate the source using the source no attribute specifying the source enables to hide sensitive information such as insurance data or to exclude sources from analyses considered less reliable kaiser et al 2020b we further indicate the zip code of the affected city for large cities we can differentiate damages by zip code areas and thus maintain spatial accuracy for towns with only one zip code we specify the district in which flooding occurred in the districts attribute to avoid information loss we introduced the info no attribute which is a continuous integer we use the info no attribute to record several items of information on the same event this is for example the case when we document several starts of the triggering precipitation event with different precipitation amounts and durations to summarize only the composition of the event no source no info no and zip code attributes enables the unique identification of an event in the event information tables using parts of this composed key enables different aggregation levels of the event information providing the greatest possible query flexibility 3 6 data sources our database contains 23 752 flash flood and pluvial flood events that were triggered by heavy rainfall in germany we composed the event dataset from a variety of sources the event information originates from insurance companies mission archives scientific projects agencies and media our flood record starts in 346 and ends in 2017 however most events are available from 2000 onwards it should be mentioned that events in the federal states of thuringia baden wuerttemberg hesse and rhineland palatinate are potentially overrepresented since an insurance dataset with 16 900 events was obtained for these federal states kaiser et al 2020b kaiser et al 2020b present the hios event dataset in detail together with a description of the temporal and spatial resolution and the number of extracted events from the various sources used for spatial analyses we store various geodatasets covering germany in the database in addition to a digital elevation model we archive a topsoil map a land cover map and the natural regions of germany table 1 the environment ministries of the respective federal states provided official information on lakes watercourses gauges and catchments including point line and polygon shapefiles the database also contains the german administrative structure in addition to the official reference data the bounding polygons and centers of the various administrative levels are stored the hios database also contains measurements regarding discharge we store the discharge time series of 486 bavarian gauges in hourly resolution for the respective total measurement period from the study by kaiser et al 2020a we have the identified discharge time series of several thousand flash floods together with parameters describing the discharge event such as specific peak discharge time to peak or percent rise we further use two datasets published by the german weather service and the german insurance association one dataset indicates the sum of heavy rain hours in germany since 2001 per zip code area heavy rain considered in this study had to exceed 25 l m2 in 1 h or 35 l m2 in 6 h which corresponds to the warning level 3 of 4 of the german weather service the second dataset describes the damage frequency due to heavy rain in germany for the years 2002 2017 aggregated at the rural district level 4 methods 4 1 event rate to ensure the comparability of the number of events between cities we have normalized the number of events the number of inhabitants correlates moderately with the number of flash flood and pluvial flood events meaning that larger cities tend to experience more heavy rain induced floods cf section 5 3 to find out which cities are most frequently affected regardless of their size we used a normalized variable that eliminates the population bias in the number of events for reasons of comparability we introduced the dimensionless event rate which is defined as the quotient of the number of events and the logarithm of the population to the basis 10 2 event r a t e number o f e v e n t s log 10 p o p u l a t i o n the population distribution of germany has a strong right skewed distribution therefore to resolve skewness and obtain a small divisor we applied a log transformation to the population data the only disadvantage of the event rate compared to the number of events is the loss of intuitive comprehensibility 4 2 hot spot analysis we investigated the hot and cold spots of heavy rain induced floods in germany using the global moran s i and getis ord gi statistics both approaches are implemented in the spatial statistics toolbox of the gis software arcgis pro the spatial autocorrelation global moran s i tool measures spatial autocorrelation for a given set of weighted spatial features using the global moran s i statistic the moran s i index evaluates whether the data shows a dispersed random or clustered pattern a positive moran s index value implies a tendency toward clustering while a negative index value suggests dispersion the global moran s i index is defined as follows 2 i n s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x j 1 n x j x 2 where w i j is the spatial weight between feature i and j n is equal to the total feature number and s 0 is the aggregate of the spatial weights 3 s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j the z score is computed as 4 z i e i var i where e i and var i are given as 5 e i 1 n 1 6 v a r i e i 2 e i 2 the hot spot analysis getis ord gi tool applies the getis ord gi statistic to identify statistically significant hot and cold spots for a given set of weighted features getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 when calculating the gi statistic the local sum for a feature and its adjacent features are compared proportionally to the sum of all features in the study area such that 7 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where x j is the attribute value of feature j w i j is the spatial weight between feature i and j and n corresponds to the total number of features and 8 x j 1 n x j n 9 s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 for each feature the gi statistic is calculated and a z score and p value are returned a statistically significant z score is obtained when the local sum differs greatly from the expected local sum and the difference is too large to be the result of randomness a statistically significant hot spot is a feature with a high value that is surrounded by other features with high values a significant cold spot is in contrast described by a low negative z score and a small p value in geosciences the moran s i and getis ord gi statistics have been widely applied e g to assess heavy metal concentrations kim and choi 2017 to detect landslides lu et al 2019 or to improve forest management rossi and becker 2019 khajehei et al 2020 recently applied hot spot analysis to cluster gauging stations in the u s regarding the magnitude duration frequency and severity of measured flash floods 4 3 event binning to better explore the event dataset we used feature binning using arcgis pro feature binning is a method to aggregate and visually represent point data by grouping the event points into bins the dense information is summarized a bin represents all events within its boundaries and is displayed wherever there is at least one event in it we chose bins with a size of 100 km2 as a compromise between resolution and graphic representability using bins rather than political boundaries for event aggregation is preferable by using bins of equal size we avoid visually emphasizing areas as would be the case for example with unevenly sized rural districts 5 investigations on heavy rain induced floods in germany due to its good spatial and temporal coverage the hios dataset enables the holistic investigation of heavy rain induced floods in germany we used the database s functionalities to manipulate the collected data for our flood analyses using sql queries we generated the datasets required for our investigations from the hios dataset to illustrate how a database supports spatiotemporal investigations we provide the sql queries applied in the appendix these sql statements can serve as examples and inspiration for others who wish to conduct similar investigations 5 1 spatial distribution and frequency many fundamental questions regarding the spatial occurrence of floods caused by heavy rain in germany are still unanswered such as where did flash floods and pluvial floods occur in germany do they occur everywhere in germany which cities had the most events in the past we can now address these questions thanks to the availability of the hios dataset for our investigations we created a table view of the events table entitled events analysis containing only the events relevant to our analyses b 1 to ensure valid investigations we excluded possibly irrelevant events that did not occur between april and october which is considered the season of heavy rain induced floods for germany see section 5 5 overall the flood events investigated below comply with the event definition given in section 3 1 however we would like to point out that the flood events are not due to missing information differentiated according to their magnitude or flood type therefore minor and severe flood events as well as flash floods and pluvial floods are treated equally to avoid distortions of the investigation we further excluded the events from the insurance dataset since it only covers 4 of the 16 federal states without the insurance dataset we obtain a roughly representative dataset of heavy rain induced floods for germany with 8 718 events unless otherwise stated in the following sections we used the events analysis table view as a data basis to investigate the spatial distribution of heavy rain induced flood events in germany we created a dataset that summarizes the number of flood events for each affected city b 2 for this purpose we joined the events analysis table view on the cities table using the sql statement in appendix b 2 we also queried the city centers from the hios database for mapping fig 3 shows the number of documented flash flood and pluvial flood events per city in germany we find that floods caused by heavy rain occurred all over germany although not all regions were affected equally often in the past in total the hios dataset documents events for 4 875 cities of these cities 70 were affected once 17 twice 6 three times and 7 more than three times on the median the affected cities were hit once with the 95 quantile being 5 events and the 99 quantile 11 events regarding the distribution of the more frequently affected cities there appears to be a slight north south gradient with less heavy rain induced flood events in the northern german plain fig 4 this decrease of events from south to north seems plausible given the flat orography of the northern german plain many events particularly occurred in metropolitan areas such as the rhine ruhr area or the rhine main area with 11 and 6 million inhabitants respectively most events were reported for the metropolises of berlin 65 munich 59 and hamburg 54 fig 3 with regard to the event rate the top 10 are berlin 13 munich 12 hamburg 11 frankfurt 8 aachen 7 nuremberg 7 cologne 6 dresden 6 düsseldorf 6 dortmund 6 overall the top 10 most frequently affected cities are only those with more than 250 000 inhabitants both in terms of event numbers and normalized event rates however not all highly urbanized regions stand out with a particularly large number of events as can be seen from the metropolitan areas of northwest bremen oldenburg and surroundings 3million inhabitants and hanover brunswick göttingen 4 million inhabitants 5 2 temporal analysis fig 5 shows the annual frequency of floods caused by heavy rain as well as the number of people injured and killed by flash floods and pluvial floods in germany in the period 1990 2017 we summarized the number of events injuries and fatalities per year since 1990 using the sql statement from b 3 for these 28 years we collected 8 256 events in which 583 people were injured and 89 died statistically people were injured in 7 and killed in 1 of the flood events the most documented events so far occurred in the year 2011 1 065 events and 2016 1 025 events although most events were documented for 2011 this year did not cause the most deaths and injuries in the period considered the events of 2016 and 2006 caused 24 and 23 of the documented injured people respectively most deaths were reported for the years 1990 24 and 2016 17 however relative to the number of events 1990 was more extreme with seven events claiming 50 injuries and 24 deaths regarding the number of events the years 1990 1991 and 1996 had the highest death rates with 3 43 0 13 and 0 10 deaths per event the highest rates of injuries were documented for the years 1990 7 14 1994 0 20 and 2006 0 25 to better understand the temporal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods we analyzed the documented floods regarding their onset using the extract function of postgresql we grouped the events by the hour of occurrence and counted the number of events fatalities and injuries b 4 the start time of 8 150 events is known this refers to the flooding onset and not to the beginning of the triggering precipitation the first inundations outside creeks and river banks mark the beginning of the flood event it should be noted however that in most cases the flooding onset cannot be reliably measured or determined therefore the start time is usually an estimate with high uncertainties fig 6 shows the frequency of the flood onset for each hour of the day using one hour bins the local times given hereinafter refer to central european summer time which is valid in germany from march to october and corresponds to utc 2 most of the documented heavy rain induced flood events occurred at 15 00 local time almost half of all events began between 14 00 and 18 00 local time during the night and in the early morning floods triggered by heavy rain rarely occurred investigating the onset of the events in which people were injured or killed provided us with insights into the influence of flood timing on human losses fig 6 indicates that most people were killed in floods starting around 12 00 93 deaths and 21 00 local time 67 deaths whereas people were mostly injured between 18 00 and 19 00 local time 20 and 22 injuries overall the frequency of injuries and fatalities increases roughly with the frequency of the events 5 3 influence of population fig 3 raises the question to what extent population influences heavy rain induced flood occurrences since flash floods and pluvial floods often cannot be recorded automatically e g at gauging stations their flood reporting generally relies on human observation marjerison et al 2016 therefore one may hypothesize that the number of reported heavy rain induced flood events is higher for larger cities where more people can report them in addition population may influence heavy rain induced flood occurrence as the proportion of impervious area generally increases with population which is known to facilitate surface runoff thus we are interested to know whether the event frequency correlates with the population and whether regions with a high proportion of built up area report more events to answer these questions we investigated the relationship between event frequency and population as well as event frequency and sealing percentage due to the resolution of the population data we aggregated the events at the rural district level for this analysis we used the information on population density rural district area and sealing percentage contained in the rural districts table we joined the events analysis table view on the rural districts table and grouped the events by the 401 german rural districts from this intermediate table we queried the necessary district information including the shapefiles b 5 fig 7 shows the population density of the rural districts superimposed over the associated number of events we observe tendencies that higher population densities are associated with more reported events especially in the densely populated metropolitan regions of rhine ruhr rhine main stuttgart and munich we notice a high number of flood events caused by heavy rain however contrary trends are also evident when looking at the area of the ore mountains the alpine foothills and the northeastern german plain in these regions we have comparatively high event frequencies but rather low population densities to assess the correlation we plotted the number of flood events against the number of inhabitants fig 8 for better representation we transformed the number of inhabitants with the logarithm of the basis 10 according to the pearson correlation coefficient a moderate positive correlation r 0 62 p 3 33e 44 exists between the number of heavy rain induced flood events and the number of inhabitants which is also apparent in fig 7 therefore a population increase often leads to a higher frequency of flash flood and pluvial flood events contrary to expectations our event dataset indicates no correlation between the number of heavy rain induced flood events and the degree of sealing r 0 07 p 9 07e 11 however the number of heavy rain induced flood events correlates weakly with the district area r 0 32 p 1 63e 01 we would expect a strong correlation between the district area and the number of floods if heavy rain induced flood occurrence were a random process meaning that the number of flood events would increase as the district area increases as well however the districts seem to be spatially too homogeneous and furthermore do not take hydrological relationships into account given a weak correlation with the district area we can assume that the aggregation level of the events does not distort the correlation between heavy rain induced flood events and population 5 4 hot spots and cold spots to better cope with the flood hazards from heavy rain we need to identify particularly endangered regions the first step is thus to analyze the spatial pattern of heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany regarding prevention it is essential to discover the regions that experience particularly numerous or few flood events and to localize these hot and cold spots since we are interested in finding significant hot and cold spots independently of city size we use the event rate instead of the number of events we calculated the event rate for each city in germany using the sql statement in b 6 of the appendix by joining the cities table on the events analysis view we linked the information on the number of events and the city population required for this analysis if a city has not yet been affected we set the event rate to 0 taking advantage of the sql case expression we computed the event rate for all german cities b 6 to reduce the bias in our event dataset towards positive cases we considered all german cities regardless of whether an event was documented for the city as the hios dataset lacks confirmed not yet affected cities we assumed in a simplified approach that the non listed cities have not been so far affected by a flash flood or pluvial flood event as the flood events are linked to the city they affected we need to analyze whether the spatial distribution of the cities influences that of the flood events if the spatial pattern of the cities affects the heavy rain induced flood distribution the hot spot analysis will reveal the pattern of the cities not of the events therefore we investigated the spatial pattern of the german cities using the average nearest neighbor tool the tool calculates the nearest neighbor index that is given as the ratio of the observed mean distance of each city to its nearest neighboring city to the expected mean distance in case of random distribution of the cities the nearest neighbor index of the german cities is 1 2 which indicates that the observed average distance between the cities is greater than a hypothetical random distribution table 2 german cities thus show a dispersed pattern calculating the nearest neighbor ratio only for the affected cities yields 1 0 indicating that affected cities are randomly distributed over germany table 2 as german cities show a dispersed pattern but affected cities are randomly distributed we can conclude that the location of the cities does not distort the spatial distribution of the flash flood and pluvial flood events using the global moran s i statistic we further investigated the spatial patterns of the german cities regarding population number of events and event rate we found that population number of events and event rates show a statistically significant clustered pattern over germany table 3 fig 9 shows the identified hot and cold spots of heavy rain induced floods for germany in sum we localized seven hot spots and two cold spots some hot spots are found in more urbanized regions such as around berlin in the rhine ruhr metropolitan region and in the conurbations of rhine main rhine neckar and stuttgart however other hot spots are located in the less populated but hilly terrain of the bavarian alpine foothills in the ore mountains and in the region between the thuringian forest and the harz mountains two statistically significant cold spots are found in the northwestern german plain except hamburg and in north central bavaria north of the danube we further note that not all metropolitan areas are hot spots hamburg and hanover brunswick göttingen for example do not have statistically significant event rates and the metropolitan regions northwest and nuremberg lie in a cold spot it is further of interest whether injuries and fatalities occur more frequently in hot rather than in cold spots therefore we superimposed the hot and cold spots over the number of injuries and fatalities fig 10 using the sql statement of b 7 we summarized the number of injured and killed people per city during the period 1900 2017 flash and pluvial floods killed 499 and injured 583 people in general we find that few injurious and fatal events have occurred in the northern german plain compared to the rest of germany central bavaria where a cold spot has been identified also appears to be less affected in particular many deadly events happened in the ore mountains hot spot mostly due to two major events in 1927 and 2010 that affected several cities the injuries within the ore mountains hot spot in contrast are due to recent flood events caused by heavy rain in 2003 2006 and 2012 also in the rhine ruhr and rhine main to stuttgart hot spots many people have been injured and killed by heavy rain induced floods in the past the four cities with the most reported injuries were all caused by one flood event that was caused by heavy rain neuhausen ob eck bw 82 injuries on 24 06 2016 balingen bw 41 injuries on 24 06 2005 wenden nw 37 injuries on 09 06 2007 and kaiserslautern rp 35 injuries on 27 05 2016 5 5 seasonality we are further interested to know when floods triggered by heavy rain mostly occur in germany is there a season for heavy rain induced floods which months have the most flood events caused by heavy rain and does the seasonality differ for different regions in germany to investigate the seasonality we summarized the seasonal heavy rain induced flood occurrence for the individual federal states b 8 and for the whole of germany b 9 germany has a pronounced summer season with regard to floods caused by heavy rain fig 11 most documented flash flood and pluvial flood events occurred in the summer months of june july and august followed by events in spring march to may in contrast flood events triggered by heavy rain rarely occurred in autumn september to november or winter december to february with 68 5 of the documented events summer is the predominant flood season in germany overall 90 of the documented events took place in summer or spring which indicates that autumn 6 9 and winter events 3 1 play a negligible role in germany although summer is the predominant season of flash and pluvial floods throughout germany the proportion of events in the individual seasons varies considerably between the federal states fig 11 we note that the proportion of spring events in the eastern central german states are well above the average of 20 with 30 in saxony sn 35 in saxony anhalt st and 38 in thuringia th while the share of spring events is larger in southern and central states spring events occur less frequently in northern germany mecklenburg western pomerania mv and berlin be had particularly few events in spring 7 and 10 respectively regarding summer events there is a slight trend towards more summer events in a northerly direction on average almost 7 of the documented german events occurred in autumn with a tendency towards slightly more autumn events in central germany heavy rain induced floods in winter are rare in germany in most federal states winter events do not account for a significant share exceptions to this are the state of saarland 26 sl and the northern city states of hamburg 15 hh and bremen 12 hb whose sample sizes however are too small to ensure statistical significance furthermore we investigated the regional seasonal patterns of heavy rain induced floods in germany fig 12 to study the monthly patterns throughout germany we first counted the number of heavy rain induced flood events per month for each city using the sql statement in b 10 we then grouped the events into bins and determined for each bin the month with the most events for the investigation of the monthly patterns we focused on the events that occurred during the main season from april to october fig 12 shows the regional seasonality patterns in germany by displaying the month with the most documented flash flood and pluvial flood events overall july and june are the months most often affected the main season runs from late spring to early autumn with april and october marking the beginning and end of the heavy rain induced flood season throughout germany the summer events in june and july dominate however may events are particularly frequent in eastern germany ore mountains thuringian forest harz and the rhine neckar metropolitan region the state of bavaria by has also experienced some spring events in the past autumn events rarely dominate but occurred in central germany along a single strip and sporadically in southwest germany in the state of north rhine westphalia nw we find an accumulation of events in late summer overall we observe slight differences in the regional patterns of flood seasonality in germany 6 discussion 6 1 insights from event database setup most articles about flood and flash flood databases omit the technical details of the underlying database therefore information on the database management software used the event definition or the database design itself is rare the lack of technical details hampers the comparison of the hios database with other event databases but underlines the importance of the article to fully profit from setting up a database for floods caused by heavy rain a spatial database should be chosen using a spatial database such as postgresql enables merging and maintaining all required information in one place geographical data event data and metadata nevertheless it is also possible to separate event information and geodata barnolas and llasat 2007 and papagiannaki et al 2013 for example used ms access for their event databases and stored the geoinformation in a gis software however a gis software is no longer necessary when using a spatial database we used postgis functions for example to derive the mean slope and elevation of the catchments using the stored catchment shapefiles and the dem therefore separating event and geographic data unnecessarily complicates analyses as spatial databases can hold spatial and non spatial data and provide spatial functions furthermore it is important to choose a spatial database that provides interfaces to several front end solutions effective flood investigations require interfaces to common gis software e g arcgis pro qgis programming languages e g python r and database management software with this variety of front end software researchers can select the system best suited for a given task in some cases for example spatial queries in postgresql were faster than calculations in arcgis pro furthermore we generated datasets that required programming within jupyter notebook and the python libraries psycopg 2 and geopandas these datasets could not have been created within the database environment since databases are not created to support complex programming tasks in addition python offers a variety of easy to use libraries and functions for scientists that facilitate data analysis however dataset processing outside the database requires knowledge of another programming language and maintenance of an additional system to uniquely define a flood event a space and time reference is required while the occurrence date is clear as a temporal reference the spatial reference of a flood event is controversial for the hios database we chose a damage based definition which uses the affected city as the spatial reference and the time of occurrence in the city as the event date however other researchers use meteorological or hydrological event definitions in their flood databases barnolas and llasat 2007 for example group flood events under the same event id if they were triggered by the same meteorological event thus the size of the rain cell defines the spatial event extent consequently the initial and final date of the triggering rainfall marks the beginning and end of the event barnolas and llasat 2007 adhikari et al 2010 in contrast apply a hydrological event definition to their global flood inventory therefore affected cities in the same catchment obtain the same event id and the event start corresponds to the start date of the flood event hydrometeorological event definitions are impractical since documenting flash flood and pluvial flood events in a hydrometeorological context requires prior analyses of convective cells and catchments it is also not possible to add new flood events without first finding out whether the event already exists in the database and what the event id is however when applying a damage based definition we can still aggregate the events hydrometeorologically by using the stored catchment shapefiles or radar images and the event date we can group flood events according to the meteorological or hydrological context the design of the database tables influences the later event analyses to avoid restricting subsequent analyses the database design should maintain the spatial accuracy of the event information as soon as the event information is entered into the database in aggregated form e g summarized for the municipality or rural district distinct damage analyses for individual cities or catchments become impossible we therefore advocate documenting event information at the city level with the possibility to further differentiate the affected districts by specifying the postcodes for major cities or the affected urban areas for cities in addition inundated areas or affected houses can be specified by polygons and points e g gourley et al 2010 diakakis 2014 however preserving the spatial accuracy of event information requires a more complex database design as well as more effort for data preparation a complex event database like the hios database may not be required for every study it is therefore advisable to weigh the effort for database creation against the study objectives setting up an event database for a few simple analyses is probably not worthwhile however an event database offers further advantages that should be considered besides data management for example the database could be integrated into a website where researchers or interested parties can view and or download event data e g eswd storm events database furthermore people could report events via an online form which are entered directly into the event database to maintain quality standards public reports would have to be reviewed and verified by trained personnel or experts in this way the eswd for example enlarges its event dataset dotzek et al 2009 in the future methods of machine learning can help increase flood datasets one possibility to do so is for example automatically extracting flood event information from online newspaper articles cf yzaguirre et al 2015 zarei and nik bakht 2019 and subsequently updating the event database however a final quality control of the extracted event information by an expert would remain necessary 6 2 findings from spatiotemporal investigations our investigations show that heavy rain induced flood occurrences are randomly distributed over germany which the recent findings of the german weather service lengfeld et al 2019 on short term heavy precipitation also show the analysis of radar data from 16 years 2001 2016 revealed that short heavy precipitation events occur with a similar frequency and intensity throughout germany lengfeld et al 2019 lengfeld et al 2019 have proven that hourly precipitation is equally likely in both flat and mountainous areas as short precipitation events appear to be hardly controlled by orography consequently every german region can be affected by pluvial floods and flash floods triggered by heavy rain we cannot make statements about trends regarding the number of heavy rain induced flood events in germany this is because we estimate the time series to be too short for a reliable trend analysis as the hios dataset can only be considered comprehensive from 2000 onwards kaiser et al 2020b nonetheless the 10 year moving average of documented heavy rain induced flood events per year has increased from 42 in 2000 to 555 in 2017 this increase in flood events may be attributed to increased press coverage of natural hazards llasat et al 2009 as well as to the advent of the internet wirtz et al 2014 which facilitated the search for events and thus made more event information available furthermore climate change could lead to an increase in heavy rain induced floods as a significant increase in heavy precipitation events is projected for europe kovats et al 2014 concerning the development of deaths and injuries related to floods caused by heavy rain our time series suggests neither a decrease nor an increase floods triggered by heavy rain in germany seem to occur more likely between noon and late afternoon with a peak at 15 00 local time for western u s ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 found a similar diurnal distribution with more flash flood events starting between 15 00 and 20 00 local time with regard to the atmospheric processes this diurnal distribution of heavy rain induced flood events appears plausible since convective precipitation in summer is often associated with thunderstorms thunderstorms usually form in the late afternoon or early evening when warm humid air near the ground has heated up due to strong solar radiation and is forced to rise into colder layers of air the most injurious and deadly flood events caused by heavy rain in germany started around noon and late in the evening previous studies by špitalar et al 2014 and terti et al 2017 have proven an accumulation of injurious and fatal events in the evening špitalar et al 2014 examined 21 546 flash flood events in the u s from 2006 to 2012 and discovered that flash floods claimed most injuries and fatalities when they occurred in the late evening špitalar et al 2014 observed that the most fatal events occurred at 21 00 local time terti et al 2017 investigated 1 075 flash flood deaths in the u s from 1996 to 2014 and showed that 63 of the deaths were related to vehicles their analysis revealed a peak in vehicle related fatalities between 19 00 and 21 00 local time terti et al 2017 assumed that people are often unwilling to leave their cars e g when commuting to from work even when the streets are flooded this assumption is supported by the fact that many of the victims in the study died trying to drive through the floodwaters terti et al 2017 špitalar et al 2014 hypothesized that poor visibility in the twilight hours leads to more motorists driving into flooded roadways by accident the unwillingness to leave the car and poor visibility seem to be plausible reasons for the high number of victims in the evening hours also for germany however it is unclear why there were also many victims in the midday hours in germany this could possibly have to do with the fact that at lunchtime many people are outdoors e g end of shift lunch break end of school and are thus outside of protective buildings however this remains speculation as the circumstances of death are not recorded in our database in addition the beginning of the event and the time of death are not necessarily the same and can therefore be far apart our investigation indicates a moderate correlation between the number of inhabitants and the number of flash floods and pluvial floods this correlation is probably the reason why several studies use the population as one of several predictors to explain the spatial distribution of flash floods marjerison et al 2016 liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 further studies have investigated the correlation between population density and flash flood impacts calianno et al 2013 or have predicted flash flood human impacts using population density as one of the explanatory variables terti et al 2019 although we showed a relationship between heavy rain induced flood events and population we cannot say what constitutes this relationship at the rural district level we could not find a correlation between the number of heavy rain induced floods and the sealing degree in the study by marjerison et al 2016 however the share of the impervious area was positively correlated with the number of flash flood reports in binghamton new york still marjerison et al 2016 conclude that the relationship between population and soil sealing is not straightforward and that the sealing degree thus only partially explains the correlation with the population as the relationship between flash floods and human activities is complex liu et al 2018 further detailed analyses are needed to understand its nature although short heavy precipitation events occur with a similar frequency and intensity in germany lengfeld et al 2019 we detected that some regions are more frequently affected than others therefore the occurrence of hot and cold spots of heavy rain induced floods evidences that catchments are susceptible to flash and pluvial flooding in different ways if the catchment characteristics had no influence on the occurrence and magnitude of a flash flood the regions would be affected about equally often this seems plausible since other studies have been able to predict the occurrence of flash floods using catchment properties e g bui et al 2019 costache 2019 marjerison et al 2016 ma et al 2019 janizadeh et al 2019 we identified a relatively good spatial correspondence between identified hot spots and human impacting events still injurious and fatal events also occurred in cold spots or statistically non significant areas in this regard we must keep in mind that every injury and death is the result of unique circumstances and thus cannot be directly attributed to the location yet in regions with frequent heavy rain induced flood occurrences the probability of people being injured or killed increases when investigating more than 20 000 flash flood events in the u s špitalar et al 2014 found that fatalities and especially injuries were more frequent in rural than urban areas however when human impacting events occurred in urban regions they caused more injuries and fatalities per event than in rural areas špitalar et al 2014 to confirm these observations for germany more detailed analyses would have to be carried out our study showed that there is a summer seasonality of floods caused by heavy rain for germany confirmed by the seasonality patterns evidenced in previous studies gaume et al 2009 kaiser et al 2020a various studies confirm that the flash flood seasonality of mediterranean and inland continental countries in europe differ from each other while the main flash flood season is autumn for mediterranean countries gaume et al 2009 llasat et al 2014 tarolli et al 2012 papagiannaki et al 2015 inland continental countries experience most flash flood events in the summer gaume et al 2009 kaiser et al 2020a england also has a pronounced summer seasonality archer et al 2019 and is thus comparable with the seasonality of central european countries such as germany austria slovakia and romania when interpreting the results of our investigations we have to consider potential inherent biases in the hios dataset one shortcoming of our event database might be a temporal bias which leads to an increase in natural hazard events over time gall et al 2009 according to gall et al 2009 this temporal upward trend can be attributed to the increase in population and prosperity especially in high risk areas as well as progress in hazard monitoring and reporting kron et al 2012 assume however that the temporal bias of hazard reporting for western europe has not been too pronounced over the past 30 to 40 years in addition flood events that happened in densely populated areas might be overrepresented in the hios dataset geography bias gall et al 2009 finally we must also bear in mind that in our analyses pluvial floods and flash floods as well as different event magnitudes are considered together this is largely because the event type or magnitude of most documented events apart from well documented catastrophic events cannot be reliably determined by the given event information 7 conclusion this paper illustrates how to design an effective event database suitable for flash flood research using the hios database we exemplified the considerations and assumptions required to set up a relational database for investigations on heavy rain induced floods in germany after defining the database s purpose and requirements we described the system architecture with its front end solutions we further explained in detail the table design attributes and relationships of the hios database we investigated the spatiotemporal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods in germany by creating necessary datasets using the database by providing details on the database design we provided a starting point for those who wish to set up a similar event database for scientific investigations we need a flexible database structure supporting all targeted analyses reviewing our experiences we can make the following recommendations for designing an effective flash flood event database 1 choose a database management system that offers interfaces to a gis software e g arcgis pro qgis a programming language e g python r and a database management tool e g pgadmin a system architecture with multiple front end solutions offers the flexibility to use the software best suited for the investigation 2 use a spatial database system to bundle all required information and data in one place event information geodata e g dem soil land use measurements e g discharge precipitation reference data e g administration structure hydrological information e g catchments rivers metainformation e g sources quality estimation 3 implement an event definition that allows the documentation of flood events without the need for prior hydrometeorological analyses avoid storing events aggregated by catchment or triggering precipitation event 4 design database attributes in such a way that they enable differentiated event documentation implement attributes to allow for differentiation of flash flood impacts within cities e g by specification of zip codes and city districts furthermore we investigated the documented flash flood and pluvial flood events using the hios database we examined the occurrence of heavy rain induced floods in germany regarding spatial distribution and patterns temporal evolution and seasonality the main findings from the study are summarized as follows floods caused by heavy rain occur throughout germany both in flat and in mountainous terrain however there is a slight tendency toward the northern german plain experiencing less flash flood and pluvial flood events heavy rain induced flood events occurred most frequently at 15 00 local time overall the occurrence of heavy rain induced floods is more likely between noon and late afternoon 14 00 18 00 local time than at night or in the early morning most people died in heavy rain induced floods that started around noon or 21 00 local time injuries were most common during floods with onsets between 18 00 and 19 00 local time commute and bad visibility during twilight are suspected to increase the injury and death rates in the late evening there is a moderate positive correlation r 0 62 between the number of heavy rain induced flood events and the number of inhabitants in our study the share of impervious area did not explain the correlation between heavy rain induced flood events and population therefore further analyses investigating the complex relationship between heavy rain induced floods and human activity should consider other factors such as the number of culverts the degree of river obstruction land use and topographic features the flash flood frequency shows a clustered pattern over germany we identified seven hot spots four attributed to mostly metropolitan areas and three to the less populated mountainous regions the northwestern german plain and north central bavaria are cold spots with particularly few flash flood and pluvial flood events there is an increased incidence of injuries and fatalities in identified hot spots injurious and fatal flash flood and pluvial flood events were less frequent in the northern german plain and central bavaria where cold spots were identified flash floods and pluvial floods occur in germany mainly between april and october with summer being the predominant season autumn and winter events hardly occur there is a tendency towards more summer events in northeastern germany while central germany has a more pronounced spring season we benefit from our findings with regard to flood risk management and public relations now that flood hot spots have been identified we can prioritize detailed investigations and adapt local flood risk management knowledge of the diurnal and seasonal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods and high risk areas is valuable information to improve risk assessment and decision making in addition the knowledge gained about heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany helps to describe the characteristics of the natural hazard to the public this paper demonstrates that event databases are essential scientific tools that help to advance our understanding of flood hazards from heavy precipitation by ensuring the usability and quality of event data databases are valuable instruments for various applications in flash flood research such as damage modeling risk assessment socio economic analyses or climate change studies due to climate change and the associated need to better understand flash flood hazards the importance of event databases will continue to increase to enable concrete prevention measures derived with the help of the event database we have to carry out site specific analyses of factors promoting and triggering flash floods and pluvial floods these analyses must link catchment characteristics topography soil properties and land use with the

4765,flash floods are a worldwide threat to humans which is why they are being intensively studied using historical event records as measurements and event data increase databases are becoming increasingly important for flash flood research however the recent literature on flood databases lacks technical details as well as discussions about a suitable database design for scientific investigations in this paper we thus show how an event database for the investigation of heavy rain induced flood occurrences can be created based on the hios dataset a german dataset with 23 800 flash flood and pluvial flood events we exemplify the database design and explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of floods caused by heavy rain in germany we outline all aspects relevant to database setup from database requirements and system architecture through table and attribute design to a key and relationship definition furthermore we clarify why a spatial database with interfaces for gis softwares should be chosen why a damage based event definition is preferable to a hydrometeorological definition and how table attributes support differentiated analyses by means of the database we investigated frequency temporal evolution spatial distribution and patterns fatalities and injuries as well as the seasonality of heavy rain induced floods in germany the results indicate that floods caused by heavy rain occur throughout germany but with a tendency toward fewer events in the northern direction across the country we identified seven hot spots in urbanized and mountainous regions although heavy rain induced floods in germany take place mostly between noon and late afternoon most people are injured and killed in events starting in the evening our investigation indicates an increased incidence of flash flood and pluvial flood related injuries and fatalities in the identified hot spots overall we observe a pronounced summer seasonality of the heavy rain induced flood events this study highlights the importance of event databases for flash flood research and advances our understanding of heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany

2018 segura beltrán et al 2016 and damage modeling e g arrighi et al 2020 alipour et al 2020 due to the need for event data more and more researchers and institutions have begun to compile flash flood inventories during the last decade some thematic event databases and inventories already exist such as eswd dotzek et al 2009 shave ortega et al 2009 flash gourley et al 2017 and hydrate gaume et al 2009 however the existing flash flood datasets differ greatly regarding scope content and usability and not all of them are accessible kaiser et al 2020b although most existing flash flood inventories are organized in databases little or nothing is known about their underlying database designs as the current literature on flash flood datasets primarily focuses on dataset evaluation data management is scarcely addressed in addition database setup is probably considered known not relevant or not of interest furthermore the enormous effort required to generate an event dataset and build a database is seldom recognized llasat et al 2013 kaiser et al 2020b these reasons probably explain the knowledge gap regarding scientific flash flood database design databases are crucial for effectively collecting and analyzing flash flood events not only do databases facilitate data collection and management but they also support data investigation by linking event information and geodata databases enable spatiotemporal analyses and damage assessments since the database design affects data preparation and aggregation its design significantly influences the analysis however despite its influence the table and attribute design of event databases has hardly been discussed in the literature so far although germany has been affected by flash floods in the past the frequency temporal occurrence spatial distribution and seasonality of floods caused by heavy rain in germany have not yet been investigated so far only a few event specific studies have been conducted for germany e g for the braunsbach bronstert et al 2018 laudan et al 2017 lucía et al 2018 vogel et al 2017 or simbach flash flood events hübl 2018 mayr et al 2020 and the starzel river basin ruiz villanueva et al 2012 further studies have examined individual pluvial flood events in germany e g rözer et al 2016 spekkers et al 2017 in a joint project the german insurance association gdv and the german weather service dwd recently investigated the relationship between insured losses and small scale heavy rain events in germany gdv and dwd 2020 in this project context lengfeld et al 2019 evaluated radar data regarding the characteristic spatial extent of hourly and daily rain events in germany to answer these fundamental questions about the spatiotemporal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods in germany and thus provide background information for a better risk assessment we need a database for flood events caused by heavy rain in this paper we illustrate how to design a database for heavy rain induced floods that supports the systematic collection of event information and a wide range of spatiotemporal analyses to enhance the understanding of the flood hazards from extreme precipitation in germany by means of the hios database a german event database with 23 800 flood events caused by heavy rain abbreviation for hi nweiskarte o berflächenabfluss und s turzflut we explain the database structure and illustrate the database s use for flood hazard evaluation in germany first we specify the database purpose and requirements as well as the system architecture of the hios database section 2 then we outline the database design considerations section 3 and the methods applied section 4 subsequently we perform spatiotemporal analyses on heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany using the hios database section 5 finally we discuss our findings from database design and spatiotemporal investigations section 6 and give concluding remarks section 7 2 the hios database in may and june 2016 a series of extreme flash flood events occurred in southern and central germany causing a flood loss of 2 6billion munich re 2017 the german state of bavaria experienced a multitude of events which claimed seven lives lfu 2017c the loss of the worst affected administrative district in bavaria was estimated at 1 25billion lfu 2017c as a consequence of these flash flood events the bavarian state ministry of the environment and consumer protection funded the hios project hi nweiskarte o berflächenabfluss und s turzflut reference map for surface runoff and flash floods the main project objective is the creation of a reference map for bavaria which indicates possible hazards from pluvial floods and flash floods triggered by heavy rain for the investigation of the characteristics and triggering factors of heavy rain induced floods we compiled a dataset comprising about 23 800 german flash flood and pluvial flood events cf kaiser et al 2020b to enable spatiotemporal analyses that improve our understanding of the hazards from heavy precipitation in germany we designed a database that effectively manages event information and geodata it is planned to publish the hios dataset after the end of the project prior to the publication however publication rights of the individual datasets have to be checked as varying legal restrictions may apply 2 1 database purpose and required data we pursue two goals with the hios database the systematic collection and the scientific evaluation of past flood events triggered by heavy rain the database must therefore support the systematic documentation and organization of event data from sources as diverse as reports newspaper articles storm spotter networks and mission archives this requires a table and attribute design that enables unified storage of event information while maintaining the spatial temporal and content related accuracy of the event information furthermore the database is used to investigate frequency temporal evolution spatial distribution and patterns fatalities and injuries as well as the seasonality of heavy rain induced floods in germany to support spatial analysis the database must be able to aggregate datasets based on linking event information with geographical data such as political boundaries or catchments since we process geodata like digital elevation models the database s ability to handle large data volumes and return spatial queries quickly is a prerequisite the various spatiotemporal analyses require different event information and geodata sets information about the date of the event and the affected location is the prerequisite for the evaluation of historical events with regard to frequency spatial distribution hot spots and seasonality more detailed temporal analyses require additional information on the beginning and end of the triggering rain and the resulting flooding based on losses damage descriptions and the number of injuries and fatalities a damage analysis can be performed to classify events in a hydrometeorological context we need event information on the amount duration and intensity of the triggering precipitation and or discharge and water level measurements or estimates furthermore for spatial event aggregation in these analyses we require data on political boundaries convective cell extents or catchments 2 2 system architecture and interfaces the implemented system consists of a relational database management system that is accessible via various front end software fig 1 we made several demands on the chosen database management system dbms the dbms should i be able to store and process geographic data in vector and raster format ii should be supported by arcgis pro and qgis and iii should be free and open source due to these requirements we selected the relational dbms postgresql version 12 3 64 bit with its geospatial extension postgis version 2 5 the applied system architecture retains flexibility regarding data entry manipulation and retrieval as well as connection to other applications depending on the investigation objective the hios database can be accessed via different front end software for database development and administration for example we use the management tool pgadmin 4 for postgresql databases to carry out spatial analyses or create maps the gis software arcgis pro and qgis are suitable moreover the python scripting language offers a variety of options for database editing and analyses we access the hios database via the library psycopg 2 and perform spatial operations on geographic data using the library geopandas using the open source web application jupyter notebook we run analyses and create maps directly in the browser 3 design and implementation of the hios database our objective was to develop an effective and sustainable database system that supports systematic event collection and spatiotemporal hazard analyses by effective we mean a flexible database system that enables the targeted analyses a flexible database system can answer all possible questions and is easy to expand or adapt to new datasets to be effective the database system needs to return query results quickly and assist in performing event analyses by providing aggregated and systematic datasets in addition to effectiveness the sustainability of the database design is vital to ensure long term use the database structure must be easy for third parties to understand and expand in addition a comprehensible and detailed documentation of the database structure with its tables attributes and relationships is essential 3 1 event definition to obtain a consistent dataset we have to define which flood events are considered in the database the hios dataset includes flood events that have been caused by heavy precipitation i e flash flood and pluvial flood events a pluvial flood occurs when heavy precipitation triggers a flood event independent of an overflowing water body pluvial flooding is usually caused by infiltration excess and overwhelmed drainage systems flash floods are triggered by short but high intensity rainfall which causes a torrent of high velocity although flash floods and pluvial floods are both triggered by heavy precipitation they behave differently while flash flooding usually arises from a watercourse pluvial flooding is caused by water flowing towards watercourses since flash floods and pluvial floods can occur simultaneously and the available event information usually does not allow a distinct assignment we do not differentiate between flash floods and pluvial floods in our database therefore to address both flood types we speak of heavy rain induced floods in our database we apply the flash flood definition outlined by kaiser et al 2020b which is adapted to continental conditions since most of our event data containing precipitation information originates from the eswd we have adopted the eswd precipitation threshold to obtain an overall dataset that is as uniform as possible therefore according to our definition a flash flood event is triggered by a heavy rainfall event that lasts between 30 min and 24 h and exceeds a given minimum rain amount according to essl 2014 we define as the threshold for a heavy precipitation event 1 p 2 5 d where p is the precipitation amount in mm and d is the duration in min regarding spatiotemporal occurrence kaiser et al 2020b limit flash flood occurrence to catchments of up to 500 km2 in size and to the period between april and october in case the precipitation amount is unknown a short flooding rise time and or little to no warning time as well as a small catchment size are used as proxy indicators kaiser et al 2020b we apply the same thresholds for the identification of pluvial floods with the difference that if no precipitation measurement is available the heavy precipitation event must have caused flooding and an extreme impact to be documented according to essl 2014 extreme impacts are characterized by several firefighting operations cascade effects such as landslides flooded basements disruption of public transport or closed roads for the database the way a flash flood or pluvial flood event is uniquely stored also needs to be defined according to kaiser et al 2020b an event can be uniquely identified by the affected city and the occurrence date in this context the term city stands for any settlement size ranging from a village to a city that can still be uniquely identified since we consider it highly unlikely that two heavy rain induced flood events will occur on the same day at the same location we consider our definition valid according to this definition the relationship between the cities and events tables is a one to many relationship a flash flood or pluvial flood event occurs in one city and a city has experienced zero one or more flash flood pluvial flood events 3 2 database tables for comprehensive analyses the hios database combines information on flash flood and pluvial flood events with relevant geographic data geographic information relevant for flood investigations includes catchment information and measurements information on administrative structures geodata such as maps and digital elevation models in total the hios database consists of 34 tables four of which are pure geodata tables the database tables can be grouped into the following categories event description event documentation administration structure catchment information measurements claims geodata and metainformation table 1 the database tables are either reference or data tables reference tables contain general steady information related to an object the federal states table for example holds information on each federal state including name official code population and size data tables in contrast contain the collected measurements and event information that may change with each entry as an example each flood event is documented as a new event entry in the events table including occurrence date city name and official municipality code in the following we explain the database tables of each category in detail for reasons of clarity we write table names in italics and enclose attributes in quotation marks below the central component of the hios database is the collection of event information in the tables of the event description a flood event is described via entries in the events space time meteorology hydrology damage entries and sources tables in the events table we list all events by date and location in the space time table we describe the event s spatiotemporal extent and evaluate the temporal and spatial accuracy of the event information we document the event s meteorological conditions in the meteorology table not only is information on the heavy rain event recorded e g duration amount intensity start end but also the information on the accompanying phenomena of thunderstorms such as hail lightning and storms documenting the meteorological conditions helps to better assess the occurred damage and its cause in the hydrology table we specify the hydrological effects of the heavy rain event in addition to information on flooding and discharge e g highest affected floor water level discharge we document the occurrence of cascade effects such as flotsam landslides or dike breaches all losses and damages are recorded in the damage table we document financial losses and describe the occurred damages separated for buildings businesses infrastructure forestry and agriculture furthermore we record the number of injuries and fatalities documenting early warnings disaster alerts or evacuations helps to better assess the event magnitude and the occurred damage in addition we specify the accuracy of measurements and estimates in the comment attributes of the meteorology hydrology and damage tables the sources and entries tables store important metainformation we store information about the used sources regarding usage rights citations as well as a dataset description in the reference sources table metainformation about the event entry is recorded in the entries table in addition to the editor we store the source type the entry date and the last review date for each event entry furthermore we evaluate the quality of the event information in addition to event information we also archive information on the source documents in our database for event documentation the documents videos websites and photos tables are available in these tables we archive important metainformation about the source documents and the accompanying material of the event the tables not only indicate the usage rights citation author and quality of the source document but also describe the source file and the storage location videos and photos of flash flood and pluvial flood events are important because they provide much better insight into the event s course and severity than a purely textual event description for later analyses it is essential to document the original sources adequately we use the federal states government districts rural districts municipalities cities and zip codes tables to classify the events into the german administrative structure since germany is a federal republic it is divided into 16 federal states the four federal states of baden wuerttemberg bavaria hesse and north rhine westphalia are further subdivided into government districts which serve as mid level local government units the next subdivision level of the federal states or government districts is the rural district rural districts in turn are composed of municipalities which can include several villages towns and cities major cities in germany usually form their own rural district the table rural districts thus contains both rural districts which are composed of municipalities and major cities with district status for reasons of simplicity we call the table cities although it includes settlements of any size the administrative structure tables contain the official names abbreviations and identification numbers as well as the bounding shapefiles and population numbers the geographical dimension of cities towns villages is specified by official bounding boxes regarding geographic information we indicate the center and average altitude of each city zip codes and associated shapefiles are stored in the zip codes table in the water authorities table we reference information on the bavarian water authorities whose areas of responsibility are based on the government districts due to the federal system the water management administration is organized differently in the 16 federal states within the scope of the project we only had access to official detailed information about the bavarian water management administration the catchments watercourses lakes gauges and gauge catchments tables enable the hydrological classification of flood events in the lakes and watercourses table we store official information on the german lakes and watercourses along with their delimiting polygons and polylines the information available in the lakes table includes e g the number of inflows the maximum depth and the residence time for watercourses we hold information on e g the river order length and width in the database in the catchments table we describe the characteristics of the german catchments using parameters such as mean slope form factor and relief in addition the catchments table holds the official catchment polygons which were provided by the respective federal states in the gauge catchments table we store the catchments of the gauging stations in addition to the gauge location we store information such as catchment area gauge type gauge quality or gauge zero in the gauges table the category measurements include the discharge measurements discharge investigation and heavy rain hours tables since we could only obtain the discharge measurements for bavaria the discharge measurements and discharge investigation tables only contain information about the state of bavaria the heavy rain hours table on the other hand reflects all of germany for 486 bavarian gauges we save the discharge time series in hourly resolution for their entire measurement periods in the discharge measurements table the discharge investigation table contains the results of a discharge study the study by kaiser et al 2020a investigated the discharge time series of 342 gauging stations regarding flash floods the flash flood determination was based on the discharge characteristics defined by a specific peak discharge 0 3 m3s 1km2 a time to peak 20 h and a period of occurrence from april to october kaiser et al 2020a in the discharge investigation table we save each identified flash flood hydrograph of this study along with the identified event begin peak and end as well as the discharge values of begin peak and end furthermore we indicate the hydrograph describing parameters which are percent increase time to peak specific peak discharge gradient volume peak to volume return period and corresponding flood discharge in addition we store the results of a freely available dataset from the gdv and the dwd in the heavy rain hours table this dataset sums up all periods of heavy rain in germany based on the weather radar records from 2001 to 2016 the claims frequency table contains information on insurance claims due to heavy rain in germany for the years 2002 2017 the insurance claims are aggregated at the rural district level this dataset by the gdv and dwd specifies the number of heavy rain events the damages per building the average damage as well as the number of affected buildings per 1 000 buildings geodatasets for spatial analyses are in separate tables in the hios database the geodata group includes the elevation model natural region landcover and soil tables we store both vector and raster datasets since the table attributes are dataset specific they are not described further here information about the database design is stored in the table descriptions attribute descriptions and geodata descriptions tables these tables support the sustainability of the database as they contain important metainformation for understanding the database structure in table descriptions we indicate the content of each database table similarly the attribute descriptions table describes each table attribute regarding content unit and if applicable the underlying dataset and source accordingly the geodata descriptions table contains the official names and abbreviations as well as a brief description of the datasets 3 3 table attributes and attribute domains the table attributes significantly influence the later analysis options the choice of the non key attributes is essential since the descriptive attributes determine which questions can be answered when choosing the non key attributes it is of fundamental importance to anticipate potential questions and to know the information and datasets to be stored to answer future questions attributes must provide flexibility attributes that are too general entail the risk of losing information and restricting analyses whereas attributes that are too specific complicate analyses therefore ensuring flexibility often implies an increased complexity and number of attributes we chose the table attributes based on the used datasets and collected information as well as on potential questions table a 1 in the appendix lists the table attributes together with their data type constraints and keys however we do not list the attributes of the geodata tables in table a 1 as their attributes are dataset specific and therefore not of general interest we adopted nationwide reference systems such as state codes names and abbreviations information from various datasets was standardized and summarized in attributes due to german federalism each state provided differently organized hydrological information to obtain a german dataset we therefore had to summarize the information for the catchments watercourses and lakes tables the challenge of homogenization is to define attributes that summarize the information without overly generalizing it to facilitate the automated evaluation of stored information we defined attribute domains for most non key attributes this domain specification is particularly important for the attributes of the event description tables since this information forms the basis of the analyses free text is generally hard to evaluate as it is unstructured therefore kaiser et al 2020b suggest using fixed categories besides free text for attribute description they propose three types of attribute domains i yes no null ii given attribute values and iii text blocks the yes no and null attribute values document for example the occurrence or non occurrence of sedimentation landslides or dike failures kaiser et al 2020b further suggest attribute specific domains such as basement first floor second floor third floor for the highest affected floor attribute or oil sewage chemicals other to describe the type of contamination for damage description kaiser et al 2020b use text blocks consisting of an adjective and a noun where the adjective describes the extent of the damage and the noun specifies the affected object possible attribute values are for example destroyed houses flooded streets or eroded agricultural land the attribute domains proposed in kaiser et al 2020b were applied to the attributes of the space time hydrology meteorology and damage tables 3 4 table relationships and keys most entities in the hios database are connected by a one to many relationship a one to one relationship exists only between the claims frequency and rural districts heavy rain hours and zip codes gauges and gauge catchments entities due to high maintenance efforts we largely avoided the use of many to many associations however a few many to many relationships exist such as between the event documentation entities e g documents videos and the events entity fig 2 shows the entity relationship er diagram which represents the associations between the entities of the hios database thematically related entities are grouped and marked with the same color cf table 1 for reasons of clarity we only listed the key attributes of the entities regarding manageability and consistency we implemented only the necessary relationships between the database entities and not all the possible ones therefore for some queries detours via other entities have to be accepted when no direct association is implemented however entities holding geographic data can also be linked via spatial relationships for example the lakes and catchments entities can be connected using the postgis function st within the only entities without association are the metainformation entities since the table descriptions geodata descriptions and attribute descriptions entities serve as pure information tables to increase the usability of the hios database we employed simple intuitive and non composed primary keys wherever possible to this end we inherited natural keys that were already contained in the datasets such as the 12 digit municipality keys or the state names adopting natural keys has the advantage that the key also has a meaning outside the database and is therefore often easier for the user to remember and interpret we only introduced surrogate sequential primary keys when merging different datasets in one table as in the catchment information tables or when creating an own new dataset the table descriptions geodata descriptions and attribute descriptions entities are an exception to this rule since these entities have the entity and attribute names they describe as primary keys table a 1 and fig 2 indicate the primary and foreign keys of the database tables in eight tables we use composite primary keys consisting of two or four attributes for example the primary key of the cities entity is composed of the name and the 12 digit municipality no in the attribute descriptions table table and attribute together form the primary key since some attribute names occur in several tables the discharge measurements entity contains the discharge time series of the bavarian gauging stations to uniquely identify a measured discharge value we query the gauge no and the timestamp the discharge investigation table holds discharge parameters on identified flash flood events from kaiser et al 2020a by using the gauge no and number attributes we retrieve discharge information on a specific flash flood hydrograph the space time meteorology hydrology and damage tables use the same compound key the compound key consists of the four attributes event no source no info no and zip code we will clarify the use and advantages of this composite key in section 3 5 3 5 documentation of event information to guarantee sustainability it is important to ensure traceability comprehensibility and editability of the generated event dataset for this reason we document metainformation about the event information and sources and store source documents if available although this metainformation may seem unnecessary for the event investigation it contributes to an understandable and editable event dataset most importantly this metainformation allows users to get the most out of the dataset for their purposes the sources table contains information about the sources used their usage rights and citation and gives a dataset description to comply with formalities we document specifications on data sharing and publication in the usage rights attribute in addition we use the dataset description attribute to describe the dataset creation and the changes we have made to it by not allowing null entries in the sources table we force editors to think about the underlying publication rights and restrictions of the datasets used overall the sources table supports compliance with good scientific practice which in turn contributes to a responsible and sustainable dataset generation and use like the sources table we store metainformation about each event entry in the entries table where we specify the source type as literature report website newspaper article damage report photo video tv radio with the quality level attribute we assess the quality of the event information using the four categories qc0 qc0 qc1 qc2 as proposed by dotzek et al 2009 qc0 stands for event information that is adopted as received qc0 describes events that are plausibility checked qc1 stands for event confirmed and qc2 means event fully verified dotzek et al 2009 considering the source type and quality assessment we can better estimate the reliability of the event information furthermore we note the editor of each event entry together with the entry date and the last review date specifying the editor maintains the flexibility to alter event entries if for example an editor applied a different flood definition or made a systematic mistake in event documentation the indication of the last review date further allows retracing when the event information was last changed the documents videos websites and photos tables serve a purpose similar to the sources table in these tables metainformation about the original documents regarding author usage rights citation quality and storage location is stored we also note a description and comment about the source documents since event documentation for scientific investigations is a central task of the database we attached particular importance to the flexible design of the involved tables we use a primary key composed of four attributes for the space time hydrology meteorology and damage tables the compound key uses the event no source no info no and zip code attributes and allows for different aggregation levels of the event dataset the event no uniquely identifies each event in the events table to query all available information about one specific event regardless of the source we search for the event number using the event number we can aggregate all event information stored in the database on a specific event for each event entry we indicate the source using the source no attribute specifying the source enables to hide sensitive information such as insurance data or to exclude sources from analyses considered less reliable kaiser et al 2020b we further indicate the zip code of the affected city for large cities we can differentiate damages by zip code areas and thus maintain spatial accuracy for towns with only one zip code we specify the district in which flooding occurred in the districts attribute to avoid information loss we introduced the info no attribute which is a continuous integer we use the info no attribute to record several items of information on the same event this is for example the case when we document several starts of the triggering precipitation event with different precipitation amounts and durations to summarize only the composition of the event no source no info no and zip code attributes enables the unique identification of an event in the event information tables using parts of this composed key enables different aggregation levels of the event information providing the greatest possible query flexibility 3 6 data sources our database contains 23 752 flash flood and pluvial flood events that were triggered by heavy rainfall in germany we composed the event dataset from a variety of sources the event information originates from insurance companies mission archives scientific projects agencies and media our flood record starts in 346 and ends in 2017 however most events are available from 2000 onwards it should be mentioned that events in the federal states of thuringia baden wuerttemberg hesse and rhineland palatinate are potentially overrepresented since an insurance dataset with 16 900 events was obtained for these federal states kaiser et al 2020b kaiser et al 2020b present the hios event dataset in detail together with a description of the temporal and spatial resolution and the number of extracted events from the various sources used for spatial analyses we store various geodatasets covering germany in the database in addition to a digital elevation model we archive a topsoil map a land cover map and the natural regions of germany table 1 the environment ministries of the respective federal states provided official information on lakes watercourses gauges and catchments including point line and polygon shapefiles the database also contains the german administrative structure in addition to the official reference data the bounding polygons and centers of the various administrative levels are stored the hios database also contains measurements regarding discharge we store the discharge time series of 486 bavarian gauges in hourly resolution for the respective total measurement period from the study by kaiser et al 2020a we have the identified discharge time series of several thousand flash floods together with parameters describing the discharge event such as specific peak discharge time to peak or percent rise we further use two datasets published by the german weather service and the german insurance association one dataset indicates the sum of heavy rain hours in germany since 2001 per zip code area heavy rain considered in this study had to exceed 25 l m2 in 1 h or 35 l m2 in 6 h which corresponds to the warning level 3 of 4 of the german weather service the second dataset describes the damage frequency due to heavy rain in germany for the years 2002 2017 aggregated at the rural district level 4 methods 4 1 event rate to ensure the comparability of the number of events between cities we have normalized the number of events the number of inhabitants correlates moderately with the number of flash flood and pluvial flood events meaning that larger cities tend to experience more heavy rain induced floods cf section 5 3 to find out which cities are most frequently affected regardless of their size we used a normalized variable that eliminates the population bias in the number of events for reasons of comparability we introduced the dimensionless event rate which is defined as the quotient of the number of events and the logarithm of the population to the basis 10 2 event r a t e number o f e v e n t s log 10 p o p u l a t i o n the population distribution of germany has a strong right skewed distribution therefore to resolve skewness and obtain a small divisor we applied a log transformation to the population data the only disadvantage of the event rate compared to the number of events is the loss of intuitive comprehensibility 4 2 hot spot analysis we investigated the hot and cold spots of heavy rain induced floods in germany using the global moran s i and getis ord gi statistics both approaches are implemented in the spatial statistics toolbox of the gis software arcgis pro the spatial autocorrelation global moran s i tool measures spatial autocorrelation for a given set of weighted spatial features using the global moran s i statistic the moran s i index evaluates whether the data shows a dispersed random or clustered pattern a positive moran s index value implies a tendency toward clustering while a negative index value suggests dispersion the global moran s i index is defined as follows 2 i n s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x j 1 n x j x 2 where w i j is the spatial weight between feature i and j n is equal to the total feature number and s 0 is the aggregate of the spatial weights 3 s 0 i 1 n j 1 n w i j the z score is computed as 4 z i e i var i where e i and var i are given as 5 e i 1 n 1 6 v a r i e i 2 e i 2 the hot spot analysis getis ord gi tool applies the getis ord gi statistic to identify statistically significant hot and cold spots for a given set of weighted features getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 when calculating the gi statistic the local sum for a feature and its adjacent features are compared proportionally to the sum of all features in the study area such that 7 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where x j is the attribute value of feature j w i j is the spatial weight between feature i and j and n corresponds to the total number of features and 8 x j 1 n x j n 9 s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 for each feature the gi statistic is calculated and a z score and p value are returned a statistically significant z score is obtained when the local sum differs greatly from the expected local sum and the difference is too large to be the result of randomness a statistically significant hot spot is a feature with a high value that is surrounded by other features with high values a significant cold spot is in contrast described by a low negative z score and a small p value in geosciences the moran s i and getis ord gi statistics have been widely applied e g to assess heavy metal concentrations kim and choi 2017 to detect landslides lu et al 2019 or to improve forest management rossi and becker 2019 khajehei et al 2020 recently applied hot spot analysis to cluster gauging stations in the u s regarding the magnitude duration frequency and severity of measured flash floods 4 3 event binning to better explore the event dataset we used feature binning using arcgis pro feature binning is a method to aggregate and visually represent point data by grouping the event points into bins the dense information is summarized a bin represents all events within its boundaries and is displayed wherever there is at least one event in it we chose bins with a size of 100 km2 as a compromise between resolution and graphic representability using bins rather than political boundaries for event aggregation is preferable by using bins of equal size we avoid visually emphasizing areas as would be the case for example with unevenly sized rural districts 5 investigations on heavy rain induced floods in germany due to its good spatial and temporal coverage the hios dataset enables the holistic investigation of heavy rain induced floods in germany we used the database s functionalities to manipulate the collected data for our flood analyses using sql queries we generated the datasets required for our investigations from the hios dataset to illustrate how a database supports spatiotemporal investigations we provide the sql queries applied in the appendix these sql statements can serve as examples and inspiration for others who wish to conduct similar investigations 5 1 spatial distribution and frequency many fundamental questions regarding the spatial occurrence of floods caused by heavy rain in germany are still unanswered such as where did flash floods and pluvial floods occur in germany do they occur everywhere in germany which cities had the most events in the past we can now address these questions thanks to the availability of the hios dataset for our investigations we created a table view of the events table entitled events analysis containing only the events relevant to our analyses b 1 to ensure valid investigations we excluded possibly irrelevant events that did not occur between april and october which is considered the season of heavy rain induced floods for germany see section 5 5 overall the flood events investigated below comply with the event definition given in section 3 1 however we would like to point out that the flood events are not due to missing information differentiated according to their magnitude or flood type therefore minor and severe flood events as well as flash floods and pluvial floods are treated equally to avoid distortions of the investigation we further excluded the events from the insurance dataset since it only covers 4 of the 16 federal states without the insurance dataset we obtain a roughly representative dataset of heavy rain induced floods for germany with 8 718 events unless otherwise stated in the following sections we used the events analysis table view as a data basis to investigate the spatial distribution of heavy rain induced flood events in germany we created a dataset that summarizes the number of flood events for each affected city b 2 for this purpose we joined the events analysis table view on the cities table using the sql statement in appendix b 2 we also queried the city centers from the hios database for mapping fig 3 shows the number of documented flash flood and pluvial flood events per city in germany we find that floods caused by heavy rain occurred all over germany although not all regions were affected equally often in the past in total the hios dataset documents events for 4 875 cities of these cities 70 were affected once 17 twice 6 three times and 7 more than three times on the median the affected cities were hit once with the 95 quantile being 5 events and the 99 quantile 11 events regarding the distribution of the more frequently affected cities there appears to be a slight north south gradient with less heavy rain induced flood events in the northern german plain fig 4 this decrease of events from south to north seems plausible given the flat orography of the northern german plain many events particularly occurred in metropolitan areas such as the rhine ruhr area or the rhine main area with 11 and 6 million inhabitants respectively most events were reported for the metropolises of berlin 65 munich 59 and hamburg 54 fig 3 with regard to the event rate the top 10 are berlin 13 munich 12 hamburg 11 frankfurt 8 aachen 7 nuremberg 7 cologne 6 dresden 6 düsseldorf 6 dortmund 6 overall the top 10 most frequently affected cities are only those with more than 250 000 inhabitants both in terms of event numbers and normalized event rates however not all highly urbanized regions stand out with a particularly large number of events as can be seen from the metropolitan areas of northwest bremen oldenburg and surroundings 3million inhabitants and hanover brunswick göttingen 4 million inhabitants 5 2 temporal analysis fig 5 shows the annual frequency of floods caused by heavy rain as well as the number of people injured and killed by flash floods and pluvial floods in germany in the period 1990 2017 we summarized the number of events injuries and fatalities per year since 1990 using the sql statement from b 3 for these 28 years we collected 8 256 events in which 583 people were injured and 89 died statistically people were injured in 7 and killed in 1 of the flood events the most documented events so far occurred in the year 2011 1 065 events and 2016 1 025 events although most events were documented for 2011 this year did not cause the most deaths and injuries in the period considered the events of 2016 and 2006 caused 24 and 23 of the documented injured people respectively most deaths were reported for the years 1990 24 and 2016 17 however relative to the number of events 1990 was more extreme with seven events claiming 50 injuries and 24 deaths regarding the number of events the years 1990 1991 and 1996 had the highest death rates with 3 43 0 13 and 0 10 deaths per event the highest rates of injuries were documented for the years 1990 7 14 1994 0 20 and 2006 0 25 to better understand the temporal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods we analyzed the documented floods regarding their onset using the extract function of postgresql we grouped the events by the hour of occurrence and counted the number of events fatalities and injuries b 4 the start time of 8 150 events is known this refers to the flooding onset and not to the beginning of the triggering precipitation the first inundations outside creeks and river banks mark the beginning of the flood event it should be noted however that in most cases the flooding onset cannot be reliably measured or determined therefore the start time is usually an estimate with high uncertainties fig 6 shows the frequency of the flood onset for each hour of the day using one hour bins the local times given hereinafter refer to central european summer time which is valid in germany from march to october and corresponds to utc 2 most of the documented heavy rain induced flood events occurred at 15 00 local time almost half of all events began between 14 00 and 18 00 local time during the night and in the early morning floods triggered by heavy rain rarely occurred investigating the onset of the events in which people were injured or killed provided us with insights into the influence of flood timing on human losses fig 6 indicates that most people were killed in floods starting around 12 00 93 deaths and 21 00 local time 67 deaths whereas people were mostly injured between 18 00 and 19 00 local time 20 and 22 injuries overall the frequency of injuries and fatalities increases roughly with the frequency of the events 5 3 influence of population fig 3 raises the question to what extent population influences heavy rain induced flood occurrences since flash floods and pluvial floods often cannot be recorded automatically e g at gauging stations their flood reporting generally relies on human observation marjerison et al 2016 therefore one may hypothesize that the number of reported heavy rain induced flood events is higher for larger cities where more people can report them in addition population may influence heavy rain induced flood occurrence as the proportion of impervious area generally increases with population which is known to facilitate surface runoff thus we are interested to know whether the event frequency correlates with the population and whether regions with a high proportion of built up area report more events to answer these questions we investigated the relationship between event frequency and population as well as event frequency and sealing percentage due to the resolution of the population data we aggregated the events at the rural district level for this analysis we used the information on population density rural district area and sealing percentage contained in the rural districts table we joined the events analysis table view on the rural districts table and grouped the events by the 401 german rural districts from this intermediate table we queried the necessary district information including the shapefiles b 5 fig 7 shows the population density of the rural districts superimposed over the associated number of events we observe tendencies that higher population densities are associated with more reported events especially in the densely populated metropolitan regions of rhine ruhr rhine main stuttgart and munich we notice a high number of flood events caused by heavy rain however contrary trends are also evident when looking at the area of the ore mountains the alpine foothills and the northeastern german plain in these regions we have comparatively high event frequencies but rather low population densities to assess the correlation we plotted the number of flood events against the number of inhabitants fig 8 for better representation we transformed the number of inhabitants with the logarithm of the basis 10 according to the pearson correlation coefficient a moderate positive correlation r 0 62 p 3 33e 44 exists between the number of heavy rain induced flood events and the number of inhabitants which is also apparent in fig 7 therefore a population increase often leads to a higher frequency of flash flood and pluvial flood events contrary to expectations our event dataset indicates no correlation between the number of heavy rain induced flood events and the degree of sealing r 0 07 p 9 07e 11 however the number of heavy rain induced flood events correlates weakly with the district area r 0 32 p 1 63e 01 we would expect a strong correlation between the district area and the number of floods if heavy rain induced flood occurrence were a random process meaning that the number of flood events would increase as the district area increases as well however the districts seem to be spatially too homogeneous and furthermore do not take hydrological relationships into account given a weak correlation with the district area we can assume that the aggregation level of the events does not distort the correlation between heavy rain induced flood events and population 5 4 hot spots and cold spots to better cope with the flood hazards from heavy rain we need to identify particularly endangered regions the first step is thus to analyze the spatial pattern of heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany regarding prevention it is essential to discover the regions that experience particularly numerous or few flood events and to localize these hot and cold spots since we are interested in finding significant hot and cold spots independently of city size we use the event rate instead of the number of events we calculated the event rate for each city in germany using the sql statement in b 6 of the appendix by joining the cities table on the events analysis view we linked the information on the number of events and the city population required for this analysis if a city has not yet been affected we set the event rate to 0 taking advantage of the sql case expression we computed the event rate for all german cities b 6 to reduce the bias in our event dataset towards positive cases we considered all german cities regardless of whether an event was documented for the city as the hios dataset lacks confirmed not yet affected cities we assumed in a simplified approach that the non listed cities have not been so far affected by a flash flood or pluvial flood event as the flood events are linked to the city they affected we need to analyze whether the spatial distribution of the cities influences that of the flood events if the spatial pattern of the cities affects the heavy rain induced flood distribution the hot spot analysis will reveal the pattern of the cities not of the events therefore we investigated the spatial pattern of the german cities using the average nearest neighbor tool the tool calculates the nearest neighbor index that is given as the ratio of the observed mean distance of each city to its nearest neighboring city to the expected mean distance in case of random distribution of the cities the nearest neighbor index of the german cities is 1 2 which indicates that the observed average distance between the cities is greater than a hypothetical random distribution table 2 german cities thus show a dispersed pattern calculating the nearest neighbor ratio only for the affected cities yields 1 0 indicating that affected cities are randomly distributed over germany table 2 as german cities show a dispersed pattern but affected cities are randomly distributed we can conclude that the location of the cities does not distort the spatial distribution of the flash flood and pluvial flood events using the global moran s i statistic we further investigated the spatial patterns of the german cities regarding population number of events and event rate we found that population number of events and event rates show a statistically significant clustered pattern over germany table 3 fig 9 shows the identified hot and cold spots of heavy rain induced floods for germany in sum we localized seven hot spots and two cold spots some hot spots are found in more urbanized regions such as around berlin in the rhine ruhr metropolitan region and in the conurbations of rhine main rhine neckar and stuttgart however other hot spots are located in the less populated but hilly terrain of the bavarian alpine foothills in the ore mountains and in the region between the thuringian forest and the harz mountains two statistically significant cold spots are found in the northwestern german plain except hamburg and in north central bavaria north of the danube we further note that not all metropolitan areas are hot spots hamburg and hanover brunswick göttingen for example do not have statistically significant event rates and the metropolitan regions northwest and nuremberg lie in a cold spot it is further of interest whether injuries and fatalities occur more frequently in hot rather than in cold spots therefore we superimposed the hot and cold spots over the number of injuries and fatalities fig 10 using the sql statement of b 7 we summarized the number of injured and killed people per city during the period 1900 2017 flash and pluvial floods killed 499 and injured 583 people in general we find that few injurious and fatal events have occurred in the northern german plain compared to the rest of germany central bavaria where a cold spot has been identified also appears to be less affected in particular many deadly events happened in the ore mountains hot spot mostly due to two major events in 1927 and 2010 that affected several cities the injuries within the ore mountains hot spot in contrast are due to recent flood events caused by heavy rain in 2003 2006 and 2012 also in the rhine ruhr and rhine main to stuttgart hot spots many people have been injured and killed by heavy rain induced floods in the past the four cities with the most reported injuries were all caused by one flood event that was caused by heavy rain neuhausen ob eck bw 82 injuries on 24 06 2016 balingen bw 41 injuries on 24 06 2005 wenden nw 37 injuries on 09 06 2007 and kaiserslautern rp 35 injuries on 27 05 2016 5 5 seasonality we are further interested to know when floods triggered by heavy rain mostly occur in germany is there a season for heavy rain induced floods which months have the most flood events caused by heavy rain and does the seasonality differ for different regions in germany to investigate the seasonality we summarized the seasonal heavy rain induced flood occurrence for the individual federal states b 8 and for the whole of germany b 9 germany has a pronounced summer season with regard to floods caused by heavy rain fig 11 most documented flash flood and pluvial flood events occurred in the summer months of june july and august followed by events in spring march to may in contrast flood events triggered by heavy rain rarely occurred in autumn september to november or winter december to february with 68 5 of the documented events summer is the predominant flood season in germany overall 90 of the documented events took place in summer or spring which indicates that autumn 6 9 and winter events 3 1 play a negligible role in germany although summer is the predominant season of flash and pluvial floods throughout germany the proportion of events in the individual seasons varies considerably between the federal states fig 11 we note that the proportion of spring events in the eastern central german states are well above the average of 20 with 30 in saxony sn 35 in saxony anhalt st and 38 in thuringia th while the share of spring events is larger in southern and central states spring events occur less frequently in northern germany mecklenburg western pomerania mv and berlin be had particularly few events in spring 7 and 10 respectively regarding summer events there is a slight trend towards more summer events in a northerly direction on average almost 7 of the documented german events occurred in autumn with a tendency towards slightly more autumn events in central germany heavy rain induced floods in winter are rare in germany in most federal states winter events do not account for a significant share exceptions to this are the state of saarland 26 sl and the northern city states of hamburg 15 hh and bremen 12 hb whose sample sizes however are too small to ensure statistical significance furthermore we investigated the regional seasonal patterns of heavy rain induced floods in germany fig 12 to study the monthly patterns throughout germany we first counted the number of heavy rain induced flood events per month for each city using the sql statement in b 10 we then grouped the events into bins and determined for each bin the month with the most events for the investigation of the monthly patterns we focused on the events that occurred during the main season from april to october fig 12 shows the regional seasonality patterns in germany by displaying the month with the most documented flash flood and pluvial flood events overall july and june are the months most often affected the main season runs from late spring to early autumn with april and october marking the beginning and end of the heavy rain induced flood season throughout germany the summer events in june and july dominate however may events are particularly frequent in eastern germany ore mountains thuringian forest harz and the rhine neckar metropolitan region the state of bavaria by has also experienced some spring events in the past autumn events rarely dominate but occurred in central germany along a single strip and sporadically in southwest germany in the state of north rhine westphalia nw we find an accumulation of events in late summer overall we observe slight differences in the regional patterns of flood seasonality in germany 6 discussion 6 1 insights from event database setup most articles about flood and flash flood databases omit the technical details of the underlying database therefore information on the database management software used the event definition or the database design itself is rare the lack of technical details hampers the comparison of the hios database with other event databases but underlines the importance of the article to fully profit from setting up a database for floods caused by heavy rain a spatial database should be chosen using a spatial database such as postgresql enables merging and maintaining all required information in one place geographical data event data and metadata nevertheless it is also possible to separate event information and geodata barnolas and llasat 2007 and papagiannaki et al 2013 for example used ms access for their event databases and stored the geoinformation in a gis software however a gis software is no longer necessary when using a spatial database we used postgis functions for example to derive the mean slope and elevation of the catchments using the stored catchment shapefiles and the dem therefore separating event and geographic data unnecessarily complicates analyses as spatial databases can hold spatial and non spatial data and provide spatial functions furthermore it is important to choose a spatial database that provides interfaces to several front end solutions effective flood investigations require interfaces to common gis software e g arcgis pro qgis programming languages e g python r and database management software with this variety of front end software researchers can select the system best suited for a given task in some cases for example spatial queries in postgresql were faster than calculations in arcgis pro furthermore we generated datasets that required programming within jupyter notebook and the python libraries psycopg 2 and geopandas these datasets could not have been created within the database environment since databases are not created to support complex programming tasks in addition python offers a variety of easy to use libraries and functions for scientists that facilitate data analysis however dataset processing outside the database requires knowledge of another programming language and maintenance of an additional system to uniquely define a flood event a space and time reference is required while the occurrence date is clear as a temporal reference the spatial reference of a flood event is controversial for the hios database we chose a damage based definition which uses the affected city as the spatial reference and the time of occurrence in the city as the event date however other researchers use meteorological or hydrological event definitions in their flood databases barnolas and llasat 2007 for example group flood events under the same event id if they were triggered by the same meteorological event thus the size of the rain cell defines the spatial event extent consequently the initial and final date of the triggering rainfall marks the beginning and end of the event barnolas and llasat 2007 adhikari et al 2010 in contrast apply a hydrological event definition to their global flood inventory therefore affected cities in the same catchment obtain the same event id and the event start corresponds to the start date of the flood event hydrometeorological event definitions are impractical since documenting flash flood and pluvial flood events in a hydrometeorological context requires prior analyses of convective cells and catchments it is also not possible to add new flood events without first finding out whether the event already exists in the database and what the event id is however when applying a damage based definition we can still aggregate the events hydrometeorologically by using the stored catchment shapefiles or radar images and the event date we can group flood events according to the meteorological or hydrological context the design of the database tables influences the later event analyses to avoid restricting subsequent analyses the database design should maintain the spatial accuracy of the event information as soon as the event information is entered into the database in aggregated form e g summarized for the municipality or rural district distinct damage analyses for individual cities or catchments become impossible we therefore advocate documenting event information at the city level with the possibility to further differentiate the affected districts by specifying the postcodes for major cities or the affected urban areas for cities in addition inundated areas or affected houses can be specified by polygons and points e g gourley et al 2010 diakakis 2014 however preserving the spatial accuracy of event information requires a more complex database design as well as more effort for data preparation a complex event database like the hios database may not be required for every study it is therefore advisable to weigh the effort for database creation against the study objectives setting up an event database for a few simple analyses is probably not worthwhile however an event database offers further advantages that should be considered besides data management for example the database could be integrated into a website where researchers or interested parties can view and or download event data e g eswd storm events database furthermore people could report events via an online form which are entered directly into the event database to maintain quality standards public reports would have to be reviewed and verified by trained personnel or experts in this way the eswd for example enlarges its event dataset dotzek et al 2009 in the future methods of machine learning can help increase flood datasets one possibility to do so is for example automatically extracting flood event information from online newspaper articles cf yzaguirre et al 2015 zarei and nik bakht 2019 and subsequently updating the event database however a final quality control of the extracted event information by an expert would remain necessary 6 2 findings from spatiotemporal investigations our investigations show that heavy rain induced flood occurrences are randomly distributed over germany which the recent findings of the german weather service lengfeld et al 2019 on short term heavy precipitation also show the analysis of radar data from 16 years 2001 2016 revealed that short heavy precipitation events occur with a similar frequency and intensity throughout germany lengfeld et al 2019 lengfeld et al 2019 have proven that hourly precipitation is equally likely in both flat and mountainous areas as short precipitation events appear to be hardly controlled by orography consequently every german region can be affected by pluvial floods and flash floods triggered by heavy rain we cannot make statements about trends regarding the number of heavy rain induced flood events in germany this is because we estimate the time series to be too short for a reliable trend analysis as the hios dataset can only be considered comprehensive from 2000 onwards kaiser et al 2020b nonetheless the 10 year moving average of documented heavy rain induced flood events per year has increased from 42 in 2000 to 555 in 2017 this increase in flood events may be attributed to increased press coverage of natural hazards llasat et al 2009 as well as to the advent of the internet wirtz et al 2014 which facilitated the search for events and thus made more event information available furthermore climate change could lead to an increase in heavy rain induced floods as a significant increase in heavy precipitation events is projected for europe kovats et al 2014 concerning the development of deaths and injuries related to floods caused by heavy rain our time series suggests neither a decrease nor an increase floods triggered by heavy rain in germany seem to occur more likely between noon and late afternoon with a peak at 15 00 local time for western u s ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 found a similar diurnal distribution with more flash flood events starting between 15 00 and 20 00 local time with regard to the atmospheric processes this diurnal distribution of heavy rain induced flood events appears plausible since convective precipitation in summer is often associated with thunderstorms thunderstorms usually form in the late afternoon or early evening when warm humid air near the ground has heated up due to strong solar radiation and is forced to rise into colder layers of air the most injurious and deadly flood events caused by heavy rain in germany started around noon and late in the evening previous studies by špitalar et al 2014 and terti et al 2017 have proven an accumulation of injurious and fatal events in the evening špitalar et al 2014 examined 21 546 flash flood events in the u s from 2006 to 2012 and discovered that flash floods claimed most injuries and fatalities when they occurred in the late evening špitalar et al 2014 observed that the most fatal events occurred at 21 00 local time terti et al 2017 investigated 1 075 flash flood deaths in the u s from 1996 to 2014 and showed that 63 of the deaths were related to vehicles their analysis revealed a peak in vehicle related fatalities between 19 00 and 21 00 local time terti et al 2017 assumed that people are often unwilling to leave their cars e g when commuting to from work even when the streets are flooded this assumption is supported by the fact that many of the victims in the study died trying to drive through the floodwaters terti et al 2017 špitalar et al 2014 hypothesized that poor visibility in the twilight hours leads to more motorists driving into flooded roadways by accident the unwillingness to leave the car and poor visibility seem to be plausible reasons for the high number of victims in the evening hours also for germany however it is unclear why there were also many victims in the midday hours in germany this could possibly have to do with the fact that at lunchtime many people are outdoors e g end of shift lunch break end of school and are thus outside of protective buildings however this remains speculation as the circumstances of death are not recorded in our database in addition the beginning of the event and the time of death are not necessarily the same and can therefore be far apart our investigation indicates a moderate correlation between the number of inhabitants and the number of flash floods and pluvial floods this correlation is probably the reason why several studies use the population as one of several predictors to explain the spatial distribution of flash floods marjerison et al 2016 liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 further studies have investigated the correlation between population density and flash flood impacts calianno et al 2013 or have predicted flash flood human impacts using population density as one of the explanatory variables terti et al 2019 although we showed a relationship between heavy rain induced flood events and population we cannot say what constitutes this relationship at the rural district level we could not find a correlation between the number of heavy rain induced floods and the sealing degree in the study by marjerison et al 2016 however the share of the impervious area was positively correlated with the number of flash flood reports in binghamton new york still marjerison et al 2016 conclude that the relationship between population and soil sealing is not straightforward and that the sealing degree thus only partially explains the correlation with the population as the relationship between flash floods and human activities is complex liu et al 2018 further detailed analyses are needed to understand its nature although short heavy precipitation events occur with a similar frequency and intensity in germany lengfeld et al 2019 we detected that some regions are more frequently affected than others therefore the occurrence of hot and cold spots of heavy rain induced floods evidences that catchments are susceptible to flash and pluvial flooding in different ways if the catchment characteristics had no influence on the occurrence and magnitude of a flash flood the regions would be affected about equally often this seems plausible since other studies have been able to predict the occurrence of flash floods using catchment properties e g bui et al 2019 costache 2019 marjerison et al 2016 ma et al 2019 janizadeh et al 2019 we identified a relatively good spatial correspondence between identified hot spots and human impacting events still injurious and fatal events also occurred in cold spots or statistically non significant areas in this regard we must keep in mind that every injury and death is the result of unique circumstances and thus cannot be directly attributed to the location yet in regions with frequent heavy rain induced flood occurrences the probability of people being injured or killed increases when investigating more than 20 000 flash flood events in the u s špitalar et al 2014 found that fatalities and especially injuries were more frequent in rural than urban areas however when human impacting events occurred in urban regions they caused more injuries and fatalities per event than in rural areas špitalar et al 2014 to confirm these observations for germany more detailed analyses would have to be carried out our study showed that there is a summer seasonality of floods caused by heavy rain for germany confirmed by the seasonality patterns evidenced in previous studies gaume et al 2009 kaiser et al 2020a various studies confirm that the flash flood seasonality of mediterranean and inland continental countries in europe differ from each other while the main flash flood season is autumn for mediterranean countries gaume et al 2009 llasat et al 2014 tarolli et al 2012 papagiannaki et al 2015 inland continental countries experience most flash flood events in the summer gaume et al 2009 kaiser et al 2020a england also has a pronounced summer seasonality archer et al 2019 and is thus comparable with the seasonality of central european countries such as germany austria slovakia and romania when interpreting the results of our investigations we have to consider potential inherent biases in the hios dataset one shortcoming of our event database might be a temporal bias which leads to an increase in natural hazard events over time gall et al 2009 according to gall et al 2009 this temporal upward trend can be attributed to the increase in population and prosperity especially in high risk areas as well as progress in hazard monitoring and reporting kron et al 2012 assume however that the temporal bias of hazard reporting for western europe has not been too pronounced over the past 30 to 40 years in addition flood events that happened in densely populated areas might be overrepresented in the hios dataset geography bias gall et al 2009 finally we must also bear in mind that in our analyses pluvial floods and flash floods as well as different event magnitudes are considered together this is largely because the event type or magnitude of most documented events apart from well documented catastrophic events cannot be reliably determined by the given event information 7 conclusion this paper illustrates how to design an effective event database suitable for flash flood research using the hios database we exemplified the considerations and assumptions required to set up a relational database for investigations on heavy rain induced floods in germany after defining the database s purpose and requirements we described the system architecture with its front end solutions we further explained in detail the table design attributes and relationships of the hios database we investigated the spatiotemporal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods in germany by creating necessary datasets using the database by providing details on the database design we provided a starting point for those who wish to set up a similar event database for scientific investigations we need a flexible database structure supporting all targeted analyses reviewing our experiences we can make the following recommendations for designing an effective flash flood event database 1 choose a database management system that offers interfaces to a gis software e g arcgis pro qgis a programming language e g python r and a database management tool e g pgadmin a system architecture with multiple front end solutions offers the flexibility to use the software best suited for the investigation 2 use a spatial database system to bundle all required information and data in one place event information geodata e g dem soil land use measurements e g discharge precipitation reference data e g administration structure hydrological information e g catchments rivers metainformation e g sources quality estimation 3 implement an event definition that allows the documentation of flood events without the need for prior hydrometeorological analyses avoid storing events aggregated by catchment or triggering precipitation event 4 design database attributes in such a way that they enable differentiated event documentation implement attributes to allow for differentiation of flash flood impacts within cities e g by specification of zip codes and city districts furthermore we investigated the documented flash flood and pluvial flood events using the hios database we examined the occurrence of heavy rain induced floods in germany regarding spatial distribution and patterns temporal evolution and seasonality the main findings from the study are summarized as follows floods caused by heavy rain occur throughout germany both in flat and in mountainous terrain however there is a slight tendency toward the northern german plain experiencing less flash flood and pluvial flood events heavy rain induced flood events occurred most frequently at 15 00 local time overall the occurrence of heavy rain induced floods is more likely between noon and late afternoon 14 00 18 00 local time than at night or in the early morning most people died in heavy rain induced floods that started around noon or 21 00 local time injuries were most common during floods with onsets between 18 00 and 19 00 local time commute and bad visibility during twilight are suspected to increase the injury and death rates in the late evening there is a moderate positive correlation r 0 62 between the number of heavy rain induced flood events and the number of inhabitants in our study the share of impervious area did not explain the correlation between heavy rain induced flood events and population therefore further analyses investigating the complex relationship between heavy rain induced floods and human activity should consider other factors such as the number of culverts the degree of river obstruction land use and topographic features the flash flood frequency shows a clustered pattern over germany we identified seven hot spots four attributed to mostly metropolitan areas and three to the less populated mountainous regions the northwestern german plain and north central bavaria are cold spots with particularly few flash flood and pluvial flood events there is an increased incidence of injuries and fatalities in identified hot spots injurious and fatal flash flood and pluvial flood events were less frequent in the northern german plain and central bavaria where cold spots were identified flash floods and pluvial floods occur in germany mainly between april and october with summer being the predominant season autumn and winter events hardly occur there is a tendency towards more summer events in northeastern germany while central germany has a more pronounced spring season we benefit from our findings with regard to flood risk management and public relations now that flood hot spots have been identified we can prioritize detailed investigations and adapt local flood risk management knowledge of the diurnal and seasonal occurrence of heavy rain induced floods and high risk areas is valuable information to improve risk assessment and decision making in addition the knowledge gained about heavy rain induced flood occurrences in germany helps to describe the characteristics of the natural hazard to the public this paper demonstrates that event databases are essential scientific tools that help to advance our understanding of flood hazards from heavy precipitation by ensuring the usability and quality of event data databases are valuable instruments for various applications in flash flood research such as damage modeling risk assessment socio economic analyses or climate change studies due to climate change and the associated need to better understand flash flood hazards the importance of event databases will continue to increase to enable concrete prevention measures derived with the help of the event database we have to carry out site specific analyses of factors promoting and triggering flash floods and pluvial floods these analyses must link catchment characteristics topography soil properties and land use with the occurrence of flash and pluvial floods to evaluate the influence of the area properties the result of this regional risk assessment could be presented in a map indicating the flood hazards from heavy

4766,soil moisture plays an important role in partitioning rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration due to advancements in remotely sensed soil moisture data acquisition techniques many soil moisture data assimilation smda studies have been conducted to improve streamflow prediction it is thus expected that the outcome of a smda exercise will be determined by the quality of soil moisture data in hand and the hydrology of the catchment our study begins with the hypothesis that it is possible to determine the usefulness of a satellite based soil moisture data product for areas where paramaterizing a complex model is difficult due to availability of limited information to this end we use satellite based gldas root zone soil moisture data with dynamic budyko db rainfall runoff model to improve streamflow prediction for 60 us basins our results suggest that there is a reasonably good one to one or universal relationship between instantaneous dryness index φ the key state variable of the db model and root zone soil moisture θ which implies that the model can directly use soil moisture information for predicting streamflow to check the robustness of the universal φ θ relationship we also developed basin specific φ θ relationships model performance expressed in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse improved in 34 basins when we considered the universal φ θ relationship and in 51 basins when we considered the basin specific relationships multiple linear regression mlr analysis reveals that change in nse due to the use of soil moisture information is predicted quite well by certain basin characteristics in particular it is found that available water capacity and forest area positively influence nse whereas average sand silt and clay contents latitude and longitude affect it negatively a slightly stronger mlr relationship was observed while considering soil moisture deficit the difference between saturated soil moisture and actual soil moisture in place of soil moisture from the stepwise mlr analysis it is observed that the vegetation and runoff generation mechanism control the parameters of the φ θ relationship overall our study provides a framework to determine the suitability of remotely based soil moisture data for hydrological modelling keywords root zone soil moisture instantaneous dryness index dynamic budyko model catchment characteristics 1 introduction soil moisture is the fundamental variable of the hydrologic cycle which partitions rainfall into evaporation and runoff brocca et al 2017 2012 2010 massari et al 2015 an actual estimation of soil moisture facilitates improved streamflow prediction many studies have proved that antecedent soil moisture of a basin strongly affects the response of the basin coustau et al 2013 tramblay et al 2012 the in situ soil moisture measurement is generally done at point scale for many practical or hydrological modelling purposes soil moisture at basin scale is required singh et al 2019 thus soil moisture at point scale is necessary to be scaled up the up scaling process is generally associated with uncertainties due to the high spatial variability of soil moisture on the other hand accurate measurement of soil moisture being a difficult task the availability of high resolution data at both spatial and temporal scales bartalis et al 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 kerr et al 2010 owe et al 2008 enhanced application of remotely sensed soil moisture data in hydrological modelling especially in soil moisture data assimilation smda aubert et al 2003 brocca et al 2012 2010 crow and ryu 2008 lievens et al 2015 massari et al 2015 the smda merges information among observed data and model forecasted value to update the model state towards the unknown true value typically the state variables of a hydrological model are related to the corresponding satellite derived variables for this purpose alvarez garreton et al 2015 patil and ramsankaran 2018 2017 it is therefore logical to expect that the performance of such a hydrological model will depend primarily on the quality of the available soil moisture data brocca et al 2013 assimilated remotely sensed soil moisture into misdc hydrological model for five basins in italy luxembourg france and the usa they found no improvements in model simulation particularly in mountainous and snow dominated regions however in dry climates they found an improvements in runoff simulations they concluded that the reliability of the model depends on the accuracy of satellite data and climatic regions matgen et al 2012 used bibmodel to assimilate satellite derived soil moisture and found no improvements in model prediction using satellite data on the other hand alvarez garreton et al 2015 assimilated satellite derived observed soil moisture data into a hydrological model in a semi arid catchment they found improvement in the model prediction due to the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture data corato et al 2014 assimilated remotely sensed soil moisture data into a model for a catchment located in the uk they observed that the assimilation performance depends on vegetation and time of the year for which satellite data is being assimilated overall the smda is not equally beneficial in every part of the world although there are other methodological issues existed in the smda physical and hydro climatological characteristics of basins are vital factors that may affect the smda using satellite data massari et al 2015 hence it is necessary to find out dominant catchment characteristics that mainly affect the model performance for a particular satellite based soil moisture product due to the limited information available in many parts of the world water resources management using a complex hydrological model pose a challenging task chen et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2013 razavi et al 2013 yaşar and baykan 2013 therefore in this study we focus on developing a simple and effective framework to assess the suitability of remote sensing based gldas soil moisture data for streamflow prediction for the areas where limited information is available with the help of dynamic budyko db rainfall runoff model biswal 2016 in 60 usgs basins it is hypothesized that the only state variable of the model instantaneous dryness index φ is a function of soil moisture accordingly the objectives of the study are formulated as follows a to establish a relationship between φ and observed soil moisture and b to identify the catchment characteristics that primarily influence the model performance in the next section we provide a detailed description about the methodologies involved in this study 2 data and methods 2 1 study basins and data the daily root zone soil moisture θ data from 1948 to 2000 and surface soil moisture data from 1990 to 2002 were obtained from the global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas and european space agency climate change initiative esacci respectively the surface and root zone soil moisture correspond to a vertical depth of soil about 0 5 to 2 cm and 100 cm respectively the daily rainfall pet and discharge data along with porosity values for the basins were obtained from the mopex database duan et al 2006 for this study 60 mopex reference basins were selected based on the following criteria basins with i snowmelt contribution less than 25 of the total flow falcone et al 2010 ii continuous availability of rainfall and pet data from 1948 to 1975 and iii rainfall pet and discharge data for at least continuous four years during 1976 to 2000 except for the soil moisture data 0 25 0 25 all other data are lumped data the area of the basins varies from 66 56 to 8150 73 km2 the location of the gauging stations considered for the study is shown in fig 1 2 2 the dynamic budyko db model the db model is a calibration free rainfall runoff model that simulates streamflow on a daily basis it uses a dryness index based budyko function budyko 1974 to compute runoff the dryness index explicitly represents the long term average dryness state of the soil and implicitly represents the long term average soil moisture state han et al 2018 and often it is called as aridity index the budyko framework is suitable for timescales for which change in storage is negligible in the mass balance equation ds dt i q this condition is more likely to be satisfied if the timescale is larger than a year gerrits et al 2009 thus the variables of the budyko function are computed at a long timescale the db model on the other hand has been developed for hydrological partitioning at small timescales it conceptualizes a river basin into two hypothetical zones zone 1 and zone 2 in zone 1 rainfall r satisfies the pet of the basin and if r p e t the remaining water w enters the zone 2 and if r p e t then the remaining energy h enters zone 2 mathematically w is defined as w t r t p e t t if r t p e t t else w t 0 and h is defined as h t p e t t r t if p e t t r t else h t 0 thus zone 1 produces evapotranspiration et only and zone 2 produces both et and q which is realistic as it produces no q for very low intensity rainfall although the zone 1 and zone 2 are considered as hypothetical layers in the original framework of the db model physically these zones can be interpreted as two soil layers which correspond to the top few centimeters of depth 2 5 cm and root zone layer up to 100 cm respectively pet is quite commonly expressed by hydrologists in terms of water depth as one can easily obtain energy by multiplying water depth with the latent heat of vaporization in fact the hargreaves and samani 1982 method expresses pet in terms of water depth thus we have used a definition of pet that is widely accepted in the hydrologic science community the partitioning of w into effective rainfall e r and rainfall loss r l is done due to the interaction between w and h the er is defined here as rainfall that is left to flow in the stream after evapotranspiration the er and rl are the fractions of w which produces streamflow and evapotranspiration at the basin respectively at any instant of time t the partitioning of w is done by using instantaneous dryness index φ proposed by biswal 2016 1 e r t w t f φ t where f φ is the budyko function which is given as f φ 1 φ t a n h φ 1 1 e φ 0 5 the eq 1 is considered as similar to the long term hydrologic partitioning based on budyko function gerrits et al 2009 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 which is expressed as q r f ϕ where q and r are long term mean streamflow and rainfall respectively ϕ is the dryness index of the basin which is expressed as ratio of the mean pet to mean r for the sake of demonstration original budyko function is used it is however possible to use other forms of budyko model daly et al 2019 donohue et al 2012 wang and tang 2014 here φ is defined as dryness index at a given point of time and once the value of φ is determined we can perform hydrological partitioning at any given time using eq 1 biswal 2016 expressed φ as a function of antecedent w and h φ t f h t f w t where fw t t n w τ 1 0 4 t τ d τ and fh t t n h τ 1 0 4 t τ d τ where τ is the dummy variable the method essentially suggests that the effects of w and h on the dryness state of the catchment diminishes with time following a universal decay function x t x 0 1 0 4 t where x t is the available quantity at time t from the original quantity x 0 here n is the number of days for which the effects of w and h on dryness state of the basin persists which is considered to be 365 biswal 2016 note that if φ is higher a greater fraction of rainfall will be evaporated and vice versa the budyko equation is used to express rainfall partitioning as a function of φ because it correctly describes the limits the ratio of effective rainfall to rainfall ranges between 0 and 1 eventually streamflow at the basin outlet can be computed from er by using the decay function biswal 2016 where er decays to produce streamflow and with assumption that the principle of superposition is valid 2 q t d dt t 0 e r τ 1 0 4 t τ d τ the model equations in their discrete forms and the step by step procedure for streamflow simulation at daily timestep are given in the flow chart of fig 2 along with the methodology flowchart fig 3 there are similarities between the db model and other hydrological models for example both the db model and the scs model use the proportionality concept for partitioning rainfall also see wang and tang 2014 being a zero parameter model the db model can predict streamflow in ungauged basins where no regionalization based models are available andréassian et al 2014 perrin et al 2008 the model was verified for 63 basins in the usa biswal 2016 and 108 basins in india patnaik et al 2019 a recent study compared the db model with a well known regionalization based model in 40 basins situated across southern india nag and biswal 2019 and found that it is useful particularly in regions with low streamflow gauging station density nag and biswal 2019 overall the db model s performance can be considered to be reasonable if we take into account the fact that the model has been designed especially for prediction in ungauged basins nag and biswal 2019 patnaik et al 2019 although there are models that do not require streamflow for calibration donohue et al 2012 they have their own limitations like difficulty in measurement of parameters 2 3 relationship between φ and soil moisture rainfall wets a basin whereas solar energy expressed in terms of pet causes dryness if h is zero in the zone 2 of a basin soil moisture will attain the field capacity value however if h is added to the system soil moisture content will fall below the field capacity similarly h will not be utilized if there is no moisture available in zone 2 biswal 2016 assumed that hydrologic partitioning eq 1 would be determined by how antecedent w and h inputs interact with each other and cause soil moisture deficit in zone 2 at a given time however the description provided by biswal 2016 is not only hypothetical but also it does not involve measurable in this study we begin with the hypothesis that hydrological partitioning is primarily governed by soil moisture we investigate the relationship between φ and gldas derived θ since the db model uses a single mathematical expression to compute φ from antecedent rainfall and pet inputs for every catchment one may wonder if there is a universal relationship between φ and soil moisture thus we focus on checking if there is a common relationship between φ and θ following the least square regression method and considering data points from all the 60 study basins together such a regression equation between φ and θ can help us to directly use soil moisture information for streamflow modelling we are therefore interested to compare the modified db model that uses the universal φ θ regression equation to simulate streamflow denoted as dbu with the original db model section 2 2 furthermore to fully exploit soil moisture information for streamflow simulation we optimize the parameters of φ θ regression model for each basin this modified db model is denoted as dbbs by applying the genetic algorithm to minimize the root mean square error rmse the performance of each model is quantified in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and r2 note that in the original formation of the db model it is assumed that φ is mainly controlled by the soil moisture deficit smd here we interpret smd as the quantity of soil moisture required to bring back actual soil moisture to saturation soil moisture we therefore tried to investigate if there is a universal relationship between φ and smd for calculating smd saturated soil moisture content porosity of the 60 basins is obtained from the mopex data base the data from 60 basins are considered together to establish a common relationship between φ and smd following the least square regression φ smd relationship is used in the db model hereafter called dbusmd to simulate streamflow and then we tried to compare the performance of the db model with dbusmd model 2 4 influence of catchment characteristics on model performance one of the objectives of this research is to investigate how different catchment characteristics determine the change in nse due to the use of satellite based soil moisture data we thus compare nses of the dbu dbbs and dbusmd models with that of the db model hence the catchment characteristics data were obtained from the hydrologic database falcone et al 2010 the simple linear regression method was employed to find out the coefficient of determination r2 of the relationship between each considered catchment characteristic and change in nse for every 60 basins using the dbu and dbusmd model to dodge large negative nse values influencing our regression analysis a transformed nse nse is used here which ranges between 0 and 1 3 nse 1 e e x p n s e initially 20 catchment characteristics were considered for the simple linear regression analysis these catchment characteristics are classified based on soil topography geology hydrology and geographical location finally a total of 11 and 12 catchment characteristics were selected r2 0 05 and p 0 05 for further analysis of the study which is given in table 1 and table 2 respectively for the dbu and dbusmd model patnaik et al 2018 2015 r2 value suggests that the improvement of the model results might have physical relation in general latitude longitude average clay silt and sand content available water capacity drainage area and forest area shows a good relationship with the change in nse however to understand this relationship in more detail we performed multiple linear regression mlr analysis because there is a possibility of interaction among the catchment characteristics due to multicollinearity among the characteristics principal component analysis was performed to make them mutually independent with each other first the catchment characteristics were standardized by subtracting their mean and then dividing by its standard deviation secondly the catchment characteristics of the basins were transformed into a set of principal components because it is found that many characteristics are correlated with each other abdi and williams 2010 brown 1993 using principal component analysis a set of mutually dependent catchment characteristics is converted into a set of principal components which are independent of each other finally mlr analysis was performed between the nse dbu nse db nse dbbs nse db nse dbusmd nse db and principal components the equations are given as 4 ns e d b u n s e d b β 0 i 1 z β i p c i 5 ns e d b bs n s e d b β 0 i 1 z β i p c i 6 ns e d b usmd n s e d b β 0 i 1 z β i p c i where β 0 and β i are intercept and linear coefficients respectively z is the number of principal components which is 11 for eqs 4 and 5 and 12 for eq 6 the coefficients from the mlr are transformed into the original domain to obtain the coefficients of the variables based on the sign of the coefficients of the characteristics the directions of influence of the catchment characteristics on the performance of the models are obtained since our main aim here is to identify the catchment characteristics which are influencing the model performance β 0 is not considered in the analysis 3 results and discussion fig 4 shows the scatter plots between φ simulated by the db model and θ derived by gldas for four sample basins the relationship between φ and θ appears to be exponential of the type 7 φ a e b θ the values of a and b have been obtained following the least square regression method the coefficient of determination r2 values for the sample basins range between 0 21 and 0 33 which are statistically significant p value 0 05 the ranges of a and b respectively are 19 56 to 23 51 and 0 011 to 0 01 these plots therefore seem to suggest that there is some dependency between φ and θ however to explore the strength of φ and surface soil moisture w we investigated the relationships between φ and w it is observed that for each basin the relationship between φ and w is also exponential but weaker in general compared to the φ θ relationship see fig 5 which strengthens the hypothesis that θ is the key determinant of hydrological partitioning if we come back to the earlier question that the relationship between φ and θ can be assumed to be reasonably one to one or universal if we have a universal relationship φ θ we can predict θ in regions without reliable soil moisture data for various practical applications such as flood and drought management das and maity 2015 pal et al 2017 sawada and koike 2016 for φ and θ to have a perfectly one to one relationship the individual plots need to show the same set of a and b values and r2 needs to be 1 in each case of course this is not the case see fig 4 due to errors in the estimation of either φ by db model θ by gldas or both moreover there might be a possibility of model s structural uncertainty which gives rise to the scatter the scatter plot fig 6 between φ and θ considers all the data points from all the 60 study basins the 95 confidence interval of a and b are found to be 89 67 1 09 and 0 01517 0 00004 respectively and r2 is 0 5 it should be noted that for 53 study basins r2 of the individual φ θ scatter plot is smaller than the r2 of the combined scatter plot 0 5 which means the notion that there is a universal relationship between φ and θ is quite reasonable the reasoning is that if the relationship is not one to one individual φ θ scatter plots will show stronger relationships see biswal and nagesh kumar 2014 biswal and marani 2014 2010 however because the individual φ θ scatter do not show very similar a and b values we should attempt to exploit soil moisture information to the fullest by calibrating the parameters for each basin whenever data is available note that calibration of a and b requires soil moisture as well as discharge data given that there is a one to one exponential type relationship between φ and θ it is possible to use θ information directly to predict φ at a given time eq 7 and subsequently perform hydrological partitioning using eq 1 moreover the relationship between φ and smd for every basin is found to be exponential type and opposite of the φ θ individual relationship which is shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it is observed that r2 values of the φ smd for the four sample basins are exactly the same as r2 of the φ θ see fig 4 relationships however for five basins out of 60 basins r2 values of φ smd are not the same as that of φ θ relationships where the soil moisture content of the particular basins exceeded the corresponding saturated soil moisture content value may be because of errors in soil moisture and or soil moisture at saturation data further data from the 60 basins are used together to obtain a common relationship between φ and smd universal relationship following the least square regression which is shown in fig 8 it is observed from fig 8 that r2 of φ smd universal relationship is 0 46 which is lesser than r2 0 5 of φ θ universal relation the 95 confidence interval of parameters a and b is 0 1036 0 0007 and 0 014022 0 00004 the box plot fig 9 shows the values of nse of streamflow simulated by the db dbu dbbs and dbusmd models for 60 basins it is observed from fig 9 that the dbu and dbusmd model performed similar to the db model in terms of median nse s whereas these models performed better in terms of mean nse s when compared to the db model as the interquartile ranges of the dbu and dbusmd model are smaller than that of the db model imply that the variation of the models performance is lesser as compared to the db model this suggests relatively higher performance improvements of the dbu and dbusmd model for some of the basins moreover it is observed from fig 9 that the mean and median nse of the dbbs model are better than the other models indicate that overall the dbbs model outperformed the other models the change in nse values of streamflow simulations using dbu dbbs and dbusmd model comparison to the db model for the 60 basins are shown in fig 10 a b and c respectively from fig 10 a and c it is observed that using dbu and dbusmd model for streamflow simulation there is an improvement in nse for 34 and 33 basins as compared to the db model which implies that dbu and dbusmd model is better at capturing θ than the db model for these basins further it is observed that using the dbbs model for simulation of streamflow there is the improvement of nse for 51 basins fig 10b out of 60 basins considered for the study however the basins where the nse values are deteriorated implies that the db model captures θ better than the modified db dbu dbbs and dbusmd model moreover from fig 10 a b and c the basins for which the change in nse values are positive suggest that the soil moisture information is going to be useful for the streamflow simulation the basins for which the change in nse is negative suggest that soil moisture information might not be helpful to improve the streamflow simulation the performance index in terms of nse actual value of all the models is shown in table s1 the db model performance is affected by both the uncertainty in the data and the model however to understand how the performance of the dbu model affected by the quality of the soil moisture data we have considered uncertainty in the soil moisture data not in the model thus we added 10 error to the observed soil moisture data which is assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean wherever soil moisture came as negative manually adjusted to zero value then we used the dbu model to simulate streamflow hereafter called dbue and compared the performance with the dbu model which is shown in fig 9 from fig 11 it is observed that except for a few basins the model performance in terms of nse decreased when compared to the dbu model so here it can be argued that how the erroneous soil moisture data helped in improving the model performance for very few basins it might be possible that the error added in the soil moisture data played a role of the correction factor which helped in improving the model performance when a model systematically under predicts or over predicts we however are emphasizing that error cannot be added to improve the model performance our only intention here was to demonstrate that the erroneous soil moisture data can influence the performance of the dbu model due to brevity results of 20 basins are shown here however for all the basins fig s1 can be referred which is provided in the supporting information the scatter plots between streamflow simulated by the db dbu dbbs and dbusmd model and observed streamflow are shown in fig 12 for a random sample basin it is observed from fig 12 a that the db model over predicted the observed flow but some of the high flows are predicted quite well on the other hand the dbbs model see fig 12c under predicted the observed flow particularly the high flows and dbusmd model see fig 12c over predicted the low and medium flows overall the dbu model predicted quite well the observed flow especially the low and medium flows it is quite obvious that the db model performance might have influenced by certain catchment characteristics due to incorporation of the soil moisture han et al 2018 however we would like to mention that our aim here is to find out the major catchment characteristics which influence the model performance and based on these characteristics it is possible to know in advance whether a particular soil moisture product is useful or not even without running the model our overall goal is to provide a framework to determine the usefulness of remotely based soil moisture data as mentioned earlier an mlr analysis was performed between the observed change in nse and catchment characteristics eqs 4 5 and 6 fig 13 a b and c shows r2 between observed and mlr modelled change in nse for the dbu dbbs and dbusmd model with respect to the db model which is found to be 0 60 0 61 and 0 67 respectively from fig 13 it is observed that change in nse is predicted quite well for all cases however slightly higher r2 value observed in case of the dbusmd model which is shown in fig 13 c that means the performance of the dbusmd model is more predictable although it is observed that the dbusmd model slightly underperformed than the dbu model see fig 9 φ smd universal relation can be used to predict the change in nse here the change in nse is predicted following the mlr analysis between catchment characteristics considered and the observed change in nse although we have assumed a linear relationship between catchment characteristics and the change in nse there might be a non linear relationship existing between them the list of catchment characteristics which affect the model performance like nse dbu nse db nse dbbs nse db and nse dbusmd nse db model in positive performance improvement and negative performance deterioration direction are shown in tables 3 5 respectively from the tables 3 and 5 it is observed that some common characteristics which affect the improvement of the model performance in the positive direction are available water capacity maximum basin elevation drainage area forest area and agricultural area in the positive direction and average sand silt and clay content latitude and longitude in the negative direction the characteristics are listed in tables 3 5 in descending order according to their magnitude of influence the consistently positive influence of available water capacity and forest area suggest that these characteristics play a vital role in controlling the improvement of the model performance than the other characteristics similarly average sand silt and clay content latitude and longitude affect the model performance in the negative direction than the other characteristics however from table 4 it is understood that average sand silt and clay content along with available water capacity and forest area influence the model performance in the positive direction and longitude latitude in the negative direction in case of the basin specific φ θ relations here we observed that the catchment characteristics such as average sand silt and clay content influenced the model performance in the positive direction in contrast to φ θ and φ smd universal relations see table 3 and table 5 similarly agricultural area influenced the model performance in the negative direction instead of the positive direction since φ θ basin specific relations are developed by minimizing the rmse of streamflow that could be the reason why the catchment characteristics changed the direction of influence overall saturated overland flow maximum basin elevation and agricultural area influence the model performance in the positive and negative directions suggest that these characteristics may not have a significant impact on the db model performance as the parameters a and b of the eq 7 are correlated fig 14 also for related discussion see dralle et al 2015 they are expected to have common physical origins thus we have investigated only how catchment characteristics influence b once the exponent is predicted from catchment characteristics the coefficient can be predicted from the corresponding predicted exponent value the relation between the coefficient and exponent is found be of exponentially increasing type a me bn the 95 confidence interval of the parameter m is 1 6526 0 2906 and n is 239 25 8 27 we considered eight catchment characteristics r2 0 05 for the stepwise mlr analysis to understand the catchment characteristics that mainly control the exponent b of the eq 7 table 6 shows the final coefficients in the stepwise mlr model and the corresponding p value along with cumulative r2 only five out of the eight catchment characteristics show a significant correlation with parameter b at the significance level of 5 identification of the main controlling factors of b only through r2 may not be proper because these catchment characteristics are not independent of each other hence p value is used to avoid this issue bai et al 2020 according to the magnitude of the coefficient of the catchment characteristics of the mlr analysis the dunne overland flow urban area horton overland flow forest area and agricultural area are five main factors that influence b these five catchment characteristics explain 83 of the variability in parameter b whereas the remaining catchment characteristics only explain 6 of the variability hence it can be concluded that the vegetation and the runoff generation mechanism of a basin mainly control b r2 between the observed b and the predicted b of the mlr analysis is found to be pretty good which is shown in fig 15 from the foregoing discussions the soil moisture data is found to be useful for most of the basins for improving the performance this suggests that data assimilation using the soil moisture as the state variable may help to improve the model simulations although we have not used any advanced data assimilation da technique like ensemble kalman filter in our study to assimilate the observed soil moisture the empirical relationship used in this study directly incorporates the soil moisture θ and smd into the db model helps the model achieve a better performance and is a motivating evidence for the smda the relationship will also help assimilate observed soil moisture into the model using any da techniques also the smda for a particular basin is going to be useful or not can be known in advance before using the model from the information provided by the catchment characteristics analysis results presented in tables 3 5 as only catchment characteristics data is required to know the benefit of the soil moisture information our framework is suitable especially for ungauged basins for the ungauged basin the dbu model can be used to predict streamflow as it does not require observed streamflow data for the calibration although in the current study our framework has considered the db model for any hydrological model our framework can be implemented if we can develop a relationship between soil moisture and any of the state variables see fig 3 a few studies have been conducted in the past to link dryness index with long term soil moisture daly et al 2019 porporato et al 2004 which may provide some insights to explore the physical relationship between φ and soil moisture 4 conclusions the study revealed that there is an appreciable relationship between φ and θ r2 0 5 which implies that the model captures the soil moisture dynamics quite well for most of the basins for the same reason we also observed a statistically significant relationship between φ and smd r2 0 46 once we have established the relationship between φ and θ or φ and smd satellite based or in situ soil moisture information can be assimilated for streamflow prediction our study finds θ obtained from gldas to be useful for streamflow simulation in a majority of the basins furthermore improvement of the model performance due to the use of the satellite based soil moisture data is found to be influenced by several catchment characteristics this indicates that for any hydrological model our framework can be implemented to determine if the assimilation of the soil moisture data is going to be helpful for a catchment or not by merely looking its catchment characteristics it was also found that catchment characteristics such as vegetation and runoff generation mechanism primarily control the parameters a and b since our study considered only 60 usa basins due to resource constraints further investigation may be required to evaluate the hypothesis that a reasonably good universal relationship exists between φ and θ a universal φ θ relation can help us solve the problem of ungauged basins as we do not need discharge data to calibrate the model further investigation also needs to be carried out to address the following limitations of our study i it is likely that some of the important catchment characteristics have not been taken into account here ii our study has ignored the possibility of a non linear relationship between catchment characteristics and the improvement of model performance due to soil moisture incorporation and iii the soil moisture data we have used might not be of very good quality

4766,soil moisture plays an important role in partitioning rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration due to advancements in remotely sensed soil moisture data acquisition techniques many soil moisture data assimilation smda studies have been conducted to improve streamflow prediction it is thus expected that the outcome of a smda exercise will be determined by the quality of soil moisture data in hand and the hydrology of the catchment our study begins with the hypothesis that it is possible to determine the usefulness of a satellite based soil moisture data product for areas where paramaterizing a complex model is difficult due to availability of limited information to this end we use satellite based gldas root zone soil moisture data with dynamic budyko db rainfall runoff model to improve streamflow prediction for 60 us basins our results suggest that there is a reasonably good one to one or universal relationship between instantaneous dryness index φ the key state variable of the db model and root zone soil moisture θ which implies that the model can directly use soil moisture information for predicting streamflow to check the robustness of the universal φ θ relationship we also developed basin specific φ θ relationships model performance expressed in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse improved in 34 basins when we considered the universal φ θ relationship and in 51 basins when we considered the basin specific relationships multiple linear regression mlr analysis reveals that change in nse due to the use of soil moisture information is predicted quite well by certain basin characteristics in particular it is found that available water capacity and forest area positively influence nse whereas average sand silt and clay contents latitude and longitude affect it negatively a slightly stronger mlr relationship was observed while considering soil moisture deficit the difference between saturated soil moisture and actual soil moisture in place of soil moisture from the stepwise mlr analysis it is observed that the vegetation and runoff generation mechanism control the parameters of the φ θ relationship overall our study provides a framework to determine the suitability of remotely based soil moisture data for hydrological modelling keywords root zone soil moisture instantaneous dryness index dynamic budyko model catchment characteristics 1 introduction soil moisture is the fundamental variable of the hydrologic cycle which partitions rainfall into evaporation and runoff brocca et al 2017 2012 2010 massari et al 2015 an actual estimation of soil moisture facilitates improved streamflow prediction many studies have proved that antecedent soil moisture of a basin strongly affects the response of the basin coustau et al 2013 tramblay et al 2012 the in situ soil moisture measurement is generally done at point scale for many practical or hydrological modelling purposes soil moisture at basin scale is required singh et al 2019 thus soil moisture at point scale is necessary to be scaled up the up scaling process is generally associated with uncertainties due to the high spatial variability of soil moisture on the other hand accurate measurement of soil moisture being a difficult task the availability of high resolution data at both spatial and temporal scales bartalis et al 2007 entekhabi et al 2010 kerr et al 2010 owe et al 2008 enhanced application of remotely sensed soil moisture data in hydrological modelling especially in soil moisture data assimilation smda aubert et al 2003 brocca et al 2012 2010 crow and ryu 2008 lievens et al 2015 massari et al 2015 the smda merges information among observed data and model forecasted value to update the model state towards the unknown true value typically the state variables of a hydrological model are related to the corresponding satellite derived variables for this purpose alvarez garreton et al 2015 patil and ramsankaran 2018 2017 it is therefore logical to expect that the performance of such a hydrological model will depend primarily on the quality of the available soil moisture data brocca et al 2013 assimilated remotely sensed soil moisture into misdc hydrological model for five basins in italy luxembourg france and the usa they found no improvements in model simulation particularly in mountainous and snow dominated regions however in dry climates they found an improvements in runoff simulations they concluded that the reliability of the model depends on the accuracy of satellite data and climatic regions matgen et al 2012 used bibmodel to assimilate satellite derived soil moisture and found no improvements in model prediction using satellite data on the other hand alvarez garreton et al 2015 assimilated satellite derived observed soil moisture data into a hydrological model in a semi arid catchment they found improvement in the model prediction due to the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture data corato et al 2014 assimilated remotely sensed soil moisture data into a model for a catchment located in the uk they observed that the assimilation performance depends on vegetation and time of the year for which satellite data is being assimilated overall the smda is not equally beneficial in every part of the world although there are other methodological issues existed in the smda physical and hydro climatological characteristics of basins are vital factors that may affect the smda using satellite data massari et al 2015 hence it is necessary to find out dominant catchment characteristics that mainly affect the model performance for a particular satellite based soil moisture product due to the limited information available in many parts of the world water resources management using a complex hydrological model pose a challenging task chen et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2013 razavi et al 2013 yaşar and baykan 2013 therefore in this study we focus on developing a simple and effective framework to assess the suitability of remote sensing based gldas soil moisture data for streamflow prediction for the areas where limited information is available with the help of dynamic budyko db rainfall runoff model biswal 2016 in 60 usgs basins it is hypothesized that the only state variable of the model instantaneous dryness index φ is a function of soil moisture accordingly the objectives of the study are formulated as follows a to establish a relationship between φ and observed soil moisture and b to identify the catchment characteristics that primarily influence the model performance in the next section we provide a detailed description about the methodologies involved in this study 2 data and methods 2 1 study basins and data the daily root zone soil moisture θ data from 1948 to 2000 and surface soil moisture data from 1990 to 2002 were obtained from the global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas and european space agency climate change initiative esacci respectively the surface and root zone soil moisture correspond to a vertical depth of soil about 0 5 to 2 cm and 100 cm respectively the daily rainfall pet and discharge data along with porosity values for the basins were obtained from the mopex database duan et al 2006 for this study 60 mopex reference basins were selected based on the following criteria basins with i snowmelt contribution less than 25 of the total flow falcone et al 2010 ii continuous availability of rainfall and pet data from 1948 to 1975 and iii rainfall pet and discharge data for at least continuous four years during 1976 to 2000 except for the soil moisture data 0 25 0 25 all other data are lumped data the area of the basins varies from 66 56 to 8150 73 km2 the location of the gauging stations considered for the study is shown in fig 1 2 2 the dynamic budyko db model the db model is a calibration free rainfall runoff model that simulates streamflow on a daily basis it uses a dryness index based budyko function budyko 1974 to compute runoff the dryness index explicitly represents the long term average dryness state of the soil and implicitly represents the long term average soil moisture state han et al 2018 and often it is called as aridity index the budyko framework is suitable for timescales for which change in storage is negligible in the mass balance equation ds dt i q this condition is more likely to be satisfied if the timescale is larger than a year gerrits et al 2009 thus the variables of the budyko function are computed at a long timescale the db model on the other hand has been developed for hydrological partitioning at small timescales it conceptualizes a river basin into two hypothetical zones zone 1 and zone 2 in zone 1 rainfall r satisfies the pet of the basin and if r p e t the remaining water w enters the zone 2 and if r p e t then the remaining energy h enters zone 2 mathematically w is defined as w t r t p e t t if r t p e t t else w t 0 and h is defined as h t p e t t r t if p e t t r t else h t 0 thus zone 1 produces evapotranspiration et only and zone 2 produces both et and q which is realistic as it produces no q for very low intensity rainfall although the zone 1 and zone 2 are considered as hypothetical layers in the original framework of the db model physically these zones can be interpreted as two soil layers which correspond to the top few centimeters of depth 2 5 cm and root zone layer up to 100 cm respectively pet is quite commonly expressed by hydrologists in terms of water depth as one can easily obtain energy by multiplying water depth with the latent heat of vaporization in fact the hargreaves and samani 1982 method expresses pet in terms of water depth thus we have used a definition of pet that is widely accepted in the hydrologic science community the partitioning of w into effective rainfall e r and rainfall loss r l is done due to the interaction between w and h the er is defined here as rainfall that is left to flow in the stream after evapotranspiration the er and rl are the fractions of w which produces streamflow and evapotranspiration at the basin respectively at any instant of time t the partitioning of w is done by using instantaneous dryness index φ proposed by biswal 2016 1 e r t w t f φ t where f φ is the budyko function which is given as f φ 1 φ t a n h φ 1 1 e φ 0 5 the eq 1 is considered as similar to the long term hydrologic partitioning based on budyko function gerrits et al 2009 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 which is expressed as q r f ϕ where q and r are long term mean streamflow and rainfall respectively ϕ is the dryness index of the basin which is expressed as ratio of the mean pet to mean r for the sake of demonstration original budyko function is used it is however possible to use other forms of budyko model daly et al 2019 donohue et al 2012 wang and tang 2014 here φ is defined as dryness index at a given point of time and once the value of φ is determined we can perform hydrological partitioning at any given time using eq 1 biswal 2016 expressed φ as a function of antecedent w and h φ t f h t f w t where fw t t n w τ 1 0 4 t τ d τ and fh t t n h τ 1 0 4 t τ d τ where τ is the dummy variable the method essentially suggests that the effects of w and h on the dryness state of the catchment diminishes with time following a universal decay function x t x 0 1 0 4 t where x t is the available quantity at time t from the original quantity x 0 here n is the number of days for which the effects of w and h on dryness state of the basin persists which is considered to be 365 biswal 2016 note that if φ is higher a greater fraction of rainfall will be evaporated and vice versa the budyko equation is used to express rainfall partitioning as a function of φ because it correctly describes the limits the ratio of effective rainfall to rainfall ranges between 0 and 1 eventually streamflow at the basin outlet can be computed from er by using the decay function biswal 2016 where er decays to produce streamflow and with assumption that the principle of superposition is valid 2 q t d dt t 0 e r τ 1 0 4 t τ d τ the model equations in their discrete forms and the step by step procedure for streamflow simulation at daily timestep are given in the flow chart of fig 2 along with the methodology flowchart fig 3 there are similarities between the db model and other hydrological models for example both the db model and the scs model use the proportionality concept for partitioning rainfall also see wang and tang 2014 being a zero parameter model the db model can predict streamflow in ungauged basins where no regionalization based models are available andréassian et al 2014 perrin et al 2008 the model was verified for 63 basins in the usa biswal 2016 and 108 basins in india patnaik et al 2019 a recent study compared the db model with a well known regionalization based model in 40 basins situated across southern india nag and biswal 2019 and found that it is useful particularly in regions with low streamflow gauging station density nag and biswal 2019 overall the db model s performance can be considered to be reasonable if we take into account the fact that the model has been designed especially for prediction in ungauged basins nag and biswal 2019 patnaik et al 2019 although there are models that do not require streamflow for calibration donohue et al 2012 they have their own limitations like difficulty in measurement of parameters 2 3 relationship between φ and soil moisture rainfall wets a basin whereas solar energy expressed in terms of pet causes dryness if h is zero in the zone 2 of a basin soil moisture will attain the field capacity value however if h is added to the system soil moisture content will fall below the field capacity similarly h will not be utilized if there is no moisture available in zone 2 biswal 2016 assumed that hydrologic partitioning eq 1 would be determined by how antecedent w and h inputs interact with each other and cause soil moisture deficit in zone 2 at a given time however the description provided by biswal 2016 is not only hypothetical but also it does not involve measurable in this study we begin with the hypothesis that hydrological partitioning is primarily governed by soil moisture we investigate the relationship between φ and gldas derived θ since the db model uses a single mathematical expression to compute φ from antecedent rainfall and pet inputs for every catchment one may wonder if there is a universal relationship between φ and soil moisture thus we focus on checking if there is a common relationship between φ and θ following the least square regression method and considering data points from all the 60 study basins together such a regression equation between φ and θ can help us to directly use soil moisture information for streamflow modelling we are therefore interested to compare the modified db model that uses the universal φ θ regression equation to simulate streamflow denoted as dbu with the original db model section 2 2 furthermore to fully exploit soil moisture information for streamflow simulation we optimize the parameters of φ θ regression model for each basin this modified db model is denoted as dbbs by applying the genetic algorithm to minimize the root mean square error rmse the performance of each model is quantified in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and r2 note that in the original formation of the db model it is assumed that φ is mainly controlled by the soil moisture deficit smd here we interpret smd as the quantity of soil moisture required to bring back actual soil moisture to saturation soil moisture we therefore tried to investigate if there is a universal relationship between φ and smd for calculating smd saturated soil moisture content porosity of the 60 basins is obtained from the mopex data base the data from 60 basins are considered together to establish a common relationship between φ and smd following the least square regression φ smd relationship is used in the db model hereafter called dbusmd to simulate streamflow and then we tried to compare the performance of the db model with dbusmd model 2 4 influence of catchment characteristics on model performance one of the objectives of this research is to investigate how different catchment characteristics determine the change in nse due to the use of satellite based soil moisture data we thus compare nses of the dbu dbbs and dbusmd models with that of the db model hence the catchment characteristics data were obtained from the hydrologic database falcone et al 2010 the simple linear regression method was employed to find out the coefficient of determination r2 of the relationship between each considered catchment characteristic and change in nse for every 60 basins using the dbu and dbusmd model to dodge large negative nse values influencing our regression analysis a transformed nse nse is used here which ranges between 0 and 1 3 nse 1 e e x p n s e initially 20 catchment characteristics were considered for the simple linear regression analysis these catchment characteristics are classified based on soil topography geology hydrology and geographical location finally a total of 11 and 12 catchment characteristics were selected r2 0 05 and p 0 05 for further analysis of the study which is given in table 1 and table 2 respectively for the dbu and dbusmd model patnaik et al 2018 2015 r2 value suggests that the improvement of the model results might have physical relation in general latitude longitude average clay silt and sand content available water capacity drainage area and forest area shows a good relationship with the change in nse however to understand this relationship in more detail we performed multiple linear regression mlr analysis because there is a possibility of interaction among the catchment characteristics due to multicollinearity among the characteristics principal component analysis was performed to make them mutually independent with each other first the catchment characteristics were standardized by subtracting their mean and then dividing by its standard deviation secondly the catchment characteristics of the basins were transformed into a set of principal components because it is found that many characteristics are correlated with each other abdi and williams 2010 brown 1993 using principal component analysis a set of mutually dependent catchment characteristics is converted into a set of principal components which are independent of each other finally mlr analysis was performed between the nse dbu nse db nse dbbs nse db nse dbusmd nse db and principal components the equations are given as 4 ns e d b u n s e d b β 0 i 1 z β i p c i 5 ns e d b bs n s e d b β 0 i 1 z β i p c i 6 ns e d b usmd n s e d b β 0 i 1 z β i p c i where β 0 and β i are intercept and linear coefficients respectively z is the number of principal components which is 11 for eqs 4 and 5 and 12 for eq 6 the coefficients from the mlr are transformed into the original domain to obtain the coefficients of the variables based on the sign of the coefficients of the characteristics the directions of influence of the catchment characteristics on the performance of the models are obtained since our main aim here is to identify the catchment characteristics which are influencing the model performance β 0 is not considered in the analysis 3 results and discussion fig 4 shows the scatter plots between φ simulated by the db model and θ derived by gldas for four sample basins the relationship between φ and θ appears to be exponential of the type 7 φ a e b θ the values of a and b have been obtained following the least square regression method the coefficient of determination r2 values for the sample basins range between 0 21 and 0 33 which are statistically significant p value 0 05 the ranges of a and b respectively are 19 56 to 23 51 and 0 011 to 0 01 these plots therefore seem to suggest that there is some dependency between φ and θ however to explore the strength of φ and surface soil moisture w we investigated the relationships between φ and w it is observed that for each basin the relationship between φ and w is also exponential but weaker in general compared to the φ θ relationship see fig 5 which strengthens the hypothesis that θ is the key determinant of hydrological partitioning if we come back to the earlier question that the relationship between φ and θ can be assumed to be reasonably one to one or universal if we have a universal relationship φ θ we can predict θ in regions without reliable soil moisture data for various practical applications such as flood and drought management das and maity 2015 pal et al 2017 sawada and koike 2016 for φ and θ to have a perfectly one to one relationship the individual plots need to show the same set of a and b values and r2 needs to be 1 in each case of course this is not the case see fig 4 due to errors in the estimation of either φ by db model θ by gldas or both moreover there might be a possibility of model s structural uncertainty which gives rise to the scatter the scatter plot fig 6 between φ and θ considers all the data points from all the 60 study basins the 95 confidence interval of a and b are found to be 89 67 1 09 and 0 01517 0 00004 respectively and r2 is 0 5 it should be noted that for 53 study basins r2 of the individual φ θ scatter plot is smaller than the r2 of the combined scatter plot 0 5 which means the notion that there is a universal relationship between φ and θ is quite reasonable the reasoning is that if the relationship is not one to one individual φ θ scatter plots will show stronger relationships see biswal and nagesh kumar 2014 biswal and marani 2014 2010 however because the individual φ θ scatter do not show very similar a and b values we should attempt to exploit soil moisture information to the fullest by calibrating the parameters for each basin whenever data is available note that calibration of a and b requires soil moisture as well as discharge data given that there is a one to one exponential type relationship between φ and θ it is possible to use θ information directly to predict φ at a given time eq 7 and subsequently perform hydrological partitioning using eq 1 moreover the relationship between φ and smd for every basin is found to be exponential type and opposite of the φ θ individual relationship which is shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it is observed that r2 values of the φ smd for the four sample basins are exactly the same as r2 of the φ θ see fig 4 relationships however for five basins out of 60 basins r2 values of φ smd are not the same as that of φ θ relationships where the soil moisture content of the particular basins exceeded the corresponding saturated soil moisture content value may be because of errors in soil moisture and or soil moisture at saturation data further data from the 60 basins are used together to obtain a common relationship between φ and smd universal relationship following the least square regression which is shown in fig 8 it is observed from fig 8 that r2 of φ smd universal relationship is 0 46 which is lesser than r2 0 5 of φ θ universal relation the 95 confidence interval of parameters a and b is 0 1036 0 0007 and 0 014022 0 00004 the box plot fig 9 shows the values of nse of streamflow simulated by the db dbu dbbs and dbusmd models for 60 basins it is observed from fig 9 that the dbu and dbusmd model performed similar to the db model in terms of median nse s whereas these models performed better in terms of mean nse s when compared to the db model as the interquartile ranges of the dbu and dbusmd model are smaller than that of the db model imply that the variation of the models performance is lesser as compared to the db model this suggests relatively higher performance improvements of the dbu and dbusmd model for some of the basins moreover it is observed from fig 9 that the mean and median nse of the dbbs model are better than the other models indicate that overall the dbbs model outperformed the other models the change in nse values of streamflow simulations using dbu dbbs and dbusmd model comparison to the db model for the 60 basins are shown in fig 10 a b and c respectively from fig 10 a and c it is observed that using dbu and dbusmd model for streamflow simulation there is an improvement in nse for 34 and 33 basins as compared to the db model which implies that dbu and dbusmd model is better at capturing θ than the db model for these basins further it is observed that using the dbbs model for simulation of streamflow there is the improvement of nse for 51 basins fig 10b out of 60 basins considered for the study however the basins where the nse values are deteriorated implies that the db model captures θ better than the modified db dbu dbbs and dbusmd model moreover from fig 10 a b and c the basins for which the change in nse values are positive suggest that the soil moisture information is going to be useful for the streamflow simulation the basins for which the change in nse is negative suggest that soil moisture information might not be helpful to improve the streamflow simulation the performance index in terms of nse actual value of all the models is shown in table s1 the db model performance is affected by both the uncertainty in the data and the model however to understand how the performance of the dbu model affected by the quality of the soil moisture data we have considered uncertainty in the soil moisture data not in the model thus we added 10 error to the observed soil moisture data which is assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean wherever soil moisture came as negative manually adjusted to zero value then we used the dbu model to simulate streamflow hereafter called dbue and compared the performance with the dbu model which is shown in fig 9 from fig 11 it is observed that except for a few basins the model performance in terms of nse decreased when compared to the dbu model so here it can be argued that how the erroneous soil moisture data helped in improving the model performance for very few basins it might be possible that the error added in the soil moisture data played a role of the correction factor which helped in improving the model performance when a model systematically under predicts or over predicts we however are emphasizing that error cannot be added to improve the model performance our only intention here was to demonstrate that the erroneous soil moisture data can influence the performance of the dbu model due to brevity results of 20 basins are shown here however for all the basins fig s1 can be referred which is provided in the supporting information the scatter plots between streamflow simulated by the db dbu dbbs and dbusmd model and observed streamflow are shown in fig 12 for a random sample basin it is observed from fig 12 a that the db model over predicted the observed flow but some of the high flows are predicted quite well on the other hand the dbbs model see fig 12c under predicted the observed flow particularly the high flows and dbusmd model see fig 12c over predicted the low and medium flows overall the dbu model predicted quite well the observed flow especially the low and medium flows it is quite obvious that the db model performance might have influenced by certain catchment characteristics due to incorporation of the soil moisture han et al 2018 however we would like to mention that our aim here is to find out the major catchment characteristics which influence the model performance and based on these characteristics it is possible to know in advance whether a particular soil moisture product is useful or not even without running the model our overall goal is to provide a framework to determine the usefulness of remotely based soil moisture data as mentioned earlier an mlr analysis was performed between the observed change in nse and catchment characteristics eqs 4 5 and 6 fig 13 a b and c shows r2 between observed and mlr modelled change in nse for the dbu dbbs and dbusmd model with respect to the db model which is found to be 0 60 0 61 and 0 67 respectively from fig 13 it is observed that change in nse is predicted quite well for all cases however slightly higher r2 value observed in case of the dbusmd model which is shown in fig 13 c that means the performance of the dbusmd model is more predictable although it is observed that the dbusmd model slightly underperformed than the dbu model see fig 9 φ smd universal relation can be used to predict the change in nse here the change in nse is predicted following the mlr analysis between catchment characteristics considered and the observed change in nse although we have assumed a linear relationship between catchment characteristics and the change in nse there might be a non linear relationship existing between them the list of catchment characteristics which affect the model performance like nse dbu nse db nse dbbs nse db and nse dbusmd nse db model in positive performance improvement and negative performance deterioration direction are shown in tables 3 5 respectively from the tables 3 and 5 it is observed that some common characteristics which affect the improvement of the model performance in the positive direction are available water capacity maximum basin elevation drainage area forest area and agricultural area in the positive direction and average sand silt and clay content latitude and longitude in the negative direction the characteristics are listed in tables 3 5 in descending order according to their magnitude of influence the consistently positive influence of available water capacity and forest area suggest that these characteristics play a vital role in controlling the improvement of the model performance than the other characteristics similarly average sand silt and clay content latitude and longitude affect the model performance in the negative direction than the other characteristics however from table 4 it is understood that average sand silt and clay content along with available water capacity and forest area influence the model performance in the positive direction and longitude latitude in the negative direction in case of the basin specific φ θ relations here we observed that the catchment characteristics such as average sand silt and clay content influenced the model performance in the positive direction in contrast to φ θ and φ smd universal relations see table 3 and table 5 similarly agricultural area influenced the model performance in the negative direction instead of the positive direction since φ θ basin specific relations are developed by minimizing the rmse of streamflow that could be the reason why the catchment characteristics changed the direction of influence overall saturated overland flow maximum basin elevation and agricultural area influence the model performance in the positive and negative directions suggest that these characteristics may not have a significant impact on the db model performance as the parameters a and b of the eq 7 are correlated fig 14 also for related discussion see dralle et al 2015 they are expected to have common physical origins thus we have investigated only how catchment characteristics influence b once the exponent is predicted from catchment characteristics the coefficient can be predicted from the corresponding predicted exponent value the relation between the coefficient and exponent is found be of exponentially increasing type a me bn the 95 confidence interval of the parameter m is 1 6526 0 2906 and n is 239 25 8 27 we considered eight catchment characteristics r2 0 05 for the stepwise mlr analysis to understand the catchment characteristics that mainly control the exponent b of the eq 7 table 6 shows the final coefficients in the stepwise mlr model and the corresponding p value along with cumulative r2 only five out of the eight catchment characteristics show a significant correlation with parameter b at the significance level of 5 identification of the main controlling factors of b only through r2 may not be proper because these catchment characteristics are not independent of each other hence p value is used to avoid this issue bai et al 2020 according to the magnitude of the coefficient of the catchment characteristics of the mlr analysis the dunne overland flow urban area horton overland flow forest area and agricultural area are five main factors that influence b these five catchment characteristics explain 83 of the variability in parameter b whereas the remaining catchment characteristics only explain 6 of the variability hence it can be concluded that the vegetation and the runoff generation mechanism of a basin mainly control b r2 between the observed b and the predicted b of the mlr analysis is found to be pretty good which is shown in fig 15 from the foregoing discussions the soil moisture data is found to be useful for most of the basins for improving the performance this suggests that data assimilation using the soil moisture as the state variable may help to improve the model simulations although we have not used any advanced data assimilation da technique like ensemble kalman filter in our study to assimilate the observed soil moisture the empirical relationship used in this study directly incorporates the soil moisture θ and smd into the db model helps the model achieve a better performance and is a motivating evidence for the smda the relationship will also help assimilate observed soil moisture into the model using any da techniques also the smda for a particular basin is going to be useful or not can be known in advance before using the model from the information provided by the catchment characteristics analysis results presented in tables 3 5 as only catchment characteristics data is required to know the benefit of the soil moisture information our framework is suitable especially for ungauged basins for the ungauged basin the dbu model can be used to predict streamflow as it does not require observed streamflow data for the calibration although in the current study our framework has considered the db model for any hydrological model our framework can be implemented if we can develop a relationship between soil moisture and any of the state variables see fig 3 a few studies have been conducted in the past to link dryness index with long term soil moisture daly et al 2019 porporato et al 2004 which may provide some insights to explore the physical relationship between φ and soil moisture 4 conclusions the study revealed that there is an appreciable relationship between φ and θ r2 0 5 which implies that the model captures the soil moisture dynamics quite well for most of the basins for the same reason we also observed a statistically significant relationship between φ and smd r2 0 46 once we have established the relationship between φ and θ or φ and smd satellite based or in situ soil moisture information can be assimilated for streamflow prediction our study finds θ obtained from gldas to be useful for streamflow simulation in a majority of the basins furthermore improvement of the model performance due to the use of the satellite based soil moisture data is found to be influenced by several catchment characteristics this indicates that for any hydrological model our framework can be implemented to determine if the assimilation of the soil moisture data is going to be helpful for a catchment or not by merely looking its catchment characteristics it was also found that catchment characteristics such as vegetation and runoff generation mechanism primarily control the parameters a and b since our study considered only 60 usa basins due to resource constraints further investigation may be required to evaluate the hypothesis that a reasonably good universal relationship exists between φ and θ a universal φ θ relation can help us solve the problem of ungauged basins as we do not need discharge data to calibrate the model further investigation also needs to be carried out to address the following limitations of our study i it is likely that some of the important catchment characteristics have not been taken into account here ii our study has ignored the possibility of a non linear relationship between catchment characteristics and the improvement of model performance due to soil moisture incorporation and iii the soil moisture data we have used might not be of very good quality

corresponding author at college of science and engineering flinders university australia college of science and engineering flinders university australia this manuscript was handled by c corradini editor in chief with the assistance of stephen worthington associate editor fresh groundwater lens dynamics and transition zone geometries on small tropical islands have been investigated in a wide range of geological environments however the understanding of multi aquifer fractured bedrock systems and how they respond to episodic wet season rainfall recharge is still limited this study used a comprehensive suite of isotopic tracers hydrogeological and near surface geophysical methods to characterise the multi layer aquifer system on milingimbi a small bedrock island located in the tropics of the arafura sea northern australia near surface geophysics was used to determine the subsurface structure of the aquifer including the spatial extent and thickness of the fresh groundwater lens and the shape of the transition zone pore water chloride profiles hydrochemistry and δ18o and δ2h data supported the geophysics results the lens was found to be 40 m thick on average with an up to 70 m thick transition zone underneath water level time series data over 4 years showed that there was a strong tidal signal observed in the groundwater wells screened in the deeper aquifer and that the aquifer system showed a dynamic response to the wet season rainfall time series chloride and δ18o and δ2h rainfall and production bore data suggest that there was a freshening i e lower salinity input of the lens as a result of recharge during the wet season which occurs up to 6 months after the event groundwater residence time indicators showed that the mean residence time in the lens was at least 25 years and the rate of recharge to the system was up to 200 mm y 1 the comprehensive data set which is rather unique in its wide range of methods that were applied resulted in a hydrogeological conceptual model of the multi layer bedrock aquifer system of the island that also provides insight into the fresh groundwater lens and the transition zone geometry of similar island aquifer systems

islands where groundwater is the main water resource werner et al 2013 werner 2017 white and falkland 2010 over the last 50 years a comprehensive knowledge base of atoll and barrier island hydrological processes and management approaches have been compiled falkland 1991 falkland 1993 roeper et al 2012 schneider and kruse 2006 werner et al 2017 an extensive range of studies have also been undertaken on volcanic islands for example in hawaii that have highlighted the strong influence of geological structures like low permeability strata and dikes on groundwater flow oki et al 1998 gingerich and voss 2005 izuka et al 2018 similar findings were reported for other volcanic islands around the world e g coutinho et al 2015 hemmings et al 2015 custodio et al 2016 atoll barrier and volcanic islands all have very specific geological and geomorphological characteristics the conceptual model for these settings can therefore not be transferred to smaller islands with low topographic relief and comprised of other bedrock types especially scarce are studies of island bedrock aquifers that are low yielding and have a high risk of well failure when drilling groundwater infrastructure the few studies from such settings that are in the literature are from the koster islands in sweden afewerki 2019 and the gulf islands in british columbia canada klassen 2013 for these studies seawater intrusion was evaluated using aquifer vulnerability maps based on spatial and semi quantitative modelling methods and observed salinity data from wells groundwater recharge in these types of bedrock aquifers can be rapid especially in the tropics where high intensity rainfall events are common to develop and refine conceptual models of island groundwater systems a suite of field investigation techniques are widely used the most common techniques include i near surface geophysical surveys to determine the subsurface conductivity structure and the freshwater lens morphology binley et al 2015 christensen and soerensen 1998 fitterman and stewart 1986 christiansen et al 2006 ii water level monitoring to capture the transient dynamics and the impacts of groundwater pumping

transition zones in small inhabited bedrock islands remain understudied and the scarcity of scientific data has precluded detailed investigations in the past important questions remain such as i what proportion of rainfall replenishes the fresh groundwater lens ii how much rainfall is lost due to evapotranspiration and lateral flow to the coast iii how does geology affect the lens geometry and iv what is the likelihood of up coning of saline groundwater due to groundwater pumping to address this knowledge gap the objective of the present study was to identify and evaluate the dynamics of a fresh groundwater lens in a multi layer aquifer system on the small bedrock island of milingimbi in northern australia in the tropics in recent years the onset and intensity of the wet season has changed and the sustainability of fresh groundwater resources to increased groundwater demand and changing climatic conditions has been of critical concern to the island community the most robust conceptual models are founded on a combination of field investigation techniques we therefore use all of the aforementioned techniques to i determine the spatial extent and thickness of the fresh groundwater lens ii examine the geological controls and the effects of pumping on the geometry of freshwater seawater transition zone and iii develop a conceptual model of the groundwater system that can form an exemplar for other low relief small bedrock islands 2 study site 2 1 site description milingimbi island a 70 km2 island in the tropics of northern australia is part of the crocodile island group in the arafura sea fig 1 its highest elevation is around 16 m above the australian height datum m ahd equivalent to mean sea level m a s l in the central part of the island the mangroves and saline tidal mudflats that fringe the island are inundated monthly during spring tide events when the sea over tops the tidal creek embankments a wide inter tidal zone surrounds the island there is one semi permanent billabong nalajirwa a quasi circular water body located west of the airstrip in between the mudflats and terrestrial area of the island fig 1 the central part of the island is covered by open forest tropical savanna type landscape consisting of mixed eucalyptus species darwin woollybut and stringybark at the edge of this vegetation zone along the island perimeter near the mudflats stands of melaleuca species paperbark have established because of the shallow water table the vegetation has been cleared during world war ii to create a north south air strip which was later abandoned in lieu of an east west sealed airstrip along which extensive vegetation clearing has also occurred the island is situated in the tropics and the monsoonal climate is characterised by two distinct seasons wet and dry the dry season extends from may to october and the wet season extends from november to april however most of the monsoonal rain falls between december and march on average the long term annual rainfall for the island is 1164 mm 1900 2018 whilst for the last four decades average yearly rainfall has been 1452 mm bureau of meteorology 2019 fig s1 supporting information some recent wet seasons had rainfall well below average and the start of high intensity rainfall was much delayed this included the years 2016 and 2018 during the present investigation the air temperature in the dry season may to october ranges between 21 to 31 5 c average 26 3 c and during the wet season october to march between 25 2 to 33 c average 29 1 c bureau of meteorology 2019 the average annual actual evapotranspiration et act rate is 1100 mm daily average of 5 5 mm d 1 and is based on data available from bureau of meteorology bom climate data services data for the bom stations 014402 and 014404 on the island bureau of meteorology 2019 fig s2 supporting information recharge to the fresh groundwater lens occurs exclusively from the rains during the four to six month wet season findings from earlier studies on the water resources of milingimbi concluded that there is significant uncertainty as to what proportion of rainfall replenishes the fresh groundwater lens and what proportions are lost to evapotranspiration and overland flow towards the coast augustino 1960 knapton 2002 matthews 2009 urs corp 2011 woodgate 2014 foo 1980 foo 1982 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the low lying island plateau slopes northward with a dip angle of 2 degrees reflecting the regional basin geology and depositional environment of the arafura coastal plain the geology of the island is comprised of cenozoic and cretaceous age sediments overlying a cambrian succession fig s3 supporting information the latter consists of interbedded limestone fine to coarse grained siltstone and dolostone fig 2 barclay and rix 1964 woodgate 2014 with the top part of the sequence being strongly weathered deposited on top of the weathered cambrian material are lower cretaceous siltstones sandstones and claystones the cenozoic age sediments overlying the cretaceous units consist of undifferentiated sands silts and alluvium and include quaternary sediments comprised of clay silt fine sand and evaporite deposits in the part of the sequence nearest to the land surface a thin layer of ferruginous sandy soil covers most of the elevated part of the island whilst the lower lying tidal flats are comprised of the quaternary deposits notable features are the cambrian basement rock outcropping at the eastern edge near the tidal creek inlet and at the eastern side of the town s rubbish dump fig 1 the extent and nature of weathering is highly variable spatially across the island and vugs and open cavities are common in the ferruginous soil horizons but also at depth in the weathered cambrian material three major aquifers and two aquitards are differentiated beneath the island the unconfined near surface fresh groundwater upper sandstone aquifer is comprised of two distinct layers fig 2 the upper layer consists of sandy clay claystone and laterite that is spatially variable in its extent and thickness between 3 and 19 m the lower layer consists of sand gravel and sandstone and has a thickness ranging between 1 and 34 m it forms the main production aquifer on the island beneath the unconfined aquifer is an aquitard of clay and siltstone cretaceous period with a thickness between 4 and 39 m which covers the aquifer that resides in the weathered and fractured cambrian siltstone and chert woodgate 2014 this intermediate brackish aquifer has a thickness between 16 and 54 m below the intermediate aquifer is a tight hard unfractured dolomitic sandstone with a thickness of between 3 and 53 m although dissolution features have been identified within this unit that may be preferential pathways for groundwater flow woodgate 2014 it generally behaves as an confining layer for the underlying karstic fractured bedrock saline aquifer in the cambrian basement rock the aforementioned heterogeneous weathering intervals vugs and cavities result in the hydraulic properties of the aquifers being spatially variable the drilling report by woodgate 2014 noted that the degree of weathering was deeper and more intense towards the coast on the northern side of the island the areal extent of the main production aquifer is limited to the central portion of the island and is demarcated by the vegetation type that is less resilient to the higher salinity waters found in the mudflats the intermediate aquifer contains brackish groundwater whereas the deepest aquifer s groundwater approaches the salinity of seawater woodgate 2014 from previous investigations it was not clear if the freshwater lens below the island is connected to the mainland foo 1982 woodgate 2014 also postulated that there may be localised up coning of underlying seawater as well as lateral inflow from the arafura sea towards the production wells in the centre of the island this was based on the drilling and hydrogeological data which showed that there is a hydraulic connection between the brackish intermediate aquifer underlying the fresh unconfined aquifer groundwater extraction for the community water supply has largely been from the lower unit of the unconfined aquifer in the central part of the island where four production bores are located fig 1 the average rate of extraction between 2015 to 2018 was 452 m3d 1 in the early 1900s water supply was from bore rn1828 located in the community township near the coast however salinisation of this bore led to production bores being moved towards the centre of the island in the 1970s and 1980s foo 1982 construction details of the production bores and groundwater monitoring wells are described in table s1 in the supporting information manual water level measurements of the groundwater monitoring wells and salinity observations of the production bores have been conducted since the 1980s historical time series data are suggesting a declining water level in the unconfined aquifer system and an increase in salinity of the production bores however due to the strong seasonal signal and intermittent observations it is difficult to conduct any trend analysis based on these data figs s4 and s5 supplementary information 3 methods 3 1 near surface and downhole geophysical surveys this study used several near surface and downhole geophysical techniques to investigate the geometry and thickness of the freshwater lens transient electromagnetic tem surveys using a zonge engineering nanotem system were conducted along an east west and north south transect as well as a transect adjacent to the tidal mud flats fig 1 this area was identified by the local natural resource managers the crocodile islands rangers as a groundwater discharge zone the transmitter for the nanotem outputted approximately 2amp into a single turn 40 m x 40 m square transmitter loop the single turn receiving antenna 5 m x 5 m was located in the centre of the transmitter loop data were collected at a sampling rate of 625 000 samples per second stacking 256 cycles at a repetition rate of 32 hertz data were processed by averaging each of the data stacks and the averaged data were run through zonge engineering s steminv inversion routine that converts observed magnetic field decay data i e measured voltages and times at each location to a one dimensional 24 layer depth electrical resistivity model macinnes 2005 frequency domain electromagnetic induction fdem surveys were undertaken across the island in october 2013 and 2014 using a geonics em34 3 inductive terrain conductivity meter to determine the near surface electrical resistivity distribution the details on this instrument are discussed in mcneill 1980 over 700 measurements 45 line kms were made using the em34 3 in horizontal dipole mode 20 m coil separation with an effective depth range of approximately 15 m to generate an interpolated surface of the bulk conductivity across the island borehole geophysical logging gamma and electromagnetic induction using a mount sopris instruments matrix logger system was conducted on suitably constructed groundwater monitoring wells in order to characterise the lithology changes in the subsurface conductivity structure and to provide constraints for the near surface geophysical surveys 3 2 water level time series data continuous water level monitoring was carried out over a 4 year period october 2014 to october 2018 to examine the transient dynamics in response to wet season rainfall events tides and groundwater pumping in situ level troll data loggers were used to measure the water level in 17 of the 32 operational groundwater observation wells and set to a sample interval of 30 min three shallow piezometers 3 m depth were also installed on the mudflats to monitor the shallow water table table s1 supporting information a data logger was installed at the ranger station in the community township fig 1 to record changes in atmospheric pressure at the same time interval these data provided the barometric correction term for the non vented water level data loggers manual water level measurements were taken each month to verify for pressure transducer and clock drift and as data backup in case of logger failure 3 3 water table fluctuation the water table fluctuation wtf technique is a widely used method to estimate recharge rates healy and cook 2002 in this study the seasonal variation in the water table from eleven observation wells completed within the freshwater lens away from the main production bores were used to estimate the recharge rate r wtf mm y 1 1 r wtf s y δ h δ t where δ h is the change in water level height over a specific time interval δ t and s y is the specific yield based upon previous data for milingimbi woodgate 2014 a specific yield of 0 05 is used 3 4 water sampling the following parameters were measured and analysed in the field during sampling and purging of the monitoring wells using a flow through cell and a ysi multi parameter meter ph dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp specific electrical conductivity sec and temperature alkalinity as caco3 concentration was measured using a hach titration kit prior to sampling the monitoring wells the static water level was measured from the top of casing toc using an electric water level indicator dip meter and reported as metres above the australian height datum m ahd using well survey information from a real time kinematic geographical positioning system trimble r10 instrument purging of at least three volumes from the well was done prior to sampling whenever possible but was occasionally less due to low yields in some wells water samples were collected for laboratory analysis of major ions and trace elements alkalinity stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h chlorofluorocarbons cfcs tritium 3h sulphur hexafluoride sf6 stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13c dic and radiocarbon of dissolved inorganic carbon 14c dic for major element analyses samples were filtered through a 0 45 μ membrane filter in the field major cation and trace element samples were acidified with nitric acid 1 v v hno3 the laboratory analysis techniques and instruments used are described in detail in the supplementary information 3 5 environmental tracers environmental tracers were used to understand the mixing dynamics between the different waters the apparent groundwater age and to estimate recharge rates to the fresh groundwater lens chlorofluorocarbons and sf6 are synthetic organic compounds that are produced for a range of domestic and industrial applications and can be used to date groundwater since they were released into the atmosphere after 1940 they have fairly long residence times in the atmosphere and their atmospheric concentrations are uniform over large areas atmospheric concentrations of cfc 11 and cfc 12 peaked between 1994 and 2002 different cfcs peaked at different times and since then concentrations have decreased fig s6 supporting information on the other hand atmospheric concentrations of sf6 are still increasing cfcs and sf6 have been used as age indicators for groundwater studies since the late 1970s szabo et al 1996 and are an effective tracer for modern groundwaters less than 60 years chambers et al 2018 cook et al 1995 gooddy et al 2006 environmental tracers can be used to estimate recharge rates if sampling takes place close to the water table i e the distance measured from the watertable to the mid screen depth sample depth relative to the thickness of the aquifer is small such that the recharge rate r m y 1 is estimated by cook and bohlke 1999 2 r z θ t where z is the depth below the water table m θ is the porosity of the aquifer and ranges from 0 to 1 and t is the groundwater age y calculated recharge rates using eq 2 assumed a porosity range of 20 θ 30 i e 0 2 to 0 3 3 6 chloride mass balance the chloride mass balance cmb technique is another method that can be used to determine long term groundwater recharge rates although the application in coastal areas is plagued by uncertainty due to the dry deposition of chloride which is spatially heterogeneous and difficult to measure eriksson and khunakasem 1969 at steady state the mass balance between chloride input in rainfall and chloride output in recharge can be used to estimate the recharge rate r cmb mm y 1 3 r cmb pc p c gw where p is the average annual rainfall mm y 1 c p is the chloride concentration of rainfall mg l 1 and c gw is the chloride concentration of groundwater mg l 1 3 7 pore water samples pore water chloride and water content were measured on drill core material that was retrieved during the 2013 drilling program woodgate 2014 to create a salinity profile of the subsurface sub samples of rock 50 100 mm long from the drill core 63 mm diameter recovered during drilling were collected in vacuum sealed food saver bags and were analysed using standard laboratory techniques for gravimetric water contents oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and chloride concentration using a 1 5 soil to ultra pure water extract rayment and higginson 1992 chloride was measured using a dionex ics 2500 ion chromatograph 4 results 4 1 near surface and downhole geophysical surveys here we consider the freshwater lens to have conductivity values less than 20 ms m 1 brackish water e g the transition zone to have values between 20 and 300 ms m 1 and saline water to have values greater than 300 ms m 1 the results of the inversion model of the nanotem surveys across the island clearly shows the spatial extent of the fresh groundwater lens fig 3 a and b the measurements suggest a lens thickness ranging between 30 and 40 m between 2 and 38 m ahd across much of the island the lens overlies a more conductive zone with values between 20 and 300 ms m 1 west east transect fig 3a the south north nanotem transect shows that the lower conductivity values extend deepest near the middle of the island up to 80 m and that the shape of the lens is asymmetric such that the slope of the freshwater saltwater interface on the northern side of the island is more gradual compared to the southern side where it is relatively steep fig 3b the southwest northeast survey adjacent to the mudflat on the northeastern side of the island also shows a fresh groundwater seawater interface with a slope of about 18 degrees and a thickness of the transition zone between 12 to 20 m fig 3c at the break of slope between the vegetated area and the tidal mudflat at a distance of 500 m along the transect there is a more conductive area at the near surface approximately 300 ms m 1 overlying a resistive wedge approximately 3 ms m 1 that in turn sits on top of a more conductive feature 300 ms m 1 this sequence may represent from bottom to top a wedge of intruded seawater the extension of the freshwater lens below the tidal flat and a veneer of brackish groundwater that is the result of infiltration of seawater during periodic inundations spring tides in combination with mixing with fresh groundwater and evapo concentration by the salt marsh vegetation the em34 data fig s7 supporting information shows that the central part of the island is characterised by low conductivity values 20 ms m 1 the interpretation of these values which are representative for the upper 15 m of the subsurface is ambiguous as the low conductivities may reflect the extent of the fresh groundwater lens or the thickness of the unsaturated zone or both interestingly the perimeter of the low conductivity area coincides with the transition between the open forest tropical savanna type landscape and the paperbark species the conductivity across the paperbark area increases from 20 to 80 ms m 1 continuing to values of up to 300 ms m 1 beneath the low lying mudflats the electromagnetic induction logs from the borehole logging surveys of the three deeper wells of the multi level piezometers located in the northern rn38462 middle rn38461 and southern rn38460c area of the island fig 1 support the findings from the nanotem surface geophysical surveys the bulk conductivity profiles from the borehole logs are consistent with a sequence consisting of fresh groundwater measured values ranging from 0 1 to 20 ms m 1 and the transition zone measured values ranging from 5 to 228 ms m 1 to the more saline groundwater of the deeper fractured bedrock aquifer measured values ranging from 75 to 305 ms m 1 fig 3 the small differences in measured conductivity values and the inferred transitions between the fresh brackish and saline water is in line with what would be expected given the difference in the measurement sample volume between the induction log and surface instruments i e a much smaller volume of the subsurface being sensed by the downhole tool than by the nanotem comparing the downhole electromagnetic induction log and the closest nanotem sounding in proximity to the well location showed a similar bulk conductivity profile across the lens and transition zone and into the deeper saline aquifer fig s8 supporting information the downhole profile of rn38461 shows a decrease in conductivity from 61 to 62 m depth which coincided with a step reduction in the diameter of the well which was completed as an open well from 60 down as the fractured rock below this depth was competent enough for the drillhole not to require a casing the low bulk conductivity values ranging from 0 2 to 27 ms m 1 over this depth range is not attributed to a decrease in groundwater salinity but instead interpreted as a response to a strong porosity reduction in the tight matrix of the unweathered hard dolomitic sandstone which was observed in the recovered drill core material woodgate 2014 this is confirmed by the chemical composition of the groundwater and pore water samples as discussed in the following sections 4 2 groundwater chemical and isotopic composition the chloride concentrations in the pore water from the drill core samples as well as the groundwater samples from the multi level piezometers specifically rn38465a rn38465b rn38462 in the north rn38463 rn38464 rn38461 in the centre and rn38460a rn38460b rn38460c in the south confirmed the interpreted geophysics results that the fresh groundwater lens extends on average to 40 m depth below the land surface fig 4 and tables s2 s4 supporting information moreover the lower salinity of the groundwater from rn38460c in the south than rn38462 in the north which are both screened at the same depth is consistent with the nanotem measurements that show that the lens is thicker in the south than in the north below the bottom of the freshwater lens the pore water chloride profile shows a steady increase in salinity interpreted as the transition zone which is at least 50 m and up to 70 m thick in some locations towards the concentration of seawater 20 900 mg l 1 measured in the arafura sea offshore of the island the stable water isotopes and the major ion chemistry data showed the different groundwater compositions in each of the aquifers fig 5 and table s3 s4 supporting information the majority of the wells completed within the lens had chloride concentrations much less than 1000 mg l 1 the groundwater sample from well rn38231 showed very little mineralisation and its chloride concentration cl 5 5 mg l 1 was almost as low as in rainfall the data points for the wells completed beneath the fresh groundwater lens in the deepest aquifer plot along a mixing line between the fresh groundwater and seawater in fig 5a groundwater sampled from well rn38238 near the lens perimeter in the community township also has slightly higher isotopic values δ18o 6 5 and δ2h 43 31 and higher salinity compared to the other samples in the shallower aquifer and central part of the island as expected the water from the billabong showed distinct evaporative δ18o and δ2h signatures that is a relatively high enrichment compared to rainfall given its chloride concentration fig 5b the δ18o and δ2h values in bulk monthly rainfall samples n 16 collected between 2016 and 2019 showed a seasonal trend that correlated with variation in rainfall between the wet and dry seasons fig 6 a and b for the three wet dry season cycles sampled the rainfall δ18o and δ2h values ranged from 8 78 to 1 53 and from 58 8 to 3 8 respectively the delta values tended to increase from the onset of the wet season in december to the dry season middle of the year table s5 supplementary information the δ18o and δ2h values of samples collected from the production bore rn9257 during the same period n 45 also show some variability between the wet and dry season ranging from 7 59 to 6 52 and 48 3 to 44 9 respectively during the 2016 2017 wet season there is a subtle but consistent decrease of the δ18o values from the middle of the wet season through into the dry season followed by an increase of similar magnitude during the second half of the dry season albeit that the magnitude of the change is small this could suggest a 6 month delayed response to the previous wet season rainfall recharge fig 6b chloride concentrations of samples collected from the production bore rn9257 during the same period n 45 vary somewhat erratically but showed the lowest concentrations during the dry seasons fig 6c measured chloride concentrations in the rainfall samples varied between less than detection limit of 0 8 mg l 1 to 6 6 mg l 1 groundwater cfc concentrations were detected in most of the wells sampled from each of the aquifers cfc concentrations ranged from 17 5 to 171 9 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 cfc 11 5 to 263 7 pg kg 1 up to 25 m below the water table 25 m ahd where as below this depth concentrations ranged from 10 to 78 1 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 cfc 11 5 to 109 2 pg kg 1 this is indicative of mean residence time of 30 to greater than 60 years old fig 7 and table s3 supporting information cfcs can degrade in anaerobic groundwater oster et al 1996 degradation rates for cfc 11 typically exceed rates for cfc 12 degradation cook et al 1995 sebol et al 2007 which does appear to be the case for some of the shallower groundwater samples because the majority of the samples had cfc 11 concentrations that plotted below the equivalent atmospheric concentration line at a temperature of 26 c in particular samples from wells rn38233 rn38234 rn38235 rn38237 and rn38234 appeared to be more affected by cfc 11 degradation than the other samples detectable cfc concentrations were found in the aquifers up to 70 m below land surface indicating an active groundwater flow system furthermore tracers at this depth indicate that there is inter connectivity between the aquifer units and rapid transit pathways due to the dual porosity of the weathered and fractured bedrock fig 8 tritium sf6 and 14c of dic decrease with depth in the top 40 m below the water table and become more uniform with depth fig 8 sf6 concentrations ranged from 14 6 to 1270 7 fg kg 1 just like the cfcs and tritium the presence of sf6 is an indicator of a modern groundwater component cfc 12 and sf6 concentrations from the same sample can be compared to evaluate mixing processes and anthropogenic contamination fig 9 the mixing envelope represents mixtures of water having different ages whereas concentrations falling outside of the envelope cannot be ascribed solely to mixing processes cook et al 2017 two of the groundwater samples rn38460b screened near the base of the lens and rn38237 a shallow well had sf6 concentrations of 1270 fg kg 1 and 955 fg kg 1 respectively such high values could be due to excess air in recharge heaton and vogel 1981 but more likely they were contaminated by modern air injection during rotary air drilling or well development poulsen et al 2020 cfc and sf6 concentrations were used to establish an apparent groundwater age their concentration in groundwater is dependent upon the water temperature at the time of groundwater recharge i e the solubility of cfcs and sf6 and therefore the concentration in groundwater in equilibrium with a given atmospheric concentration decreases as temperature increases and the atmospheric concentration for the wells of which the groundwater was analysed for both cfc 12 and sf6 the groundwater mean residence time ranged between about 25 and 55 years tritium activities ranged from 0 02 to 0 78 tu and were lower than the annual average of 1 tu measured in rainfall in darwin over the last decade tadros et al 2014 in the 1990s measured rainfall tritium values in darwin were approximately 2 5 tu and in the early 1970s they were around 8 tu possible reasons contributing to the lower groundwater values include a geographic continental effect on the island whereby the island experiences different rainfall events that generate recharge compared to darwin as well as mixing of soil water the 14c of dic contents ranged from 11 5 to 100 pmc groundwater samples with values greater than 60 pmc also had higher tritium and sf6 compared to samples with less than 60 pmc the shape and the slope of all the tracer profiles suggest that the vertical groundwater flow velocities are higher in the shallower aquifer greater change in concentration with depth than in the deeper more saline aquifer less change in concentration with depth fig 8 and fig s9 supporting information the cfc 12 concentrations in the upper 30 m show a large amount of scatter which is likely to be attributed to the spatial variation in the physical characteristics of the near surface geology e g presence of vugs degree of weathering variable porosity influencing the recharge transit times as well as mixing of different age waters comparing the measured cfc 12 concentrations and the modelled recharge estimates eq 2 suggests that most of the concentrations are best explained by recharge rates of 85 and 200 mm y 1 i e vertical flow velocities between 285 and 1000 mm y 1 and considering porosity values between 20 and 30 based on drillcore material woodgate 2014 and surface nuclear magnetic resonance surveys soerensen et al 2019 the maximum recharge rate represents up to 14 of the average annual rainfall average over the last four decades fig 10 in comparison the estimated long term average recharge rate using the chloride mass balance method was 140 mm y 1 and ranged between 14 and 420 mm y 1 this calculation was based upon the average measured chloride concentration 2 mg l 1 from bulk monthly rainfall collectors representing total chloride deposition of the water that infiltrates the soil and becomes recharge e g wood 1999 that were deployed at two sites on the island for two wet seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and the groundwater chloride concentration from wells completed less than 35 deep i e within the freshwater lens which ranged from 5 5 to 162 mg l 1 4 3 water level time series the change in groundwater as a result of the contrasting rainfall during the wet and dry season is evident in the water level time series data from 2014 to 2018 that show that groundwater levels rise by 8 5 m over the wet season fig 11 lower than average annual rainfall was experienced in the wet season from november 2015 to april 2016 and therefore the water level rise during the wet season was very subdued considering the rise in water table the estimated recharge based on the water table fluctuation method using data from 11 of the shallow observation wells and a specific yield of 0 05 ranged between 150 and 425 mm y 1 with an average of 290 mm y 1 the average depth to the water table from ground level increases from a few metres near the edge of the lens to over 10 m in the central part of the island the strong fluctuations during the year can also be seen from the groundwater level contours maps before and after the 2016 2017 wet season towards the very end of the dry season prior to the first wet season rains the water table falls below mean sea level fig 12 the water levels around the main production bores at the very end of the dry season are less than 0 4 m ahd i e close to mean sea level it is also worth noting that beneath the mudflats that surround the central elevated region of the island and lie between the arafura sea 0 m ahd the depth to water was generally less than 1 m based on 3 shallow hand dug piezometers installed across the tidal mudflat on the northern side of the island the three groundwater wells shown in fig 11b are located in the middle of the island adjacent to one of the main production bores rn21382 the influence of pumping from the production bore is seen in the water level of the adjacent groundwater well rn38463 completed within the fresh groundwater lens at a similar depth to the production bore rn21382 screen interval 26 29 m below ground located approximately 50 m away the pumping causes a one metre fluctuation in the water level of rn38643 and an overall slight decline in the water level from october 2014 to august 2018 groundwater well rn38461 is located in the deeper aquifer drilled down to 123 m depth whilst rn38229 is completed within the aquifer underlying the fresh groundwater lens with a screen interval of 55 58 m below ground these two wells show a clear tidal signal with the amplitude being the largest in the deepest screen the influence of the ocean tides is also apparent in several of the other observation wells in particular the wells completed with screens in the deeper fractured bedrock aquifer fig 11 5 discussion the survey transects showed that the lens exists only beneath the island and that it does not extend beyond the mudflats this finding contradicts foo 1982 who contended that the lens could be connected to the mainland below the island itself the lens seems to be continuous although the nanotem measurements suggest a variable thickness we hypothesise that the shape of the lens is influenced by the regional 2 degree dip angle in the stratigraphy and its orientation towards the arafura sea and the fluctuating surface of the weathered and the unweathered cambrian rock whereby the stratigraphy is influencing the geometry of the lens because of the expected higher permeability in line with the bedding plane the latter was evident in the continuous drill core material that was retrieved during drilling of the deepest observation wells in the north central and southern areas of the island the lens appears to have developed across the lithological boundaries in the upper part of the aquifer aquitard sequence this is different from small carbonate islands werner et al 2017 where the permeability contrast between holocene and pleistocene strata often causes a truncation of the lens at the transition between the different lithologies studies of barrier islands composed of unconsolidated siliciclastic material have found that the geometry of freshwater lenses can also be influenced by the geomorphology of the dune system and tidal storm surges holt et al 2019 or by spatially variable recharge rates due to differences in vegetation or land use schneider and kruse 2006 given the relatively uniform surface and land cover of milingimbi island such controls are believed to be of secondary relevance here to what extent the areas where the vegetation was cleared for the two airstrips affects groundwater recharge could not be ascertained from the available data there were no clear indications in the geophysical data however that the absence of vegetation exerts an important control on the thickness of the freshwater lens it was identified from previous water resource assessments foo 1980 foo 1982 and geophysical surveys martin 1991 that several parts of the island s aquifers may be at risk of seawater intrusion particularly near the eastern shore salinisation by seawater is the most likely cause of failure to the original community groundwater well that was constructed back in the 1930s in the township where the groundwater became saline towards the end of the dry season this was confirmed during the present study by the major ion chemistry and δ18o and δ2h data from well rn38238 located near the edge of the township and those wells located towards the edge of the lens which showed that the brackish transition zone water is a mixture of fresh groundwater and seawater from the lower aquifer construction of the current production bores in the middle of the island in the late 1970 s has mitigated the likelihood of seawater intrusion laterally from the coast furthermore the installation of short screen intervals in the upper parts of the fresh groundwater lens within the sandstone unit has also been advantageous in minimising the risk of localised up coning of saline water the near surface geophysical surveys and time series chemistry data from the production bore over the study period showed no evidence of up coning even though water levels near the main production bore drop below sea level during the dry season fig 12 given its size and thickness it is difficult to ascertain if the freshwater lens changes in response to the wet season rainfall events however the monitoring well hydrographs and hydrochemical time series data from the production bore did elucidate the dynamic characteristics of the fresh groundwater lens between the wet and dry season the influence of the sea tides and freshening of groundwater within the lens after wet season rainfall the groundwater extraction from the main production bores does not vary significantly between the wet and the dry season periods as they supply an almost constant demand the subtle trends in the time series data of chloride concentration and δ18o and δ2h suggest that there was freshwater replenishment of the lens after the wet season rainfalls this is noteworthy as it demonstrates the recharge mechanism of wet season rainfall and a lagged response of up to 6 months before the rainfall reaches the production bore well screen despite this the mean residence time of groundwater within the lens was not less than 25 years implying that there is effective mixing of young and older water such mixing could only occur as a result of the dual porosity of the weathered and fractured bedrock aquifers by providing a mechanism for rapid infiltration of young water and exchange with more tightly bound older water via matrix diffusion recharge rates between 14 and 425 mm y 1 which is between 1 and 29 of the annual rainfall were calculated using residence time tracer cfcs chloride mass balance and water table fluctuation methods the range in estimated recharge seems reasonable compared to other sedimentary and crystalline aquifers characterised by wet and dry season rainfall in the tropics kotchoni et al 2019 in those studies long term hydrograph data have been used to determine recharge rates up to 40 of annual rainfall the fact that the δ18o values of the fresh groundwater are within a narrow range that is at the lower end of the rainfall δ18o values has been explained in other studies harrington et al 2002 jasechko and taylor 2015 priestley et al 2017 as being due to recharge occurring predominantly during high intensity rainfall events while this could also be the case on milingimbi island the temporal variability of the rainfall δ18o values provides an additional explanation the lowest δ18δ18o values occurred at the onset of the wet season when the water table was at its deepest consequently there is a lot of storage capacity in the unsaturated zone to accommodate the first rains that fall as the wet season progresses the water table rises fig 11 and fig s10 supporting information and the storage capacity decreases providing less opportunity for the rainfall with relatively high δ18o values to penetrate deep into the unsaturated zone or to infiltrate at all the rainwater that does not infiltrate is potentially lost by overland flow moreover and perhaps more importantly the rainwater that does enter the upper part of the unsaturated zone is lost by evapotranspiration more so than the deeper soil water as it forms the soil water store from which the vegetation can most easily draw its water this means that only the early rains of the wet season are effectively recharging the groundwater a simple water balance of the fresh groundwater lens on the island can provide some guidance of the available potable water and its rate of replenishment by wet season rainfall taking the spatial extent of the freshwater lens as 2x107 m2 and its saturated thickness as 40 m as determined by the geophysical surveys and a porosity of 0 25 the total freshwater volume was calculated to be 2x108 m3 using the range of estimated recharge rates based on the three recharge methods the calculated groundwater recharge volume is between 3x105 to 8 5x106 m3 y 1 taking these calculations into consideration the available freshwater storage 4x107 m3 using a specific yield of 0 05 could be replenished from rainfall within 5 to 133 years if no groundwater extraction occurred any rainfall that does not become recharge contributes to other hydrological processes or ecosystem services being either removed via evapotranspiration or discharge at the margins of the lens towards the mudflats and the ocean the average annual groundwater extraction from the main production bores 2015 to 2018 is 1 64x105 m3 y 1 and is between 2 and 55 of the recharge volume this extraction volume is a very small proportion 0 5 of the available freshwater storage within the lens therefore as long as appropriate groundwater pumping schedules are maintained and under the caveat that no unidentified preferential migration pathways for saline groundwater exist that might facilitate up coning there should be no major impact to the sustainability of the freshwater lens the wide transition zone up to 70 m thick below the freshwater lens and the fact that some brackish water samples have detectable cfc 12 sf6 and tritium concentrations indicates vigorous mixing between intruded seawater and modern fresh groundwater these findings also demonstrate the importance of matrix and fracture porosity on solute and groundwater flow in bedrock aquifers which has been recognised in previous studies e g zuber and motyka 1994 and zuber et al 2011 extensive transition zones have also been observed below atolls and have been attributed to the oscillatory vertical flow that is driven by the ocean tides e g buddemeier et al 2004 tidal influence was clearly observable for the water levels measured in the deeper screens fig 11 from which it can be inferred that tidally driven mixing plays a role here the pronounced wet dry seasonal cycle might also contribute to this extensive mixing by causing a seasonal shift of the transition zone but our data do not allow quantifying the magnitude of such as shift given the large water table fluctuations between the wet and dry season though figs 11 and 12 it is very well conceivable that there is at least some response of the deeper groundwater salinities in response to the rainfall lu et al 2009 demonstrated that mixing zones are widened by the combined effect of tidally or rainfall induced flow and kinetic mass transfer of solutes between the mobile and immobile regions recent results based on numerical models by kreyns et al 2020 suggest that wide transition zones characterised by heterogeneous salinity distributions may also develop under steady conditions in aquifers with connected high permeability structures even though the structures considered by kreyns et al 2020 which were representative of volcanic conduits are of a different nature than the fissures and vugs in the aquifers of milingimbi island it seems likely that the fractured nature of the bedrock aquifer and the karst features in the dolomitic sandstone provide a setting that is conducive to the development of a wide transition zone below the freshwater lens continued re evaluation of the fresh groundwater lens using several of the hydrogeophysical and hydrochemical techniques that were used in the study would provide a useful monitoring strategy for the ongoing management of the freshwater resource and to mitigate the potential impacts of seawater intrusion and saline water up coning as was shown in this study there are inherent differences in each field technique for example the spatial variation and thickness of the freshwater lens and the observed conductivity higher salinity water in the deeper fractured bedrock aquifer where the downhole em induction logs of the three deep wells showed lower conductivity values to what was observed with the nanotem this is most likely due to the bedrock having a tight matrix and low porosity such that the high salinity of the pore water contributes only a minor component to the em response over the area of investigation whilst the nanotem has a much larger area of investigation and ultimately a larger sample volume that increases with increasing depth but also at a loss of sample resolution this finding along with other outcomes of the study reiterates the value in using multiple methods and time series data to provide insight into understanding these dynamic aquifer systems 6 conclusions this study has highlighted the benefits of using multiple geophysical and hydrogeological techniques to investigate and understand seawater intrusion and groundwater flow processes beneath a small multi aquifer fractured bedrock island and how recharge responds to episodic wet season rainfall the near surface and downhole geophysical surveys together with the pore water salinity measurements characterised the shape thickness and extent of the fresh groundwater lens and confirmed that the water resource was not hydraulically connected to the mainland the brackish transition zone between the fresh groundwater lens and seawater is at least 50 m and up to 70 m thick in some locations given that some brackish water samples have detectable cfc 12 sf6 and tritium concentrations indicates vigorous mixing between intruded seawater and modern fresh groundwater these findings also highlight the importance of matrix and fracture porosity on solute and groundwater flow in bedrock aquifers the angle of the fresh groundwater seawater interface on the seaward side of the island was less than the mainland side of the island and the shape also followed the regional geological structure associated with the 2 degree dip angle of the island plateau furthermore the size of lens and the available groundwater storage was large compared to the current groundwater extraction the high frequency water level measurements showed the dynamic behaviour of the lens influence of the sea tide and recharge to the aquifer system in response to episodic wet season rainfall despite the groundwater levels showing a large increase and detectable changes to the chemical and isotopic composition of the groundwater collected from one of the main production bores between the wet and dry seasons indicating rapid recharge processes the mean residence time of groundwater within the freshwater lens was equal or greater than 25 years based on various methods estimated recharge to the freshwater lens is between 14 and 425 mm y 1 which is 1 to 29 of the annual rainfall the time series chloride and δ18o and δ2h data suggest that there is a freshening i e lower salinity input of the lens as a result of the wet season rainfall which occurs up to 6 months after the event confirmation that direct rainfall is the only source of recharge to the lens and not from aquifer s on the mainland is an important outcome to evaluate what the impacts of climate change and the likelihood of consecutive wet seasons of below average rainfall are on a decrease in the input of fresh water to the lens this information combined with the other results from the field investigation techniques used in this study improves the hydrogeological conceptual model and understanding of this bedrock environment this will be invaluable in the development of a numerical variable density groundwater flow and solute transport model of the island and contribute to making better and more informed water management decisions for a secure and reliable water supply to a growing remote community which relies solely on

editor in chief with the assistance of stephen worthington associate editor fresh groundwater lens dynamics and transition zone geometries on small tropical islands have been investigated in a wide range of geological environments however the understanding of multi aquifer fractured bedrock systems and how they respond to episodic wet season rainfall recharge is still limited this study used a comprehensive suite of isotopic tracers hydrogeological and near surface geophysical methods to characterise the multi layer aquifer system on milingimbi a small bedrock island located in the tropics of the arafura sea northern australia near surface geophysics was used to determine the subsurface structure of the aquifer including the spatial extent and thickness of the fresh groundwater lens and the shape of the transition zone pore water chloride profiles hydrochemistry and δ18o and δ2h data supported the geophysics results the lens was found to be 40 m thick on average with an up to 70 m thick transition zone underneath water level time series data over 4 years showed that there was a strong tidal signal observed in the groundwater wells screened in the deeper aquifer and that the aquifer system showed a dynamic response to the wet season rainfall time series chloride and δ18o and δ2h rainfall and production bore data suggest that there was a freshening i e lower salinity input of the lens as a result of recharge during the wet season which occurs up to 6 months after the event groundwater residence time indicators showed that the mean residence time in the lens was at least 25 years and the rate of recharge to the system was up to 200 mm y 1 the comprehensive data set which is rather unique in its wide range of methods that were applied resulted in a hydrogeological conceptual model of the multi layer bedrock aquifer system of the island that also provides insight into the fresh groundwater lens and the transition zone geometry of similar island aquifer systems

been undertaken on volcanic islands for example in hawaii that have highlighted the strong influence of geological structures like low permeability strata and dikes on groundwater flow oki et al 1998

volcanic islands all have very specific geological and geomorphological characteristics the conceptual model for these settings can therefore not be transferred to smaller islands with low topographic relief and comprised of other bedrock types especially scarce are studies of island bedrock aquifers that are low yielding and have a high risk of well failure when drilling groundwater infrastructure the few studies from such settings that are in the literature are from the koster islands in sweden afewerki 2019 and the gulf islands in british columbia canada klassen 2013 for these studies seawater intrusion was evaluated using aquifer vulnerability maps based on spatial and semi quantitative modelling methods and observed salinity data from wells groundwater recharge in these types of bedrock aquifers can be rapid especially in the tropics where high intensity rainfall events are common to develop and refine conceptual models of island groundwater systems a suite of field

transition zones in small inhabited bedrock islands remain understudied and the scarcity of scientific data has precluded detailed investigations in the past important questions remain such as i what proportion of rainfall replenishes the fresh groundwater lens ii how much rainfall is lost due to evapotranspiration and lateral flow to the coast iii how does geology affect the lens geometry and iv what is the likelihood of up coning of saline groundwater due to groundwater pumping to address this knowledge gap the objective of the present study was to identify and evaluate the dynamics of a fresh groundwater lens in a multi layer aquifer system on the small bedrock island of milingimbi in northern australia in the tropics in recent years the onset and intensity of the wet season has changed and the sustainability of fresh groundwater resources to increased groundwater demand and changing climatic conditions has been of critical concern to the island community the most robust conceptual models are founded on a combination of field investigation techniques we therefore use all of the aforementioned techniques to i determine the spatial extent and thickness of the fresh groundwater lens ii examine the geological controls and the effects of pumping on the geometry of freshwater seawater transition zone and iii develop a conceptual model of the groundwater system that can form an exemplar for other low relief small bedrock islands 2 study site 2 1 site description milingimbi island a 70 km2 island in the tropics of northern australia is part of the crocodile island group in the arafura sea fig 1 its highest elevation is around 16 m above the australian height datum m ahd equivalent to mean sea level m a s l in the central part of the island the mangroves and saline tidal mudflats that fringe the island are inundated monthly during spring tide events when the sea over tops the tidal creek embankments a wide inter tidal zone surrounds the island there is one semi permanent billabong nalajirwa a quasi circular water body located west of the airstrip in between the mudflats and terrestrial area of the island fig 1 the central part of the island is covered by open forest tropical savanna type landscape consisting of mixed eucalyptus species darwin woollybut and stringybark at the edge of this vegetation zone along the island perimeter near the mudflats stands of melaleuca species paperbark have established because of the shallow water table the vegetation has been cleared during world war ii to create a north south air strip which was later abandoned in lieu of an east west sealed airstrip along which extensive vegetation clearing has also occurred the island is situated in the tropics and the monsoonal climate is characterised by two distinct seasons wet and dry the dry season extends from may to october and the wet season extends from november to april however most of the monsoonal rain falls between december and march on average the long term annual rainfall for the island is 1164 mm 1900 2018 whilst for the last four decades average yearly rainfall has been 1452 mm bureau of meteorology 2019 fig s1 supporting information some recent wet seasons had rainfall well below average and the start of high intensity rainfall was much delayed this included the years 2016 and 2018 during the present investigation the air temperature in the dry season may to october ranges between 21 to 31 5 c average 26 3 c and during the wet season october to march between 25 2 to 33 c average 29 1 c bureau of meteorology 2019 the average annual actual evapotranspiration et act rate is 1100 mm daily average of 5 5 mm d 1 and is based on data available from bureau of meteorology bom climate data services data for the bom stations 014402 and 014404 on the island bureau of meteorology 2019 fig s2 supporting information recharge to the fresh groundwater lens occurs exclusively from the rains during the four to six month wet season findings from earlier studies on the water resources of milingimbi concluded that there is significant uncertainty as to what proportion of rainfall replenishes the fresh groundwater lens and what proportions are lost to evapotranspiration and overland flow towards the coast augustino 1960 knapton 2002 matthews 2009 urs corp 2011 woodgate 2014 foo 1980 foo 1982 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the low lying island plateau slopes northward with a dip angle of 2 degrees reflecting the regional basin geology and depositional environment of the arafura coastal plain the geology of the island is comprised of cenozoic and cretaceous age sediments overlying a cambrian succession fig s3 supporting information the latter consists of interbedded limestone fine to coarse grained siltstone and dolostone fig 2 barclay and rix 1964 woodgate 2014 with the top part of the sequence being strongly weathered deposited on top of the weathered cambrian material are lower cretaceous siltstones sandstones and claystones the cenozoic age sediments overlying the cretaceous units consist of undifferentiated sands silts and alluvium and include quaternary sediments comprised of clay silt fine sand and evaporite deposits in the part of the sequence nearest to the land surface a thin layer of ferruginous sandy soil covers most of the elevated part of the island whilst the lower lying tidal flats are comprised of the quaternary deposits notable features are the cambrian basement rock outcropping at the eastern edge near the tidal creek inlet and at the eastern side of the town s rubbish dump fig 1 the extent and nature of weathering is highly variable spatially across the island and vugs and open cavities are common in the ferruginous soil horizons but also at depth in the weathered cambrian material three major aquifers and two aquitards are differentiated beneath the island the unconfined near surface fresh groundwater upper sandstone aquifer is comprised of two distinct layers fig 2 the upper layer consists of sandy clay claystone and laterite that is spatially variable in its extent and thickness between 3 and 19 m the lower layer consists of sand gravel and sandstone and has a thickness ranging between 1 and 34 m it forms the main production aquifer on the island beneath the unconfined aquifer is an aquitard of clay and siltstone cretaceous period with a thickness between 4 and 39 m which covers the aquifer that resides in the weathered and fractured cambrian siltstone and chert woodgate 2014 this intermediate brackish aquifer has a thickness between 16 and 54 m below the intermediate aquifer is a tight hard unfractured dolomitic sandstone with a thickness of between 3 and 53 m although dissolution features have been identified within this unit that may be preferential pathways for groundwater flow woodgate 2014 it generally behaves as an confining layer for the underlying karstic fractured bedrock saline aquifer in the cambrian basement rock the aforementioned heterogeneous weathering intervals vugs and cavities result in the hydraulic properties of the aquifers being spatially variable the drilling report by woodgate 2014 noted that the degree of weathering was deeper and more intense towards the coast on the northern side of the island the areal extent of the main production aquifer is limited to the central portion of the island and is demarcated by the vegetation type that is less resilient to the higher salinity waters found in the mudflats the intermediate aquifer contains brackish groundwater whereas the deepest aquifer s groundwater approaches the salinity of seawater woodgate 2014 from previous investigations it was not clear if the freshwater lens below the island is connected to the mainland foo 1982 woodgate 2014 also postulated that there may be localised up coning of underlying seawater as well as lateral inflow from the arafura sea towards the production wells in the centre of the island this was based on the drilling and hydrogeological data which showed that there is a hydraulic connection between the brackish intermediate aquifer underlying the fresh unconfined aquifer groundwater extraction for the community water supply has largely been from the lower unit of the unconfined aquifer in the central part of the island where four production bores are located fig 1 the average rate of extraction between 2015 to 2018 was 452 m3d 1 in the early 1900s water supply was from bore rn1828 located in the community township near the coast however salinisation of this bore led to production bores being moved towards the centre of the island in the 1970s and 1980s foo 1982 construction details of the production bores and groundwater monitoring wells are described in table s1 in the supporting information manual water level measurements of the groundwater monitoring wells and salinity observations of the production bores have been conducted since the 1980s historical time series data are suggesting a declining water level in the unconfined aquifer system and an increase in salinity of the production bores however due to the strong seasonal signal and intermittent observations it is difficult to conduct any trend analysis based on these data figs s4 and s5 supplementary information 3 methods 3 1 near surface and downhole geophysical surveys this study used several near surface and downhole geophysical techniques to investigate the geometry and thickness of the freshwater lens transient electromagnetic tem surveys using a zonge engineering nanotem system were conducted along an east west and north south transect as well as a transect adjacent to the tidal mud flats fig 1 this area was identified by the local natural resource managers the crocodile islands rangers as a groundwater discharge zone the transmitter for the nanotem outputted approximately 2amp into a single turn 40 m x 40 m square transmitter loop the single turn receiving antenna 5 m x 5 m was located in the centre of the transmitter loop data were collected at a sampling rate of 625 000 samples per second stacking 256 cycles at a repetition rate of 32 hertz data were processed by averaging each of the data stacks and the averaged data were run through zonge engineering s steminv inversion routine that converts observed magnetic field decay data i e measured voltages and times at each location to a one dimensional 24 layer depth electrical resistivity model macinnes 2005 frequency domain electromagnetic induction fdem surveys were undertaken across the island in october 2013 and 2014 using a geonics em34 3 inductive terrain conductivity meter to determine the near surface electrical resistivity distribution the details on this instrument are discussed in mcneill 1980 over 700 measurements 45 line kms were made using the em34 3 in horizontal dipole mode 20 m coil separation with an effective depth range of approximately 15 m to generate an interpolated surface of the bulk conductivity across the island borehole geophysical logging gamma and electromagnetic induction using a mount sopris instruments matrix logger system was conducted on suitably constructed groundwater monitoring wells in order to characterise the lithology changes in the subsurface conductivity structure and to provide constraints for the near surface geophysical surveys 3 2 water level time series data continuous water level monitoring was carried out over a 4 year period october 2014 to october 2018 to examine the transient dynamics in response to wet season rainfall events tides and groundwater pumping in situ level troll data loggers were used to measure the water level in 17 of the 32 operational groundwater observation wells and set to a sample interval of 30 min three shallow piezometers 3 m depth were also installed on the mudflats to monitor the shallow water table table s1 supporting information a data logger was installed at the ranger station in the community township fig 1 to record changes in atmospheric pressure at the same time interval these data provided the barometric correction term for the non vented water level data loggers manual water level measurements were taken each month to verify for pressure transducer and clock drift and as data backup in case of logger failure 3 3 water table fluctuation the water table fluctuation wtf technique is a widely used method to estimate recharge rates healy and cook 2002 in this study the seasonal variation in the water table from eleven observation wells completed within the freshwater lens away from the main production bores were used to estimate the recharge rate r wtf mm y 1 1 r wtf s y δ h δ t where δ h is the change in water level height over a specific time interval δ t and s y is the specific yield based upon previous data for milingimbi woodgate 2014 a specific yield of 0 05 is used 3 4 water sampling the following parameters were measured and analysed in the field during sampling and purging of the monitoring wells using a flow through cell and a ysi multi parameter meter ph dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp specific electrical conductivity sec and temperature alkalinity as caco3 concentration was measured using a hach titration kit prior to sampling the monitoring wells the static water level was measured from the top of casing toc using an electric water level indicator dip meter and reported as metres above the australian height datum m ahd using well survey information from a real time kinematic geographical positioning system trimble r10 instrument purging of at least three volumes from the well was done prior to sampling whenever possible but was occasionally less due to low yields in some wells water samples were collected for laboratory analysis of major ions and trace elements alkalinity stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h chlorofluorocarbons cfcs tritium 3h sulphur hexafluoride sf6 stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13c dic and radiocarbon of dissolved inorganic carbon 14c dic for major element analyses samples were filtered through a 0 45 μ membrane filter in the field major cation and trace element samples were acidified with nitric acid 1 v v hno3 the laboratory analysis techniques and instruments used are described in detail in the supplementary information 3 5 environmental tracers environmental tracers were used to understand the mixing dynamics between the different waters the apparent groundwater age and to estimate recharge rates to the fresh groundwater lens chlorofluorocarbons and sf6 are synthetic organic compounds that are produced for a range of domestic and industrial applications and can be used to date groundwater since they were released into the atmosphere after 1940 they have fairly long residence times in the atmosphere and their atmospheric concentrations are uniform over large areas atmospheric concentrations of cfc 11 and cfc 12 peaked between 1994 and 2002 different cfcs peaked at different times and since then concentrations have decreased fig s6 supporting information on the other hand atmospheric concentrations of sf6 are still increasing cfcs and sf6 have been used as age indicators for groundwater studies since the late 1970s szabo et al 1996 and are an effective tracer for modern groundwaters less than 60 years chambers et al 2018 cook et al 1995 gooddy et al 2006 environmental tracers can be used to estimate recharge rates if sampling takes place close to the water table i e the distance measured from the watertable to the mid screen depth sample depth relative to the thickness of the aquifer is small such that the recharge rate r m y 1 is estimated by cook and bohlke 1999 2 r z θ t where z is the depth below the water table m θ is the porosity of the aquifer and ranges from 0 to 1 and t is the groundwater age y calculated recharge rates using eq 2 assumed a porosity range of 20 θ 30 i e 0 2 to 0 3 3 6 chloride mass balance the chloride mass balance cmb technique is another method that can be used to determine long term groundwater recharge rates although the application in coastal areas is plagued by uncertainty due to the dry deposition of chloride which is spatially heterogeneous and difficult to measure eriksson and khunakasem 1969 at steady state the mass balance between chloride input in rainfall and chloride output in recharge can be used to estimate the recharge rate r cmb mm y 1 3 r cmb pc p c gw where p is the average annual rainfall mm y 1 c p is the chloride concentration of rainfall mg l 1 and c gw is the chloride concentration of groundwater mg l 1 3 7 pore water samples pore water chloride and water content were measured on drill core material that was retrieved during the 2013 drilling program woodgate 2014 to create a salinity profile of the subsurface sub samples of rock 50 100 mm long from the drill core 63 mm diameter recovered during drilling were collected in vacuum sealed food saver bags and were analysed using standard laboratory techniques for gravimetric water contents oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and chloride concentration using a 1 5 soil to ultra pure water extract rayment and higginson 1992 chloride was measured using a dionex ics 2500 ion chromatograph 4 results 4 1 near surface and downhole geophysical surveys here we consider the freshwater lens to have conductivity values less than 20 ms m 1 brackish water e g the transition zone to have values between 20 and 300 ms m 1 and saline water to have values greater than 300 ms m 1 the results of the inversion model of the nanotem surveys across the island clearly shows the spatial extent of the fresh groundwater lens fig 3 a and b the measurements suggest a lens thickness ranging between 30 and 40 m between 2 and 38 m ahd across much of the island the lens overlies a more conductive zone with values between 20 and 300 ms m 1 west east transect fig 3a the south north nanotem transect shows that the lower conductivity values extend deepest near the middle of the island up to 80 m and that the shape of the lens is asymmetric such that the slope of the freshwater saltwater interface on the northern side of the island is more gradual compared to the southern side where it is relatively steep fig 3b the southwest northeast survey adjacent to the mudflat on the northeastern side of the island also shows a fresh groundwater seawater interface with a slope of about 18 degrees and a thickness of the transition zone between 12 to 20 m fig 3c at the break of slope between the vegetated area and the tidal mudflat at a distance of 500 m along the transect there is a more conductive area at the near surface approximately 300 ms m 1 overlying a resistive wedge approximately 3 ms m 1 that in turn sits on top of a more conductive feature 300 ms m 1 this sequence may represent from bottom to top a wedge of intruded seawater the extension of the freshwater lens below the tidal flat and a veneer of brackish groundwater that is the result of infiltration of seawater during periodic inundations spring tides in combination with mixing with fresh groundwater and evapo concentration by the salt marsh vegetation the em34 data fig s7 supporting information shows that the central part of the island is characterised by low conductivity values 20 ms m 1 the interpretation of these values which are representative for the upper 15 m of the subsurface is ambiguous as the low conductivities may reflect the extent of the fresh groundwater lens or the thickness of the unsaturated zone or both interestingly the perimeter of the low conductivity area coincides with the transition between the open forest tropical savanna type landscape and the paperbark species the conductivity across the paperbark area increases from 20 to 80 ms m 1 continuing to values of up to 300 ms m 1 beneath the low lying mudflats the electromagnetic induction logs from the borehole logging surveys of the three deeper wells of the multi level piezometers located in the northern rn38462 middle rn38461 and southern rn38460c area of the island fig 1 support the findings from the nanotem surface geophysical surveys the bulk conductivity profiles from the borehole logs are consistent with a sequence consisting of fresh groundwater measured values ranging from 0 1 to 20 ms m 1 and the transition zone measured values ranging from 5 to 228 ms m 1 to the more saline groundwater of the deeper fractured bedrock aquifer measured values ranging from 75 to 305 ms m 1 fig 3 the small differences in measured conductivity values and the inferred transitions between the fresh brackish and saline water is in line with what would be expected given the difference in the measurement sample volume between the induction log and surface instruments i e a much smaller volume of the subsurface being sensed by the downhole tool than by the nanotem comparing the downhole electromagnetic induction log and the closest nanotem sounding in proximity to the well location showed a similar bulk conductivity profile across the lens and transition zone and into the deeper saline aquifer fig s8 supporting information the downhole profile of rn38461 shows a decrease in conductivity from 61 to 62 m depth which coincided with a step reduction in the diameter of the well which was completed as an open well from 60 down as the fractured rock below this depth was competent enough for the drillhole not to require a casing the low bulk conductivity values ranging from 0 2 to 27 ms m 1 over this depth range is not attributed to a decrease in groundwater salinity but instead interpreted as a response to a strong porosity reduction in the tight matrix of the unweathered hard dolomitic sandstone which was observed in the recovered drill core material woodgate 2014 this is confirmed by the chemical composition of the groundwater and pore water samples as discussed in the following sections 4 2 groundwater chemical and isotopic composition the chloride concentrations in the pore water from the drill core samples as well as the groundwater samples from the multi level piezometers specifically rn38465a rn38465b rn38462 in the north rn38463 rn38464 rn38461 in the centre and rn38460a rn38460b rn38460c in the south confirmed the interpreted geophysics results that the fresh groundwater lens extends on average to 40 m depth below the land surface fig 4 and tables s2 s4 supporting information moreover the lower salinity of the groundwater from rn38460c in the south than rn38462 in the north which are both screened at the same depth is consistent with the nanotem measurements that show that the lens is thicker in the south than in the north below the bottom of the freshwater lens the pore water chloride profile shows a steady increase in salinity interpreted as the transition zone which is at least 50 m and up to 70 m thick in some locations towards the concentration of seawater 20 900 mg l 1 measured in the arafura sea offshore of the island the stable water isotopes and the major ion chemistry data showed the different groundwater compositions in each of the aquifers fig 5 and table s3 s4 supporting information the majority of the wells completed within the lens had chloride concentrations much less than 1000 mg l 1 the groundwater sample from well rn38231 showed very little mineralisation and its chloride concentration cl 5 5 mg l 1 was almost as low as in rainfall the data points for the wells completed beneath the fresh groundwater lens in the deepest aquifer plot along a mixing line between the fresh groundwater and seawater in fig 5a groundwater sampled from well rn38238 near the lens perimeter in the community township also has slightly higher isotopic values δ18o 6 5 and δ2h 43 31 and higher salinity compared to the other samples in the shallower aquifer and central part of the island as expected the water from the billabong showed distinct evaporative δ18o and δ2h signatures that is a relatively high enrichment compared to rainfall given its chloride concentration fig 5b the δ18o and δ2h values in bulk monthly rainfall samples n 16 collected between 2016 and 2019 showed a seasonal trend that correlated with variation in rainfall between the wet and dry seasons fig 6 a and b for the three wet dry season cycles sampled the rainfall δ18o and δ2h values ranged from 8 78 to 1 53 and from 58 8 to 3 8 respectively the delta values tended to increase from the onset of the wet season in december to the dry season middle of the year table s5 supplementary information the δ18o and δ2h values of samples collected from the production bore rn9257 during the same period n 45 also show some variability between the wet and dry season ranging from 7 59 to 6 52 and 48 3 to 44 9 respectively during the 2016 2017 wet season there is a subtle but consistent decrease of the δ18o values from the middle of the wet season through into the dry season followed by an increase of similar magnitude during the second half of the dry season albeit that the magnitude of the change is small this could suggest a 6 month delayed response to the previous wet season rainfall recharge fig 6b chloride concentrations of samples collected from the production bore rn9257 during the same period n 45 vary somewhat erratically but showed the lowest concentrations during the dry seasons fig 6c measured chloride concentrations in the rainfall samples varied between less than detection limit of 0 8 mg l 1 to 6 6 mg l 1 groundwater cfc concentrations were detected in most of the wells sampled from each of the aquifers cfc concentrations ranged from 17 5 to 171 9 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 cfc 11 5 to 263 7 pg kg 1 up to 25 m below the water table 25 m ahd where as below this depth concentrations ranged from 10 to 78 1 pg kg 1 for cfc 12 cfc 11 5 to 109 2 pg kg 1 this is indicative of mean residence time of 30 to greater than 60 years old fig 7 and table s3 supporting information cfcs can degrade in anaerobic groundwater oster et al 1996 degradation rates for cfc 11 typically exceed rates for cfc 12 degradation cook et al 1995 sebol et al 2007 which does appear to be the case for some of the shallower groundwater samples because the majority of the samples had cfc 11 concentrations that plotted below the equivalent atmospheric concentration line at a temperature of 26 c in particular samples from wells rn38233 rn38234 rn38235 rn38237 and rn38234 appeared to be more affected by cfc 11 degradation than the other samples detectable cfc concentrations were found in the aquifers up to 70 m below land surface indicating an active groundwater flow system furthermore tracers at this depth indicate that there is inter connectivity between the aquifer units and rapid transit pathways due to the dual porosity of the weathered and fractured bedrock fig 8 tritium sf6 and 14c of dic decrease with depth in the top 40 m below the water table and become more uniform with depth fig 8 sf6 concentrations ranged from 14 6 to 1270 7 fg kg 1 just like the cfcs and tritium the presence of sf6 is an indicator of a modern groundwater component cfc 12 and sf6 concentrations from the same sample can be compared to evaluate mixing processes and anthropogenic contamination fig 9 the mixing envelope represents mixtures of water having different ages whereas concentrations falling outside of the envelope cannot be ascribed solely to mixing processes cook et al 2017 two of the groundwater samples rn38460b screened near the base of the lens and rn38237 a shallow well had sf6 concentrations of 1270 fg kg 1 and 955 fg kg 1 respectively such high values could be due to excess air in recharge heaton and vogel 1981 but more likely they were contaminated by modern air injection during rotary air drilling or well development poulsen et al 2020 cfc and sf6 concentrations were used to establish an apparent groundwater age their concentration in groundwater is dependent upon the water temperature at the time of groundwater recharge i e the solubility of cfcs and sf6 and therefore the concentration in groundwater in equilibrium with a given atmospheric concentration decreases as temperature increases and the atmospheric concentration for the wells of which the groundwater was analysed for both cfc 12 and sf6 the groundwater mean residence time ranged between about 25 and 55 years tritium activities ranged from 0 02 to 0 78 tu and were lower than the annual average of 1 tu measured in rainfall in darwin over the last decade tadros et al 2014 in the 1990s measured rainfall tritium values in darwin were approximately 2 5 tu and in the early 1970s they were around 8 tu possible reasons contributing to the lower groundwater values include a geographic continental effect on the island whereby the island experiences different rainfall events that generate recharge compared to darwin as well as mixing of soil water the 14c of dic contents ranged from 11 5 to 100 pmc groundwater samples with values greater than 60 pmc also had higher tritium and sf6 compared to samples with less than 60 pmc the shape and the slope of all the tracer profiles suggest that the vertical groundwater flow velocities are higher in the shallower aquifer greater change in concentration with depth than in the deeper more saline aquifer less change in concentration with depth fig 8 and fig s9 supporting information the cfc 12 concentrations in the upper 30 m show a large amount of scatter which is likely to be attributed to the spatial variation in the physical characteristics of the near surface geology e g presence of vugs degree of weathering variable porosity influencing the recharge transit times as well as mixing of different age waters comparing the measured cfc 12 concentrations and the modelled recharge estimates eq 2 suggests that most of the concentrations are best explained by recharge rates of 85 and 200 mm y 1 i e vertical flow velocities between 285 and 1000 mm y 1 and considering porosity values between 20 and 30 based on drillcore material woodgate 2014 and surface nuclear magnetic resonance surveys soerensen et al 2019 the maximum recharge rate represents up to 14 of the average annual rainfall average over the last four decades fig 10 in comparison the estimated long term average recharge rate using the chloride mass balance method was 140 mm y 1 and ranged between 14 and 420 mm y 1 this calculation was based upon the average measured chloride concentration 2 mg l 1 from bulk monthly rainfall collectors representing total chloride deposition of the water that infiltrates the soil and becomes recharge e g wood 1999 that were deployed at two sites on the island for two wet seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 and the groundwater chloride concentration from wells completed less than 35 deep i e within the freshwater lens which ranged from 5 5 to 162 mg l 1 4 3 water level time series the change in groundwater as a result of the contrasting rainfall during the wet and dry season is evident in the water level time series data from 2014 to 2018 that show that groundwater levels rise by 8 5 m over the wet season fig 11 lower than average annual rainfall was experienced in the wet season from november 2015 to april 2016 and therefore the water level rise during the wet season was very subdued considering the rise in water table the estimated recharge based on the water table fluctuation method using data from 11 of the shallow observation wells and a specific yield of 0 05 ranged between 150 and 425 mm y 1 with an average of 290 mm y 1 the average depth to the water table from ground level increases from a few metres near the edge of the lens to over 10 m in the central part of the island the strong fluctuations during the year can also be seen from the groundwater level contours maps before and after the 2016 2017 wet season towards the very end of the dry season prior to the first wet season rains the water table falls below mean sea level fig 12 the water levels around the main production bores at the very end of the dry season are less than 0 4 m ahd i e close to mean sea level it is also worth noting that beneath the mudflats that surround the central elevated region of the island and lie between the arafura sea 0 m ahd the depth to water was generally less than 1 m based on 3 shallow hand dug piezometers installed across the tidal mudflat on the northern side of the island the three groundwater wells shown in fig 11b are located in the middle of the island adjacent to one of the main production bores rn21382 the influence of pumping from the production bore is seen in the water level of the adjacent groundwater well rn38463 completed within the fresh groundwater lens at a similar depth to the production bore rn21382 screen interval 26 29 m below ground located approximately 50 m away the pumping causes a one metre fluctuation in the water level of rn38643 and an overall slight decline in the water level from october 2014 to august 2018 groundwater well rn38461 is located in the deeper aquifer drilled down to 123 m depth whilst rn38229 is completed within the aquifer underlying the fresh groundwater lens with a screen interval of 55 58 m below ground these two wells show a clear tidal signal with the amplitude being the largest in the deepest screen the influence of the ocean tides is also apparent in several of the other observation wells in particular the wells completed with screens in the deeper fractured bedrock aquifer fig 11 5 discussion the survey transects showed that the lens exists only beneath the island and that it does not extend beyond the mudflats this finding contradicts foo 1982 who contended that the lens could be connected to the mainland below the island itself the lens seems to be continuous although the nanotem measurements suggest a variable thickness we hypothesise that the shape of the lens is influenced by the regional 2 degree dip angle in the stratigraphy and its orientation towards the arafura sea and the fluctuating surface of the weathered and the unweathered cambrian rock whereby the stratigraphy is influencing the geometry of the lens because of the expected higher permeability in line with the bedding plane the latter was evident in the continuous drill core material that was retrieved during drilling of the deepest observation wells in the north central and southern areas of the island the lens appears to have developed across the lithological boundaries in the upper part of the aquifer aquitard sequence this is different from small carbonate islands werner et al 2017 where the permeability contrast between holocene and pleistocene strata often causes a truncation of the lens at the transition between the different lithologies studies of barrier islands composed of unconsolidated siliciclastic material have found that the geometry of freshwater lenses can also be influenced by the geomorphology of the dune system and tidal storm surges holt et al 2019 or by spatially variable recharge rates due to differences in vegetation or land use schneider and kruse 2006 given the relatively uniform surface and land cover of milingimbi island such controls are believed to be of secondary relevance here to what extent the areas where the vegetation was cleared for the two airstrips affects groundwater recharge could not be ascertained from the available data there were no clear indications in the geophysical data however that the absence of vegetation exerts an important control on the thickness of the freshwater lens it was identified from previous water resource assessments foo 1980 foo 1982 and geophysical surveys martin 1991 that several parts of the island s aquifers may be at risk of seawater intrusion particularly near the eastern shore salinisation by seawater is the most likely cause of failure to the original community groundwater well that was constructed back in the 1930s in the township where the groundwater became saline towards the end of the dry season this was confirmed during the present study by the major ion chemistry and δ18o and δ2h data from well rn38238 located near the edge of the township and those wells located towards the edge of the lens which showed that the brackish transition zone water is a mixture of fresh groundwater and seawater from the lower aquifer construction of the current production bores in the middle of the island in the late 1970 s has mitigated the likelihood of seawater intrusion laterally from the coast furthermore the installation of short screen intervals in the upper parts of the fresh groundwater lens within the sandstone unit has also been advantageous in minimising the risk of localised up coning of saline water the near surface geophysical surveys and time series chemistry data from the production bore over the study period showed no evidence of up coning even though water levels near the main production bore drop below sea level during the dry season fig 12 given its size and thickness it is difficult to ascertain if the freshwater lens changes in response to the wet season rainfall events however the monitoring well hydrographs and hydrochemical time series data from the production bore did elucidate the dynamic characteristics of the fresh groundwater lens between the wet and dry season the influence of the sea tides and freshening of groundwater within the lens after wet season rainfall the groundwater extraction from the main production bores does not vary significantly between the wet and the dry season periods as they supply an almost constant demand the subtle trends in the time series data of chloride concentration and δ18o and δ2h suggest that there was freshwater replenishment of the lens after the wet season rainfalls this is noteworthy as it demonstrates the recharge mechanism of wet season rainfall and a lagged response of up to 6 months before the rainfall reaches the production bore well screen despite this the mean residence time of groundwater within the lens was not less than 25 years implying that there is effective mixing of young and older water such mixing could only occur as a result of the dual porosity of the weathered and fractured bedrock aquifers by providing a mechanism for rapid infiltration of young water and exchange with more tightly bound older water via matrix diffusion recharge rates between 14 and 425 mm y 1 which is between 1 and 29 of the annual rainfall were calculated using residence time tracer cfcs chloride mass balance and water table fluctuation methods the range in estimated recharge seems reasonable compared to other sedimentary and crystalline aquifers characterised by wet and dry season rainfall in the tropics kotchoni et al 2019 in those studies long term hydrograph data have been used to determine recharge rates up to 40 of annual rainfall the fact that the δ18o values of the fresh groundwater are within a narrow range that is at the lower end of the rainfall δ18o values has been explained in other studies harrington et al 2002 jasechko and taylor 2015 priestley et al 2017 as being due to recharge occurring predominantly during high intensity rainfall events while this could also be the case on milingimbi island the temporal variability of the rainfall δ18o values provides an additional explanation the lowest δ18δ18o values occurred at the onset of the wet season when the water table was at its deepest consequently there is a lot of storage capacity in the unsaturated zone to accommodate the first rains that fall as the wet season progresses the water table rises fig 11 and fig s10 supporting information and the storage capacity decreases providing less opportunity for the rainfall with relatively high δ18o values to penetrate deep into the unsaturated zone or to infiltrate at all the rainwater that does not infiltrate is potentially lost by overland flow moreover and perhaps more importantly the rainwater that does enter the upper part of the unsaturated zone is lost by evapotranspiration more so than the deeper soil water as it forms the soil water store from which the vegetation can most easily draw its water this means that only the early rains of the wet season are effectively recharging the groundwater a simple water balance of the fresh groundwater lens on the island can provide some guidance of the available potable water and its rate of replenishment by wet season rainfall taking the spatial extent of the freshwater lens as 2x107 m2 and its saturated thickness as 40 m as determined by the geophysical surveys and a porosity of 0 25 the total freshwater volume was calculated to be 2x108 m3 using the range of estimated recharge rates based on the three recharge methods the calculated groundwater recharge volume is between 3x105 to 8 5x106 m3 y 1 taking these calculations into consideration the available freshwater storage 4x107 m3 using a specific yield of 0 05 could be replenished from rainfall within 5 to 133 years if no groundwater extraction occurred any rainfall that does not become recharge contributes to other hydrological processes or ecosystem services being either removed via evapotranspiration or discharge at the margins of the lens towards the mudflats and the ocean the average annual groundwater extraction from the main production bores 2015 to 2018 is 1 64x105 m3 y 1 and is between 2 and 55 of the recharge volume this extraction volume is a very small proportion 0 5 of the available freshwater storage within the lens therefore as long as appropriate groundwater pumping schedules are maintained and under the caveat that no unidentified preferential migration pathways for saline groundwater exist that might facilitate up coning there should be no major impact to the sustainability of the freshwater lens the wide transition zone up to 70 m thick below the freshwater lens and the fact that some brackish water samples have detectable cfc 12 sf6 and tritium concentrations indicates vigorous mixing between intruded seawater and modern fresh groundwater these findings also demonstrate the importance of matrix and fracture porosity on solute and groundwater flow in bedrock aquifers which has been recognised in previous studies e g zuber and motyka 1994 and zuber et al 2011 extensive transition zones have also been observed below atolls and have been attributed to the oscillatory vertical flow that is driven by the ocean tides e g buddemeier et al 2004 tidal influence was clearly observable for the water levels measured in the deeper screens fig 11 from which it can be inferred that tidally driven mixing plays a role here the pronounced wet dry seasonal cycle might also contribute to this extensive mixing by causing a seasonal shift of the transition zone but our data do not allow quantifying the magnitude of such as shift given the large water table fluctuations between the wet and dry season though figs 11 and 12 it is very well conceivable that there is at least some response of the deeper groundwater salinities in response to the rainfall lu et al 2009 demonstrated that mixing zones are widened by the combined effect of tidally or rainfall induced flow and kinetic mass transfer of solutes between the mobile and immobile regions recent results based on numerical models by kreyns et al 2020 suggest that wide transition zones characterised by heterogeneous salinity distributions may also develop under steady conditions in aquifers with connected high permeability structures even though the structures considered by kreyns et al 2020 which were representative of volcanic conduits are of a different nature than the fissures and vugs in the aquifers of milingimbi island it seems likely that the fractured nature of the bedrock aquifer and the karst features in the dolomitic sandstone provide a setting that is conducive to the development of a wide transition zone below the freshwater lens continued re evaluation of the fresh groundwater lens using several of the hydrogeophysical and hydrochemical techniques that were used in the study would provide a useful monitoring strategy for the ongoing management of the freshwater resource and to mitigate the potential impacts of seawater intrusion and saline water up coning as was shown in this study there are inherent differences in each field technique for example the spatial variation and thickness of the freshwater lens and the observed conductivity higher salinity water in the deeper fractured bedrock aquifer where the downhole em induction logs of the three deep wells showed lower conductivity values to what was observed with the nanotem this is most likely due to the bedrock having a tight matrix and low porosity such that the high salinity of the pore water contributes only a minor component to the em response over the area of investigation whilst the nanotem has a much larger area of investigation and ultimately a larger sample volume that increases with increasing depth but also at a loss of sample resolution this finding along with other outcomes of the study reiterates the value in using multiple methods and time series data to provide insight into understanding these dynamic aquifer systems 6 conclusions this study has highlighted the benefits of using multiple geophysical and hydrogeological techniques to investigate and understand seawater intrusion and groundwater flow processes beneath a small multi aquifer fractured bedrock island and how recharge responds to episodic wet season rainfall the near surface and downhole geophysical surveys together with the pore water salinity measurements characterised the shape thickness and extent of the fresh groundwater lens and confirmed that the water resource was not hydraulically connected to the mainland the brackish transition zone between the fresh groundwater lens and seawater is at least 50 m and up to 70 m thick in some locations given that some brackish water samples have detectable cfc 12 sf6 and tritium concentrations indicates vigorous mixing between intruded seawater and modern fresh groundwater these findings also highlight the importance of matrix and fracture porosity on solute and groundwater flow in bedrock aquifers the angle of the fresh groundwater seawater interface on the seaward side of the island was less than the mainland side of the island and the shape also followed the regional geological structure associated with the 2 degree dip angle of the island plateau furthermore the size of lens and the available groundwater storage was large compared to the current groundwater extraction the high frequency water level measurements showed the dynamic behaviour of the lens influence of the sea tide and recharge to the aquifer system in response to episodic wet season rainfall despite the groundwater levels showing a large increase and detectable changes to the chemical and isotopic composition of the groundwater collected from one of the main production bores between the wet and dry seasons indicating rapid recharge processes the mean residence time of groundwater within the freshwater lens was equal or greater than 25 years based on various methods estimated recharge to the freshwater lens is between 14 and 425 mm y 1 which is 1 to 29 of the annual rainfall the time series chloride and δ18o and δ2h data suggest that there is a freshening i e lower salinity input of the lens as a result of the wet season rainfall which occurs up to 6 months after the event confirmation that direct rainfall is the only source of recharge to the lens and not from aquifer s on the mainland is an important outcome to evaluate what the impacts of climate change and the likelihood of consecutive wet seasons of below average rainfall are on a decrease in the input of fresh water to the lens this information combined with the other results from the field investigation techniques used in this study improves the hydrogeological conceptual model and understanding of this bedrock environment this will be invaluable in the development of a numerical variable density groundwater flow and solute transport model of the island and contribute to making better and more informed water management decisions for a secure and reliable water supply to a growing remote community which relies solely on

4768,data driven models can achieve high accuracy and low computational cost without a priori knowledge of hydrological system which have been successfully applied in streamflow forecasting for decades however it is still a challenging task to improve the performance of these models especially for the rivers with dramatic flow changes in this paper a new integrated framework for daily streamflow forecasting based on different flow regimes is developed the framework integrates a fuzzy c means fcm clustering for streamflow regime identification a partial mutual information pmi for input selection deep belief networks dbn for mapping the nonlinear relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes and a rigorous validation process considering structure validity to interpret the physical processes simulated using the dbn models the framework was applied to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in usa and the results show that the framework has significantly improved modelling performance approximately 12 compared to single data driven models the integration of data driven models and physical process classification also leads to improved integration of physical understanding of the complex characteristic of different flow regimes into the modelling process leading to overall improved confidence in the developed daily streamflow forecasting models keywords daily streamflow forecasting deep belief network rigorous model validation streamflow process classification 1 introduction streamflow forecasting is of significant importance for water resources system planning and management activities such as flooding control hydropower generation agricultural irrigation liu et al 2018 luo et al 2019 and has been a research focus for decades moradkhani et al 2004 kisi and cimen 2011 tikhamarine et al 2020 however it is still a challenging task to improve the performance of these models especially for the rivers with dramatic flow changes ghaith et al 2020 this is partially due to the fact that the whole streamflow generation process is very complex and the input output relationship also changes over time as different internal sub processes takes place in the whole process such that hydrologic behavior is different when streamflow generates at the beginning and the falling limb and when streamflow generates at the base flow and extreme flow hadi tombul 2018 boucher et al 2020 data driven models boost growth exploded for streamflow forecasting recently which are more powerful to forecast without a priori knowledge of hydrological process and have the potential to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost quilty et al 2019 wang et al 2019 different data driven methods such as auto regressive models artificial neural networks ann support vector regression svr and extreme learning machines elm have been introduced to apply in streamflow forecasting lima et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however in the majority of these studies data driven models are directly used to map the input output relationships while the physical understanding of the streamflow process is largely ignored the streamflow generation process has distinct features during different stages jain srinivasulu 2006 wu et al 2009 for example low flow events are dominated by steady base flow and high flow events are caused by random extreme rainfall events the rising limbs of streamflow generation process are influenced by the intensity and duration of rainfall and the falling limbs are dominated by the storage characteristics of the catchment parasuraman elshorbagy 2007 li et al 2017 therefore the whole streamflow generation process can be classified into different sub processes each of which can be modelled separately as demonstrated in previous studies corzo solomatine 2007 toth 2009 chu et al 2020a however in the majority of these studies traditional data driven models have been used dbn have recently been found to be an effective modelling method for mapping non linearity relationships and they have been used in applications such as language understanding cancer classification facial expression recognition hyperspectral image classification and so on sarikaya et al 2014 abdel zaher eldeib 2016 zhong et al 2017 dbn models have an efficient layer by layer learning algorithm and an initialization of the parameters extracted from the training dataset to prevent falling into local optimum and accelerate the training process mohamed et al 2011 huang et al 2014 in this study it is proposed to develop an integrated framework to incorporate physical understanding of the streamflow generation process into streamflow forecasting models using dbns this framework includes a fuzzy c means clustering fcm method for streamflow classification a partial mutual information pmi based input selection a dbn for mapping input output relationships and a rigorous validation process for model validation the framework was applied to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in usa and the performance of the framework was compared with that of single data driven models the structure of this paper is presented as follows the framework is provided in section 2 which includes the clustering classification method pmi based input selection the dbn model architecture and a rigorous model validation process the study area and data for different case studies are described in section 3 the streamflow forecasting results obtained for different case studies are presented and discussed in section 4 conclusions are provided in section 5 2 methods 2 1 physical processes of streamflow generation the underlying physical relationships of streamflow generation are very complex because of high complexity non linearity and non stationarity which still are not fully understood the whole process of streamflow generation may include many periods such as rising limbs flows close to the peak falling limbs base flows and other intermediate situations toth 2009 the relationship between the impact factors and streamflow of different periods in the sub process will follow the whole characteristic of the system but the relationship of different periods also changes to some extent in most research a single data driven model is often used to simulate the whole process of streamflow generation with the generalization of the understanding of the system however more generalization will have a bad effect on the performance of the forecasting model with ignoring the characteristics of different periods therefore data driven models with different parameters should be capture the characteristics of relationship between the impact factors and streamflow corresponding to different periods respectively 2 2 overall framework a classification based dbn model framework for streamflow forecasting is shown in fig 1 there are four steps within the framework including data clustering input selection model development and validation the first step is data classification the dataset may be clustered into different groups sub datasets of different characteristic and physical process and fcm method was employed to classify the total input output dataset into several sub datasets for example three sub datasets representing the relationship between the inputs and low medium and high flow the second step is input selection and pmi method was applied to screen the significant inputs of streamflow at different magnitudes as the inputs of each data driven model the third step is data driven model development where dbn models were built in this study finally a rigorous model validation process proposed by humphrey et al 2017 is used model validation is an important step to evaluate the effectiveness of data driven model details of fcm pmi dbn and rigorous model validation are provided section 2 3 2 6 below 2 3 data classification fcm the fuzzy c means fcm is developed based on the fuzzy set theory to classify the input output datasets into different groups according to similarity it is relatively insensitive to initializations and produces more appropriate classification results with less computation gou et al 2015 jahangoshai rezaee et al 2018 the fcm approach can classify the total dataset into several groups by determining the distinct clusters using cluster center and membership matrix on the basis of minimizing the objective function below 1 f i 1 k j 1 n u ij m x i c j 2 where m is a fuzzier representing the level of cluster fuzziness n is the number of input output samples k is the number of clusters x i is the ith samples u ij is the degree that the sample x i belongs to one group c j and c j is the center of one group silva filho et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 fcm approach starts with random selection of the initial group centers and computes the degree of the samples based on the distance between the samples and each center according to the largest degree it divides all the samples into k clusters and recalculate the center of new group and update the center of each group until satisfy the iteration criterion chuang et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 2 4 data driven modelling process 2 4 1 input selection pmi input selection is an essential process of data driven model which can determine the inputs that best characterize the underlying input output relationship prasad et al 2017 partial mutual information pmi originates from the improvement of mutual information mi that pmi can remove redundant dependencies among all the inputs by considering both input significance and input dependence may et al 2008a marković et al 2013 fang et al 2018 in the selection process the input with the highest mi was selected firstly however there are redundant information among the selected inputs and the residual inputs and it will have an impact on the results of the screening variables if the information are considered repeatedly may et al 2008b therefore pmi method should calculate the marginal pdf with the transformation of the residual information between the outputand inputs under the consideration of the effect of already screening inputs by mi frenzel and pompe 2007 fernando et al 2009 more details of the transformation process can be find in may et al 2011 2 4 2 model development dbn dbn has attracted many attentions in the application of image recognition and time series forecasting as an efficient method developed on the basis of the traditional ann models the structure of dbn model is also comprised of inputs layer hidden layer and output layer like the other ann models mohamed et al 2012a 2012b wang et al 2016 in the hidden layer there is a special structure with a two layer neural network called restricted boltzmann machine rbm which can be trained layerwise to help dbn models to achieve a good performance and prevent from the over fitting problems shen et al 2015 the energy of a joint configuration of the hidden and visible units of rbm can be defined as 3 e v h θ i 1 m a i v i j 1 n b j h j i 1 m j 1 n v i w ij h j where θ w a b w represents the symmetric weight between the hidden and visible units a represents the visible unit bias b represents the hidden unit bias then the probability that an rbm assigns to a visible layer is 4 p v h 1 z e e v h given v i and h j defines as the states of visible layer i and hidden layer j and it can be seen that the units of hidden layer are conditionally independent of the units of visible layer so the units of a binary hidden layer can be 5 p vi p v i 1 1 1 exp j w ij h j 6 p hj p h j 1 1 1 exp i w ij v i the weights can be updated according to the gradient of the log likelihood pinaya et al 2016 there are two important parts including pre training and fine tuning stage in the parameterized process khatami et al 2017 at the pre training stage the initial weights of dbn models has been initialized by layer by layer unsupervised learning algorithm and the output of rbm can be input into the visible layer of the next rbm mohamed et al 2010 kuremoto et al 2014 at the fine tuning stage the weights of the whole structures need to be slightly adjusted by the gradient descent algorithm the training process can prevent from local convergence and make the performance better lopes and ribeiro 2014 2 4 3 the rigorous validation process a rigorous validation process proposed by humphrey et al 2017 is used in this paper the process considers replicative validity predictive validity and structural validity most of data driven models for streamflow forecasting often include replicative validity and predictive validity but structure validity is often overlooked which can compensate for the explanation of physical mechanism lack of data driven model biondi et al 2012 humphrey et al 2017 therefore all three aspects of validity are considered in the model validation step in this study a scatter plot of observed versus forecasted streamflow has been employed to visually represent the fitting performance of the model if the data distributes along the 1 1 line it means the model fits well between the observed and predicted streamflow bennett et al 2013 found that it is very suitable for representing the forecasting performance of different magnitudes of streamflow such as low medium and high flow four measures including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae median absolute percentage error mdape and coefficient of determination r2 are calculated in the paper four measures can evaluate the deviation between the observed value and the forecasted value from different perspectives and more detailed can be found in dawson et al 2007 and chu et al 2020b the profile method is used to conduct the structure validity and guarantee that the model can represent plausible physical input output response that is this method can check whether that the model can simulate the streamflow response in terms of the precipitation as the hydrological processes system not just fit well with the data lek et al 1995 young et al 2011 2 5 experiment setup the framework of fcm pmi dbn with a rigorous validation process considering replicative predictive and structure validity was developed and used to test the applicability to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in usa the framework is also compared to single data driven models developed using dbns to illustrate the impact of considering different streamflow regimes using classification methods the comparison results include predictive and replicative validation results for all three stations and structure validation results are just provided for station 07 068 000 to illustrate the physical understanding that could be obtained from using structure validation methods 3 case studies the case studies include two regions with different climate characteristics in the humid south and arid southwest region of usa fig 2 there are three gauging stations 07 068 000 36 62 n 90 83 w 07 050 500 36 42 n 93 62 w and 09 505 800 34 57 n 111 68 w in the current river kings river and verde river respectively current river 296 km runs through ozarks and northeastern arkansas and then runs into the white river a tributary of mississippi river the upstream of current river is located at doniphan missouri where the drainage area is approximately 5200 km2 this part of the basin is contained entirely within the ozarks in missouri average annual rainfall in the region are 1000 1200 mm and average annual temperature ranges from 15 to 18 c large floods generally are caused by intense rainfall during the winter or late spring relatively impermeable soils contribute to flashy runoff events kings river runs through madison and carroll counties to its confluence with the white river arm of table rock lake located on the missouri arkansas border the drainage area is approximately 1365 km2 and average annual rainfall in the region is about 1000 mm verde river is located in the watershed of colorado river which is included in the state of arizona the river flows from many springs near the confluence with granite creek to below camp verde the streamflow station is located at the middle of verde river average annual rainfall in the region ranges about 254 mm to about 1016 mm and average annual temperature ranges from 6 c to 17 c in this paper daily precipitation data with the same time period of the corresponding streamflow station were collected streamflow data comes from three streamflow stations of current river in doniphan missouri 07068000 kings river near berryville arkansas 07050500 and west clear creek near camp verde arizona 09505800 in this paper daily streamflow data from 07 068 000 station between june 1921 and october 2019 07 050 500 station between november 1992 and october 2019 and 09 505 800 station between july 1977 and september 2019 table 1 shows the statistics of streamflow and precipitation of three stations the average and standard deviation of daily streamflow in the humid region are greater than those of the arid region the characteristics of three streamflow stations are different and represent the relationship between streamflow and precipitation under different climate conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 data classification the initial inputs has 31 variables including 16 precipitation related inputs r t r t 1 r t 15 15 streamflow related inputs s t 1 s t 15 r t 1 and s t 1 means precipitation and streamflow of the day before one output variable is current streamflow at daily scales s t one input output sample includes 31 inputs and one output there are 35879 9815 and 15 400 input output samples in the three stations respectively these samples will be classified into three different groups subsets or classifications representing the relationship between precipitation and streamflow at low medium and high flow scales respectively using fcm classification method samples were classified into three subsets for three stations respectively the results were shown in the fig 3 there are 25 266 group 1 g1 green circles 7870 group 2 g2 blue circles and 2743 group 3 g3 red circles samples in three subsets for station 07068000 and the average streamflow are 55 m3 s 122 m3 s and 195 m3 s the average daily precipitation for different classifications are 2 mm 4 mm and 8 mm there are 7157 1331 and 987 samples in three subsets for station 07050500 and the average streamflow are 8 m3 s 37 m3 s and 52 m3 s there are 11249 2803 and 1348 samples in three subsets for station 09505800 and the average streamflow are 1 m3 s 2 m3 s and 9 m3 s it is clear from the figures that the samples of group 1 represent the relationship between low flow and precipitation and the samples of group 2 and 3 represent the relationship between medium flow high flow and precipitation respectively the classification results by fcm method reveal that the low flow regime has the most number of data points followed by is the medium flow and high flow regimes the low flow regime always has the highest number of data points after classification no matter where the stations are located because it is an important component of the flow regime in any river or stream and the classification results are consistent with the physical processes the high flow regime has the least number of data points after classification and it is more difficult to model high flow regime as there are less data 4 2 input selection the pmi based input selection method was employed to identify the final inputs for streamflow at different groups table s1 appendix s1 shows the order of candidate inputs first twenty selected by pmi method according the results of table s1 the results indicates that s t 1 is more related with s t than the other inputs the final inputs selected for each data subsets are summarised in table 2 according to aic criterion may et al 2011 for group 1 low flow of station 07068000 the inputs for model includes s t 1 s t 2 s t 3 s t 8 s t 15 and s t 14 for group 1 of station 07050500 the inputs for model includes s t 1 s t 2 s t 10 s t 14 s t 15 s t 3 and r t for group 1 of station 09505800 the inputs for model includes s t 2 s t 6 s t 11 s t 13 and s t 3 from input selection results by pmi method it is obvious that the daily streamflow with a lag of one day s t 1 is always selected as the inputs firstly for different magnitudes of three stations with different characteristic of hydrological meteorological conditions and it is probably that the most recent inputs always have a high impact due to system memory for low flow s t just has a strong relationship with only previous streamflow and has little relationship with precipitation and for medium flow s t has a strong relationship with previous streamflow and precipitation and for high flow s t has a strong relationship with previous streamflow and precipitation which has more lag days than that of medium flow for streamflow station in arid region s t has a stronger relationship with precipitation of more lagged time according to the order of inputs probably it is because low flow is an integral component of a flow regime of any river and it takes a longer time to convert precipitation into streamflow in the arid region 4 3 model validation 4 3 1 replicative validity the replicative validation results were used to assess the fitting performance between the observed values and the modelled values with the training input output samples which had been used to obtain the parameters of the dbn models the replicative validation results of three different classifications for three stations were examined using the rmse mae mdape and r2 the replicative validation results are obtained in fig 4 and table 3 for station 07068000 the performance for group 1 during the calibration period have the rmse of 67 97 mae of 28 20 mdape of 9 20 and r2 of 0 79 respectively it can be demonstrated that the framework can map the relationship between the previous streamflow and current low flow the performance of the models for group 2 and group 3 also show that the model can simulate the relationship between the inputs including previous streamflow and precipitation and current high flow and medium flow during the calibration period the r2 for station 07 068 000 are 0 79 0 80 and 0 87 the r2 for station 07 050 500 are 0 67 0 81 and 0 87 the r2 for station 09 505 800 are 0 64 0 68 and 0 65 the performance of station 07 068 000 and 07 050 500 for different classifications are higher than those of station 09505800 4 3 2 predictive validity predictive validity is used to assess the fitting performance between the observed values and the modelled values with the validation input output samples which had not been used to obtain the parameters of the dbn models the predicative validation results of three different classifications for three stations were shown in fig 5 and table 4 for station 07068000 the performance of the models for group 1 during the validation period have the rmse of 117 23 mae of 45 16 mdape of 8 51 and r2 of 0 86 for station 09505800 the performance of group 1 has the rmse of 0 30 mae of 0 07 mdape of 9 48 and r2 of 0 98 respectively during the validation period the r2 for station 07 068 000 are 0 86 0 90 and 0 97 the r2 for station 07 050 500 are 0 69 0 94 and 0 96 the r2 for station 09 505 800 are 0 98 0 60 and 0 60 for different groups however the performance of station 07 068 000 and 07 050 500 for different classifications are higher than those of station 09505800 the mean and variance of daily streamflow at station 09 505 800 is much smaller than those of two other stations the results indicated that the framework can be more effectively for streamflow forecasting at the station which has a large mean and variance of daily streamflow 4 3 3 structure validity structure validity is used to evaluate the relationship between each model input to model output according to pmi results the sort of the selected inputs for group 1 at station 07068000 from most important to least was s t 1 s t 2 s t 3 s t 8 s t 15 and s t 14 the scatter plot of model inputs the first fourth versus the current streamflow s t presented in fig 6 and it is obvious that the output s t has a very close relationship with the input variable s t 1 and has a slightly less scatter relationship with s t 2 s t 3 and s t 8 at low flow fig 6a at low flow the current flow is less affected by the variables related precipitation but at medium flow and high flow the current flow is affected by the variables related precipitation and s t is more correlated with r t 1 at the high flow than that at the medium flow according to the table s1 and fig 6 b c the input sensitivity profiles for three groups of station 07 068 000 by profile method shown in fig 7 the models for three groups could be considered physically plausible and it shows the linearity relationship between s t 1 and s t at low flow and high flow and non linearity relationship between s t 1 and s t at medium flow when the values of s t 2 are very small the streamflow increases as the other explanatory variables increases but the values of s t 2 are above 25 of the classification the streamflow will increase only the other explanatory variables are above 50 of the classification low flow has a little correlated with precipitation but high flow and medium flow has correlated relationship with precipitation the day before r t 1 and the streamflow will increase as precipitation increase only when the precipitation are below 50 of the classification and the streamflow has a small variation when precipitation are above 50 of the classification it may be caused by that soil water saturation has been achieved so precipitation cannot be transferred to streamflow replicative validity and predictive validity show the dbn models can be effectively for streamflow forecasting at different magnitudes by four statistics measures and the scatter plot of observed versus predicted streamflow for the stations in the humid region the performance of medium flow and high flow is better than that of low flow but for the station in the arid region the performance of low flow are better than that of medium flow and high flow it is very important for forecasting accurately high flow especially in the humid region and low flow in the arid region because high flow can probably cause erosion and damaging floods while low flow can reduce the amount of water available diminish water quality and harm fish it will provide more reliable information to prevent economic losses and protect the ecological environment the structure validity results show that more complex relationship of s t 1 vs s t at medium flow than that of low flow and high flow low flow has a little correlated with precipitation but high flow and medium flow has correlated relationship with precipitation the day before r t 1 and the streamflow will increase as precipitation increase only when the precipitation are below 50 of the classification and the streamflow has a small variation when precipitation are above 50 of the classification it may be caused by that soil water saturation has been achieved so precipitation cannot be transferred to streamflow structure validity results based on understanding of physical systems indicates dbn models can infer the input output relationship of streamflow system which leads to more confident results 4 4 model comparison the results of dbn and fcm pmi dbn for different stations are showed in table 5 and figs 8 and 9 from four measures fcm pmi dbn models outperforms better than those of dbn models during the calibration period and validation period especially during the validation period fcm pmi dbn have nearly 15 12 and 12 improvement of the performance than that of dbn models according to the values of r2 ranging from 0 82 to 0 95 at 07 068 000 station from 0 81 to 0 91 at 07 050 500 station and from 0 57 to 0 64 at 09 505 800 station the compared results of fcm pmi dbn model with single dbn model reveals that the framework including hydro meteorological conditions classification input selection and data driven models development evaluation will provide a better performance than those of single data driven models whether in the humid region or in the arid region in the figs 8 and 9 different colours represent the streamflow at the low medium high flow it is obvious that fcm pmi dbn models have a better fitting performance than that of single dbn model at the high flow the improvement of high flow forecasting can help to prepare for flood management and give a warning of extreme flooding events the compared results of fcm pmi dbn modes with single dbn models obviously show that the framework including hydro meteorological conditions classification input selection and data driven models development evaluation will provide a better performance than that of single data driven models whether in the humid region or in the arid region it can also be seen obviously that the performance of high flow forecasting has been greatly improved and it is essential for giving a warning of extreme flooding events and preparing for flood management 5 conclusions a classification based dbn modelling framework for daily streamflow forecasting is developed to integrate the physical understanding of different flow regimes into the modelling process and thus improve the performance of the forecasting models this framework integrates a fcm clustering classification method for streamflow regime identification an pmi based method for input selection a dbn for mapping the nonlinear relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes and a rigorous model validation process considering three aspects of model validity the fcm classification method classifies the total samples into three groups to identify the relationship between precipitation previous streamflow and low flow medium flow high flow respectively the pmi based input selection method is used to identify the inputs for different magnitude of flows and the order the importance of the inputs so the most relevant input variables are used in the model development process the dbn models are developed to map the relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes and a rigorous validation process considering replicative predictive and structure validity to evaluate the performance of dbn models the suitability of the framework is test using three case studies with different hydrological meteorological conditions the results showed that there are different inputs for different magnitude of flows the framework has significantly improved modelling performance approximately 12 compared to single data driven models developed using dbns the integration of data driven models and physical process classification provide a better understanding of the complex characteristics of different flow regimes during streamflow generation processes thus improving the overall confidence of developed daily streamflow forecasting models it has been found in this study that data driven model combined with hydrological understanding can have a high forecasting accuracy however the physical mechanisms of different flow regimes during streamflow generation processes are only identified using a classification technique alternative methods to integrate physical system understanding into the data driven modelling process needs to be investigated in future studies for example mathematical equation representing different streamflow generation processes can be integrated into data driven models which can potentially further improve forecasting performance the parameters and structure of data driven models could also be examined further in relations to different physical processes being simulated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

process classification also leads to improved integration of physical understanding of the complex characteristic of different flow regimes into the modelling process leading to overall improved confidence in the developed daily streamflow forecasting models keywords daily streamflow forecasting deep belief network rigorous model validation streamflow process classification 1 introduction streamflow forecasting is of significant importance for water resources system planning and management activities such as flooding control hydropower generation agricultural irrigation liu et al 2018 luo et al 2019 and has been a research focus for decades moradkhani et al 2004 kisi and cimen 2011 tikhamarine et al 2020 however it is still a challenging task to improve the performance of these models especially for the rivers with dramatic flow changes ghaith et al 2020 this is partially due to the fact that the whole streamflow generation process is very complex and the input output relationship also changes over time as different internal sub processes takes place in the whole process such that hydrologic behavior is different when streamflow generates at the beginning and the falling limb and when streamflow generates at the base flow and extreme flow hadi tombul 2018 boucher et al 2020 data driven models boost growth exploded for streamflow forecasting recently which are more powerful to forecast without a priori knowledge of hydrological process and have the potential to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost quilty et al 2019 wang et al 2019 different data driven methods such as auto regressive models artificial neural networks ann support vector regression svr and extreme learning machines elm have been introduced to apply in streamflow forecasting lima et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however in the majority of these studies data driven models are directly used to map the input output relationships while the physical understanding of the streamflow process is largely ignored the streamflow generation process has distinct features during different stages jain srinivasulu 2006 wu et al 2009 for example low flow events are dominated by steady base flow and high flow events are caused by random extreme rainfall events the rising limbs of streamflow generation process are influenced by the intensity and duration of rainfall and the falling limbs are dominated by the storage characteristics of the catchment parasuraman elshorbagy 2007 li et al 2017 therefore the whole streamflow generation process can be classified into different sub processes each of which can be modelled separately as demonstrated in previous studies corzo solomatine 2007 toth 2009 chu et al 2020a however in the majority of these studies traditional data driven models have been used dbn have recently been found to be an effective modelling method for mapping non linearity relationships and they have been used in applications such as language understanding cancer classification facial expression recognition hyperspectral image classification and so on sarikaya et al 2014 abdel zaher eldeib 2016 zhong et al 2017 dbn models have an efficient layer by layer learning algorithm and an initialization of the parameters extracted from the training dataset to prevent falling into local optimum and accelerate the training process mohamed et al 2011 huang et al 2014 in this study it is proposed to develop an integrated framework to incorporate physical understanding of the streamflow generation process into streamflow forecasting models using dbns this framework includes a fuzzy c means clustering fcm method for streamflow classification a partial mutual information pmi based input selection a dbn for mapping input output relationships and a rigorous validation process for model validation the framework was applied to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in usa and the performance of the framework was compared with that of single data driven models the structure of this paper is presented as follows the framework is provided in section 2 which includes the clustering classification method pmi based input selection the dbn model architecture and a rigorous model validation process the study area and data for different case studies are described in section 3 the streamflow forecasting results obtained for different case studies are presented and discussed in section 4 conclusions are provided in section 5 2 methods 2 1 physical processes of streamflow generation the underlying physical relationships of streamflow generation are very complex because of high complexity non linearity and non stationarity which still are not fully understood the whole process of streamflow generation may include many periods such as rising limbs flows close to the peak falling limbs base flows and other intermediate situations toth 2009 the relationship between the impact factors and streamflow of different periods in the sub process will follow the whole characteristic of the system but the relationship of different periods also changes to some extent in most research a single data driven model is often used to simulate the whole process of streamflow generation with the generalization of the understanding of the system however more generalization will have a bad effect on the performance of the forecasting model with ignoring the characteristics of different periods therefore data driven models with different parameters should be capture the characteristics of relationship between the impact factors and streamflow corresponding to different periods respectively 2 2 overall framework a classification based dbn model framework for streamflow forecasting is shown in fig 1 there are four steps within the framework including data clustering input selection model development and validation the first step is data classification the dataset may be clustered into different groups sub datasets of different characteristic and physical process and fcm method was employed to classify the total input output dataset into several sub datasets for example three sub datasets representing the relationship between the inputs and low medium and high flow the second step is input selection and pmi method was applied to screen the significant inputs of streamflow at different magnitudes as the inputs of each data driven model the third step is data driven model development where dbn models were built in this study finally a rigorous model validation process proposed by humphrey et al 2017 is used model validation is an important step to evaluate the effectiveness of data driven model details of fcm pmi dbn and rigorous model validation are provided section 2 3 2 6 below 2 3 data classification fcm the fuzzy c means fcm is developed based on the fuzzy set theory to classify the input output datasets into different groups according to similarity it is relatively insensitive to initializations and produces more appropriate classification results with less computation gou et al 2015 jahangoshai rezaee et al 2018 the fcm approach can classify the total dataset into several groups by determining the distinct clusters using cluster center and membership matrix on the basis of minimizing the objective function below 1 f i 1 k j 1 n u ij m x i c j 2 where m is a fuzzier representing the level of cluster fuzziness n is the number of input output samples k is the number of clusters x i is the ith samples u ij is the degree that the sample x i belongs to one group c j and c j is the center of one group silva filho et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 fcm approach starts with random selection of the initial group centers and computes the degree of the samples based on the distance between the samples and each center according to the largest degree it divides all the samples into k clusters and recalculate the center of new group and update the center of each group until satisfy the iteration criterion chuang et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 2 4 data driven modelling process 2 4 1 input selection pmi input selection is an essential process of data driven model which can determine the inputs that best characterize the underlying input output relationship prasad et al 2017 partial mutual information pmi originates from the improvement of mutual information mi that pmi can remove redundant dependencies among all the inputs by considering both input significance and input dependence may et al 2008a marković et al 2013 fang et al 2018 in the selection process the input with the highest mi was selected firstly however there are redundant information among the selected inputs and the residual inputs and it will have an impact on the results of the screening variables if the information are considered repeatedly may et al 2008b therefore pmi method should calculate the marginal pdf with the transformation of the residual information between the outputand inputs under the consideration of the effect of already screening inputs by mi frenzel and pompe 2007 fernando et al 2009 more details of the transformation process can be find in may et al 2011 2 4 2 model development dbn dbn has attracted many attentions in the application of image recognition and time series forecasting as an efficient method developed on the basis of the traditional ann models the structure of dbn model is also comprised of inputs layer hidden layer and output layer like the other ann models mohamed et al 2012a 2012b wang et al 2016 in the hidden layer there is a special structure with a two layer neural network called restricted boltzmann machine rbm which can be trained layerwise to help dbn models to achieve a good performance and prevent from the over fitting problems shen et al 2015 the energy of a joint configuration of the hidden and visible units of rbm can be defined as 3 e v h θ i 1 m a i v i j 1 n b j h j i 1 m j 1 n v i w ij h j where θ w a b w represents the symmetric weight between the hidden and visible units a represents the visible unit bias b represents the hidden unit bias then the probability that an rbm assigns to a visible layer is 4 p v h 1 z e e v h given v i and h j defines as the states of visible layer i and hidden layer j and it can be seen that the units of hidden layer are conditionally independent of the units of visible layer so the units of a binary hidden layer can be 5 p vi p v i 1 1 1 exp j w ij h j 6 p hj p h j 1 1 1 exp i w ij v i the weights can be updated according to the gradient of the log likelihood pinaya et al 2016 there are two important parts including pre training and fine tuning stage in the parameterized process khatami et al 2017 at the pre training stage the initial weights of dbn models has been initialized by layer by layer unsupervised learning algorithm and the output of rbm can be input into the visible layer of the next rbm mohamed et al 2010 kuremoto et al 2014 at the fine tuning stage the weights of the whole structures need to be slightly adjusted by the gradient descent algorithm the training process can prevent from local convergence and make the performance better lopes and ribeiro 2014 2 4 3 the rigorous validation process a rigorous validation process proposed by humphrey et al 2017 is used in this paper the process considers replicative validity predictive validity and structural validity most of data driven models for streamflow forecasting often include replicative validity and predictive validity but structure validity is often overlooked which can compensate for the explanation of physical mechanism lack of data driven model biondi et al 2012 humphrey et al 2017 therefore all three aspects of validity are considered in the model validation step in this study a scatter plot of observed versus forecasted streamflow has been employed to visually represent the fitting performance of the model if the data distributes along the 1 1 line it means the model fits well between the observed and predicted streamflow bennett et al 2013 found that it is very suitable for representing the forecasting performance of different magnitudes of streamflow such as low medium and high flow four measures including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae median absolute percentage error mdape and coefficient of determination r2 are calculated in the paper four measures can evaluate the deviation between the observed value and the forecasted value from different perspectives and more detailed can be found in dawson et al 2007 and chu et al 2020b the profile method is used to conduct the structure validity and guarantee that the model can represent plausible physical input output response that is this method can check whether that the model can simulate the streamflow response in terms of the precipitation as the hydrological processes system not just fit well with the data lek et al 1995 young et al 2011 2 5 experiment setup the framework of fcm pmi dbn with a rigorous validation process considering replicative predictive and structure validity was developed and used to test the applicability to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in usa the framework is also compared to single data driven models developed using dbns to illustrate the impact of considering different streamflow regimes using classification methods the comparison results include predictive and replicative validation results for all three stations and structure validation results are just provided for station 07 068 000 to illustrate the physical understanding that could be obtained from using structure validation methods 3 case studies the case studies include two regions with different climate characteristics in the humid south and arid southwest region of usa fig 2 there are three gauging stations 07 068 000 36 62 n 90 83 w 07 050 500 36 42 n 93 62 w and 09 505 800 34 57 n 111 68 w in the current river kings river and verde river respectively current river 296 km runs through ozarks and northeastern arkansas and then runs into the white river a tributary of mississippi river the upstream of current river is located at doniphan missouri where the drainage area is approximately 5200 km2 this part of the basin is contained entirely within the ozarks in missouri average annual rainfall in the region are 1000 1200 mm and average annual temperature ranges from 15 to 18 c large floods generally are caused by intense rainfall during the winter or late spring relatively impermeable soils contribute to flashy runoff events kings river runs through madison and carroll counties to its confluence with the white river arm of table rock lake located on the missouri arkansas border the drainage area is approximately 1365 km2 and average annual rainfall in the region is about 1000 mm verde river is located in the watershed of colorado river which is included in the state of arizona the river flows from many springs near the confluence with granite creek to below camp verde the streamflow station is located at the middle of verde river average annual rainfall in the region ranges about 254 mm to about 1016 mm and average annual temperature ranges from 6 c to 17 c in this paper daily precipitation data with the same time period of the corresponding streamflow station were collected streamflow data comes from three streamflow stations of current river in doniphan missouri 07068000 kings river near berryville arkansas 07050500 and west clear creek near camp verde arizona 09505800 in this paper daily streamflow data from 07 068 000 station between june 1921 and october 2019 07 050 500 station between november 1992 and october 2019 and 09 505 800 station between july 1977 and september 2019 table 1 shows the statistics of streamflow and precipitation of three stations the average and standard deviation of daily streamflow in the humid region are greater than those of the arid region the characteristics of three streamflow stations are different and represent the relationship between streamflow and precipitation under different climate conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 data classification the initial inputs has 31 variables including 16 precipitation related inputs r t r t 1 r t 15 15 streamflow related inputs s t 1 s t 15 r t 1 and s t 1 means precipitation and streamflow of the day before one output variable is current streamflow at daily scales s t one input output sample includes 31 inputs and one output there are 35879 9815 and 15 400 input output samples in the three stations respectively these samples will be classified into three different groups subsets or classifications representing the relationship between precipitation and streamflow at low medium and high flow scales respectively using fcm classification method samples were classified into three subsets for three stations respectively the results were shown in the fig 3 there are 25 266 group 1 g1 green circles 7870 group 2 g2 blue circles and 2743 group 3 g3 red circles samples in three subsets for station 07068000 and the average streamflow are 55 m3 s 122 m3 s and 195 m3 s the average daily precipitation for different classifications are 2 mm 4 mm and 8 mm there are 7157 1331 and 987 samples in three subsets for station 07050500 and the average streamflow are 8 m3 s 37 m3 s and 52 m3 s there are 11249 2803 and 1348 samples in three subsets for station 09505800 and the average streamflow are 1 m3 s 2 m3 s and 9 m3 s it is clear from the figures that the samples of group 1 represent the relationship between low flow and precipitation and the samples of group 2 and 3 represent the relationship between medium flow high flow and precipitation respectively the classification results by fcm method reveal that the low flow regime has the most number of data points followed by is the medium flow and high flow regimes the low flow regime always has the highest number of data points after classification no matter where the stations are located because it is an important component of the flow regime in any river or stream and the classification results are consistent with the physical processes the high flow regime has the least number of data points after classification and it is more difficult to model high flow regime as there are less data 4 2 input selection the pmi based input selection method was employed to identify the final inputs for streamflow at different groups table s1 appendix s1 shows the order of candidate inputs first twenty selected by pmi method according the results of table s1 the results indicates that s t 1 is more related with s t than the other inputs the final inputs selected for each data subsets are summarised in table 2 according to aic criterion may et al 2011 for group 1 low flow of station 07068000 the inputs for model includes s t 1 s t 2 s t 3 s t 8 s t 15 and s t 14 for group 1 of station 07050500 the inputs for model includes s t 1 s t 2 s t 10 s t 14 s t 15 s t 3 and r t for group 1 of station 09505800 the inputs for model includes s t 2 s t 6 s t 11 s t 13 and s t 3 from input selection results by pmi method it is obvious that the daily streamflow with a lag of one day s t 1 is always selected as the inputs firstly for different magnitudes of three stations with different characteristic of hydrological meteorological conditions and it is probably that the most recent inputs always have a high impact due to system memory for low flow s t just has a strong relationship with only previous streamflow and has little relationship with precipitation and for medium flow s t has a strong relationship with previous streamflow and precipitation and for high flow s t has a strong relationship with previous streamflow and precipitation which has more lag days than that of medium flow for streamflow station in arid region s t has a stronger relationship with precipitation of more lagged time according to the order of inputs probably it is because low flow is an integral component of a flow regime of any river and it takes a longer time to convert precipitation into streamflow in the arid region 4 3 model validation 4 3 1 replicative validity the replicative validation results were used to assess the fitting performance between the observed values and the modelled values with the training input output samples which had been used to obtain the parameters of the dbn models the replicative validation results of three different classifications for three stations were examined using the rmse mae mdape and r2 the replicative validation results are obtained in fig 4 and table 3 for station 07068000 the performance for group 1 during the calibration period have the rmse of 67 97 mae of 28 20 mdape of 9 20 and r2 of 0 79 respectively it can be demonstrated that the framework can map the relationship between the previous streamflow and current low flow the performance of the models for group 2 and group 3 also show that the model can simulate the relationship between the inputs including previous streamflow and precipitation and current high flow and medium flow during the calibration period the r2 for station 07 068 000 are 0 79 0 80 and 0 87 the r2 for station 07 050 500 are 0 67 0 81 and 0 87 the r2 for station 09 505 800 are 0 64 0 68 and 0 65 the performance of station 07 068 000 and 07 050 500 for different classifications are higher than those of station 09505800 4 3 2 predictive validity predictive validity is used to assess the fitting performance between the observed values and the modelled values with the validation input output samples which had not been used to obtain the parameters of the dbn models the predicative validation results of three different classifications for three stations were shown in fig 5 and table 4 for station 07068000 the performance of the models for group 1 during the validation period have the rmse of 117 23 mae of 45 16 mdape of 8 51 and r2 of 0 86 for station 09505800 the performance of group 1 has the rmse of 0 30 mae of 0 07 mdape of 9 48 and r2 of 0 98 respectively during the validation period the r2 for station 07 068 000 are 0 86 0 90 and 0 97 the r2 for station 07 050 500 are 0 69 0 94 and 0 96 the r2 for station 09 505 800 are 0 98 0 60 and 0 60 for different groups however the performance of station 07 068 000 and 07 050 500 for different classifications are higher than those of station 09505800 the mean and variance of daily streamflow at station 09 505 800 is much smaller than those of two other stations the results indicated that the framework can be more effectively for streamflow forecasting at the station which has a large mean and variance of daily streamflow 4 3 3 structure validity structure validity is used to evaluate the relationship between each model input to model output according to pmi results the sort of the selected inputs for group 1 at station 07068000 from most important to least was s t 1 s t 2 s t 3 s t 8 s t 15 and s t 14 the scatter plot of model inputs the first fourth versus the current streamflow s t presented in fig 6 and it is obvious that the output s t has a very close relationship with the input variable s t 1 and has a slightly less scatter relationship with s t 2 s t 3 and s t 8 at low flow fig 6a at low flow the current flow is less affected by the variables related precipitation but at medium flow and high flow the current flow is affected by the variables related precipitation and s t is more correlated with r t 1 at the high flow than that at the medium flow according to the table s1 and fig 6 b c the input sensitivity profiles for three groups of station 07 068 000 by profile method shown in fig 7 the models for three groups could be considered physically plausible and it shows the linearity relationship between s t 1 and s t at low flow and high flow and non linearity relationship between s t 1 and s t at medium flow when the values of s t 2 are very small the streamflow increases as the other explanatory variables increases but the values of s t 2 are above 25 of the classification the streamflow will increase only the other explanatory variables are above 50 of the classification low flow has a little correlated with precipitation but high flow and medium flow has correlated relationship with precipitation the day before r t 1 and the streamflow will increase as precipitation increase only when the precipitation are below 50 of the classification and the streamflow has a small variation when precipitation are above 50 of the classification it may be caused by that soil water saturation has been achieved so precipitation cannot be transferred to streamflow replicative validity and predictive validity show the dbn models can be effectively for streamflow forecasting at different magnitudes by four statistics measures and the scatter plot of observed versus predicted streamflow for the stations in the humid region the performance of medium flow and high flow is better than that of low flow but for the station in the arid region the performance of low flow are better than that of medium flow and high flow it is very important for forecasting accurately high flow especially in the humid region and low flow in the arid region because high flow can probably cause erosion and damaging floods while low flow can reduce the amount of water available diminish water quality and harm fish it will provide more reliable information to prevent economic losses and protect the ecological environment the structure validity results show that more complex relationship of s t 1 vs s t at medium flow than that of low flow and high flow low flow has a little correlated with precipitation but high flow and medium flow has correlated relationship with precipitation the day before r t 1 and the streamflow will increase as precipitation increase only when the precipitation are below 50 of the classification and the streamflow has a small variation when precipitation are above 50 of the classification it may be caused by that soil water saturation has been achieved so precipitation cannot be transferred to streamflow structure validity results based on understanding of physical systems indicates dbn models can infer the input output relationship of streamflow system which leads to more confident results 4 4 model comparison the results of dbn and fcm pmi dbn for different stations are showed in table 5 and figs 8 and 9 from four measures fcm pmi dbn models outperforms better than those of dbn models during the calibration period and validation period especially during the validation period fcm pmi dbn have nearly 15 12 and 12 improvement of the performance than that of dbn models according to the values of r2 ranging from 0 82 to 0 95 at 07 068 000 station from 0 81 to 0 91 at 07 050 500 station and from 0 57 to 0 64 at 09 505 800 station the compared results of fcm pmi dbn model with single dbn model reveals that the framework including hydro meteorological conditions classification input selection and data driven models development evaluation will provide a better performance than those of single data driven models whether in the humid region or in the arid region in the figs 8 and 9 different colours represent the streamflow at the low medium high flow it is obvious that fcm pmi dbn models have a better fitting performance than that of single dbn model at the high flow the improvement of high flow forecasting can help to prepare for flood management and give a warning of extreme flooding events the compared results of fcm pmi dbn modes with single dbn models obviously show that the framework including hydro meteorological conditions classification input selection and data driven models development evaluation will provide a better performance than that of single data driven models whether in the humid region or in the arid region it can also be seen obviously that the performance of high flow forecasting has been greatly improved and it is essential for giving a warning of extreme flooding events and preparing for flood management 5 conclusions a classification based dbn modelling framework for daily streamflow forecasting is developed to integrate the physical understanding of different flow regimes into the modelling process and thus improve the performance of the forecasting models this framework integrates a fcm clustering classification method for streamflow regime identification an pmi based method for input selection a dbn for mapping the nonlinear relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes and a rigorous model validation process considering three aspects of model validity the fcm classification method classifies the total samples into three groups to identify the relationship between precipitation previous streamflow and low flow medium flow high flow respectively the pmi based input selection method is used to identify the inputs for different magnitude of flows and the order the importance of the inputs so the most relevant input variables are used in the model development process the dbn models are developed to map the relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes and a rigorous validation process considering replicative predictive and structure validity to evaluate the performance of dbn models the suitability of the framework is test using three case studies with different hydrological meteorological conditions the results showed that there are different inputs for different magnitude of flows the framework has significantly improved modelling performance approximately 12 compared to single data driven models developed using dbns the integration of data driven models and physical process classification provide a better understanding of the complex characteristics of different flow regimes during streamflow generation processes thus improving the overall confidence of developed daily streamflow forecasting models it has been found in this study that data driven model combined with hydrological understanding can have a high forecasting accuracy however the physical mechanisms of different flow regimes during streamflow generation processes are only identified using a classification technique alternative methods to integrate physical system understanding into the data driven modelling process needs to be investigated in future studies for example mathematical equation representing different streamflow generation processes can be integrated into data driven models which can potentially further improve forecasting performance the parameters and structure of data driven models could also be examined

4769,a finite element model was developed for the hydraulic design of subsurface drip irrigation subunits the governing differential equation for steady state water flow in a multi outlet pipeline was derived according to the energy and mass conservation equations and was discretized using the galerkin method an equation system containing unknown hydraulic heads was constructed and solved using direct stiffness algorithm and gaussian elimination the local head loss from the emitter was calculated as a fraction of the kinetic head the emitter flow rate and its variation were evaluated using an analytical expression of positive soil water pressure and a log transformation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the model adopted a virtual emitter concept which allowed for rapid convergence on an ordinary computer the finite element formulation made the model capable of analyzing both branched and looped pipe network systems a matlab software script was developed and the hydraulic performance of subsurface drip irrigation subunits was analyzed the results indicate that a higher number of elements discretized in a pipe led to a higher accuracy of the model with 20 elements being sufficient the subsurface drip irrigation subunit can be recognized as an integrated water energy dissipation system the average value and uniformity of emitter flow rate were determined by the pipe system and soil hydraulic properties the designed maximum lateral length of a drip and a subsurface drip irrigation subunit was different in the presented design example that difference was determined by the emitter nominal flow rate and variation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity keywords subsurface drip irrigation hydraulic model soil hydraulic property flow rate irrigation uniformity 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is one of the most effective water saving techniques to alleviate water shortage in agricultural production it has the advantage of minimizing water loss by evaporation runoff and deep percolation camp 1998 similar to a drip irrigation di system a subunit is the basic pipe network unit of a subsurface drip irrigation system and is made up of a manifold and multiple laterals with emitters installed to deliver water from sources to the root zone of agricultural plants fig 1 water application uniformity is the most crucial design criterion because it determines not only the crop yield and quality but also the soil infiltration process assouline 2019 spatial variability of the emitter flow rate in the field leads to local over or inadequate irrigation assuming that emitter clogging problems are controlled a lack of sufficient uniformity is mainly caused by the variation of pressure heads due to both the elevation changes and the head losses along the pipe lines as well as by the manufacturer coefficient of variation and the number of emitters per plant provenzano 2005 therefore a hydraulic model that accurately evaluates the pressure head distribution is important for determining the appropriate design of a sdi pipe system and ensuring the soil and water conservation numerous hydraulic calculation methods have been developed and successfully applied to the analysis and design of di system analytical formulation are widely accepted to directly calculate the pressure head variation or emitter flow rate alonge a multi outlet lateral pipe zayani et al 2001 keshtgar et al 2013 baiamonte 2018 without requiring numerical and computer aided techniques the design variables such as maximum lateral length is then determined manually the iterative based approach howell and hiler 1974 pinthong et al 2013 which is often called back step method was utilized to expand the hydraulic calculation from a single lateral to a subunit an assumed pressure at the pipe end is needed to make the calculated pressure at the pipe inlet coincide with the given value the water distribution uniformity can be therefore simulated however the current hydraulic models are seldom applicable to the sdi system in china the hydraulic design of sdi subunits can only follow the standard used for surface drip irrigation one difficulty in the design of sdi systems is that the pipe network of an sdi subunit adopts a looped form an extra manifold connects all the lateral ends and is used for flushing the underground pipe system fig 1 the flow direction is difficult to predict which makes the analytical model invalid and iterative method inefficient meanwhile the buried emitter discharge was found to decrease by 10 50 compared with the nominal value without being plugged shani et al 1996 when the discharge is higher than the soil infiltration capacity a positive water pressure philip 1992 exists at the emitter soil interface consequentially decreasing the pressure gradient across the emitter predictions of emitter flow rate and its variation in a sdi subunit are rarely reported the designed average emitter flow rate typically determines the irrigation scheduling and quantity therefore the effects of soil hydraulic property and its spatial variation on emitter flow rate and uniformity should be considered in the design of the sdi subunits the hydraulic performance of sdi subunits should be analyzed and compared with that of di subunits with the availability of a personal computer bralts and segerlind 1985 first proposed a finite element model to analyze microirrigation subunits and the model was modified for different engineering application purposes mohtar et al 1991 the finite element method has been proved to be able to analyze the hydraulic performance of looped drip irrigation subunits wang et al 2016 and can be potentially used for a sdi system a system of equations is constructed to solve for the pressure heads in a pipe network the number of equations is determined by the number of emitters wang and chen 2020 which makes the method being computational expensive the solution process of the finite element method therefore will become cumbersome due to the excessive number of emitters in a large subunit it is important to find a way to improve the model by decreasing the number of elements needed for approximating the pressure head distribution a decrease in the number of elements helps to improve the computational efficiency the optimal design of large municipal water distribution systems has experienced a significant improvement using evolutionary algorithms reca and martinez 2006 wang et al 2017 cunha and marques 2020 the design optimization is normally based on the hydraulic solver epanet rossman 2000 which provides hydraulic simulations to predict the behavior of water distribution systems similarly for the di and sdi subunits a hydraulic model with high accuracy and computational efficiency is essentially needed which may ease the application of an artificial intelligence algorithm in the optimal design process another concern is that the local head loss from the emitter is often neglected or considered according to the equivalent length in the current hydraulic models that may lead to an underestimation of pressure loss and erroneous design of the pipe system many studies have in fact successfully proposed the calculation methods of local emitter head loss the most commonly used methods in these studies are laboratory experiments provenzano and pumo 2004 wang et al 2020 computational fluid dynamic procedure palau salvador et al 2006 wang et al 2018 and dimensional analysis approaches vilaça et al 2017 the local head losses of on line emitters integrated in line emitters and non coaxial emitters are usually calculated as a fraction of the kinetic head the fraction is determined by the geometric characteristic of the emitter pipe system bagarello et al 1997 the importance of the local head loss in the design of drip irrigation systems has been emphasized by previous studies al amoud 1995 juana et al 2002 yildirim 2010 how to integrate the existing research results into the finite element model to improve accuracy is the task of this study based on the above considerations the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a finite element based model for the hydraulic analysis and design of sdi subunits considering the effect of the soil hydraulic property 2 improve the accuracy of the simulated pressure heads by calculating the local head loss as a fraction of the kinetic head and decrease the required computational efforts and 3 analyze the average emitter flow rate and irrigation uniformity of sdi subunits the hydraulic performacne of di and sdi subunits is compared finally a design example is provided 2 method as shown in fig 1 water is continuously discharged by the emitters along the direction of flow inside the lateral the velocity varies at each pipe section between two consecutive emitters of the lateral the pressure head distribution and emitter flow rates in a subsurface drip irrigation subunit are stable the subunit is s steady state water flow system with one inlet and multiple outlets inlet pressure head and outflow discharge are the boundary conditions chosen for the inlet and outlets of the flow system a differential equation governing the hydraulic head distribution in an element of the subunit grid is developed and is similar to that used for solving one dimensional steady state heat transfer problems the basic logic of the finite element formulation procedure adheres to the concept of a virtual emitter system proposed by bralts et al 1993 multiple emitters can be integrated as one virtual emission node which allows for the concentration of the solution matrix into a more compact virtual node matrix 2 1 development of governing differential equation fig 2

reynolds number is less than 100 000 von bernuth and wilson 1989 taking the length of pipe l equivalent to the length of the element dx eq 7 can be rewritten in a generalized form in terms of fluid

empirical hazen williams equation is used to evaluate the friction loss the pipe flow exponent m in eq 8 becomes 1 852 and the pipe coefficient b changes to 10 b 5 93 c 1 852 a 0 586 where c is the hazen williams coefficient a is the cross section area of pipe m2 local head loss of a single emitter is shown in fig 2 as a sharp drop in the energy grade line and calculated as the sum of the energy drop due to the contraction and subsequent enlargement of the flow bagarello et al 1997 as follows 11 h l α v 2 2 g where hl is the local head loss m α is the local loss coefficient which is determined by a specific pipe emitter scheme bagarello et al 1997 provenzano and pumo 2004 in order to simplify the model it is assumed that the exponent of fluid velocity in eq 11 equals the pipe flow exponent m in eq 8 then eq 11 can be converted to 12 h l α v m 2 g d x d x combining eqs 8 and 12 eq 4 can be arranged as 13 h x d x b α 2 g d x v m d x 0 fluid velocity is solved by eq 13

into eq 18 results in the differential equation as 19 d x 2 h x 2 d x q 0 where d x a c x a b α 2 g δ x 1 m δ h δ x 1 m m with dimension m3 s 1 the empirical relationship between the pressure head and emitter flow rate wu et al 1979 can be expressed as follows 20 q k h x e where q is emitter discharge m3 s 1 k is the emission coefficient m3 xe s 1 xe is the emission exponent dimensionless when an emitter is used for subsurface drip irrigation as a buried point source the soil infiltration capacity affects emitter flow rate a spherical saturated region is developed around the steady state discharge point with soil water under positive pressure philip 1992 it was proved that this pressure is higher for soils with lower hydraulic conductivity the positive pressure leads to a decrease in the hydraulic gradient across the emitter orifice the flow rate can be calculated as gil et al 2008 21 q k h h s x e where hs is the positive pressure head at the emitter soil interface often called the back pressure m philip 1992 developed an analytical expression to determine the pressure at the discharge point in a permanent flow regime shani et al 1996 applied that expression and related hs with the soil hydrophysical properties the cavity size of the source outlet and the emitter flow rate as 22 h s 2 α 0 r 0 8 π k s r 0 q 1 α 0 where a0 is the fitting parameter of the exponential model for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity proposed by gardner 1958 m 1 ro is the formed spherical cavity radius m ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 the value for q follows by simultaneously solving eqs 21 and 22 the hydraulic conductivity parameters ks and a0 vary throughout the field the variation of soil hydraulic properties affects the water application uniformity in previous studies saturated hydraulic conductivity has been represented by a log normal distribution warrick et al 1977 a log transformation ksi can be taken with 23 k si l n k si the estimation of the average k s and the standard deviation σ k s of ksi is warrick 2003 24 k s e x p k s 0 5 σ k s 2 25 σ k s 2 e x p 2 k s σ k s 2 e x p σ k s 2 1 where k s and σ k s are the average and the standard

corresponding ksi is 28 k si e x p k s σ k s z where z is a normal random variable with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 the values of k s σ k s and z for a specific soil are used to create random number ksi which is added in eq 22 to calculate the back pressure head the distribution of parameter a0 is calculated by the following relation warrick et al 1977 29 ln α 0 i α 0 σ α 0 ρ ln k si k s σ k s z 1 ρ 2 0 5 where α 0 and σ α 0 are the average and the standard deviation of lna respectively ρ is the correlation coefficient between ks and α0 α0 lnα0 for ρ 0 α0 is independent of ks and for ρ 1 α0 is solely dependent upon ks the finite element model adopts the virtual emitter concept to decrease the memory requirement of the computer and to facilitate convergence the irrigation pipe is discretized into elements each element can contain any number of emitters the outflow of one element is virtually integrated as from one emitter the pressure head is estimated as the average value of previous approximations of pressure heads at both ends of the pipe element the outflow is incorporated into eq 19 using two different methods method 1 when both sides of eq 19 are divided by the length of the element the outflow is calculated as the sum of emitters average flow rate 30 1 n q i dx nk h x e δ x q e where h is the average pressure head m n is the number of emitters in an element for a drip system h h x h x d x 2 and for a subsurface drip system h h x h sx h x d x h sx d x 2 method 2 the emitter flow equation is linearized in terms of pressure head h resulting in 31 1 n q i dx nk h x e 1 δ x h nk h x e 1 δ x h n k h x e 1 δ x z g h q z z for the manifold element where there is no emitter installed eq 19 therefore changes to 32 d x 2 h x 2 0 according to eqs 19 30 and 31 the one dimensional differential equation governing hydraulic heads for any pipe element in a drip irrigation subunit can be summarized as 33 d x 2 h x 2 g h q 0 where dx g and q q qzz qe are the coefficients and determined by the element type and evaluation methods of element outflow the coefficients are summarized in table 1 2 2 solution of governing differential equation the galerkin method is then used to solve eq 33 numerically it is one of the weighted residual methods in which an approximate solution is substituted into the differential equation a residual term results and is multiplied by a weighting function the integral of the product is required to be zero 34 0 1 w x d x 2 h x 2 g h q d x 0 where w x is the weighting function polynomial function or so called hat function is used to obtain both the approximate equation and the weighting function as required by the galerkin method two equations are generated by evaluating the weighted residual integral for an element with two nodes as 35 r e k e h e f e k e dx l 1 1 1 1 gl 6 2 1 1 2 c 1 e c 2 e c 2 e c 1 e is the element stiffness matrix h e h s h t is the vector containing element nodal hydraulic head values and f e q z l 2 z s z t q e l 2 1 1 g s g t is the element force vector the element matrices are assembled using a direct stiffness algorithm segerlind 1984 and yield a system of equations that have the general global matrix form 36 k h f 0 the hydraulic heads are obtained by solving the system eq 36 the static pressure heads are calculated by h h z other quantities of interest can be calculated subsequently for this study two frequently used parameters are selected to evaluate the irrigation uniformity the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 37 cu 1 σ q q where σ q is the mean absolute flow sd q is the average value of emitter flow rates due to hydraulic variation m3 s 1 the emission uniformity eu keller and karmelli 1974 38 eu 1 1 27 c vm n q min q where n is the number of emitters per plant qmin is the minimum emitter flow rate m3 s 1 cvm is the emitter coefficient of manufacturing variation 3 example implementation a computer program was developed using matlab software the mathworks inc natick ma usa to solve for the hydraulic heads in drip irrigation subunits with the finite element method the solution procedure is with several iterations and uses the following calculation steps as shown in fig 3 1 the physical parameters of the emitter pipe and soil are identified as input data the numbering strategy of the pipe elements and nodes is determined 2 the initial approximation hydraulic heads and emitter flow rates is provided to calculate the coefficients dx g and q this is carried out differently for methods 1 and 2 the initial approximation of emitter flow rates is needed for a subsurface drip system to calculate the back pressure and coefficients in eqs 30 and 31 3 the element stiffness matrices are generated using the galerkin method a system of linearized equations containing a global matrix is constructed by assembling the element stiffness matrices according to the numbering strategy 4 the system of linearized equations is solved using gaussian elimination 5 the coefficients dx g and q are recalculated using the most recent value of hydraulic heads and emitter flow rates solved this step repeats steps 3 and 4 6 the iterations are stopped when the nodal hydraulic head values converge to a desired accuracy the element stiffness matrices in step 3 are generated by solving the governing differential equation eq 33 which is different from the previous finite element method bralts and segerlind 1985 wang and chen 2020 the lateral is discretized into elements which can contain any number of emitters the outflow of a single element is virtually taken as the sum of the emitters flow rate as shown in eqs 30 and 31 the number of elements is not necessarily equal to the number of emitters which help to improve the computational efficiency a surface drip irrigation pipe system in fig 4 is chosen firstly as an example to be analyzed with the model the pipe network is composed of a branched and looped system with two manifolds and three laterals the manifold consists of elements 4 8 12 13 and 14 six emitters are located at emission nodes 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 on laterals the pressure head at inlet node 13 is 20 m and the other physical parameters are listed in table 2 based on the direct stiffness algorithm and numbering strategy the element matrix is added to the globe stiffness matrix by the nodal number it connects as shown in fig 4 solid and dashed lines in fig 5 illustrate the lateral and manifold element respectively the stiffness matrix is symmetrical diagonally dominant and banded fig 5 there are 12 unknown hydraulic heads in this problem the numbering scheme is not unique but is preferred to minimize the bandwidth of the system of equations as suggested by bralts and segerlind 1985 table 3 presents the results of the solved nodal pressure heads shown in fig 4 all solution procedures were performed using the same computer cpu 3 0 ghz ram 8 0 gb the convergence was guaranteed when a reasonable initial hydraulic heads estimate was used in this study approximated hydraulic head decreased gradually by a step size of 0 01 m with each decrease of node number minimum value occurred at node 1 and maximum value equaled the given inlet pressure there was not a standard method to make the initial guess and this method worked well furthermore the dimensionless energy gradient concept wu and gitlin 1974 was a suitable alternative as suggested by bralts and segerlind 1985 the solved pressure heads were essentially the same for the two methods of incorporating emitter outflow in the differential equation the solution was obtained in less than seven iterations with computation time less than 0 03 s as revealed in table 3 the pressure variation was small in the right part of the pipe system and the pressure distribution tended to be more uniform in a looped system 4 accuracy and speed of convergence the adoption of the virtual emitter concept helps to decrease the number of elements discretized in a pipe system it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy and speed of convergence of the model a lateral line at 0 02 slope was selected for the analysis to determine how many elements would be sufficient to approach the exact pressure head distribution the parameters are listed in table 4 the number of the emitter was 300 the lateral line was subdivided using an increasing number of elements from 2 to 20 the pressure heads were calculated and are illustrated in fig 6 as demonstrated for both methods the exact pressure head firstly decreased from the lateral inlet at nodal number 300 and then increased due to positive field slope the deviation from the exact solution with 300 nodes tended to be small with the increase in the number of elements the nodal pressure heads with 20 elements accurately overlapped with the exact solution whereas the solution with 4 elements also demonstrated sufficient accuracy the average emitter flow rate and uniformity cu which were around 2 6 l h 1 and 0 83 respectively showed no difference it is evident that both methods can be applied for the hydraulic analysis of lateral lines when element number is larger than four nodes however the computation time increased from 0 022 to 0 110 s when the number of elements increased from 4 to 300 while the difference in convergence speed may be acceptable for this system the convergence process would become cumbersome and unpredictable for the whole subunit with multiple laterals 5 model application 5 1 emitter flow variation along a lateral pipe the hydraulic performance of drip and subsurface drip systems was studied using the finite element model the parameters of the lateral pipe were same as those listed in table 4 with emitter number decreasing to 200 two soils were considered a sandy soil with an average saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 5 10 5 m s 1 and average parameter α0 25 m 1 and a loamy soil with ks 8 10 6 m s 1 and average parameter α0 7 m 1 for the subsurface drip irrigation the variation in soil hydraulic properties within a field causes a discrepancy in pressure buildup and consequently nonuniform emitter flow rate a coefficient cv is defined herein to evaluate the soil variability as 39 c v σ k s k s for the sandy soil with cv 0 5 a sample of random saturated hydraulic conductivity ksi was generated by eq 28 and represented by a log normal distribution the parameter α0i was determined by eq 29 with ρ 1 the sample was assigned to each emission node to evaluate the flow rate the back pressures were obtained along with the solution of pressure heads and emitter flows the frequency histogram of back pressure also resembled a log normal distribution which was skewed to the left rather than being symmetric as shown in fig 7 the accumulated number of back pressures in the range of 0 37 0 51 m accounted for the highest in the sample similar to the pressure head in fig 6 flow rate generally decreased and then increased along the lateral line due to hydraulic variation and field slope meanwhile it fluctuated around a certain mean value due to the variation of ksi and corresponding back pressure the emitter flow in the subsurface drip system was determined by energy loss in the pipe system in addition to the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties fig 8 compares the emitter flow rate variation along the lateral pipe in air drip system and sandy and loamy soil subsurface drip system with cv 0 1 as expected the flow rate decreased due to the back pressure in soil the average flow was 3 36 3 29 and 2 93 l h 1 for the air sand and loam respectively the reduction increased with the decrease in hydraulic conductivity a finding that agrees with that emphasized by lazarovitch et al 2006 lamm and rogers 2017 observed that the emitter flow decreased in a subsurface drip system whereas the emitter was found not to be clogged when dug out of soil this model can be an efficient tool to evaluate the drop in discharge in terms of soil hydraulic properties the effect of nominal emitter flow rate q0 on the flow distribution of a subsurface drip system is illustrated in fig 9 using the sandy soil with cv 0 5 higher nominal flow rate increased the velocity and head loss in the pipe thus causing a higher pressure head and flow rate variation along the pipe line the flow rate decreased from 3 87 and 7 44 l h 1 to 3 18 and 4 25 l h 1 for q0 4 and 8 l h 1 on the other hand higher q0 increased the build up back pressure and further expanded the effect of soil variability on flow rate change the degree of dispersion of flow rate was higher for higher nominal flow rate the decrease in average discharge from its nominal value was 4 69 19 44 and 42 04 for 2 4 and 8 l h 1 respectively 5 2 emitter flow variation in a subunit the emitter pressure head and flow rate distribution were studied for a subunit with 45 laterals with the same parameters as in table 4 the lateral spacing was 1 m and the slope along the lateral and manifold directions was 0 02 and 0 02 respectively cvm was considered to be zero and n was taken as one for calculating eu the soils studied were the same as the above ones with cv 0 2 the hydraulic variation was different for drip and subsurface drip systems due to the effect of soil back pressure and flow direction in the looped pipe network as shown in fig 10 for the looped system since the end of each lateral was connected by an extra manifold the flow rate and velocity increased in the laterals close to the subunit inlet resulting in a more intense drop in pressure head in this part of the laterals for example in the sandy soil the pressure head in the first lateral decreased from 9 72 to 5 42 m in the drip irrigation subunit this value decreased from 9 70 to 6 59 m on the other hand the flow rate and energy loss in the manifold connected to the lateral inlet decreased thus the pressure head in the looped system tended to be more uniform than that in the di system the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu of the pressure head was 0 82 and 0 88 for the di and sdi system in sandy soil the higher pressure head uniformity in sdi was also partially attributed to the decreased energy loss because of the declined emitter discharge and flow velocity in the pipe system the hydraulic behavior of the sdi system in the loamy soil fig 10 c was similar to that in the sandy soil whereas the emitter flow rate further decreased due to the higher back pressure resulting in a higher pressure uniformity which was 0 91 uniformity of emitter flow rate is a crucial design criterion for drip irrigation systems and is the most frequently examined parameter by previous researchers regarding the difference in water application uniformity according to the experimental investigation gil et al 2008 noted that the interaction between the emitter discharge and soil hydraulic properties acts as a self regulated mechanism which offsets the negative effect of hydraulic variation due to energy loss the water application uniformity of sdi is greater than that of di which is valid for a single lateral in homogeneous soil taking spatial variability of soil properties into consideration lazarovitch et al 2006 developed an iteration based algorithm to calculate the emitter discharge coefficient of variation in a single lateral and found that the heterogeneity of soil leads to a decrease in dripper discharge uniformity according to the above analysis and fig 11 it is evident that the nominal flow rate and form of a pipe network also affect the change in uniformity in addition to the soil back pressure and its variation a comprehensive evaluation of water application uniformity in different drip irrigation systems was conducted for this study the effect of slope was neglected by using a horizontal manifold and laterals the other parameters were the same as in table 4 for all the cases as shown in table 5 the change in the average emitter flow rate was similar to that explained above in figs 8 and 9 for a single lateral and subunit the average back pressure hsavg increased slightly with the increase in the coefficient of variation cv however the variation of back pressure cvhs was linearly correlated to cv for the sdi subunit in sandy soil with nominal emitter flow rate q0 2 l h 1 for example the cvhs increased dramatically from 0 112 to 0 563 when cv increased from 0 1 to 0 5 it was interesting that the change in uniformity depended on not only the system type soil type nominal flow rate and cv but also the evaluation indicator selected for the surface drip irrigation system and subsurface drip system with cv 0 1 no significant difference in uniformity was observed for christiansen uniformity coefficient cu and emission uniformity eu when cu was used the effect of cv on uniformity was not obvious the uniformity of di was similar to that of sdi in sandy soil and slightly lower than that of sdi in loamy soil which was true for both a single lateral and subunit when eu was used the uniformity of sdi decreased dramatically with the increase in cv however the uniformity of sdi in sandy soil was still higher than that of di when cv 0 1 due to a lower hydraulic variation associated with the looped pipe network the difference between cu and eu can be explained by eq 38 which reveals that eu considered minimum flow rate instead of standard deviation in addition to the average value the hydraulic behavior was similar for di and sdi in sandy soil whereas it was sensitive to the soil with low permeability for loamy soil the uniformity eu decreased to 0 685 with cv 0 3 q0 2 l h 1 and 0 594 with cv 0 2 q0 4 l h 1 the data for the higher cv is not provided since the uniformity was extremely low in the simulation higher deviation of the hydraulic conductivity from the mean value led to the flow rate of certain emitters that declined to zero which was especially true for the downstream end of the pipe system this was because the soil back pressure was higher than the pressure head in the pipe due to the energy loss the emitter at these points could be considered clogged and uniformity eu declined to zero if the same amount of fertilizer were applied simultaneously with water through such a water distribution system the non point source pollution would be aggravated which should not occur in a field situation different countries have their preference of uniformity indicator for designing drip irrigation systems for example in the united states asae ep405 1 asae 2003 recommends a design eu between 0 70 and 0 95 based on type of emitter field layout and field topography the engineering design specifications of china national standard gb t 50485 2009 chinese standards 2009 suggests that cu should not be below 0 8 when evaluating the irrigation uniformity for di and sdi in homogeneous soil with high permeability both indicators are applicable for sdi in soil with low permeability eu would be a safer choice for the design of subunit pipe systems since the cu can hardly reflect the effect of the variation of soil hydraulic conductivity on the change of irrigation uniformity 5 3 example of lateral design the drip irrigation subunit is designed conventionally based on the limitation of water application uniformity in the following example the maximum lateral length lmax was selected manually to achieve the design criteria eu 0 85 by repeating the hydraulic model two emitters with the nominal flow rate q0 at 4 l h 1 k 1 27 and 2 l h 1 k 0 635 were used and the local head loss coefficient was 0 2 the slopes of laterals and the manifold were both zero the lateral number was 60 the emitter coefficient of manufacturing variation cvm required for calculating the eu was 0 01 the other parameters were the same as in table 4 as shown in table 6 as expected the lmax increased with the increase in the lateral diameter for all the cases when the lateral diameter was 16 mm the lmax was 215 5 and 183 m respectively for the sdi in sandy and loamy soil which was higher than the 141 5 m of di subunit on the condition of achieving the same irrigation uniformity eu the lmax of sdi can be longer due to a more uniform distribution of the pressure head in the looped subunits the lmax was lower for sdi in loamy soil than in sandy soil with different lateral diamters a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity caused a higher soil back pressure and further led to a higher variation of emitter flow rate and lower uniformity which is illustrated in fig 8 for the soils with the same variation of soil hydraulic conductivity cv the lmax for loamy soil was therefore shorter to decrease the pressure head variation and to compensate the more significant negative effect of the cv the total head loss ht was lower and the average pressure head havg was higher for the sdi in loamy soil which led to a higher cu compared with that of sandy soil compared with table 6 as expected the lmax in table 7 decreased for all the cases due to a higher emitter nominal flow rate qo 4 l h 1 when the lateral diameter was 16 mm the lmax decreased by 47 7 for di subunit and this value was 42 0 and 62 3 for the sdi in sandy and loamy soil a higher qo can also cause a higher soil back pressure and the corresponding variation of emitter flow rate for the same cv which was shown in fig 9 for the sdi subunit in loamy soil especially due to the effects of both low permeability and high emitter flow rate the lateral length had to be significantly shortened to achieve the same target uniformity thus the lmax was lower than that of di subunit the decrease of lmax for sdi subunit in sandy soil was small with the help of looped system as shown in table 8 when cv increased to 0 2 for qo 2 l h 1 the lmax decreased for the sdi in both soils compared with the results in table 6 this decrease was logical since a higher cv led to a decrease in eu which had been shown in table 5 the total head losses were all lower than the results in table 6 the average emitter pressure head and cu both obviously increased for sdi in loamy soil it can be seen from the example that the design results were different for the di and sdi subunits in different soils variation of soil hydraulic conductivity and nominal emitter flow rate were two important parameters for the selection of lmax although the same eu was achieved for all the cases the other hydraulic performance indices were different the use of the design results should depend on the crop and the actual farmland conditions 6 conclusions a finite element based model was developed for the hydraulic analysis and design of subsurface drip irrigation subunits a differential equation governing the nodal hydraulic heads in a pipe element was derived based on the conservation of energy principle and flow continuity equation and was discretized using the galerkin method the direct stiffness algorithm was applied to generate the system of equations containing unknown element nodal hydraulic heads according to the defined pipe system and numbering strategy the emitter induced local head loss was calculated as a fraction of the kinetic head the effect of the soil infiltration capacity on the emitter flow rate was considered by using an analytical expression of back pressure containing saturated hydraulic conductivity the effect of variation of soil hydraulic properties on water application uniformity was evaluated by assuming a log transformation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the pressure heads and other quantities of interest were subsequently solved the main findings from the implementation of the proposed model are summarized as follows the model adopted two methods to incorporate the emitter outflow into the differential equation the two methods demonstrated the same accuracy the discrepancy between the exact solution of pressure head values with 300 elements and the solution with less elements decreased with the increase in the number of elements set with the drawback of decreasing convergence speed the average emitter flow rate in a single lateral of sdi decreased compared with di due to soil back pressure the reduction increased with the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity meanwhile a higher nominal emitter flow rate resulted in higher back pressures in soils causing a higher degree of reduction in the calculated average flow rate from its nominal value the hydraulic performance of sdi was determined by the pipe system and soil hydraulic properties the sdi pipe network can be recognized as an integrated water energy dissipation system any change in this system will affect the water outflow process occurring at the interface between emitters and soil and this effect will be expanded to a large field scale the water application uniformity was different for di and sdi subunits although the looped pipe network of sdi provided a more uniform distribution of pressure heads the uniformity eu was much lower than that of the di subunit due to the variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity and this was especially true for loamy soil with low permeability moreover the evaluation indicator of uniformity should be selected cautiously for the design of sdi subunits the designed maximum lateral length was different for di and sdi subunits and affected by the nominal emitter flow rate q0 and variation of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity cv in the example the lmax of sdi in sandy soil was longer than that of di contrarily the lmax of sdi in loamy soil was shorter when q0 or cv was high it must be mentioned that the model relied on the hypothesis that the exponent of water velocity in the kinetic head for evaluating local head loss and in the darcy weisbach or hazen williams formula was equal the hypothesis will lead to a decrease in the calculated local head loss and total head loss compared to the actual values the model should be further modified for higher accuracy credit authorship contribution statement jian wang

4769,a finite element model was developed for the hydraulic design of subsurface drip irrigation subunits the governing differential equation for steady state water flow in a multi outlet pipeline was derived according to the energy and mass conservation equations and was discretized using the galerkin method an equation system containing unknown hydraulic heads was constructed and solved using direct stiffness algorithm and gaussian elimination the local head loss from the emitter was calculated as a fraction of the kinetic head the emitter flow rate and its variation were evaluated using an analytical expression of positive soil water pressure and a log transformation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the model adopted a virtual emitter concept which allowed for rapid convergence on an ordinary computer the finite element formulation made the model capable of analyzing both branched and looped pipe network systems a matlab software script was developed and the hydraulic performance of subsurface drip irrigation subunits was analyzed the results indicate that a higher number of elements discretized in a pipe led to a higher accuracy of the model with 20 elements being sufficient the subsurface drip irrigation subunit can be recognized as an integrated water energy dissipation system the average value and uniformity of emitter flow rate were determined by the pipe system and soil hydraulic properties the designed maximum lateral length of a drip and a subsurface drip irrigation subunit was different in the presented design example that difference was determined by the emitter nominal flow rate and variation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity keywords subsurface drip irrigation hydraulic model soil hydraulic property flow rate irrigation uniformity 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is one of the most effective water saving techniques to alleviate water shortage in agricultural production it has the advantage of minimizing water loss by evaporation runoff and deep percolation camp 1998 similar to a drip irrigation di system a subunit is the basic pipe network unit of a subsurface drip irrigation system and is made up of a manifold and multiple laterals with emitters installed to deliver water from sources to the root zone of agricultural plants fig 1 water application uniformity is the most crucial design criterion because it determines not only the crop yield and quality but also the soil infiltration process assouline 2019 spatial variability of the emitter flow rate in the field leads to local over or inadequate irrigation assuming that emitter clogging problems are controlled a lack of sufficient uniformity is mainly caused by the variation of pressure heads due to both the elevation changes and the head losses along the pipe lines as well as by the manufacturer coefficient of variation and the number of emitters per plant provenzano 2005 therefore a hydraulic model that accurately evaluates the pressure head distribution is important for determining the appropriate design of a sdi pipe system and ensuring the soil and water conservation numerous hydraulic calculation methods have been developed and successfully applied to the analysis and design of di system analytical formulation are widely accepted to directly calculate the pressure head variation or emitter flow rate alonge a multi outlet lateral pipe zayani et al 2001 keshtgar et al 2013 baiamonte 2018 without requiring numerical and computer aided techniques the design variables such as maximum lateral length is then determined manually the iterative based approach howell and hiler 1974 pinthong et al 2013 which is often called back step method was utilized to expand the hydraulic calculation from a single lateral to a subunit an assumed pressure at the pipe end is needed to make the calculated pressure at the pipe inlet coincide with the given value the water distribution uniformity can be therefore simulated however the current hydraulic models are seldom applicable to the sdi system in china the hydraulic design of sdi subunits can only follow the standard used for surface drip irrigation one difficulty in the design of sdi systems is that the pipe network of an sdi subunit adopts a looped form an extra manifold connects all the lateral ends and is used for flushing the underground pipe system fig 1 the flow direction is difficult to predict which makes the analytical model invalid and iterative method inefficient meanwhile the buried emitter discharge was found to decrease by 10 50 compared with the nominal value without being plugged shani et al 1996 when the discharge is higher than the soil infiltration capacity a positive water pressure philip 1992 exists at the emitter soil interface consequentially decreasing the pressure gradient across the emitter predictions of emitter flow rate and its variation in a sdi subunit are rarely reported the designed average emitter flow rate typically determines the irrigation scheduling and quantity therefore the effects of soil hydraulic property and its spatial variation on emitter flow rate and uniformity should be considered in the design of the sdi subunits the hydraulic performance of sdi subunits should be analyzed and compared with that of di subunits with the availability of a personal computer bralts and segerlind 1985 first proposed a finite element model to analyze microirrigation subunits and the model was modified for different engineering application purposes mohtar et al 1991 the finite element method has been proved to be able to analyze the hydraulic performance of looped drip irrigation subunits wang et al 2016 and can be potentially used for a sdi system a system of equations is constructed to solve for the pressure heads in a pipe network the number of equations is determined by the number of emitters wang and chen 2020 which makes the method being computational expensive the solution process of the finite element method therefore will become cumbersome due to the excessive number of emitters in a large subunit it is important to find a way to improve the model by decreasing the number of elements needed for approximating the pressure head distribution a decrease in the number of elements helps to improve the computational efficiency the optimal design of large municipal water distribution systems has experienced a significant improvement using evolutionary algorithms reca and martinez 2006 wang et al 2017 cunha and marques 2020 the design optimization is normally based on the hydraulic solver epanet rossman 2000 which provides hydraulic simulations to predict the behavior of water distribution systems similarly for the di and sdi subunits a hydraulic model with high accuracy and computational efficiency is essentially needed which may ease the application of an artificial intelligence algorithm in the optimal design process another concern is that the local head loss from the emitter is often neglected or considered according to the equivalent length in the current hydraulic models that may lead to an underestimation of pressure loss and erroneous design of the pipe system many studies have in fact successfully proposed the calculation methods of local emitter head loss the most commonly used methods in these studies are laboratory experiments provenzano and pumo 2004 wang et al 2020 computational fluid dynamic procedure palau salvador et al 2006 wang et al 2018 and dimensional analysis approaches vilaça et al 2017 the local head losses of on line emitters integrated in line emitters and non coaxial emitters are usually calculated as a fraction of the kinetic head the fraction is determined by the geometric characteristic of the emitter pipe system bagarello et al 1997 the importance of the local head loss in the design of drip irrigation systems has been emphasized by previous studies al amoud 1995 juana et al 2002 yildirim 2010 how to integrate the existing research results into the finite element model to improve accuracy is the task of this study based on the above considerations the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a finite element based model for the hydraulic analysis and design of sdi subunits considering the effect of the soil hydraulic property 2 improve the accuracy of the simulated pressure heads by calculating the local head loss as a fraction of the kinetic head and decrease the required computational efforts and 3 analyze the average emitter flow rate and irrigation uniformity of sdi subunits the hydraulic performacne of di and sdi subunits is compared finally a design example is provided 2 method as shown in fig 1 water is continuously discharged by the emitters along the direction of flow inside the lateral the velocity varies at each pipe section between two consecutive emitters of the lateral the pressure head distribution and emitter flow rates in a subsurface drip irrigation subunit are stable the subunit is s steady state water flow system with one inlet and multiple outlets inlet pressure head and outflow discharge are the boundary conditions chosen for the inlet and outlets of the flow system a differential equation governing the hydraulic head distribution in an element of the subunit grid is developed and is similar to that used for solving one dimensional steady state heat transfer problems the basic logic of the finite element formulation procedure adheres to the concept of a virtual emitter system proposed by bralts et al 1993 multiple emitters can be integrated as one virtual emission node which allows for the concentration of the solution matrix into a more compact virtual node matrix 2 1 development of governing differential equation fig 2 represents a pipe element between two emitters the flow energy ex and ex dx at points x and x dx can be expressed using the energy equation for incompressible pipe flow as 1 e x h z v 2 2 g 2 e x d x

where q is the flow rate of pipe m3 s 1 υ is the fluid kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 it was reported that eq 7 works well for small diameter irrigation plastic pipes with low wall roughness when the reynolds number is less than 100 000 von bernuth and wilson 1989 taking the length of pipe l equivalent to the length of the element dx eq 7 can be rewritten in a generalized form in terms of fluid velocity instead of flow rate 8 h f b v m d x where b is the pipe coefficient m 1 75 s1 75 m is the pipe flow exponent m 1 75 for the darcy weisbach equation 9 b 0 0158 ν 0 25 d 1 25 g when the empirical hazen williams equation is used to evaluate the friction loss the pipe flow exponent m in eq 8 becomes 1 852 and the pipe coefficient b changes to 10 b 5 93 c 1 852 a 0 586 where c is the hazen williams coefficient a is the cross section area of pipe m2 local head loss of a single emitter is shown in fig 2 as a sharp drop in the energy grade line and calculated as the sum of the energy drop due to the contraction and subsequent enlargement of the flow bagarello et al 1997 as follows 11 h l α v 2 2 g where hl is the local head loss m α is the local loss coefficient which is determined by a specific pipe emitter scheme bagarello et al 1997 provenzano and pumo 2004 in order to simplify the model it is assumed that the exponent of fluid velocity in eq 11 equals the pipe flow exponent m in eq 8 then eq 11 can be converted to 12 h l α v m 2 g d x d x combining eqs 8 and 12 eq 4 can be arranged as 13 h x d x b α 2 g d x v m d x 0 fluid velocity is solved by eq 13 resulting in 14 v 1 b α 2 g d x 1 m h x 1 m when an initial approximation of hydraulic head drop per element δh δx is made eq 14 is linearized in terms of h x as follows 15 v 1 b α 2 g δ x 1 m δ h δ x

elements connected to element i qij is the flow rate in pipe element j m3 s 1 flow into element i is positive and flow away from element i is negative q is the outflow rate of element i m3 s 1 when there is flow out of an emitter the mass balance in eq 16 for a lateral pipe element changes to 17 va v v x d x a q 0 eq 17 can be reduced to 18 a v x d x q 0 substituting the flow velocity in eq 15 into eq 18 results in the differential equation as 19 d x 2 h x 2 d x q 0 where d x a c x a b α 2 g δ x 1 m δ h δ x 1 m m with dimension m3 s 1 the empirical relationship between the pressure head and emitter flow rate wu et al 1979 can be expressed as follows 20 q k h x e where q is emitter discharge m3 s 1 k is the emission coefficient m3 xe s 1 xe is the emission exponent dimensionless when an emitter is used for subsurface drip irrigation as a buried point source the soil infiltration capacity affects emitter flow rate a spherical saturated region is developed around the steady state discharge point with soil water under positive pressure philip 1992 it was proved that this pressure is higher for soils with lower hydraulic conductivity the positive pressure leads to a decrease in the hydraulic gradient across the emitter orifice the flow rate can be calculated as gil et al 2008 21 q k h h s x e where hs is the positive pressure head at the emitter soil interface often called the back pressure m philip 1992 developed an analytical expression to determine the pressure at the discharge point in a permanent flow regime shani et al 1996 applied that expression and related hs with the soil hydrophysical properties the cavity size of the source outlet and the emitter flow rate as 22 h s 2 α 0 r 0 8 π k s r 0 q 1 α 0 where a0 is the fitting parameter of the exponential model for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity proposed by gardner 1958 m 1 ro is the formed spherical cavity radius m ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s 1 the value for q follows by simultaneously solving eqs 21 and 22 the hydraulic conductivity parameters ks and a0 vary throughout the field the variation of soil hydraulic properties affects the water application uniformity in previous studies saturated hydraulic conductivity has been represented by a log normal distribution warrick et al 1977 a log transformation ksi can be taken with 23 k si l n k si the estimation of the average k s and the standard deviation σ k s of ksi is warrick 2003 24 k s e x p k s 0 5 σ k s 2 25 σ k s 2 e x p 2 k s σ k s 2 e x p σ k s 2 1 where k s and σ k s are the average and the standard deviation of ksi m s 1 and can be obtained by solving eqs 24 and 25 as 26 σ k s l n σ k s 2 k s 2 1 0 5 27 k s l n k s 0 5 σ k s 2 according to warrick 2003 and lazarovitch et al 2006 the corresponding ksi is 28 k si e x p k s σ k s z where z is a normal random variable with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 the values of k s σ k s and z for a specific soil are used to create random number ksi which is added in eq 22 to calculate the back pressure head the distribution of parameter a0 is calculated by the following relation warrick et al 1977 29 ln α 0 i α 0 σ α 0 ρ ln k si k s σ k s z 1 ρ 2 0 5 where α 0 and σ α 0 are the average and the standard deviation of lna respectively ρ is the correlation coefficient between ks and α0 α0 lnα0 for ρ 0 α0 is independent of ks and for ρ 1 α0 is solely dependent upon ks the finite element model adopts the virtual emitter concept to decrease the memory requirement of the computer and to facilitate convergence the irrigation pipe is discretized into elements each element can contain any number of emitters the outflow of one element is virtually integrated as from one emitter the pressure head is estimated as the average value of previous approximations of pressure heads at both ends of the pipe element the outflow is incorporated into eq 19 using two different methods method 1 when both sides of eq 19 are divided by the length of the element the outflow is calculated as the sum of emitters average flow rate 30 1 n q i dx nk h x e δ x q e where h is the average pressure head m n is the number of emitters in an element for a drip system h h x h x d x 2 and for a subsurface drip system h h x h sx h x d x h sx d x 2 method 2 the emitter flow equation is linearized in terms of pressure head h resulting in 31 1 n q i dx nk h x e 1 δ x h nk h x e 1 δ x h n k h x e 1 δ x z g h q z z for the manifold element where there is no emitter installed eq 19 therefore changes to 32 d x 2 h x 2 0 according to eqs 19 30 and 31 the one dimensional differential equation governing hydraulic heads for any pipe element in a drip irrigation subunit can be summarized as 33 d x 2 h x 2 g h q 0 where dx g and q q qzz qe are the coefficients and determined by the element type and evaluation methods of element outflow the coefficients are summarized in table 1 2 2 solution of governing differential equation the galerkin method is then used to solve eq 33 numerically it is one of the weighted residual methods in which an approximate solution is substituted into the differential equation a residual term results and is multiplied by a weighting function the integral of the product is required to be zero 34 0 1 w x d x 2 h x 2 g h q d x 0 where w x is the weighting function polynomial function or so called hat function is used to obtain both the approximate equation and the weighting function as required by the galerkin method two equations are generated by evaluating the weighted residual integral for an element with two nodes as 35 r e k e h e f e k e dx l 1 1 1 1 gl 6 2 1 1 2 c 1 e c 2 e c 2 e c 1 e is the element stiffness matrix h e h s h t is the vector containing element nodal hydraulic head values and f e q z l 2 z s z t q e l 2 1 1 g s g t is the element force vector the element matrices are assembled using a direct stiffness algorithm segerlind 1984 and yield a system of equations that have the general global matrix form 36 k h f 0 the hydraulic heads are obtained by solving the system eq 36 the static pressure heads are calculated by h h z other quantities of interest can be calculated subsequently for this study two frequently used parameters are selected to evaluate the irrigation uniformity the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 37 cu 1 σ q q

where n is the number of emitters per plant qmin is the minimum emitter flow rate m3 s 1 cvm is the emitter coefficient of manufacturing variation 3 example implementation a computer program was developed using matlab software the mathworks inc natick ma usa to solve for the hydraulic heads in drip irrigation subunits with the finite element method the solution procedure is with several iterations and uses the following calculation steps as shown in fig 3 1 the physical parameters of the emitter pipe and soil are identified as input data the numbering strategy of the pipe elements and nodes is determined 2 the initial approximation hydraulic heads and emitter flow rates is provided to calculate the coefficients dx g and q this is carried out differently for methods 1 and 2 the initial approximation of emitter flow rates is needed for a subsurface drip system to calculate the back pressure and coefficients in eqs 30 and 31 3 the element stiffness matrices are generated using the galerkin method a system of linearized equations containing a global matrix is constructed by assembling the element stiffness matrices according to the numbering strategy 4 the system of linearized equations is solved using gaussian elimination 5 the coefficients dx g and q are recalculated using the most recent value of hydraulic heads and emitter flow rates solved this step repeats steps 3 and 4 6 the iterations are stopped when the nodal hydraulic head values converge to a desired accuracy the element stiffness matrices in step 3 are generated by solving the governing differential equation eq 33 which is different from the previous finite element method bralts and segerlind 1985 wang and chen 2020 the lateral is discretized into elements which can contain any number of emitters the outflow of a single element is virtually taken as the sum of the emitters flow rate as shown in eqs 30 and 31 the number of elements is not necessarily equal to the number of emitters which help to improve the computational efficiency a surface drip irrigation pipe system in fig 4 is chosen firstly as an example to be analyzed with the model the pipe network is composed of a branched and looped system with two manifolds and three laterals the manifold consists of elements 4 8 12 13 and 14 six emitters are located at emission nodes 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 on laterals the pressure head at inlet node 13 is 20 m and the other physical parameters are listed in table 2 based on the direct stiffness algorithm and numbering strategy the element matrix is added to the globe stiffness matrix by the nodal number it connects as shown in fig 4 solid and dashed lines in fig 5 illustrate the lateral and manifold element respectively the stiffness matrix is symmetrical diagonally dominant and banded fig 5 there are 12 unknown hydraulic heads in this problem the numbering scheme is not unique but is preferred to minimize the bandwidth of the system of equations as suggested by bralts and segerlind 1985 table 3 presents the results of the solved nodal pressure heads shown in fig 4 all solution procedures were performed using the same computer cpu 3 0 ghz ram 8 0 gb the convergence was guaranteed when a reasonable initial hydraulic heads estimate was used in this study approximated hydraulic head decreased gradually by a step size of 0 01 m with each decrease of node number minimum value occurred at node 1 and maximum value equaled the given inlet pressure there was not a standard method to make the initial guess and this method worked well furthermore the dimensionless energy gradient concept wu and gitlin 1974 was a suitable alternative as suggested by bralts and segerlind 1985 the solved pressure heads were essentially the same for the two methods of incorporating emitter outflow in the differential equation the solution was obtained in less than seven iterations with computation time less than 0 03 s as revealed in table 3 the pressure variation was small in the right part of the pipe system and the pressure distribution tended to be more uniform in a looped system 4 accuracy and speed of convergence the adoption of the virtual emitter concept helps to decrease the number of elements discretized in a pipe system it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy and speed of convergence of the model a lateral line at 0 02 slope was selected for the analysis to determine how many elements would be sufficient to approach the exact pressure head distribution the parameters are listed in table 4 the number of the emitter was 300 the lateral line was subdivided using an increasing number of elements from 2 to 20 the pressure heads were calculated and are illustrated in fig 6 as demonstrated for both methods the exact pressure head firstly decreased from the lateral inlet at nodal number 300 and then increased due to positive field slope the deviation from the exact solution with 300 nodes tended to be small with the increase in the number of elements the nodal pressure heads with 20 elements accurately overlapped with the exact solution whereas the solution with 4 elements also demonstrated sufficient accuracy the average emitter flow rate and uniformity cu which were around 2 6 l h 1 and 0 83 respectively showed no difference it is evident that both methods can be applied for the hydraulic analysis of lateral lines when element number is larger than four nodes however the computation time increased from 0 022 to 0 110 s when the number of elements increased from 4 to 300 while the difference in convergence speed may be acceptable for this system the convergence process would become cumbersome and unpredictable for the whole subunit with multiple laterals 5 model application 5 1 emitter flow variation along a lateral pipe the hydraulic performance of drip and subsurface drip systems was studied using the finite element model the parameters of the lateral pipe were same as those listed in table 4 with emitter number decreasing to 200 two soils were considered a sandy soil with an average saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 5 10 5 m s 1 and average parameter α0 25 m 1 and a loamy soil with ks 8 10 6 m s 1 and average parameter α0 7 m 1 for the subsurface drip irrigation the variation in soil hydraulic properties within a field causes a discrepancy in pressure buildup and consequently nonuniform emitter flow rate a coefficient cv is defined herein to evaluate the soil variability as 39 c v σ k s k s for the sandy soil with cv 0 5 a sample of random saturated hydraulic conductivity ksi was generated by eq 28 and represented by a log normal distribution the parameter α0i was determined by eq 29 with ρ 1 the sample was assigned to each emission node to evaluate the flow rate the back pressures were obtained along with the solution of pressure heads and emitter flows the frequency histogram of back pressure also resembled a log normal distribution which was skewed to the left rather than being symmetric as shown in fig 7 the accumulated number of back pressures in the range of 0 37 0 51 m accounted for the highest in the sample similar to the pressure head in fig 6 flow rate generally decreased and then increased along the lateral line due to hydraulic variation and field slope meanwhile it fluctuated around a certain mean value due to the variation of ksi and corresponding back pressure the emitter flow in the subsurface drip system was determined by energy loss in the pipe system in addition to the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties fig 8 compares the emitter flow rate variation along the lateral pipe in air drip system and sandy and loamy soil subsurface drip system with cv 0 1 as expected the flow rate decreased due to the back pressure in soil the average flow was 3 36 3 29 and 2 93 l h 1 for the air sand and loam respectively the reduction increased with the decrease in hydraulic conductivity a finding that agrees with that emphasized by lazarovitch et al 2006 lamm and rogers 2017 observed that the emitter flow decreased in a subsurface drip system whereas the emitter was found not to be clogged when dug out of soil this model can be an efficient tool to evaluate the drop in discharge in terms of soil hydraulic properties the effect of nominal emitter flow rate q0 on the flow distribution of a subsurface drip system is illustrated in fig 9 using the sandy soil with cv 0 5 higher nominal flow rate increased the velocity and head loss in the pipe thus causing a higher pressure head and flow rate variation along the pipe line the flow rate decreased from 3 87 and 7 44 l h 1 to 3 18 and 4 25 l h 1 for q0 4 and 8 l h 1 on the other hand higher q0 increased the build up back pressure and further expanded the effect of soil variability on flow rate change the degree of dispersion of flow rate was higher for higher nominal flow rate the decrease in average discharge from its nominal value was 4 69 19 44 and 42 04 for 2 4 and 8 l h 1 respectively 5 2 emitter flow variation in a subunit the emitter pressure head and flow rate distribution were studied for a subunit with 45 laterals with the same parameters as in table 4 the lateral spacing was 1 m and the slope along the lateral and manifold directions was 0 02 and 0 02 respectively cvm was considered to be zero and n was taken as one for calculating eu the soils studied were the same as the above ones with cv 0 2 the hydraulic variation was different for drip and subsurface drip systems due to the effect of soil back pressure and flow direction in the looped pipe network as shown in fig 10 for the looped system since the end of each lateral was connected by an extra manifold the flow rate and velocity increased in the laterals close to the subunit inlet resulting in a more intense drop in pressure head in this part of the laterals for example in the sandy soil the pressure head in the first lateral decreased from 9 72 to 5 42 m in the drip irrigation subunit this value decreased from 9 70 to 6 59 m on the other hand the flow rate and energy loss in the manifold connected to the lateral inlet decreased thus the pressure head in the looped system tended to be more uniform than that in the di system the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu of the pressure head was 0 82 and 0 88 for the di and sdi system in sandy soil the higher pressure head uniformity in sdi was also partially attributed to the decreased energy loss because of the declined emitter discharge and flow velocity in the pipe system the hydraulic behavior of the sdi system in the loamy soil fig 10 c was similar to that in the sandy soil whereas the emitter flow rate further decreased due to the higher back pressure resulting in a higher pressure uniformity which was 0 91 uniformity of emitter flow rate is a crucial design criterion for drip irrigation systems and is the most frequently examined parameter by previous researchers regarding the difference in water application uniformity according to the experimental investigation gil et al 2008 noted that the interaction between the emitter discharge and soil hydraulic properties acts as a self regulated mechanism which offsets the negative effect of hydraulic variation due to energy loss the water application uniformity of sdi is greater than that of di which is valid for a single lateral in homogeneous soil taking spatial variability of soil properties into consideration lazarovitch et al 2006 developed an iteration based algorithm to calculate the emitter discharge coefficient of variation in a single lateral and found that the heterogeneity of soil leads to a decrease in dripper discharge uniformity according to the above analysis and fig 11 it is evident that the nominal flow rate and form of a pipe network also affect the change in uniformity in addition to the soil back pressure and its variation a comprehensive evaluation of water application uniformity in different drip irrigation systems was conducted for this study the effect of slope was neglected by using a horizontal manifold and laterals the other parameters were the same as in table 4 for all the cases as shown in table 5 the change in the average emitter flow rate was similar to that explained above in figs 8 and 9 for a single lateral and subunit the average back pressure hsavg increased slightly with the increase in the coefficient of variation cv however the variation of back pressure cvhs was linearly correlated to cv for the sdi subunit in sandy soil with nominal emitter flow rate q0 2 l h 1 for example the cvhs increased dramatically from 0 112 to 0 563 when cv increased from 0 1 to 0 5 it was interesting that the change in uniformity depended on not only the system type soil type nominal flow rate and cv but also the evaluation indicator selected for the surface drip irrigation system and subsurface drip system with cv 0 1 no significant difference in uniformity was observed for christiansen uniformity coefficient cu and emission uniformity eu when cu was used the effect of cv on uniformity was not obvious the uniformity of di was similar to that of sdi in sandy soil and slightly lower than that of sdi in loamy soil which was true for both a single lateral and subunit when eu was used the uniformity of sdi decreased dramatically with the increase in cv however the uniformity of sdi in sandy soil was still higher than that of di when cv 0 1 due to a lower hydraulic variation associated with the looped pipe network the difference between cu and eu can be explained by eq 38 which reveals that eu considered minimum flow rate instead of standard deviation in addition to the average value the hydraulic behavior was similar for di and sdi in sandy soil whereas it was sensitive to the soil with low permeability for loamy soil the uniformity eu decreased to 0 685 with cv 0 3 q0 2 l h 1 and 0 594 with cv 0 2 q0 4 l h 1 the data for the higher cv is not provided since the uniformity was extremely low in the simulation higher deviation of the hydraulic conductivity from the mean value led to the flow rate of certain emitters that declined to zero which was especially true for the downstream end of the pipe system this was because the soil back pressure was higher than the pressure head in the pipe due to the energy loss the emitter at these points could be considered clogged and uniformity eu declined to zero if the same amount of fertilizer were applied simultaneously with water through such a water distribution system the non point source pollution would be aggravated which should not occur in a field situation different countries have their preference of uniformity indicator for designing drip irrigation systems for example in the united states asae ep405 1 asae 2003 recommends a design eu between 0 70 and 0 95 based on type of emitter field layout and field topography the engineering design specifications of china national standard gb t 50485 2009 chinese standards 2009 suggests that cu should not be below 0 8 when evaluating the irrigation uniformity for di and sdi in homogeneous soil with high permeability both indicators are applicable for sdi in soil with low permeability eu would be a safer choice for the design of subunit pipe systems since the cu can hardly reflect the effect of the variation of soil hydraulic conductivity on the change of irrigation uniformity 5 3 example of lateral design the drip irrigation subunit is designed conventionally based on the limitation of water application uniformity in the following example the maximum lateral length lmax was selected manually to achieve the design criteria eu 0 85 by repeating the hydraulic model two emitters with the nominal flow rate q0 at 4 l h 1 k 1 27 and 2 l h 1 k 0 635 were used and the local head loss coefficient was 0 2 the slopes of laterals and the manifold were both zero the lateral number was 60 the emitter coefficient of manufacturing variation cvm required for calculating the eu was 0 01 the other parameters were the same as in table 4 as shown in table 6 as expected the lmax increased with the increase in the lateral diameter for all the cases when the lateral diameter was 16 mm the lmax was 215 5 and 183 m respectively for the sdi in sandy and loamy soil which was higher than the 141 5 m of di subunit on the condition of achieving the same irrigation uniformity eu the lmax of sdi can be longer due to a more uniform distribution of the pressure head in the looped subunits the lmax was lower for sdi in loamy soil than in sandy soil with different lateral diamters a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity caused a higher soil back pressure and further led to a higher variation of emitter flow rate and lower uniformity which is illustrated in fig 8 for the soils with the same variation of soil hydraulic conductivity cv the lmax for loamy soil was therefore shorter to decrease the pressure head variation and to compensate the more significant negative effect of the cv the total head loss ht was lower and the average pressure head havg was higher for the sdi in loamy soil which led to a higher cu compared with that of sandy soil compared with table 6 as expected the lmax in table 7 decreased for all the cases due to a higher emitter nominal flow rate qo 4 l h 1 when the lateral diameter was 16 mm the lmax decreased by 47 7 for di subunit and this value was 42 0 and 62 3 for the sdi in sandy and loamy soil a higher qo can also cause a higher soil back pressure and the corresponding variation of emitter flow rate for the same cv which was shown in fig 9 for the sdi subunit in loamy soil especially due to the effects of both low permeability and high emitter flow rate the lateral length had to be significantly shortened to achieve the same target uniformity thus the lmax was lower than that of di subunit the decrease of lmax for sdi subunit in sandy soil was small with the help of looped system as shown in table 8 when cv increased to 0 2 for qo 2 l h 1 the lmax decreased for the sdi in both soils compared with the results in table 6 this decrease was logical since a higher cv led to a decrease in eu which had been shown in table 5 the total head losses were all lower than the results in table 6 the average emitter pressure head and cu both obviously increased for sdi in loamy soil it can be seen from the example that the design results were different for the di and sdi subunits in different soils variation of soil hydraulic conductivity and nominal emitter flow rate were two important parameters for the selection of lmax although the same eu was achieved for all the cases the other hydraulic performance indices were different the use of the design results should depend on the crop and the actual farmland conditions 6 conclusions a finite element based model was developed for the hydraulic analysis and design of subsurface drip irrigation subunits a differential equation governing the nodal hydraulic heads in a pipe element was derived based on the conservation of energy principle and flow continuity equation and was discretized using the galerkin method the direct stiffness algorithm was applied to generate the system of equations containing unknown element nodal hydraulic heads according to the defined pipe system and numbering strategy the emitter induced local head loss was calculated as a fraction of the kinetic head the effect of the soil infiltration capacity on the emitter flow rate was considered by using an analytical expression of back pressure containing saturated hydraulic conductivity the effect of variation of soil hydraulic properties on water application uniformity was evaluated by assuming a log transformation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the pressure heads and other quantities of interest were subsequently solved the main findings from the implementation of the proposed model are summarized as follows the model adopted two methods to incorporate the emitter outflow into the differential equation the two methods demonstrated the same accuracy the discrepancy between the exact solution of pressure head values with 300 elements and the solution with less elements decreased with the increase in the number of elements set with the drawback of decreasing convergence speed the average emitter flow rate in a single lateral of sdi decreased compared with di due to soil back pressure the reduction increased with the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity meanwhile a higher nominal emitter flow rate resulted in higher back pressures in soils causing a higher degree of reduction in the calculated average flow rate from its nominal value the hydraulic performance of sdi was determined by the pipe system and soil hydraulic properties the sdi pipe network can be recognized as an integrated water energy dissipation system any change in this system will affect the water outflow process occurring at the interface between emitters and soil and this effect will be expanded to a large field scale the water application uniformity was different for di and sdi subunits although the looped pipe network of sdi provided a more uniform distribution of pressure heads the uniformity eu was much lower than that of the di subunit due to the variation in saturated hydraulic conductivity and this was especially true for loamy soil with low permeability moreover the evaluation indicator of uniformity should be selected cautiously for the design of sdi subunits the designed maximum lateral length was different for di and sdi subunits and affected by the nominal emitter flow rate q0 and variation of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity cv in the example the lmax of sdi in sandy soil was longer than that of di contrarily the lmax of sdi in loamy soil was shorter when q0 or cv was high it must be mentioned that the model relied on the hypothesis that the exponent of water velocity in the kinetic head for evaluating local head loss and in the darcy weisbach or hazen williams formula was equal the hypothesis will lead to a decrease in the calculated local head loss and total head loss compared to the actual values the model should be further modified for higher accuracy credit authorship contribution statement jian wang
