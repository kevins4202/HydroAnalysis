24695,landscape connectivity measures based on metapopulation theory were developed over 20 years ago initially they applied classic metapopulation models to simple patch based representations of landscapes using vector spatial data structures realism was improved by developing dynamic estimates of occupancy and metapopulation capacity the latter providing a measure of the integrated habitat amount such measures are used to estimate the ability of habitat networks to support metapopulation persistence the original methods for occupancy mapping and metapopulation capacity were adapted to work with fine grained continuous value raster data that step shifted the method outside of the classic metapopulation model which left some methodological issues unresolved in particular what has been termed the deceptive paradox of patch based connectivity whereby perverse and what we describe as inequitable results are obtained through arbitrary circumscription of the analysis grid and through the trading of habitat between habitat quality extent and connectivity we provide a solution to this issue and apply it within the frame of drielsma and ferrier s 2009 raster based rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence remp we demonstrate our solution using simple hypothetical examples and in order to demonstrate the practicality of our approach to real world settings we apply the approach to habitat suitability mapping of the white browed treecreeper climacteris affinis in south eastern new south wales australia keywords habitat amount structure metapopulation ecology potential occupancy landscape connectivity remp ecological persistence raster data 1 introduction it is accepted that along with average birth death competition and predation rates population persistence in wild settings also relies on the spatial structure of supporting habitats at landscape scales hanski 1999 bertuzzo et al 2015 many populations and entire species are threatened by the loss degradation and fragmentation of their habitats liao et al three key facets of habitat structure underpin the capacity of landscapes to support such populations habitat connectivity defined as the functional linkage amongst habitat patches taylor et al 1993 with et al 1997 habitat quality and habitat extent the way these facets combine to affect the distribution and survival of populations varies between taxa which exhibit vast differences in terms of areal habitat requirements and mobilities hiebeler 2007 debate over the relative importance of individual facets li and wu 2004 hodgson et al 2009 doerr et al 2011 2011 fahrig 2013 drielsma et al 2014 thiele et al 2018 belies a much needed shift of focus to the more germane issue of persistence of populations and species individual facets are of less interest essentially they are inseparable complementary and to a degree substitutable e g improved habitat quality can offset the loss of aerial extent if the persistence outcome is unaffected this places considerable importance on developing ways to fully integrate these facets so that habitat configurations can be equitably assessed and alternatives compared 1 1 landscape measures habitat composition structure and function exert influence across a range of spatial scales noss 1990 they are interrelated phenomenon if one is present so must the others in some form concepts of effective habitat area ferrier and drielsma 2010 and habitat amount saura and rubio 2010 fahrig 2013 provide a perspective on integrating these interrelated facets into a measure of what can be considered usable habitat i e the area of habitat present accounting for habitat quality and discounted according to impediments to full function for example due to excessive geographic separation and impediments to movement low permeability a perspective on useable habitat accounts for how physical habitat elements such as structures and resources along with their spatial distribution integrate at spatial scales relevant to each species and population thus a given quanta of fine scale habitat can translate to differing amounts of useable habitat depending on how it is spatially configured hiebeler 2000 fahrig 2013 when habitat amount is reported in actual area units it can answer the questions how do real world patterns of habitat compare with an area of gold standard habitat that being ideal perfectly connected habitat and does a given real world configuration of varying quality habitat translate to what is understood to be a minimum area required for the persistence of a population in the wild answers to these questions are useful for informing habitat trading and offset schemes as well as for conservation prioritisation for the practical purpose of spatial analysis we suggest that habitat amount is usefully viewed from two perspectives site connected habitat amount which refers to the amount of habitat available at a point location or site from its functionally connected neighbourhood and integrated habitat amount by which we mean connected components of habitat forming a zone of habitat such as a patch grid cell or region analysis units patches or grid cells are necessary artificial constructs used to represent the distribution of habitat for the purpose of spatial analysis their size and shape are abstractions often circumscribed with little or no consideration of ecological relevance fahrig 2013 in many cases it is a legacy of and a constraint imposed by the way habitat data was collected operationally site connected and integrated habitat amount can be derived from a spatial layer of finer scale integrated habitat amount e g see love et al 2020 conceptually we suggest that habitat which is endogenous to an analysis unit patch or grid cell equates to the integrated habitat amount within that analysis unit which is not necessarily the same as the sum of habitat within that analysis unit as it may also be subject to connectivity at that finer scale integrated habitat amount particularly at fine scales is often referred to as habitat condition quality or suitability e g see department of planning industry and environment nsw and university of new england 2020 generally when these terms are used it is not explicitly described or understood to mean an emergent state sensu holland 1998 arising from the dynamic interplay of finer scale constituent parts it is often assumed that the circumscription process clusters habitat into perfectly connected units and therefore no internal dynamics need to be considered this is the case with the spatially explicit metapopulation model of hanski 1999 however this will not be realistic where the resolution of units is low in comparison to population dynamics or habitat variegation or if analysis unit boundaries are otherwise ecologically inappropriate to place this concept more generally the spatial scale and resolution of habitat data is not a special case but is rather the lower bound of a continuum of spatial scales along which habitat can practically be viewed and analysed using the available data drielsma et al 2018 the concept of the panarchy gunderson and holling 2002 specifies that at each successively broader level of spatial scale new properties emerge from the integration of the finer scale components in the context of habitat this describes how as scale broadens biological diversity and resource richness increases and ecological function expands from that of supporting elements of habitat through to supporting habitat dependant individuals populations metapopulations hanski and gilpin 1991 and ultimately adaptive systems levin 1998 1 2 perspectives on habitat amount fig 1 provides a perspective of how habitat across space is integrated into habitat amount potentially considering endogenous configuration in the process the two basic habitat amount measures derived from habitat condition are site connected and integrated habitat by applying entity specific landscape parameters potential occupancy can also be mapped across regions this latter analysis we argue is the most ecologically relevant and useful measure 1 3 potential occupancy we define potential occupancy pi as the proportion of time a species or biological entity would be expected to occupy a patch or location subject to specific rates of local extinctions and colonisations and the distribution of habitat across a region a spatially explicit method that integrates habitat and connectivity was developed to calculate the potential occupancy of patches using landscape habitat structure and a minimal taxa specific parameter set hanski 1999 an iterative method was used to reach dynamic equilibrium across a network occupancy mapping can readily be converted to the total expected area of occupancy pn in a region by calculating and then summing the product of the potential occupancy of an analysis unit by its area ai across the study area 1 p n p i a i 1 4 raster implementations the development of raster based methods for measuring landscape connectivity has increased considerably since the early part of the 21st century ayram et al 2016 methods based on network graph theory urban et al 2009 provide a powerful tool for estimating landscape habitat connectivity however there remains concerns over the ecological validity of how it has been applied moilanen 2011 zeller et al 2018 the cost benefit approach cba drielsma et al 2007 is a raster based technique for measuring ni across regions cba adopts the theoretical underpinnings of metapopulation ecology and adapts them to work efficiently with large fine grained raster datasets which can account for detailed landscape heterogeneity mcintyre and barrett 1992 wiens 1995 with et al 1997 hanski 1998 baguette and van dyck 2007 baguette et al 2013 the approach recognises no clear divide between patch and the non patch matrix rather it treats all areas as providing habitat suitability and permeability along continua the least cost paths algorithm from graph theory dijkstra 1959 is employed for estimating ecologically informed effective distances between pairs of cells true habitat integration would consider all possible connectivity pathways not just the most direct or least cost e g by using a circuit theory approach mcrae et al 2008 however computational limitations make this unfeasible for all pairs of endpoints assessment on large and complex datasets so it is common to use the best or most likely paths between pairs of locations for which least cost paths are a reasonable proxy grid cells are used in the cba to define the distribution of habitat and the level of permeability to movement but not to define population boundaries in contrast to patch implementations e g hanski 1999 the circumscription of habitat using a grid grid origin and cell size is arbitrary other than in exceptional circumstances although ideally the granularity will be matched to the spatial scale at which taxa perceive their environment baguette and van dyck 2007 drielsma and ferrier 2009 with the cba patches are virtual with fuzzy edges they are algorithmically defined by a distance decay function from each grid cell individually generally the characteristics of these virtual patches varies gradually across space as each successive focal cell s neighbourhood changes incrementally from the cba perspective populations metapopulations or even multiple metapopulations are not differentiated rather they lie on a continuum ranging from isolated single cells through to complex inter connected cellular networks thus the cba implementation does not conform to the classic metapopulation model cba underpinned landscape matrix connectivity calculations in the original rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence technique remp version 1 0 drielsma and ferrier 2009 remp 1 0 was a process explicit model briscoe et al 2019 that calculated metapopulation capacity hanski and ovaskainen 2000 and mapped potential occupancy hanski 1999 remp provides fine grained analysis which in contrast to patch based polygonal data approaches hanski 1999 hanski and ovaskainen 2000 is particularly suited to variegated and fragmented landscapes drielsma et al 2007 the approach accommodates species specific variation in habitat requirements type and area in granularity of landscape perception and in movement abilities connectivity is calculated from each location to its whole neighbourhood using least cost paths within an entity specific distance decay function drielsma et al 2007 for remp iterative methods caswell 1988 were employed to capture the dynamics of large and complex datasets typically millions of analysis units the remp calculation of potential occupancy considers two causal processes baguette et al 2013 local extinction generally relevant at finer spatial scales and higher spatial resolution and colonisation generally relevant to broader spatial scales and calculated using lower spatial resolution remp version 1 0 was incorporated into species and species functional group assessment e g drielsma et al 2016 scenario planning in the face of bio climatic habitat shifts using a generic focal species approach doerr et al 2013 and for guiding conservation and restoration taylor et al 2016 foster et al 2017 1 5 the problem of inequitable integration of habitat with the classic metapopulation model levins 1966 patches represent discrete areas of habitat with potential to support populations within their boundaries metapopulations are formed through colonisation of vacant patches from extant populations in the classic model internal colonisation processes are not relevant at any moment the entire patch is either occupied or vacant we find the classic model to be inappropriate for many of the contexts in which we are involved where internal patch dynamics are highly relevant where patch size can vary by orders of magnitude and where habitat suitability is highly variegated drielsma et al 2007 drielsma and ferrier 2009 raster approaches such as the cba are more suited in these cases limitations became apparent with the calculation of metapopulation capacity and potential occupancy in remp 1 0 due to a failure to adequately translate the classic model to work in the continuous value raster context we concluded that metapopulation capacity is not transferrable to the cba context and modifications to remp were required a major problem was that of inequitable integration the inequitable way that habitat quality extent and connectivity were combined the problem is demonstrated in this paper using simple hypothetical scenarios which differ in measured ways highlighting the implications of habitat consolidation versus more scattered distributions we propose and apply what we term site connected habitat amount ni and integrated habitat amount nn which provide alternatives to colonisation potential hanski 1999 and metapopulation capacity hanski and ovaskainen 2000 respectively within the context of remp the purpose of this paper is to describe theoretical refinements we have applied these refinements result in a unified and mathematically equitable approach to quantifying habitat amount across spatial scales and deriving potential occupancy across regions to illustrate our approach with a real life example we re calculated potential occupancy of the white browed treecreeper climacteris affinis using remp 2 0 and conducted a sensitivity analysis on the new model our methodological refinements can be applied to raster or patch based applications provided that internal patch dynamics are deemed relevant we focus here on grid cell applications as it provides the most complex and for our purposes the most useful option 2 material and methods a methodological problem that has affected cba based integrated habitat amount assessment is what we refer to as the problem of inequitable integration the problem incorporates the deceptive paradox of patch based connectivity measurements tischendorf and fahrig 2000 whereby increased fragmentation can when the classic model is misused perversely lead to increased colonisation our migration from remp 1 0 to remp 2 0 addresses this and other incidental issues to assist in conceptualising our approach we adopt a habitat unit conceptual model see appendix a whereby spatial patterns of habitat of variable suitability are represented by quanta of habitat habitat units the habitat unit model which is not substantially different to what is implicit to other assessments e g see aiello lammens et al 2011 bertuzzo et al 2015 is illustrated here merely as a convenient visual representation of how we assume habitat distribution and habitat quality combine into habitat availability this perspective on habitat structure is agnostic to whether habitat units are co located in perfectly connected stacks where the number of stacked units represents the degree of entity specific habitat quality form a cohort of units that fall within the same arbitrarily defined grid cell also perfectly connected if the cell size is small in comparison to species mobility or are spatially distributed across the extent of a region where entity specific connectivity decreases with increased spatial separation a representation of a realistic habitat configuration will typically involve combinations of these three using this schema the only salient variable to describe a habitat configuration is the horizontal distance euclidean or effective separating habitat units which can be greater than or equal to zero 2 1 site connected habitat amount site connected habitat amount is calculated as 2 n i exp α d i j a j where j the neighbourhood cell can equal i the focal cell eq 2 is a simple weighted sum of the neighbourhood habitat or the connectivity of an analysis unit i including internal connections ni neatly provides a value range between 0 when there is no habitat and the summed habitat area in the region achieved when the neighbourhood is filled with ideal habitat that is perfectly connected to i by integrating three facets of habitat structure habitat connectivity quality and extent ni measures what quantum of habitat is accessible to organisms at and directly from a given site or location including the neighbouring habitat to which the site is functionally connected local habitat suitability can be very low in places whereas ni for that same location may be high due to connectivity to quality habitat in its neighbourhood the way ni is calculated the size of the neighbourhood and the distance decay function is not only specific to each biological entity species or functional group it can also be differentiated across different biological processes for a single taxa such as home range movements and dispersal movements drielsma and ferrier 2009 2 2 integrated habitat amount measures such as neighbourhood habitat area hanski 1999 provide a reasonable approximation of the habitat amount across a region however connected habitat can be fully integrated into a measure of integrated habitat amount nn this requires either differential calculus or iterative approximations based on the fundamental connectivity measure i e n i the calculated habitat amount for a connected region is determined by the extent and quality of its habitat and it s degree of consolidation measured through direct indirect circuitous and recursive connections hanski 1998 martensen et al 2017 integrated habitat quantifies connected habitat components into virtual broader scale units and attributes component grid cells with the habitat amount of the integrated network of which they are a part see fig 1 metapopulation capacity hanski and ovaskainen 2000 is a form of integrated habitat amount that was developed for a spatially realistic metapopulation structures comprising independent homogenous patches represented by a polygonal representation of habitat metapopulation capacity λn is calculated as the leading eigenvalue of the landscape matrix m consisting of elements m i j exp α d i j a i a j for j i and mii 0 within a spatially realistic model metapopulation capacity performs the same role as the amount of suitable habitat in the non spatial levins 1966 model hanski and ovaskainen 2003 see appendix c for summary of terms differential calculus was used to find the equilibrium state calculated as the leading eigenvalue of the landscape matrix we replace metapopulation capacity which was part of in remp 1 0 with integrated habitat amount nn the two measures are closely related and can be calculated in much the same way like metapopulation capacity nn is the leading eigenvalue of the landscape matrix in the case of metapopulation capacity the landscape matrix is populated with colonisation potential hanski and ovaskainen 2000 with j i whereas nn uses ni for which j i is included 2 3 modifications to the potential occupancy model as with the derivation of nn the problem of inequitable integration affected occupancy mapping in remp 1 0 and is addressed by adopting a similar approach as that used for habitat amount as is evident from groups c and d in fig 2 p i is unaffected by the exchange from suitability to extent the method for calculating potential occupancy as described by drielsma and ferrier 2009 couples analysis at two spatial scales local extinction rate is calculated at a home range spatial scale which then determines the magnitude and pattern of dispersal scale propagule movement across the network an estimate of equilibrium occupancy across a network is achieved through iterations of extinction and colonisation processes based on hanski s 1999 method for calculating potential occupancy pi drielsma and ferrier s 2009 raster version relied on iterations between two equations p i c i γ i c i γ i λ t and c i c j i exp α d i j p j γ j where γ i the home range scale patch connectivity replaced aj from the original equation for colonisation potential hanski 1999 in order to essentially treat each grid cell as if it were a patch for purposes of considering both extinction and colonisation rates c i is the colonisation rate we propose to use ni i e allowing for i j instead of colonisation potential in the iteration stage which establishes connectivity to each cell location and the estimation of occupancy is extended to include suitability of the focal cell at a final step in the calculations at a final cell aggregation stage the equilibrium potential occupancy is calculated as p i 1 1 p u a i where habitat suitability ai has a value between zero and one pu is the equilibrium potential occupancy per habitat unit resulting from the conclusion of the iteration stage thus p i is assigned zero where habitat value is zero and occupancy is equitably adjusted within the core method according to the habitat suitability of analysis units across the study region a further two issues in remp 1 0 that relate to occupancy mapping are addressed in remp 2 0 double counting within the home range calculations and a refinement to how the threshold for metapopulation persistence is calculated these refinements which are incidental to the focus of this paper are described in appendix b 2 4 testing with hypothetical examples fig 2 demonstrates how the problem of inequitable integration is overcome we tested for inequitable integration using hypothetical cases we compared results for hanski s 1999 neighbourhood habitat area h n metapopulation capacity λn as applied in remp 1 0 nn and the potential occupancy as calculated within remp 1 0 and remp 2 0 a more detailed mathematical representation of the methods referred to here the patch based implementation remp 1 0 and remp 2 0 are provided in appendix b the six scenarios in fig 2 groups a b c d e and f are illustrated using the habitat unit model in fig 2 each of groups a b c and d has equal total habitat equals 3 habitat units but with varying spatial configurations from group a to group b as the connectivity of the system is increased hn and λn both go up but λn by a larger amount due to indirect connections experiments show that the more complex the arrangement of habitat in terms of varying distances and degree of clustering the more hn and λ n diverge with λn being able to incorporate higher order links and therefore produce higher values λn does not capture the variable habitat amount within a single analysis unit which leads to an inequitable result for group c and group d however from the perspective of habitat availability c and d are equal in the case of groups c and d where connectivity between all habitat units is perfect equals 1 nn equals the summed habitat of the region in other cases groups a b e and f nn is moderated by reduced connectivity between pairs of habitat units the simple examples illustrate how quanta of habitat habitat quality and connectivity can be integrated and equitably exchanged i e a lack of connectivity can be offset by extra habitat being added say to group a making group e which provides similar functionality to groups c or d the value of the integrated approach nn in comparison to the static version of neighbourhood habitat area hn is also demonstrated by how each behaves as a hypothetical scenario is increasingly fragmented i e the analysis units are increasingly dispersed in fig 3 as the analysis units are systematically fragmented hn asymptotes to 2 λn towards zero while nn asymptotes to 3 the value of the highest suitability habitat unit which increasingly assumes the role of the maximum connected zone in the scenario nn is the only of the three habitat amount measures we argue to correctly evaluate the fully connected scenario step 1 as the sum of the habitat present equals 8 and then through fragmentation to full isolation evaluate the system as equal to the habitat present in the best available connected part fig 2 demonstrates that additional units of habitat as improved habitat quality or additional extent can have the same effect on measures of habitat amount and occupancy with n n and p n co located or perfectly connected units of habitat are merely special cases along a connectivity continuum and are mathematically treated no differently to spatially separated units of habitat having met these basic conditions further variation in overall quantity and distribution of habitat merely adds further nuance and complexity to scenarios such as in the example shown in fig 4 2 5 the example of the white browed treecreeper white browed treecreeper was part of a remp 1 0 assessment of 19 species and functional groups occurring in the former lower murray darling catchment management authority region in new south wales australia drielsma et al 2016 we re modelled the species for that region using remp 2 0 with the changes outlined above 3 results for the white browed treecreeper fig 4 depicts input habitat quality or suitability and results for the white browed treecreeper from the application of remp 2 0 potential occupancy is constrained to a sub set of the areas identified as having non zero habitat quality the model deems large areas of suitable habitat unable to support occupancy due to insufficient connectivity to other habitat for dispersal following local extinction and or home range scale connectivity to reduce local extinction dispersal scale nn indicates areas where appropriate restoration could link into and strengthen existing habitat networks fig 5 and supplementary appendix e shows potential occupancy for the white browed treecreeper derived using remp 1 0 and remp 2 0 the two models have a near identical range of values but the newer version predicts additional potential occupancy across the study region the newer version treats well connected regions more as virtual patches with less penalty imposed on patch edges and some of the better connected aggregations of smaller patches combine to act as single viable habitat areas in fig 5 species records are provided for added context in some parts of the study area the new model concords better with concentrations of more recent records however it is not clear how well the species records which include unsystematic and incidental sightings represent actual occupancy or how well observed occupancy reflects the long term viability that the model seeks to represent on the latter point extinction debt coates et al 2016 could be a factor in this case as the majority of the habitat in the region areas outside conservation reserves while not cleared of native vegetation are considered in the model to have lost half the habitat quality for the species due to over grazing by domestic stock drielsma et al 2016 3 1 sensitivity analysis for the white browed treecreeper model a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua was undertaken for the remp 2 0 white browed treecreeper model it found the model was responsive to two ecological parameters in particular the minimum viable areas needed to support a population and the maximum movement ability maximum permeability for dispersal however variations in the parameter of up to 30 yielded 10 variation in potential occupancy with other parameter variations contributing to that response no unexplained and dramatic responses to variation in the parameters were found it was also reassuring that the model was most sensitive to ecological parameters that should affect the model results but was only mildly affected by variations to the operational parameters which are more arbitrary in nature e g cell sizes and number of iterations a detailed description of the gsua and its results is provided in appendix d 4 discussion 4 1 varying site suitability in a network the white browed treecreeper example demonstrates how variations in site level habitat quality can be accomodated equitably across a connected network despite our example being derived from a four class habitat quality input our approach is indifferent to whether input data is binary has a limited number of classes or is attributed with continuous values our approach can theoretically equate a concentration of habitat with a greater quantity of imperfectly accessable fragmented habitat it can also evaluate nuanced combinations of proximal and remote habitat in all cases the calculation of available habitat is subject to individual taxa s movement abilities including distance limited dispersal and longer range dispersal liao et al 2013b and is gauged against each taxa s habitat quantity requirements scale of movement per se does not present a limitation to the approach as increased mobility of a species implies a decrease in required granularity which can be addressed by reducing analysis resolution drielsma and ferrier 2009 grid cells within the network where site quality is low or even zero can still be regarded as high in terms of nn if the cell is connected to a robust network this acknowledges that given an entity s movement ability it may have access to network resources from these locations despite little or no habitat being available locally that it can traverse the habitat gap to access the network s resources thus locations such as this are integral to the habitat network albeit as non contributers in terms of basic resources thus spatially defined nn is a measure not of suitable habitat but when intersected with habitat cover as is done in the final step of remp 2 0 s derivation of potential occupancy it identifies well connected and thus functional habitat when it intersects with degraded or cleared habitat it indicates candidate areas for ecological restoration e g former areas of habitat where vegetation has been removed that remain well connected to a viable habitat network restoration of locations such as this will be aided through colonisation from the viable area and once new habitat establishes the existing network will be strengthened from its inclusion other non habitat connected areas may not be physically capable of supporting suitable habitat but may have a role in aiding movement for example with the white browed treecreeper example only belah rosewood and cypress vegetation communities are considered suitable habitat but the condition of other community types is understood to affect permeability to movement for the species by a factor of 10 or more see drielsma et al 2016 4 2 separate metapopulations drielsma and ferrier 2009 found that multiple connected networks or separate potential metapopulations could be discerned using their approach to map metapopulation capacity across regions fig 4 bottom provides a typical mapping where each region of the same value of nn with remp 1 0 metapopulation capacity would serve this purpose indicates the veracity of what can be considered distinct metapopulations the definition of separate networks does not always occur as marginal or weak connections across regions cannot be resolved within a few iterations of the eigenvalue calculations in these cases a clear definition of network boundaries is elusive if iterations are allowed to continue until all possibilities of connectivity are exhausted entire regions may resolve to a single metapopulation capacity as with hanski and ovaskainen s 2000 approach using limited numbers of analysis units and a differential calculus to derive the leading eigenvalue for remp we use a standard number of iterations in the dispersal calculations of potential occupancy usually 5 as a way of discerning separate metapopulations 4 3 limitations the methods described here are considered models of potential occupancy inter and intra specific liao et al 2013a and human interactions or stochastic calamities that may affect realised occupancy are not considered models such as these seek to reflect complex interactions and are therefore highly theoretical and largely untestable in nature as such they should be used carefully in ways that are fit for purpose and in conjunction with other lines of evidence baguette 2004 loehle 2004 there can be both positive and negative effects of fragmentation when considering the contagion of disease habitat disturbance e g fire or when considering potential crowding effects liao et al 2013a care should be taken in relation to rolling out models without firstly considering the applicability to individual species landscape interactions and in this case recognising the role of active drivers which are not considered in the model 5 conclusion metapopulation capacity provides a measure of the relative robustness of each metapopulation in relation to a threshold for persistence the suggested formulation of nn unlocks additional useful information as it equitably measures integrated habitat represented in units of area aligning to the concept of effective habitat area ferrier and drielsma 2010 or the amount of available habitat within a connected network fahrig 2013 thus it can be interpreted as a network s equivalent area of gold standard habitat of ideal quality and connectivity in this paper we have demonstrated the use of nn within remp 2 0 to equitably evaluate the amount of available habitat at the home range and dispersal scales our refinements to remp make raster based estimation of potential occupancy consistent across landscape habitat scenarios involving complex combinations of habitat extent quality and connectivity remp is relatively simple to apply for evaluation of landscape scenarios and to inform landscape level conservation action as the approach only requires a spatial surface of habitat distribution or habitat suitability and a minimal set of parameters it can feasibly be applied to multiple species over large spatial extents software

materials image application 1 appendix a the habitat unit model the habitat unit model hum is described as both as an idealised geometric conceptual model and as a practical analytical model that we have operationalised using a raster data structure the model applies equally to polygonal data simple examples are provided conceptual model each hum example is constructed entirely from a set of habitat links a habitat link is a two node graph representing two connected nodes each node is a habitat unit habitat units are the molecules of a habitat network they are georeferenced quanta of habitat that are one dimensional points in space the link length represents the distance between the habitat units dense concentrations of habitat units at a single location represented as stacks in fig a 1 represent high quality habitat at that location or analysis unit well connected habitat units across space form habitat networks these can include what are sometimes called habitat patches but which are often heterogeneous in terms of habitat type and quality wiens 1989 with et al 1997 all habitat units are equal subject to the requirements of the biological entity of interest the only model variable is link lengths in practice link length is derived based on the geographical separation of the habitat units often non linear distance decay is applied and can include environmental considerations such as the habitat quality of the intervening habitat and the most likely routes between locations such as least cost paths e g see drielsma et al 2007 fig a 2 conceptually the model is agnostic to whether habitat units are stacked into high quality locations or if they are connected horizontally across space where pairs of habitat units are stacked link lengths are assumed to be zero analytical version of the habitat unit model graph theory is used to describe habitat within a region as comprising one or more habitat networks fig a 3 for the practical purpose of undertaking spatial analysis habitat is defined geometrically with three objects locations zero dimensional points in space areas two dimensional regions and links two dimensional vectors or graph edges defining the connectedness between locations or between zones appendix b three versions of potential occupancy models hanski 1999 occupancy the derivation of pi of a patch using a single scale see hanski 1999 using iterations the rate of change in the probability of a patch being occupied given by hanski and gyllenberg 1997 b 1 d p i d t i c i t 1 p i μ i p i where ci t is the colonisation to patch i and assuming larger patches have a lower rate of extinction of extant populations denoted µi i e b 2 μ i e a i the equilibrium potential occupancy of a patch pi can be derived through substitution and re arrangement firstly at equilibrium the rate of change in probability of a patch being occupied equals zero and we substitute equation b 2 into equation b 1 0 c i 1 p i e p i a i p i e a i c i c i b 3 p i c i a i c i a i e b 4 c i c s i where ai is the habitat quality of the analysis unit s i p j a j w i j c is a constant typically w i j exp d i j α d where 1 α d is the average dispersal distance for the entity hanski 1999 therefore p i c a i s i c a i s i e c as λ t e c at the threshold of persistence then b 5 p i a i s i a i s i λ t where λt is the leading eigenvalue of the dispersal scale landscape matrix for an ideal landscape at threshold of persistence p i is derived through iterations of equations b 4 and b 5 remp version 1 0 occupancy the rate of change in the probability of a patch being occupied given by equation b 1 in order to capture μ i at the home range scale the connectivity of a patch zone at home range scale γi and γj were used instead of patch sizes ai and aj thus μ i e γ i where γ i j i exp d i j α h a j and where 1 α h is the average home range movement ability regarding colonisation ci c s i where s i j i p j γ j w i j and where w i j exp d i j α d thus

use of γj in remp 1 0 where it also affects colonisation rate that was double counting as extinction rate driven by γi is considered elsewhere γi can be calculated as either site connected habitat amount or integrated habitat amount the latter provides the more rigorous measure occupancy for the ideal patch at the threshold of persistence colonisation rate denoted by st equals extinction rate i

units the potential occupancy of an analysis unit using probability theory p i 1 1 p u a i this provides equitable integration because pu is the probability of occupancy at a location without considering habitat suitability pi the probability of occupancy after considering suitability is an adjusted probability based on the number of habitat units at the location remp 2 0 deriving the threshold for metapopulation persistence in the same way as the threshold metapopulation capacity is calculated for the classic model hanski and ovaskainen 2000 drielsma and ferrier 2009 the threshold integrated habitat amount nt is used in remp 2 0 in order to capture the dynamic interplay between extinction and colonisation we recognise the leading eigenvalue of the dispersal scale landscape matrix to be an estimate of s i only i e connectivity at the dispersal scale which is a contributor to nt as nt needs to encompass both colonisation and extinction dynamics we conclude that nt stγt where γt and st are equilibrium home range connectivity and dispersal scale connectivity respectively calculated for a single patch of uniform maximum habitat quality with an area set to the known or estimated minimum viable habitat needed to support a metapopulation see drielsma and ferrier 2009 with this refinement occupancy levels are a function of nt with areas that equal nt getting a potential occupancy of 0 5 or any predetermined fraction occupancy is determined by the balance between variations across space of both colonisation and extinction in practice where colonisation calculated at a broader spatial scale is poor this can to a limited degree be offset by low extinction rate at the finer spatial scale and vice versa as si falls below st local scale habitat amount γt needs to be increased in order to maintain occupancy level however there are limits to this capacity for offsetting as these two properties are inter dependant but less so if the scales differ more responding to the same habitat pattern at different spatial scales nn reflects the size of a connected network which relates to a region s capacity to support a viable metapopulation but within that region occupancy varies according to local extinction rate and how the interactions of colonisation and extinction flow permeate across the region appendix c summary of concepts and terms table c1 appendix d sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for white browed treecreeper potential occupancy with remp 2 0 methods we derived 50 sets of remp s 5 ecological pertaining to habitat needs and movement ability and 6 operational parameters pertaining to model configuration in the absence of empirically derived confidence bands we varied each variable semi randomly the probability of selecting a parameter value was determined by a gaussian function with a standard deviation of 20 and an assumed mean equal to the parameter value adopted for the assumed model the one with unaltered parameters from the original set from drielsma et al 2016 50 variable sets were run leading to 50 scenarios the potential occupancy pi was derived for each the parameters are presented in table d 1 from this analysis we qualitatively assessed each variable in terms of sensitivity to uncertainty a measure of the steepness of response of pi to variation in the variable this analysis is relevant only to the white browed treecreeper model for south eastern new south wales australia each remp model for other species or a different configuration for this species would require a separate gusa results a spatial rendering of standard deviation for the 50 scenarios see table d 1 shows increased spread of values with increasing pi in the assumed model i e as should be expected all scenarios agree that p i equals zero in the poorer habitat configurations standard deviation approximately zero this is expected as the input habitat suitability model was not varied in the analysis disagreement amongst the models increases with improved habitat conditions maximum of 0 079 fig d 1 for each variable minimum maximum and mean pi across 50 scenarios were plotted against variable value see fig d 2 results drawn from fig d 2 are summarised in table d 2 distributions of pi across the scenarios were also plotted for a random sample of 494 grid cells see fig d 3 in order to constrain the analysis to locations of possible sensitivity to variable uncertainty only cells with pi 0 01 out of a range of 0 1 0 in the assumed model were included conclusion in the areas of maximum variation the standard deviation was still low 0 079 in a potential range of 0 1 the mean and median values of pi across the scenarios were all within 10 of the assumed model mean the model is sensitive to two parameters see table d 2 1 minimum viable habitat area the area needed to support a population indefinitely when habitat conditions are optimal 2 dispersal distance through favourable habitat how far the species will disperse through optimal habitat conditions this result reflects the ecological importance of these two parameters to this model if further improvements to the model are sought this finding would support further investigation into these two parameters whereas others are less important in support of the model there was low to mild sensitivity to operational parameters cell sizes numbers of iterations and resolution of neighbourhood connectivity analysis see drielsma 2009 for discussion on petal strategy the model displayed no gross instability but responded to parameter fluctuations in predictable and logical ways discussion this analysis highlights the response of p i to changes in variables ideally only ecologically valid responses are detected for the ecological parameters the choice of system parameters is in some cases a compromise and they can introduce error in this analysis operational errors were minor in comparison to the overall evaluation of the response variable 
24695,landscape connectivity measures based on metapopulation theory were developed over 20 years ago initially they applied classic metapopulation models to simple patch based representations of landscapes using vector spatial data structures realism was improved by developing dynamic estimates of occupancy and metapopulation capacity the latter providing a measure of the integrated habitat amount such measures are used to estimate the ability of habitat networks to support metapopulation persistence the original methods for occupancy mapping and metapopulation capacity were adapted to work with fine grained continuous value raster data that step shifted the method outside of the classic metapopulation model which left some methodological issues unresolved in particular what has been termed the deceptive paradox of patch based connectivity whereby perverse and what we describe as inequitable results are obtained through arbitrary circumscription of the analysis grid and through the trading of habitat between habitat quality extent and connectivity we provide a solution to this issue and apply it within the frame of drielsma and ferrier s 2009 raster based rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence remp we demonstrate our solution using simple hypothetical examples and in order to demonstrate the practicality of our approach to real world settings we apply the approach to habitat suitability mapping of the white browed treecreeper climacteris affinis in south eastern new south wales australia keywords habitat amount structure metapopulation ecology potential occupancy landscape connectivity remp ecological persistence raster data 1 introduction it is accepted that along with average birth death competition and predation rates population persistence in wild settings also relies on the spatial structure of supporting habitats at landscape scales hanski 1999 bertuzzo et al 2015 many populations and entire species are threatened by the loss degradation and fragmentation of their habitats liao et al three key facets of habitat structure underpin the capacity of landscapes to support such populations habitat connectivity defined as the functional linkage amongst habitat patches taylor et al 1993 with et al 1997 habitat quality and habitat extent the way these facets combine to affect the distribution and survival of populations varies between taxa which exhibit vast differences in terms of areal habitat requirements and mobilities hiebeler 2007 debate over the relative importance of individual facets li and wu 2004 hodgson et al 2009 doerr et al 2011 2011 fahrig 2013 drielsma et al 2014 thiele et al 2018 belies a much needed shift of focus to the more germane issue of persistence of populations and species individual facets are of less interest essentially they are inseparable complementary and to a degree substitutable e g improved habitat quality can offset the loss of aerial extent if the persistence outcome is unaffected this places considerable importance on developing ways to fully integrate these facets so that habitat configurations can be equitably assessed and alternatives compared 1 1 landscape measures habitat composition structure and function exert influence across a range of spatial scales noss 1990 they are interrelated phenomenon if one is present so must the others in some form concepts of effective habitat area ferrier and drielsma 2010 and habitat amount saura and rubio 2010 fahrig 2013 provide a perspective on integrating these interrelated facets into a measure of what can be considered usable habitat i e the area of habitat present accounting for habitat quality and discounted according to impediments to full function for example due to excessive geographic separation and impediments to movement low permeability a perspective on useable habitat accounts for how physical habitat elements such as structures and resources along with their spatial distribution integrate at spatial scales relevant to each species and population thus a given quanta of fine scale habitat can translate to differing amounts of useable habitat depending on how it is spatially configured hiebeler 2000 fahrig 2013 when habitat amount is reported in actual area units it can answer the questions how do real world patterns of habitat compare with an area of gold standard habitat that being ideal perfectly connected habitat and does a given real world configuration of varying quality habitat translate to what is understood to be a minimum area required for the persistence of a population in the wild answers to these questions are useful for informing habitat trading and offset schemes as well as for conservation prioritisation for the practical purpose of spatial analysis we suggest that habitat amount is usefully viewed from two perspectives site connected habitat amount which refers to the amount of habitat available at a point location or site from its functionally connected neighbourhood and integrated habitat amount by which we mean connected components of habitat forming a zone of habitat such as a patch grid cell or region analysis units patches or grid cells are necessary artificial constructs used to represent the distribution of habitat for the purpose of spatial analysis their size and shape are abstractions often circumscribed with little or no consideration of ecological relevance fahrig 2013 in many cases it is a legacy of and a constraint imposed by the way habitat data was collected operationally site connected and integrated habitat amount can be derived from a spatial layer of finer scale integrated habitat amount e g see love et al 2020 conceptually we suggest that habitat which is endogenous to an analysis unit patch or grid cell equates to the integrated habitat amount within that analysis unit which is not necessarily the same as the sum of habitat within that analysis unit as it may also be subject to connectivity at that finer scale integrated habitat amount particularly at fine scales is often referred to as habitat condition quality or suitability e g see department of planning industry and environment nsw and university of new england 2020 generally when these terms are used it is not explicitly described or understood to mean an emergent state sensu holland 1998 arising from the dynamic interplay of finer scale constituent parts it is often assumed that the circumscription process clusters habitat into perfectly connected units and therefore no internal dynamics need to be considered this is the case with the spatially explicit metapopulation model of hanski 1999 however this will not be realistic where the resolution of units is low in comparison to population dynamics or habitat variegation or if analysis unit boundaries are otherwise ecologically inappropriate to place this concept more generally the spatial scale and resolution of habitat data is not a special case but is rather the lower bound of a continuum of spatial scales along which habitat can practically be viewed and analysed using the available data drielsma et al 2018 the concept of the panarchy gunderson and holling 2002 specifies that at each successively broader level of spatial scale new properties emerge from the integration of the finer scale components in the context of habitat this describes how as scale broadens biological diversity and resource richness increases and ecological function expands from that of supporting elements of habitat through to supporting habitat dependant individuals populations metapopulations hanski and gilpin 1991 and ultimately adaptive systems levin 1998 1 2 perspectives on habitat amount fig 1 provides a perspective of how habitat across space is integrated into habitat amount potentially considering endogenous configuration in the process the two basic habitat amount measures derived from habitat condition are site connected and integrated habitat by applying entity specific landscape parameters potential occupancy can also be mapped across regions this latter analysis we argue is the most ecologically relevant and useful measure 1 3 potential occupancy we define potential occupancy pi as the proportion of time a species or biological entity would be expected to occupy a patch or location subject to specific rates of local extinctions and colonisations and the distribution of habitat across a region a spatially explicit method that integrates habitat and connectivity was developed to calculate the potential occupancy of patches using landscape habitat structure and a minimal taxa specific parameter set hanski 1999 an iterative method was used to reach dynamic equilibrium across a network occupancy mapping can readily be converted to the total expected area of occupancy pn in a region by calculating and then summing the product of the potential occupancy of an analysis unit by its area ai across the study area 1 p n p i a i 1 4 raster implementations the development of raster based methods for measuring landscape connectivity has increased considerably since the early part of the 21st century ayram et al 2016 methods based on network graph theory urban et al 2009 provide a powerful tool for estimating landscape habitat connectivity however there remains concerns over the ecological validity of how it has been applied moilanen 2011 zeller et al 2018 the cost benefit approach cba drielsma et al 2007 is a raster based technique for measuring ni across regions cba adopts the theoretical underpinnings of metapopulation ecology and adapts them to work efficiently with large fine grained raster datasets which can account for detailed landscape heterogeneity mcintyre and barrett 1992 wiens 1995 with et al 1997 hanski 1998 baguette and van dyck 2007 baguette et al 2013 the approach recognises no clear divide between patch and the non patch matrix rather it treats all areas as providing habitat suitability and permeability along continua the least cost paths algorithm from graph theory dijkstra 1959 is employed for estimating ecologically informed effective distances between pairs of cells true habitat integration would consider all possible connectivity pathways not just the most direct or least cost e g by using a circuit theory approach mcrae et al 2008 however computational limitations make this unfeasible for all pairs of endpoints assessment on large and complex datasets so it is common to use the best or most likely paths between pairs of locations for which least cost paths are a reasonable proxy grid cells are used in the cba to define the distribution of habitat and the level of permeability to movement but not to define population boundaries in contrast to patch implementations e g hanski 1999 the circumscription of habitat using a grid grid origin and cell size is arbitrary other than in exceptional circumstances although ideally the granularity will be matched to the spatial scale at which taxa perceive their environment baguette and van dyck 2007 drielsma and ferrier 2009 with the cba patches are virtual with fuzzy edges they are algorithmically defined by a distance decay function from each grid cell individually generally the characteristics of these virtual patches varies gradually across space as each successive focal cell s neighbourhood changes incrementally from the cba perspective populations metapopulations or even multiple metapopulations are not differentiated rather they lie on a continuum ranging from isolated single cells through to complex inter connected cellular networks thus the cba implementation does not conform to the classic metapopulation model cba underpinned landscape matrix connectivity calculations in the original rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence technique remp version 1 0 drielsma and ferrier 2009 remp 1 0 was a process explicit model briscoe et al 2019 that calculated metapopulation capacity hanski and ovaskainen 2000 and mapped potential occupancy hanski 1999 remp provides fine grained analysis which in contrast to patch based polygonal data approaches hanski 1999 hanski and ovaskainen 2000 is particularly suited to variegated and fragmented landscapes drielsma et al 2007 the approach accommodates species specific variation in habitat requirements type and area in granularity of landscape perception and in movement abilities connectivity is calculated from each location to its whole neighbourhood using least cost paths within an entity specific distance decay function drielsma et al 2007 for remp iterative methods caswell 1988 were employed to capture the dynamics of large and complex datasets typically millions of analysis units the remp calculation of potential occupancy considers two causal processes baguette et al 2013 local extinction generally relevant at finer spatial scales and higher spatial resolution and colonisation generally relevant to broader spatial scales and calculated using lower spatial resolution remp version 1 0 was incorporated into species and species functional group assessment e g drielsma et al 2016 scenario planning in the face of bio climatic habitat shifts using a generic focal species approach doerr et al 2013 and for guiding conservation and restoration taylor et al 2016 foster et al 2017 1 5 the problem of inequitable integration of habitat with the classic metapopulation model levins 1966 patches represent discrete areas of habitat with potential to support populations within their boundaries metapopulations are formed through colonisation of vacant patches from extant populations in the classic model internal colonisation processes are not relevant at any moment the entire patch is either occupied or vacant we find the classic model to be inappropriate for many of the contexts in which we are involved where internal patch dynamics are highly relevant where patch size can vary by orders of magnitude and where habitat suitability is highly variegated drielsma et al 2007 drielsma and ferrier 2009 raster approaches such as the cba are more suited in these cases limitations became apparent with the calculation of metapopulation capacity and potential occupancy in remp 1 0 due to a failure to adequately translate the classic model to work in the continuous value raster context we concluded that metapopulation capacity is not transferrable to the cba context and modifications to remp were required a major problem was that of inequitable integration the inequitable way that habitat quality extent and connectivity were combined the problem is demonstrated in this paper using simple hypothetical scenarios which differ in measured ways highlighting the implications of habitat consolidation versus more scattered distributions we propose and apply what we term site connected habitat amount ni and integrated habitat amount nn which provide alternatives to colonisation potential hanski 1999 and metapopulation capacity hanski and ovaskainen 2000 respectively within the context of remp the purpose of this paper is to describe theoretical refinements we have applied these refinements result in a unified and mathematically equitable approach to quantifying habitat amount across spatial scales and deriving potential occupancy across regions to illustrate our approach with a real life example we re calculated potential occupancy of the white browed treecreeper climacteris affinis using remp 2 0 and conducted a sensitivity analysis on the new model our methodological refinements can be applied to raster or patch based applications provided that internal patch dynamics are deemed relevant we focus here on grid cell applications as it provides the most complex and for our purposes the most useful option 2 material and methods a methodological problem that has affected cba based integrated habitat amount assessment is what we refer to as the problem of inequitable integration the problem incorporates the deceptive paradox of patch based connectivity measurements tischendorf and fahrig 2000 whereby increased fragmentation can when the classic model is misused perversely lead to increased colonisation our migration from remp 1 0 to remp 2 0 addresses this and other incidental issues to assist in conceptualising our approach we adopt a habitat unit conceptual model see appendix a whereby spatial patterns of habitat of variable suitability are represented by quanta of habitat habitat units the habitat unit model which is not substantially different to what is implicit to other assessments e g see aiello lammens et al 2011 bertuzzo et al 2015 is illustrated here merely as a convenient visual representation of how we assume habitat distribution and habitat quality combine into habitat availability this perspective on habitat structure is agnostic to whether habitat units are co located in perfectly connected stacks where the number of stacked units represents the degree of entity specific habitat quality form a cohort of units that fall within the same arbitrarily defined grid cell also perfectly connected if the cell size is small in comparison to species mobility or are spatially distributed across the extent of a region where entity specific connectivity decreases with increased spatial separation a representation of a realistic habitat configuration will typically involve combinations of these three using this schema the only salient variable to describe a habitat configuration is the horizontal distance euclidean or effective separating habitat units which can be greater than or equal to zero 2 1 site connected habitat amount site connected habitat amount is calculated as 2 n i exp α d i j a j where j the neighbourhood cell can equal i the focal cell eq 2 is a simple weighted sum of the neighbourhood habitat or the connectivity of an analysis unit i including internal connections ni neatly provides a value range between 0 when there is no habitat and the summed habitat area in the region achieved when the neighbourhood is filled with ideal habitat that is perfectly connected to i by integrating three facets of habitat structure habitat connectivity quality and extent ni measures what quantum of habitat is accessible to organisms at and directly from a given site or location including the neighbouring habitat to which the site is functionally connected local habitat suitability can be very low in places whereas ni for that same location may be high due to connectivity to quality habitat in its neighbourhood the way ni is calculated the size of the neighbourhood and the distance decay function is not only specific to each biological entity species or functional group it can also be differentiated across different biological processes for a single taxa such as home range movements and dispersal movements drielsma and ferrier 2009 2 2 integrated habitat amount measures such as neighbourhood habitat area hanski 1999 provide a reasonable approximation of the habitat amount across a region however connected habitat can be fully integrated into a measure of integrated habitat amount nn this requires either differential calculus or iterative approximations based on the fundamental connectivity measure i e n i the calculated habitat amount for a connected region is determined by the extent and quality of its habitat and it s degree of consolidation measured through direct indirect circuitous and recursive connections hanski 1998 martensen et al 2017 integrated habitat quantifies connected habitat components into virtual broader scale units and attributes component grid cells with the habitat amount of the integrated network of which they are a part see fig 1 metapopulation capacity hanski and ovaskainen 2000 is a form of integrated habitat amount that was developed for a spatially realistic metapopulation structures comprising independent homogenous patches represented by a polygonal representation of habitat metapopulation capacity λn is calculated as the leading eigenvalue of the landscape matrix m consisting of elements m i j exp α d i j a i a j for j i and mii 0 within a spatially realistic model metapopulation capacity performs the same role as the amount of suitable habitat in the non spatial levins 1966 model hanski and ovaskainen 2003 see appendix c for summary of terms differential calculus was used to find the equilibrium state calculated as the leading eigenvalue of the landscape matrix we replace metapopulation capacity which was part of in remp 1 0 with integrated habitat amount nn the two measures are closely related and can be calculated in much the same way like metapopulation capacity nn is the leading eigenvalue of the landscape matrix in the case of metapopulation capacity the landscape matrix is populated with colonisation potential hanski and ovaskainen 2000 with j i whereas nn uses ni for which j i is included 2 3 modifications to the potential occupancy model as with the derivation of nn the problem of inequitable integration affected occupancy mapping in remp 1 0 and is addressed by adopting a similar approach as that used for habitat amount as is evident from groups c and d in fig 2 p i is unaffected by the exchange from suitability to extent the method for calculating potential occupancy as described by drielsma and ferrier 2009 couples analysis at two spatial scales local extinction rate is calculated at a home range spatial scale which then determines the magnitude and pattern of dispersal scale propagule movement across the network an estimate of equilibrium occupancy across a network is achieved through iterations of extinction and colonisation processes based on hanski s 1999 method for calculating potential occupancy pi drielsma and ferrier s 2009 raster version relied on iterations between two equations p i c i γ i c i γ i λ t and c i c j i exp α d i j p j γ j where γ i the home range scale patch connectivity replaced aj from the original equation for colonisation potential hanski 1999 in order to essentially treat each grid cell as if it were a patch for purposes of considering both extinction and colonisation rates c i is the colonisation rate we propose to use ni i e allowing for i j instead of colonisation potential in the iteration stage which establishes connectivity to each cell location and the estimation of occupancy is extended to include suitability of the focal cell at a final step in the calculations at a final cell aggregation stage the equilibrium potential occupancy is calculated as p i 1 1 p u a i where habitat suitability ai has a value between zero and one pu is the equilibrium potential occupancy per habitat unit resulting from the conclusion of the iteration stage thus p i is assigned zero where habitat value is zero and occupancy is equitably adjusted within the core method according to the habitat suitability of analysis units across the study region a further two issues in remp 1 0 that relate to occupancy mapping are addressed in remp 2 0 double counting within the home range calculations and a refinement to how the threshold for metapopulation persistence is calculated these refinements which are incidental to the focus of this paper are described in appendix b 2 4 testing with hypothetical examples fig 2 demonstrates how the problem of inequitable integration is overcome we tested for inequitable integration using hypothetical cases we compared results for hanski s 1999 neighbourhood habitat area h n metapopulation capacity λn as applied in remp 1 0 nn and the potential occupancy as calculated within remp 1 0 and remp 2 0 a more detailed mathematical representation of the methods referred to here the patch based implementation remp 1 0 and remp 2 0 are provided in appendix b the six scenarios in fig 2 groups a b c d e and f are illustrated using the habitat unit model in fig 2 each of groups a b c and d has equal total habitat equals 3 habitat units but with varying spatial configurations from group a to group b as the connectivity of the system is increased hn and λn both go up but λn by a larger amount due to indirect connections experiments show that the more complex the arrangement of habitat in terms of varying distances and degree of clustering the more hn and λ n diverge with λn being able to incorporate higher order links and therefore produce higher values λn does not capture the variable habitat amount within a single analysis unit which leads to an inequitable result for group c and group d however from the perspective of habitat availability c and d are equal in the case of groups c and d where connectivity between all habitat units is perfect equals 1 nn equals the summed habitat of the region in other cases groups a b e and f nn is moderated by reduced connectivity between pairs of habitat units the simple examples illustrate how quanta of habitat habitat quality and connectivity can be integrated and equitably exchanged i e a lack of connectivity can be offset by extra habitat being added say to group a making group e which provides similar functionality to groups c or d the value of the integrated approach nn in comparison to the static version of neighbourhood habitat area hn is also demonstrated by how each behaves as a hypothetical scenario is increasingly fragmented i e the analysis units are increasingly dispersed in fig 3 as the analysis units are systematically fragmented hn asymptotes to 2 λn towards zero while nn asymptotes to 3 the value of the highest suitability habitat unit which increasingly assumes the role of the maximum connected zone in the scenario nn is the only of the three habitat amount measures we argue to correctly evaluate the fully connected scenario step 1 as the sum of the habitat present equals 8 and then through fragmentation to full isolation evaluate the system as equal to the habitat present in the best available connected part fig 2 demonstrates that additional units of habitat as improved habitat quality or additional extent can have the same effect on measures of habitat amount and occupancy with n n and p n co located or perfectly connected units of habitat are merely special cases along a connectivity continuum and are mathematically treated no differently to spatially separated units of habitat having met these basic conditions further variation in overall quantity and distribution of habitat merely adds further nuance and complexity to scenarios such as in the example shown in fig 4 2 5 the example of the white browed treecreeper white browed treecreeper was part of a remp 1 0 assessment of 19 species and functional groups occurring in the former lower murray darling catchment management authority region in new south wales australia drielsma et al 2016 we re modelled the species for that region using remp 2 0 with the changes outlined above 3 results for the white browed treecreeper fig 4 depicts input habitat quality or suitability and results for the white browed treecreeper from the application of remp 2 0 potential occupancy is constrained to a sub set of the areas identified as having non zero habitat quality the model deems large areas of suitable habitat unable to support occupancy due to insufficient connectivity to other habitat for dispersal following local extinction and or home range scale connectivity to reduce local extinction dispersal scale nn indicates areas where appropriate restoration could link into and strengthen existing habitat networks fig 5 and supplementary appendix e shows potential occupancy for the white browed treecreeper derived using remp 1 0 and remp 2 0 the two models have a near identical range of values but the newer version predicts additional potential occupancy across the study region the newer version treats well connected regions more as virtual patches with less penalty imposed on patch edges and some of the better connected aggregations of smaller patches combine to act as single viable habitat areas in fig 5 species records are provided for added context in some parts of the study area the new model concords better with concentrations of more recent records however it is not clear how well the species records which include unsystematic and incidental sightings represent actual occupancy or how well observed occupancy reflects the long term viability that the model seeks to represent on the latter point extinction debt coates et al 2016 could be a factor in this case as the majority of the habitat in the region areas outside conservation reserves while not cleared of native vegetation are considered in the model to have lost half the habitat quality for the species due to over grazing by domestic stock drielsma et al 2016 3 1 sensitivity analysis for the white browed treecreeper model a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua was undertaken for the remp 2 0 white browed treecreeper model it found the model was responsive to two ecological parameters in particular the minimum viable areas needed to support a population and the maximum movement ability maximum permeability for dispersal however variations in the parameter of up to 30 yielded 10 variation in potential occupancy with other parameter variations contributing to that response no unexplained and dramatic responses to variation in the parameters were found it was also reassuring that the model was most sensitive to ecological parameters that should affect the model results but was only mildly affected by variations to the operational parameters which are more arbitrary in nature e g cell sizes and number of iterations a detailed description of the gsua and its results is provided in appendix d 4 discussion 4 1 varying site suitability in a network the white browed treecreeper example demonstrates how variations in site level habitat quality can be accomodated equitably across a connected network despite our example being derived from a four class habitat quality input our approach is indifferent to whether input data is binary has a limited number of classes or is attributed with continuous values our approach can theoretically equate a concentration of habitat with a greater quantity of imperfectly accessable fragmented habitat it can also evaluate nuanced combinations of proximal and remote habitat in all cases the calculation of available habitat is subject to individual taxa s movement abilities including distance limited dispersal and longer range dispersal liao et al 2013b and is gauged against each taxa s habitat quantity requirements scale of movement per se does not present a limitation to the approach as increased mobility of a species implies a decrease in required granularity which can be addressed by reducing analysis resolution drielsma and ferrier 2009 grid cells within the network where site quality is low or even zero can still be regarded as high in terms of nn if the cell is connected to a robust network this acknowledges that given an entity s movement ability it may have access to network resources from these locations despite little or no habitat being available locally that it can traverse the habitat gap to access the network s resources thus locations such as this are integral to the habitat network albeit as non contributers in terms of basic resources thus spatially defined nn is a measure not of suitable habitat but when intersected with habitat cover as is done in the final step of remp 2 0 s derivation of potential occupancy it identifies well connected and thus functional habitat when it intersects with degraded or cleared habitat it indicates candidate areas for ecological restoration e g former areas of habitat where vegetation has been removed that remain well connected to a viable habitat network restoration of locations such as this will be aided through colonisation from the viable area and once new habitat establishes the existing network will be strengthened from its inclusion other non habitat connected areas may not be physically capable of supporting suitable habitat but may have a role in aiding movement for example with the white browed treecreeper example only belah rosewood and cypress vegetation communities are considered suitable habitat but the condition of other community types is understood to affect permeability to movement for the species by a factor of 10 or more see drielsma et al 2016 4 2 separate metapopulations drielsma and ferrier 2009 found that multiple connected networks or separate potential metapopulations could be discerned using their approach to map metapopulation capacity across regions fig 4 bottom provides a typical mapping where each region of the same value of nn with remp 1 0 metapopulation capacity would serve this purpose indicates the veracity of what can be considered distinct metapopulations the definition of separate networks does not always occur as marginal or weak connections across regions cannot be resolved within a few iterations of the eigenvalue calculations in these cases a clear definition of network boundaries is elusive if iterations are allowed to continue until all possibilities of connectivity are exhausted entire regions may resolve to a single metapopulation capacity as with hanski and ovaskainen s 2000 approach using limited numbers of analysis units and a differential calculus to derive the leading eigenvalue for remp we use a standard number of iterations in the dispersal calculations of potential occupancy usually 5 as a way of discerning separate metapopulations 4 3 limitations the methods described here are considered models of potential occupancy inter and intra specific liao et al 2013a and human interactions or stochastic calamities that may affect realised occupancy are not considered models such as these seek to reflect complex interactions and are therefore highly theoretical and largely untestable in nature as such they should be used carefully in ways that are fit for purpose and in conjunction with other lines of evidence baguette 2004 loehle 2004 there can be both positive and negative effects of fragmentation when considering the contagion of disease habitat disturbance e g fire or when considering potential crowding effects liao et al 2013a care should be taken in relation to rolling out models without firstly considering the applicability to individual species landscape interactions and in this case recognising the role of active drivers which are not considered in the model 5 conclusion metapopulation capacity provides a measure of the relative robustness of each metapopulation in relation to a threshold for persistence the suggested formulation of nn unlocks additional useful information as it equitably measures integrated habitat represented in units of area aligning to the concept of effective habitat area ferrier and drielsma 2010 or the amount of available habitat within a connected network fahrig 2013 thus it can be interpreted as a network s equivalent area of gold standard habitat of ideal quality and connectivity in this paper we have demonstrated the use of nn within remp 2 0 to equitably evaluate the amount of available habitat at the home range and dispersal scales our refinements to remp make raster based estimation of potential occupancy consistent across landscape habitat scenarios involving complex combinations of habitat extent quality and connectivity remp is relatively simple to apply for evaluation of landscape scenarios and to inform landscape level conservation action as the approach only

materials image application 1 appendix a the habitat unit model the habitat unit model hum is described as both as an idealised geometric conceptual model and as a practical analytical model that we have operationalised using a raster data structure the model applies equally to polygonal data simple examples are provided conceptual model each hum example is constructed entirely from a set of habitat links a habitat link is a two node graph representing two connected nodes each node is a habitat unit habitat units are the molecules of a habitat network they are georeferenced quanta of habitat that are one dimensional points in space the link length represents the distance between the habitat units dense concentrations of habitat units at a single location represented as stacks in fig a 1 represent high quality habitat at that location or analysis unit well connected habitat units across space form habitat networks these can include what are sometimes called habitat patches but which are often heterogeneous in terms of habitat type and quality wiens 1989 with et al 1997 all habitat units are equal subject to the requirements of the biological entity of interest the only model variable is link lengths in practice link length is derived based on the geographical separation of the habitat units often non linear distance decay is applied and can include environmental considerations such as the habitat quality of the intervening habitat and the most likely routes between locations such as least cost paths e g see drielsma et al 2007 fig a 2 conceptually the model is agnostic to whether habitat units are stacked into high quality locations or if they are connected horizontally across space where pairs of habitat units are stacked link lengths are assumed to be zero analytical version of the habitat unit model graph theory is used to describe habitat within a region as comprising one or more habitat networks fig a 3 for the practical purpose of undertaking spatial analysis habitat is defined geometrically with three objects locations zero dimensional points in space areas two dimensional regions and links two dimensional vectors or graph edges defining the connectedness between locations or between zones appendix b three versions of potential occupancy models hanski 1999 occupancy the derivation of pi of a patch using a single scale see hanski 1999 using iterations the rate of change in the probability of a patch being occupied given by hanski and gyllenberg 1997 b 1 d p i d t i c i t 1 p i μ i p i where ci t is the colonisation to patch i and assuming larger patches have a lower rate of extinction of extant populations denoted µi i e b 2 μ i e a i the equilibrium potential occupancy of a patch pi can be derived through substitution and re arrangement firstly at equilibrium the rate of change in probability of a patch being occupied equals zero and we substitute equation b 2 into equation b 1 0 c i 1 p i e p i a i p i e a i c i c i b 3 p i c i a i c i a i e b 4 c i c s i where ai is the habitat quality of the analysis unit s i p j a j w i j c is a constant typically w i j exp d i j α d where 1 α d is the average dispersal distance for the entity hanski 1999 therefore p i c a i s i c a i s i e c as λ t e c at the threshold of persistence then b 5 p i a i s i a i s i λ t where λt is the leading eigenvalue of the dispersal scale landscape matrix for an ideal landscape at threshold of persistence p i is derived through iterations of equations b 4 and b 5 remp version 1 0 occupancy the rate of change in the probability of a patch being occupied given by equation b 1 in order to capture μ i at the home range scale the connectivity of a patch zone at home range scale γi and γj were used instead of patch sizes ai and aj thus μ i e γ i where γ i j i exp d i j α h a j and where 1 α h is the average home range movement ability regarding colonisation ci c s i where s i j i p j γ j w i j and where w i j exp d i j α d thus p i γ i s i γ i s i λ t nb the parameters e and c are not required once λt is known remp 2 0 occupancy colonisation the supply of propagules to a location is a function of site connected ni s i p j n i where ni the dispersal scale integrated habitat amount is calculated as n i exp d i j α d a j i e where j can equal i potential occupancy is calculated using a similar form to remp 1 0 p i c s i c s i e γ i γ i s i γ i s i e c local extinction γi is the home range integrated habitat amount where j can equal i 1 γi is used as a proxy for calculating local extinction rate 1 1 this contrasts to the use of γj in remp 1 0 where it also affects colonisation rate that was double counting as extinction rate driven by γi is considered elsewhere γi can be calculated as either site connected habitat amount or integrated habitat amount the latter provides the more rigorous measure occupancy for the ideal patch at the threshold of persistence colonisation rate denoted by st equals extinction rate i e c s t e γ t and γ t s t e c therefore for any given situation in nature p i γ i s i γ i s i γ t s t finally following the required iterative process for calculation of si we aggregate from habitat units the potential occupancy of an analysis unit using probability theory p i 1 1 p u a i this provides equitable integration because pu is the probability of occupancy at a location without considering habitat suitability pi the probability of occupancy after considering suitability is an adjusted probability based on the number of habitat units at the location remp 2 0 deriving the threshold for metapopulation persistence in the same way as the threshold metapopulation capacity is calculated for the classic model hanski and ovaskainen 2000 drielsma and ferrier 2009 the threshold integrated habitat amount nt is used in remp 2 0 in order to capture the dynamic interplay between extinction and colonisation we recognise the leading eigenvalue of the dispersal scale landscape matrix to be an estimate of s i only i e connectivity at the dispersal scale which is a contributor to nt as nt needs to encompass both colonisation and extinction dynamics we conclude that nt stγt where γt and st are equilibrium home range connectivity and dispersal scale connectivity respectively calculated for a single patch of uniform maximum habitat quality with an area set to the known or estimated minimum viable habitat needed to support a metapopulation see drielsma and ferrier 2009 with this refinement occupancy levels are a function of nt with areas that equal nt getting a potential occupancy of 0 5 or any predetermined fraction occupancy is determined by the balance between variations across space of both colonisation and extinction in practice where colonisation calculated at a broader spatial scale is poor this can to a limited degree be offset by low extinction rate at the finer spatial scale and vice versa as si falls below st local scale habitat amount γt needs to be increased in order to maintain occupancy level however there are limits to this capacity for offsetting as these two properties are inter dependant but less so if the scales differ more responding to the same habitat pattern at different spatial scales nn reflects the size of a connected network which relates to a region s capacity to support a viable metapopulation but within that region occupancy varies according to local extinction rate and how the interactions of colonisation and extinction flow permeate across the region appendix c summary of concepts and terms table c1 appendix d sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for white browed treecreeper potential occupancy with remp 2 0 methods we derived 50 sets of remp s 5 ecological pertaining to habitat needs and movement ability and 6 operational parameters pertaining to model configuration in the absence of empirically derived confidence bands we varied each variable semi randomly the probability of selecting a parameter value was determined by a gaussian function with a standard deviation of 20 and an assumed mean equal to the parameter value adopted for the assumed model the one with unaltered parameters from the original set from drielsma et al 2016 50 variable sets were run leading to 50 scenarios the potential occupancy pi was derived for each the parameters are presented in table d 1 from this analysis we qualitatively assessed each variable in terms of sensitivity to uncertainty a measure of the steepness of response of pi to variation in the variable this analysis is relevant only to the white browed treecreeper model for south eastern new south wales australia each remp model for other species or a different configuration for this species would require a separate gusa results a spatial rendering of standard deviation for the 50 scenarios see table d 1 shows increased spread of values with increasing pi in the assumed model i e as should be expected all scenarios agree that p i equals zero in the poorer habitat configurations standard deviation approximately zero this is expected as the input habitat suitability model was not varied in the analysis disagreement amongst the models increases with improved habitat conditions maximum of 0 079 fig d 1 for each variable minimum maximum and mean pi across 50 scenarios were plotted against variable value see fig d 2 results drawn from fig d 2 are summarised in table d 2 distributions of pi across the scenarios were also plotted for a random sample of 494 grid cells see fig d 3 in order to constrain the analysis to locations of possible sensitivity to variable uncertainty only cells with pi 0 01 out of a range of 0 1 0 in the assumed model were included conclusion in the areas of maximum variation the standard deviation was still low 0 079 in a potential range of 0 1 the mean and median values of pi across the scenarios were all within 10 of the assumed model mean the model is sensitive to two parameters see table d 2 1 minimum viable habitat area the area needed to support a population indefinitely when habitat conditions are optimal 2 dispersal distance through favourable habitat how far the species will disperse through optimal habitat conditions this result reflects the ecological importance of these two parameters to this model if further improvements to the model are sought this finding would support further investigation into these two parameters whereas others are less important in support of the model there was low to mild sensitivity to operational parameters cell sizes numbers of iterations and resolution of neighbourhood connectivity analysis see drielsma 2009 for discussion on petal strategy the model displayed no gross instability but responded to parameter fluctuations in predictable and logical ways discussion this analysis highlights the response of p i to changes in variables ideally only ecologically valid responses are detected for the ecological parameters the choice of system parameters is in some cases a compromise and they can introduce error in this analysis operational errors were minor in comparison to the overall evaluation of the response variable 
24696,in mongolia overuse and degradation of groundwater is a serious issue mainly in the urban and economic hub ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub in order to explicitly quantify spatio temporal variations in water availability a process based eco hydrology model nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology was applied to two contrasting river basins the tuul river which is characteristic of northern grassland and steppe and the galba river characteristic of the southern gobi desert the authors built a high resolution data grid representing water use for livestock urban populations and mining in the entire basins by combining a global dataset statistical data gis data observation data and field surveys to improve the accuracy of the model results the model simulated the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in these two river basins the model results showed a clear difference in the hydrologic cycle between them suggesting the impact of urbanization and mining on local regional eco hydrological degradation although drinking by herders livestock had some impact on the hydrologic change the groundwater level in the tuul river was shown to have been extremely degraded by water use in ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas that in the galba river has declined markedly as a result of oyu tolgoi mining since 2010 analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to separate the effects of climatic change and human activities on spatio temporal change in the groundwater level these results clarified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources in addition to climatic change this methodology is powerful for evaluating spatio temporal variations of water availability in regions with fewer inventory data on urbanization and mining keywords eco hydrology model water availability climatic change human activity groundwater degradation 1 introduction although mongolia has substantial groundwater resources they are unevenly distributed being abundant in the predominantly rural north but very scarce or non existent in the south at the beginning of the 21st century more than 80 of water resources were dependent on groundwater fig 1 now mongolia s water resources are under increasing pressure due to climatic change urbanization and rapid economic growth banerjee et al 2014 in particular the number of deep groundwater areas has increased greatly since 2000 fao 2012 and permafrost degradation due to climatic change drying out of surface water and increased use of groundwater have been becoming more serious rapid economic growth and political and socioeconomic shifts from socialism to capitalism starting around 1990 also caused serious environmental degradation overuse of groundwater resources resulting from urbanization exploitation of mineral resources and quarrying a rapid increase in livestock such as sheep and goats due to economic liberalization tumur et al 2018 a decrease in grassland productivity by livestock over grazing and over pumping and expansion of agricultural activity etc there are 29 river basins in mongolia under direct management by the ministry of environment and green development megdt mnet 2013 ifc 2017 fig 1 the areas at serious water risk are predominantly the urban and economic hub ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub banerjee et al 2014 in order to evaluate the degradation of water availability due to anthropogenic activity and climate change in these two contrasting hubs the author and his colleagues began to monitor the groundwater level in two river basins from summer 2018 okadera et al 2019 the tuul river basin is located in northern grassland and steppe except for forest in the upstream area jamsran et al 2018 in the middle stretch the river flows through ulaanbaatar the capital fig 1 for its municipal and industrial water supply groundwater has been drawn heavily from a network of shallow wells as a result the water level in the source zone the alluvial aquifer declined from 1 6 m in 1948 to 3 1 m in 1998 batsaikhan et al 2018 furthermore statistical data indicate that current water use may not be sustainable especially for meeting the projected water demand by the rapidly growing urban population in ulaanbaatar banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 in contrast the galba river basin galba uush doloodiing gobi river basin is located in the southern gobi desert which is mostly bare land and desert except for some grassland in north eastern region jamsran et al 2018 large mines such as oyu tolgoi ot and tavan tolgoi have been developing and recently started operations in this region fig 1 ot in particular is one of the world s largest copper gold deposits and started operations in 2008 oyu tolgoi llc 2013 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 the water resource system has to support this mining activity by providing where possible the water needed while satisfying competing water demands from the mining urbanization herder nexus banerjee et al 2014 despite previous findings indicating the impact of climate change and anthropogenic factors on water resources in both basins on different scenarios banerjee et al 2014 2016 adb 2014 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 quantitative and explicit evaluations of spatio temporal variations of water availability in the entire basins have been insufficient up to now it is important to clarify the impact of climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining development on water resources grassland carrying capacity and its vulnerability by using a process based model in the present study the process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model nakayama 2014 2015 supplementary information a was applied to the above two representative river basins the tuul river basin characteristic of northern grassland and steppe and the galba river basin characteristic of the southern gobi desert fig 1 supplementary information b nice incorporates a three dimensional groundwater submodel in addition to surface runoff submodel and extends the traditional concept of dynamic equilibrium with atmospheric forcing on a global scale maxwell and kollet 2008 based on the background described above three basic science questions were addressed i how does past climatic change influence the water resources in these two contrasting river basins ii how does anthropogenic activity such as livestock farming urban activity and mining change the water availability there iii how do these hydrologic changes affect the pasture carrying capacity and its vulnerability in order to answer these questions a high resolution gridded dataset representing water use for livestock urban activity and mining was derived by combining a global dataset statistical data gis data observation data and field surveys to input the nice simulation the model simulated the effect of climatic change and human activity livestock urban and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in the two river basins analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to quantify the inter annual variation or temporal trends in the groundwater level caused by these factors the results obtained would be used as a basis for extension to uncertainty analysis of the hydrologic cycle in order to improve the evaluation of pasture carrying capacity and its vulnerability 2 materials and methods 2 1 process based nice model and up scaling through coordinate transformation the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology framework includes the following complex sub compartments nakayama 2013 2014 2015 fig s1 in supplementary information a surface hydrology submodel a land surface submodel including urban and crop processes a groundwater submodel a regional atmospheric submodel a mass transport submodel for constituents in sediment and nutrients and a vegetation succession submodel nice is a process based distributed model that can offer an understandable formalism of water dynamics and a mathematical formulation allowing for its simulation simidjievski et al 2016 the model applies a rectangular coordinate system after albers projection or utm projection a recent study by one of the authors nakayama and maksyutov 2018 extended the model to include coordinate transformation from the original rectangular coordinate system nakayama et al 2006 nakayama and watanabe 2008 nakayama 2011a b nakayama and shankman 2013a b to a longitude latitude coordinate system applicable to continental scale or higher latitude by implementing a map factor and non uniform grid this transformation allowed up scaling to a global or higher latitude model by applying a non uniform grid and map factor into slope angle topography flow width propagation velocity and hydraulic conductivity 2 2 model input data six hour re analyzed data for downward radiation

sub basins in both rivers were calculated using topography and river channel data in the arcgis software fig 1 and these calculated data were compared with basin boundary data for mongolia mnet 2013 most of the tuul river basin is covered with grassland and steppe except for forest in the upstream area whereas most of the galba river basin is covered by bare land desert except for grassland in the northeastern region in the classification of glc2000 fig s3 in supplementary information 2 3 estimation of mining livestock and human water uses gridded data regarding water use for livestock

sources upper central industrial meat complex gachuurt and yarmag water sources to use and 2 more sources bio industrial complex and emerto water sources are planned to supply the capital in the future jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 in the absence of perennial rivers in the southern gobi region groundwater use in ot mining was calculated using the previous materials oyu tolgoi llc 2013 adb 2014 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 these data were finally gridded into 0 05 x 0 05 resolution during 1980 2018 using the arcgis software figs 2 and 3 and fig s4 in supplementary information in the tuul river basin a huge amount of groundwater has been used in ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas in the galba river basin there has been a large increase in the share of water use by the mining sector 84 since 2010 adb 2014 fig 3 2 4 boundary conditions and running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at the hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama and shankman 2013a b for the hillslope hydrology flow depth discharge and other water concentrations on the uppermost boundaries of basins were set to zero throughout the simulation in order to calculate these boundaries the authors firstly used gtopo30 to calculate each basin boundary at 1 km x 1 km resolution and then calculated the 0 05 x 0 05 grid using arcgis software for the model simulation inflows or outflows from the riverbeds were simulated at each time step depending on the difference in the groundwater and river hydraulic heads details have been described in the previous papers nakayama 2015 nakayama and watanabe 2004 the simulation areas in the tuul and galba river basins were 7 0 wide by 3 0 long and 11 0 wide by 6 0 long in longitude latitude coordinates respectively there are 29 river channels in the tuul river basin and 106 in the galba river basin fig 1 nice simulation of eco hydrological processes was performed at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution about 4 6 km resolution in the horizontal direction and in 20 layers with a weighting factor of 1 1 layer thicknesses being graduated from thinner in the upper layer to thicker in the deeper layer in the vertical direction the upper land layer was set at 0 2 m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200 m below sea level the model simulates the river network among elements and the terrestrial ecosystem in grid cells then the contribution of the river to the grid cell was estimated by calculating the areal ratio of the river river width multiplied by length in each grid details of the model set up and sensitivity analysis to show quantitative measures of model performance for the various parameters such as correlation coefficient root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency etc are given in the author s previous papers nakayama 2014 2017a 2020 simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6 h for 1980 2018 after a 1 year warm up period to allow a time varying equilibrium the simulated results were respectively calibrated and validated using ground water level observation byambasuren and odonsetseg 2015 igg 2018 okadera et al 2019 and river discharge in the tuul river num 2018 fig 1 and table s1 in supplementary information in order to separate the effects of climatic change and human activities on spatio temporal change in the groundwater level analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors was conducted the model simulation performed changes in precipitation livestock water use urban and mining water uses separately by keeping simply one of these effects constant the reference simulation repeated to use 1980 s forcing data 39 times during 1980 2018 finally groundwater level in the reference simulation was subtracted from those in alternative simulations to quantify temporal trend of groundwater level caused by various factors 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the hydrologic budget in two contrasting river basins in mongolia the authors compared observed and simulated values of river discharge between the tuul river basin during 1998 2018 at site nos 35 38 bosgo ulaanbaatar altanbulag and lun shown in fig 1 and table s1 in supplementary information fig s5 in supplementary information it can be seen that the discharge became maximal during the summer rainfall floods increasing in a downstream direction from bosgo to ulaanbaatar where forest is covered in the upstream area fig s3 in supplementary information changing little as far as altanbulag where the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin is smaller and then increasing gradually further downstream to lun where some tributaries merge fig 1 the model reasonably reproduced the values observed during the last 2 decades in particular comparison between daily fig s5a and monthly fig s5b aggregated validations showed that the root mean square error rmse in the monthly mean discharge was smaller than that in the daily mean discharge however the authors made no such comparison in the galba river basin because no observed values were available and the river remains dry almost throughout the year except during some heavy rainfall events the model also simulated the annual averaged hydrologic budget in the tuul and galba river basins during 1998 2018 fig 4 the results for each sub catchment in these basins showed a difference in the spatial distribution of the hydrologic budget between the two river basins for the tuul river basin the model showed that precipitation was higher in the northern region upstream and downstream of the river fig 4a an interesting feature was that the difference between precipitation and evaporation and water yield the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin and contributes to stream flow in the reach surface runoff lateral flow groundwater transmission loss fig s1 in supplementary information became minimal in the middle of the basin where most of the larger cities such as ulaanbaatar are located this means water resources are very limited and greatly affected by urbanization there in contrast in the galba river basin the water yield was relatively higher in the south eastern region although much smaller than in the tuul river basin fig 4b the severe limitation of water in the ot region is serious as the need to pump up more groundwater might lead to considerable hydrologic change there 3 2 impact of urbanization and mining on groundwater level in the two river basins the simulated data for groundwater level change were compared with the observed values in the tuul and galba river basins during 2000 2018 fig 5 in the tuul river basin the simulation showed that the hydrologic cycle has been greatly changed by overuse in ulaanbaatar figs 5a c there were differences in trends in the various regions upstream of the capital site nos 27 and 28 in table s1 in supplementary information which is affected by the upper water source fig 5a the central region site nos 30 and 32 in table s1 which has been seriously degraded by the central industrial meat complex gachuurt and yarmag water sources fig 5b the downstream area site no 34 in table s1 and the natural steppe region site no 18 in table s1 fig 5c jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 the groundwater level has generally declined by about 0 7 m averaged value during the study period as a result of livestock drinking and declined further by about 3 15 m averaged value in ulaanbaatar as a result of total water use site nos 30 and 32 in table s1 and fig 5b this decline has become serious after 2000 in the central region in contrast in the galba river figs 5d f there has been a great difference between intake near the ot mining area site nos 2 and 3 in table s1 fig 5d intake outside that area site nos 4 and 7 in table s1 fig 5e and sites without this effect site nos 8 and 9 in table s1 fig 5f although rainfall decreased slightly after 2000 in the galba river basin there were considerable fluctuations the annual mean temperature increased gradually fig s2 in supplementary information and this promoted evaporation after 2000 which caused a gradual decrease in groundwater level during 2005 2015 in addition to low precipitation the groundwater level has declined slightly by about 0 1 m averaged value during the study period as a result of drinking by livestock furthermore the model results show that the level has declined markedly by a maximum of 1 3 m after 2012 due to water use for mining in the area near ot site nos 2 and 3 in table s1 and fig 5d 3 3 separating the effects of climatic change and anthropogenic activity on spatio temporal change in the groundwater level nice was used to simulate changes in groundwater level from the 1980s to 1990s 2000s and 2010s around the groundwater sources in the tuul and galba river basins the differences in mean values among these periods were calculated fig s6 in supplementary information generally the simulated result showed that the groundwater level has decreased decade by decade in both basins in view of the trend for decreasing annual rainfall before 2010 fig s2 in supplementary information more importantly the model showed that the groundwater level has decreased gradually from the 1990s to the present around ulaanbaatar along the middle stretch of the tuul river due to over pumping there fig s6b in contrast the groundwater level showed a sudden decrease after the 2010s around the water source used for ot mining in the galba river basin starting in 2008 fig s6d the simulation also facilitated analysis of temporal trends and control of groundwater level changes to allow quantification of inter annual variations attributable to changes in precipitation and water use for livestock ulaanbaatar and ot mining respectively fig 6 in the tuul river basin the groundwater level tended to rise before 2000 due mainly to changes in precipitation and then showed a decreasing trend thereafter figs 6a b the model result also showed more than half of groundwater degradation in urban areas has been caused by urban water use after 2000 fig 6a in comparison to non urban areas fig 6b in contrast in the galba river basin this shift occurred around 2010 which was a little later than in the tuul river basin figs 6c d the model quantified more serious situation that almost all of groundwater degradation in mining areas has been caused by ot mining water use after 2010 fig 6c in comparison with non mining areas fig 6d in both basins the effect of water use for livestock was relatively lower than that attributable to urbanization and mining and precipitation change these analyses of the relative contributions of environmental factors helped us to directly quantify the inter annual variations or temporal trends in groundwater level change caused by those factors our results also reveal differences in the characteristics of the hydrologic cycle between the two contrasting river basins which are predominantly grassland steppe and bare land desert fig s3 in supplementary information affected or unaffected by urbanization and mining 4 discussion 4 1 for better understanding of overall distribution of water resources the results of the present simulation show that these two river basins representative of mongolia are heavily dependent on groundwater resources fao 2012 figs 2 and 3 while groundwater dynamics fundamentally depend on surface water and recharging through the natural hydrologic cycle the separate impacts of climate change and human activities are poorly understood nice simulated the differences in spatial distribution of the hydrologic budget between the tuul and galba river basins fig 4 previous studies have predicted that extreme flooding events and heavy winter precipitation are increasingly contributing to decreased reliability of the water supply unep 2009 fao 2012 increased temperature and evaporation will reduce surface water and recharge into shallow aquifers in contrast deep aquifers will be continuously degraded by urban and mining overuse ifc 2017 as illustrated by the present simulation analysis of the relative contributions shown in fig 6 supported the simulated result showing a decrease of the groundwater level in both basins fig 5 and fig s6 in supplementary information and quantified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources though nice is a powerful tool for grasping the overall distribution of water resources in river basins most of the input data are from global datasets in addition to statistical data gis data literature and observation data table 1 in particular details of geological structure are important for improving the accuracy of the simulated results for groundwater fig 5 and fig s6 in supplementary information in this study the authors used limited data from the literature batsaikhan et al 2018 and core sampling ministry of environment 2015 in combination with spatial extrapolation and some reasonable assumptions one report has indicated the need to use more ground truth data such as those of hydrogeological surveys and potential groundwater deposits ifc 2017 4 2 future effects of groundwater extraction in the two river basins prediction of future water demand in ulaanbaatar suggests that this will exceed the current supply capacity before 2021 for all scenarios banerjee et al 2016 in the high water demand scenario the demand will exceed the maximum available resources within seven years existing water resources are also vulnerable to pollution the present nice simulation of groundwater use in ulaanbaatar took into account only 6 sources figs 2a and 3a and fig s4a in supplementary information because there was no information on the locations of self water intake mnet 2010 megd 2012 sato 2015 our estimation showed that the volume of this self water intake was about 25 of total water use in ulaanbaatar this intake includes some of the water needed by industry energy and livestock etc in fact however the city may already be consuming much more water than the value employed in this study ulaanbaatar 2018 and thus the present simulated result might underestimate the total water demand in ulaanbaatar figs 5a c there is now a need for a major overhaul of the water supply and wastewater infrastructure to meet current demand and protect the local environment existing wastewater treatment plants are now operating beyond their design capacity in terms of the quantity and quality of effluents banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 it will be necessary to simulate hydrologic changes more precisely by inputting other forms of water use such as those for industry energy construction transport and utility services sites for large new mines are now being explored or have recently become operational in the southern gobi region as a backbone for the mongolian economy current projections for the high water demand scenario show that expected demand could exceed available resources before 2030 banerjee et al 2014 the total water use data for the galba river basin in 2015 inputted to nice represent a situation somewhere between the low and medium water demand scenarios this implies that the actual water demand may be greater than the inputted value figs 5d f although most of the water demand in this region is for mining and livestock more detailed analysis would need to include mining projects other than ot such as tavan tolgoi tsagaan suvraga ovoot tolgoi and nariin sukhait figs 2b and 3b and fig s4b in supplementary information the model would need to take into account that mines either extract groundwater for mining operations or pump shallow groundwater for mine dewatering other forms of water consumption such as the coal fired power plants at tavan tolgoi should also be considered adb 2014 further for all scenarios high water risks can be expected at the local level both in quantity and quality as increased water demand from mining and industrial activities would put a strain on locally limited water resources particularly the shallow groundwater resources available to herders and for crop irrigation systems the future effects of extensive groundwater extraction are yet to be clarified nice would be powerful for predicting and resolving future competition for water resources that could potentially trigger conflicts between mining companies herders and local communities banerjee et al 2014 4 3 for meeting required amount of water resources under deterioration of water environment some reservoirs are being planned in the tuul river basin to meet the increasing water demand of ulaanbaatar while most such reservoirs have been constructed by russia since the 1970s the local water authority is currently examining the water supply and has not yet reached the design phase jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 however abandonment of groundwater sources figs 5b and 6a in favor of surface water as central industrial and meat complex water sources would create a risk of water pollution particularly organic matter contamination as well as the threat posed by urbanization in spite of legal regulations banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 on the other hand shortage of groundwater figs 5d and 6c and its pollution particularly by heavy metals will become more serious in the galba river basin as a result of over pumping for mining development and the construction of sainshand industrial complex banerjee et al 2014 to meet water demand there the orkhon gobi water transfer project is planned to supply water from the orkhon river to mines in the south gobi via a pipeline more than 700 km long recently nice was developed further by coupling with biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc for application to global major river basins fig s1 in supplementary information incorporating hydrologic nutrient and carbon cycles in terrestrial aquatic linkages and including aquatic metabolism and terrestrially derived carbon together nakayama 2016 2017a b 2020 it will also be important to estimate the effects of these reservoirs on the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycle nakayama and watanabe 2008 nakayama and shankman 2013a nakayama and pelletier 2018 5 conclusions the process based eco hydrology model nice was applied to two contrasting river basins the tuul river basin located in northern grassland and steppe and the galba river basin in the southern gobi desert the model simulated the effect of past climatic change and human activity livestock urban usage and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in the two river basins this revealed differences in the spatial distribution of the hydrologic budget and its response to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances the tuul river has a very limited water resource in the middle area of the basin and has been seriously affected by ulaanbaatar urbanization in contrast the galba river showed a complicated hydrologic cycle and has been greatly affected by mining at ot though there was some hydrologic effect of drinking by herders livestock less than 1 m the groundwater level in the tuul river basin has been markedly degraded by ulaanbaatar over the last few decades and that in the galba river basin has declined markedly since 2010 due to ot mining analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to quantify inter annual variation or temporal trends in groundwater level due to the effects of changes in precipitation as well as the above water uses this methodology is powerful for evaluation of spatio temporal variations of water availability in regions for which inventory data such as those for urbanization and mining are lacking it will be necessary to conduct further uncertainty analysis of the hydrologic cycle to improve the evaluation of pasture carrying capacity and its vulnerability these approaches may help to

24696,in mongolia overuse and degradation of groundwater is a serious issue mainly in the urban and economic hub ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub in order to explicitly quantify spatio temporal variations in water availability a process based eco hydrology model nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology was applied to two contrasting river basins the tuul river which is characteristic of northern grassland and steppe and the galba river characteristic of the southern gobi desert the authors built a high resolution data grid representing water use for livestock urban populations and mining in the entire basins by combining a global dataset statistical data gis data observation data and field surveys to improve the accuracy of the model results the model simulated the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in these two river basins the model results showed a clear difference in the hydrologic cycle between them suggesting the impact of urbanization and mining on local regional eco hydrological degradation although drinking by herders livestock had some impact on the hydrologic change the groundwater level in the tuul river was shown to have been extremely degraded by water use in ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas that in the galba river has declined markedly as a result of oyu tolgoi mining since 2010 analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to separate the effects of climatic change and human activities on spatio temporal change in the groundwater level these results clarified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources in addition to climatic change this methodology is powerful for evaluating spatio temporal variations of water availability in regions with fewer inventory data on urbanization and mining keywords eco hydrology model water availability climatic change human activity groundwater degradation 1 introduction although mongolia has substantial groundwater resources they are unevenly distributed being abundant in the predominantly rural north but very scarce or non existent in the south at the beginning of the 21st century more than 80 of water resources were dependent on groundwater fig 1 now mongolia s water resources are under increasing pressure due to climatic change urbanization and rapid economic growth banerjee et al 2014 in particular the number of deep groundwater areas has increased greatly since 2000 fao 2012 and permafrost degradation due to climatic change drying out of surface water and increased use of groundwater have been becoming more serious rapid economic growth and political and socioeconomic shifts from socialism to capitalism starting around 1990 also caused serious environmental degradation overuse of groundwater resources resulting from urbanization exploitation of mineral resources and quarrying a rapid increase in livestock such as sheep and goats due to economic liberalization tumur et al 2018 a decrease in grassland productivity by livestock over grazing and over pumping and expansion of agricultural activity etc there are 29 river basins in mongolia under direct management by the ministry of environment and green development megdt mnet 2013 ifc 2017 fig 1 the areas at serious water risk are predominantly the urban and economic hub ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub banerjee et al 2014 in order to evaluate the degradation of water availability due to anthropogenic activity and climate change in these two contrasting hubs the author and his colleagues began to monitor the groundwater level in two river basins from summer 2018 okadera et al 2019 the tuul river basin is located in northern grassland and steppe except for forest in the upstream area jamsran et al 2018 in the middle stretch the river flows through ulaanbaatar the capital fig 1 for its municipal and industrial water supply groundwater has been drawn heavily from a network of shallow wells as a result the water level in the source zone the alluvial aquifer declined from 1 6 m in 1948 to 3 1 m in 1998 batsaikhan et al 2018 furthermore statistical data indicate that current water use may not be sustainable especially for meeting the projected water demand by the rapidly growing urban population in ulaanbaatar banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 in contrast the galba river basin galba uush doloodiing gobi river basin is located in the southern gobi desert which is mostly bare land and desert except for some grassland in north eastern region jamsran et al 2018 large mines such as oyu tolgoi ot and tavan tolgoi have been developing and recently started operations in this region fig 1 ot in particular is one of the world s largest copper gold deposits and started operations in 2008 oyu tolgoi llc 2013 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 the water resource system has to support this mining activity by providing where possible the water needed while satisfying competing water demands from the mining urbanization herder nexus banerjee et al 2014 despite previous findings indicating the impact of climate change and anthropogenic factors on water resources in both basins on different scenarios banerjee et al 2014 2016 adb 2014 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 quantitative and explicit evaluations of spatio temporal variations of water availability in the entire basins have been insufficient up to now it is important to clarify the impact of climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining development on water resources grassland carrying capacity and its vulnerability by using a process based model in the present study the process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model nakayama 2014 2015 supplementary information a was applied to the above two representative river basins the tuul river basin characteristic of northern grassland and steppe and the galba river basin characteristic of the southern gobi desert fig 1 supplementary information b nice incorporates a three dimensional groundwater submodel in addition to surface runoff submodel and extends the traditional concept of dynamic equilibrium with atmospheric forcing on a global scale maxwell and kollet 2008 based on the background described above three basic science questions were addressed i how does past climatic change influence the water resources in these two contrasting river basins ii how does anthropogenic activity such as livestock farming urban activity and mining change the water availability there iii how do these hydrologic changes affect the pasture carrying capacity and its vulnerability in order to answer these questions a high resolution gridded dataset representing water use for livestock urban activity and mining was derived by combining a global dataset statistical data gis data observation data and field surveys to input the nice simulation the model simulated the effect of climatic change and human activity livestock urban and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in the two river basins analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to quantify the inter annual variation or temporal trends in the groundwater level caused by these factors the results obtained would be used as a basis for extension to uncertainty analysis of the hydrologic cycle in order to improve the evaluation of pasture carrying capacity and its vulnerability 2 materials and methods 2 1 process based nice model and up scaling through coordinate transformation the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology framework includes the following complex sub compartments nakayama 2013 2014 2015 fig s1 in supplementary information a surface hydrology submodel a land surface submodel including urban and crop processes a groundwater submodel a regional atmospheric submodel a mass transport submodel for constituents in sediment and nutrients and a vegetation succession submodel nice is a process based distributed model that can offer an understandable formalism of water dynamics and a mathematical formulation allowing for its simulation simidjievski et al 2016 the model applies a rectangular coordinate system after albers projection or utm projection a recent study by one of the authors nakayama and maksyutov 2018 extended the model to include coordinate transformation from the original rectangular coordinate system nakayama et al 2006 nakayama and watanabe 2008 nakayama 2011a b nakayama and shankman 2013a b to a longitude latitude coordinate system applicable to continental scale or higher latitude by implementing a map factor and non uniform grid this transformation allowed up scaling to a global or higher latitude model by applying a non uniform grid and map factor into slope angle topography flow width propagation velocity and hydraulic conductivity 2 2 model input data six hour re analyzed data for downward radiation

called dzud massive mortality of livestock during 2001 2002 2009 2011 etc gomboluudev et al 2018 the input data at various spatial resolutions were prepared and arranged to calculate a spatially

sub basins in both rivers were calculated using topography and river channel data in the arcgis software fig 1 and these calculated data were compared with basin boundary data for mongolia mnet 2013 most of the tuul river basin is covered with grassland and steppe except for forest in the upstream area whereas most of the galba river basin is covered by bare land desert except for grassland in the northeastern region in the classification of glc2000 fig s3 in supplementary information 2 3 estimation of mining livestock and human water uses gridded data regarding water use for livestock

possible for input to the nice simulation table 1 supplementary information c total numbers of livestock sheep horses cattle goats and camels were estimated in each soum district of both basins using

for each soum every year national statistics office of mongolia 2019 and adjusted according to gridded population data with a 1 km spatial resolution every five years nasa 2018 there are 6 groundwater sources upper central industrial meat complex gachuurt and yarmag water sources to use and 2 more sources bio industrial complex and emerto water sources are planned to supply the capital in the future jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 in the absence of perennial rivers in the southern gobi region groundwater use in ot mining was calculated using the previous materials oyu tolgoi llc 2013 adb 2014 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 these data were finally gridded into 0 05 x 0 05 resolution during 1980 2018 using the arcgis software figs 2 and 3 and fig s4 in supplementary information in the tuul river basin a huge amount of groundwater has been used in ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas in the galba river basin there has been a large increase in the share of water use by the mining sector 84 since 2010 adb 2014 fig 3 2 4 boundary conditions and running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at the hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama and shankman 2013a b for the hillslope hydrology flow depth discharge and other water concentrations on the uppermost boundaries of basins were set to zero throughout the simulation in order to calculate these boundaries the authors firstly used gtopo30 to calculate each basin boundary at 1 km x 1 km resolution and then calculated the 0 05 x 0 05 grid using arcgis software for the model simulation inflows or outflows from the riverbeds were simulated at each time step depending on the difference in the groundwater and river hydraulic heads details have been described in the previous papers nakayama 2015 nakayama and watanabe 2004 the simulation areas in the tuul and galba river basins were 7 0 wide by 3 0 long and 11 0 wide by 6 0 long in longitude latitude coordinates respectively there are 29 river channels in the tuul river basin and 106 in the galba river basin fig 1 nice simulation of eco hydrological processes was performed at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution about 4 6 km resolution in the horizontal direction and in 20 layers with a weighting factor of 1 1 layer thicknesses being graduated from thinner in the upper layer to thicker in the deeper layer in the vertical direction the upper land layer was set at 0 2 m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200 m below sea level the model simulates the river network among elements and the terrestrial ecosystem in grid cells then the contribution of the river to the grid cell was estimated by calculating the areal ratio of the river river width multiplied by length in each grid details of the model set up and sensitivity analysis to show quantitative measures of model performance for the various parameters such as correlation coefficient root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency etc are given in the author s previous papers nakayama 2014 2017a 2020 simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6 h for 1980 2018 after a 1 year warm up period to allow a time varying equilibrium the simulated results were respectively calibrated and validated using ground water level observation byambasuren and odonsetseg 2015 igg 2018 okadera et al 2019 and river discharge in the tuul river num 2018 fig 1 and table s1 in supplementary information in order to separate the effects of climatic change and human activities on spatio temporal change in the groundwater level analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors was conducted the model simulation performed changes in precipitation livestock water use urban and mining water uses separately by keeping simply one of these effects constant the reference simulation repeated to use 1980 s forcing data 39 times during 1980 2018 finally groundwater level in the reference simulation was subtracted from those in alternative simulations to quantify temporal trend of groundwater level caused by various factors 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the hydrologic budget in two contrasting river basins in mongolia the authors compared observed and simulated values of river discharge between the tuul river basin during 1998 2018 at site nos 35 38 bosgo ulaanbaatar altanbulag and lun shown in fig 1 and table s1 in supplementary information fig s5 in supplementary information it can be seen that the discharge became maximal during the summer rainfall floods increasing in a downstream direction from bosgo to ulaanbaatar where forest is covered in the upstream area fig s3 in supplementary information changing little as far as altanbulag where the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin is smaller and then increasing gradually further downstream to lun where some tributaries merge fig 1 the model reasonably reproduced the values observed during the last 2 decades in particular comparison between daily fig s5a and monthly fig s5b aggregated validations showed that the root mean square error rmse in the monthly mean discharge was smaller than that in the daily mean discharge however the authors made no such comparison in the galba river basin because no observed values were available and the river remains dry almost throughout the year except during some heavy rainfall events the model also simulated the annual averaged hydrologic budget in the tuul and galba river basins during 1998 2018 fig 4 the results for each sub catchment in these basins showed a difference in the spatial distribution of the hydrologic budget between the two river basins for the tuul river basin the model showed that precipitation was higher in the northern region upstream and downstream of the river fig 4a an interesting feature was that the difference between precipitation and evaporation and water yield the net amount of water that leaves the sub basin and contributes to stream flow in the reach surface runoff lateral flow groundwater transmission loss fig s1 in supplementary information became minimal in the middle of the basin where most of the larger cities such as ulaanbaatar are located this means water resources are very limited and greatly affected by urbanization there in contrast in the galba river basin the water yield was relatively higher in the south eastern region although much smaller than in the tuul river basin fig 4b the severe limitation of water in the ot region is serious as the need to pump up more groundwater might lead to considerable hydrologic change there 3 2 impact of urbanization and mining on groundwater level in the two river basins the simulated data for groundwater level change were compared with the observed values in the tuul and galba river basins during 2000 2018 fig 5 in the tuul river basin the simulation showed that the hydrologic cycle has been greatly changed by overuse in ulaanbaatar figs 5a c there were differences in trends in the various regions upstream of the capital site nos 27 and 28 in table s1 in supplementary information which is affected by the upper water source fig 5a the central region site nos 30 and 32 in table s1 which has been seriously degraded by the central industrial meat complex gachuurt and yarmag water sources fig 5b the downstream area site no 34 in table s1 and the natural steppe region site no 18 in table s1 fig 5c jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 the groundwater level has generally declined by about 0 7 m averaged value during the study period as a result of livestock drinking and declined further by about 3 15 m averaged value in ulaanbaatar as a result of total water use site nos 30 and 32 in table s1 and fig 5b this decline has become serious after 2000 in the central region in contrast in the galba river figs 5d f there has been a great difference between intake near the ot mining area site nos 2 and 3 in table s1 fig 5d intake outside that area site nos 4 and 7 in table s1 fig 5e and sites without this effect site nos 8 and 9 in table s1 fig 5f although rainfall decreased slightly after 2000 in the galba river basin there were considerable fluctuations the annual mean temperature increased gradually fig s2 in supplementary information and this promoted evaporation after 2000 which caused a gradual decrease in groundwater level during 2005 2015 in addition to low precipitation the groundwater level has declined slightly by about 0 1 m averaged value during the study period as a result of drinking by livestock furthermore the model results show that the level has declined markedly by a maximum of 1 3 m after 2012 due to water use for mining in the area near ot site nos 2 and 3 in table s1 and fig 5d 3 3 separating the effects of climatic change and anthropogenic activity on spatio temporal change in the groundwater level nice was used to simulate changes in groundwater level from the 1980s to 1990s 2000s and 2010s around the groundwater sources in the tuul and galba river basins the differences in mean values among these periods were calculated fig s6 in supplementary information generally the simulated result showed that the groundwater level has decreased decade by decade in both basins in view of the trend for decreasing annual rainfall before 2010 fig s2 in supplementary information more importantly the model showed that the groundwater level has decreased gradually from the 1990s to the present around ulaanbaatar along the middle stretch of the tuul river due to over pumping there fig s6b in contrast the groundwater level showed a sudden decrease after the 2010s around the water source used for ot mining in the galba river basin starting in 2008 fig s6d the simulation also facilitated analysis of temporal trends and control of groundwater level changes to allow quantification of inter annual variations attributable to changes in precipitation and water use for livestock ulaanbaatar and ot mining respectively fig 6 in the tuul river basin the groundwater level tended to rise before 2000 due mainly to changes in precipitation and then showed a decreasing trend thereafter figs 6a b the model result also showed more than half of groundwater degradation in urban areas has been caused by urban water use after 2000 fig 6a in comparison to non urban areas fig 6b in contrast in the galba river basin this shift occurred around 2010 which was a little later than in the tuul river basin figs 6c d the model quantified more serious situation that almost all of groundwater degradation in mining areas has been caused by ot mining water use after 2010 fig 6c in comparison with non mining areas fig 6d in both basins the effect of water use for livestock was relatively lower than that attributable to urbanization and mining and precipitation change these analyses of the relative contributions of environmental factors helped us to directly quantify the inter annual variations or temporal trends in groundwater level change caused by those factors our results also reveal differences in the characteristics of the hydrologic cycle between the two contrasting river basins which are predominantly grassland steppe and bare land desert fig s3 in supplementary information affected or unaffected by urbanization and mining 4 discussion 4 1 for better understanding of overall distribution of water resources the results of the present simulation show that these two river basins representative of mongolia are heavily dependent on groundwater resources fao 2012 figs 2 and 3 while groundwater dynamics fundamentally depend on surface water and recharging through the natural hydrologic cycle the separate impacts of climate change and human activities are poorly understood nice simulated the differences in spatial distribution of the hydrologic budget between the tuul and galba river basins fig 4 previous studies have predicted that extreme flooding events and heavy winter precipitation are increasingly contributing to decreased reliability of the water supply unep 2009 fao 2012 increased temperature and evaporation will reduce surface water and recharge into shallow aquifers in contrast deep aquifers will be continuously degraded by urban and mining overuse ifc 2017 as illustrated by the present simulation analysis of the relative contributions shown in fig 6 supported the simulated result showing a decrease of the groundwater level in both basins fig 5 and fig s6 in supplementary information and quantified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources though nice is a powerful tool for grasping the overall distribution of water resources in river basins most of the input data are from global datasets in addition to statistical data gis data literature and observation data table 1 in particular details of geological structure are important for improving the accuracy of the simulated results for groundwater fig 5 and fig s6 in supplementary information in this study the authors used limited data from the literature batsaikhan et al 2018 and core sampling ministry of environment 2015 in combination with spatial extrapolation and some reasonable assumptions one report has indicated the need to use more ground truth data such as those of hydrogeological surveys and potential groundwater deposits ifc 2017 4 2 future effects of groundwater extraction in the two river basins prediction of future water demand in ulaanbaatar suggests that this will exceed the current supply capacity before 2021 for all scenarios banerjee et al 2016 in the high water demand scenario the demand will exceed the maximum available resources within seven years existing water resources are also vulnerable to pollution the present nice simulation of groundwater use in ulaanbaatar took into account only 6 sources figs 2a and 3a and fig s4a in supplementary information because there was no information on the locations of self water intake mnet 2010 megd 2012 sato 2015 our estimation showed that the volume of this self water intake was about 25 of total water use in ulaanbaatar this intake includes some of the water needed by industry energy and livestock etc in fact however the city may already be consuming much more water than the value employed in this study ulaanbaatar 2018 and thus the present simulated result might underestimate the total water demand in ulaanbaatar figs 5a c there is now a need for a major overhaul of the water supply and wastewater infrastructure to meet current demand and protect the local environment existing wastewater treatment plants are now operating beyond their design capacity in terms of the quantity and quality of effluents banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 it will be necessary to simulate hydrologic changes more precisely by inputting other forms of water use such as those for industry energy construction transport and utility services sites for large new mines are now being explored or have recently become operational in the southern gobi region as a backbone for the mongolian economy current projections for the high water demand scenario show that expected demand could exceed available resources before 2030 banerjee et al 2014 the total water use data for the galba river basin in 2015 inputted to nice represent a situation somewhere between the low and medium water demand scenarios this implies that the actual water demand may be greater than the inputted value figs 5d f although most of the water demand in this region is for mining and livestock more detailed analysis would need to include mining projects other than ot such as tavan tolgoi tsagaan suvraga ovoot tolgoi and nariin sukhait figs 2b and 3b and fig s4b in supplementary information the model would need to take into account that mines either extract groundwater for mining operations or pump shallow groundwater for mine dewatering other forms of water consumption such as the coal fired power plants at tavan tolgoi should also be considered adb 2014 further for all scenarios high water risks can be expected at the local level both in quantity and quality as increased water demand from mining and industrial activities would put a strain on locally limited water resources particularly the shallow groundwater resources available to herders and for crop irrigation systems the future effects of extensive groundwater extraction are yet to be clarified nice would be powerful for predicting and resolving future competition for water resources that could potentially trigger conflicts between mining companies herders and local communities banerjee et al 2014 4 3 for meeting required amount of water resources under deterioration of water environment some reservoirs are being planned in the tuul river basin to meet the increasing water demand of ulaanbaatar while most such reservoirs have been constructed by russia since the 1970s the local water authority is currently examining the water supply and has not yet reached the design phase jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 however abandonment of groundwater sources figs 5b and 6a in favor of surface water as central industrial and meat complex water sources would create a risk of water pollution particularly organic matter contamination as well as the threat posed by urbanization in spite of legal regulations banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 on the other hand shortage of groundwater figs 5d and 6c and its pollution particularly by heavy metals will become more serious in the galba river basin as a result of over pumping for mining development and the construction of sainshand industrial complex banerjee et al 2014 to meet water demand there the orkhon gobi water transfer project is planned to supply water from the orkhon river to mines in the south gobi via a pipeline more than 700 km long recently nice was developed further by coupling with biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc for application to global major river basins fig s1 in supplementary information incorporating hydrologic nutrient and carbon cycles in terrestrial aquatic linkages and including aquatic metabolism and terrestrially derived carbon together nakayama 2016 2017a b 2020 it will also be important to estimate the effects of these reservoirs on the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycle nakayama and watanabe 2008 nakayama and shankman 2013a nakayama and pelletier 2018 5 conclusions the process based eco hydrology model nice was applied to two contrasting river basins the tuul river basin located in northern grassland and steppe and the galba river basin in the southern gobi desert the model simulated the effect of past climatic change and human activity livestock urban usage and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in the two river basins this revealed differences in the spatial distribution of the hydrologic budget and its response to climatic and anthropogenic disturbances the tuul river has a very limited water resource in the middle area of the basin and has been seriously affected by ulaanbaatar urbanization in contrast the galba river showed a complicated hydrologic cycle and has been greatly affected by mining at ot though there was some hydrologic effect of drinking by herders livestock less than 1 m the groundwater level in the tuul river basin has been markedly degraded by ulaanbaatar over the last few decades and that in the galba river basin has declined markedly since 2010 due to ot mining analysis of the relative contribution of environmental factors also helped us to quantify inter annual variation or temporal trends in groundwater level due to the effects of changes in precipitation as well as the

24697,ecological research focuses on the spatio temporal patterns of ecosystems and communities the recently proposed framework of community trajectory analysis considers community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance and utilizes geometrical properties of trajectories to compare and analyse temporal changes here we extend the initial framework which focused on consecutive trajectory segments by considering additional metrics with respect to initial or baseline states addressing questions about community dynamics and more generally temporal and spatial ecological variability requires synthetic and efficient modes of representation hence we propose a set of innovative maps charts and trajectory roses to represent trajectory properties and complement the panel of traditional modes of representation used in community ecology we use four case studies to highlight the complementarity and the ability of the new metrics and innovative figures to illustrate ecological trajectories and to facilitate their interpretation finally we encourage ecologists skilled in multivariate analysis to integrate cta into their toolbox in order to quantitatively evaluate spatio temporal changes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecological variability impact assessment initial state community dynamics trajectory analysis representation tools 1 introduction ecology aims to identify processes underlying the distribution and abundance of organisms along with those that determine how organisms modify their abiotic environment kendall 2015 two paradigms are widely accepted amongst ecologists 1 biological assemblages are amongst the best response variable to estimate the impact of changes in natural ecosystems and 2 temporal changes in community assemblages indicate that some processes have been at work to generate them legendre and gauthier 2014 temporal changes in biological assemblages are the sum of local colonisation and extinction events as well as changes in the biomass and relative abundance of taxa within and amongst samples buckley et al 2018 quantifying and forecasting temporal changes in biodiversity and ecological shifts due to both natural and anthropogenic drivers is therefore a central issue in ecology dornelas et al 2013 this requires repeatedly sampling target communities over time and often studying their evolution compared to an initial state and or a chosen baseline goal defined as an ecological state to be achieved bioret et al 2009 to this aim consecutive ecological states are defined by a set of environmental or biological parameters used as descriptors of the ecosystem existing on a given location at a given time chemical and physical parameters absolute or relative abundance of population species specific richness pollution level in a period of dramatic increase of anthropogenic impacts such approaches are particularly relevant for studying natural variability and have potential implications in management and ecological restoration or in the development of ecological indicators the development of community ecology has historically been influenced by static depictions of inherently dynamic processes which led to many important insights about the structure of communities yang 2020 analytical and representation methods of biodiversity changes over time constitute an essential and important domain of innovation cimon and cusson 2018 magurran et al 2019 to study dynamics of natural systems since the beginning of community ecology elton 1927 accordingly yang 2020 suggests specific and complementary ways to continue building towards a more temporally explicit framework for community ecology notably by increasing the representation of temporal changes and developing specific and general insights into event or factor driven dynamics in this way complementary metrics are needed to document community and environmental changes cimon and cusson 2018 while the availability of long term large scale and high resolution data is the most limiting factor to study temporal patterns in biodiversity dornelas et al 2013 the development of methodological approaches to analyse synthesize and ultimately represent the dynamics of ecological systems is also an essential issue until now most analytical and representation frameworks have been based on the comparison of synchronous observations across sites and between repeated surveys m de cáceres et al 2019 one common approach is to analyse independently the changes observed between two surveys and to repeat this step as many times as necessary to cover the corresponding study period however this type of procedure quickly becomes inefficient as the number of samples increases a potential solution to deal with long term data sets could be to discard intermediate surveys and to focus only on starting and ending time points of a study period however this may hide crucial changes occurring during intermediate periods i e transitional states and hence its usefulness to study the dynamics of ecological systems may be limited multivariate analyses have been widely adopted for many decades in ecology embracing all forms of statistical analyses applied to data in which more than one character are observed per individual kendall 1958 several multivariate statistical frameworks focus on testing hypotheses of community dynamics buckley et al 2018 consequently multivariate frameworks still constitute the primary approach to analyse ecological datasets and an important source of methodological innovations a common approach is the calculation of dissimilarity indices which allows differences between a pair of ecological states to be summarized in a single metric since community data tables can represent both temporal and spatial variation of ecological states the resulting symmetric dissimilarity matrices can contain spatial temporal or spatio temporal information then the use of ecological trajectories in a multivariate space defined by the calculation of a dissimilarity index between all pairs of observations allows to representing the dynamics of a system ordination methods are therefore often complemented with trajectory analyses in which changes over time or as a response to natural or anthropogenic pressures are represented by a set of vectors linking consecutive ecological states these approaches have been previously applied to a wide variety of ecological systems including plant assemblages austin 1977 fukami et al 2005 bird assemblages hudson and bouwman 2007 sica et al 2018 haig et al 2019 and aquatic matthews et al 2013 mathers et al 2016 boit and spencer 2019 david et al 2020 or marine ecosystems dauvin and ibanez 1987 smith et al 2010 legendre and salvat 2015 cimon and cusson 2018 in this context geometric properties of trajectories defined in the space of an ordination diagram constitute relevant parameters to study the dynamics of ecological systems including intermediate transitional states the geometric study of community trajectories has sometimes been defined by two or three axes of an ordination space boit and spencer 2019 matthews et al 2013 but this has the drawback of discarding the information contained in additional dimensions in order to generalize this approach m de cáceres et al 2019 considered community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance with no limit in the number of dimensions included in the community trajectory analysis cta framework trajectories are considered as objects composed of trajectory segments to be analysed and compared using their metrics based on their geometry in a multivariate space in 2d multivariate ordinations accounting for fine scale variability hinders readability especially when the number of sites and or surveys is high even if different line formats and colours are used to facilitate the identification of different trajectories a common approach to represent the amount of change across space between two surveys t 1 and t 2 is to produce a single map i e a plot on geographical axes in which for instance the symbol size is proportional to the distance between states x1 and x2 for each sampling unit bacouillard et al 2020 kröncke et al 2011 however with this method the addition of one more survey involves the production of two more maps to represent changes between t2 and t3 states and the overall change between t1 and t3 after the last survey for three ecological surveys this method is still doable but it fails to represent simultaneously all ecological trajectory segments and more importantly information about ecological directions although mapping diversity or similarity indices are fused in many ecological studies granger et al 2015 mapping temporal changes through symbols representing trajectory metrics rather than the dissimilarity between consecutive surveys has not yet been sufficiently explored in our opinion considering the direction of ecosystem dynamics circular statistics analysis of directions ranging from 0 to 360 batschelet 1981 which are commonly used in behavioural ecology appear as promising alternatives to quantitatively represent the direction of dynamics of ecological systems and to complement traditional modes of representation in this perspective circular statistics may offer significant insights to represent trajectory properties that are not evident from qualitative comparisons of ordination diagrams as suggested for food webs by schmidt et al 2007 in this paper we propose an extension of the cta framework to represent temporal changes between more than two temporal surveys with respect to a chosen baseline state as initially defined in m de cáceres et al 2019 cta was focused on the study of ecological states corresponding to consecutive surveys a complementary overarching question being to know how ecological states change with respect to an initial state and or to a baseline an alternative way to analyse trajectories can be developped considering these fixed ecological states as central in the analysis as cta allows calculating lengths angles between trajectory segments and directionality of trajectories it is likely to be a complementary framework to approaches comparing data to initial state based on distances or distance sequences bacouillard et al 2020 bagchi et al 2017 legendre 2019 legendre and salvat 2015 differences in cluster classification kröncke et al 2011 or shifts along multivariate axes mclean et al 2019 the main contributions of this article concern 1 the extension of cta with new metrics that describe community trajectories with respect to a chosen state and new ways of defining angles 2 the synthetic representation of trajectories through three innovative figure concepts a map of changes between ecological states including information about recovering and departing dynamics with respect to a baseline or initial state b a chart of trajectories from initial state to represent trajectory paths and overall changes c trajectory rose to summarise in a circular framework the direction and length of ecological trajectories four case studies are then developed to illustrate the use of our proposed metrics and representation tools finally their potential applications and limitations are discussed 2 methods the methods detailed in the following subsections are based on trigonometrical properties of trajectories in n dimensional spaces and their representation in innovative synthetic figures 2 1 characterizing ecological trajectories 2 1 1 cta framework we follow here the terminology of de cáceres et al 2019 for describing and comparing community trajectories in a multidimensional space given a target community whose dynamics are surveyed let o1 o2 o n be an ordered set of n observations n 1 and t1 t2 tn the corresponding set of ordered survey times i e t1 t2 tn fig 1 a for all i in 1 2 n xi contains the coordinates or ecological state corresponding to oi in a multidimensional space ω the geometry of the trajectory t is formalized using a set of n 1 directed segments s1 sn 1 where si xi xi 1 is a segment with endpoints community states xi and x i 1 fig 1 a the multivariate space ω supporting cta is defined by the choice of dissimilarity coefficients e g bray curtis which is used to evaluate resemblance between pairs of community observations legendre and de cáceres 2013 m de cáceres et al 2019 note that users can choose the scale of cta by setting the scale at which communities are defined for example community trajectories may be studied at the site level or at larger scales e g landscape or regional level if community data are aggregated across sites 2 1 2 trajectory metrics original cta metrics relevant for this paper are first introduced section 2 1 2 1 and new contributions are detailed from section 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 original cta metrics the trajectory segment length is the distance between two consecutive ecological states de cáceres et al 2019 the greater the length of a trajectory segment the greater the distance between ecological states is the length of a segment si is given by the distance between its two endpoints in space ω fig 1 a l si d xi x i 1 the trajectory path length de cáceres et al 2019 is the total length of all site trajectory segments over surveys of a study period this metric contributes to informing about the overall temporal variation of the state of a site within a study period l t i 1 n 1 l s i i 1 n 1 d x i x i 1 lengths of segments or subtrajectories are influenced by the time interval between surveys hence lengths alone do not allow proper consideration of ecological dynamics i e the speed of change to this aim a better alternative is to consider trajectory speeds after dividing lengths by the time interval between observations s si l si ti 1 ti another aspect of community dynamics is approached by the calculation of angles de cáceres et al 2019 let xi xj xk be a triplet of ecological states of a trajectory t that are ordered in time i e where ti tj tk if the set of distances d xi xj d xi xk d xj xk fulfills the triangle inequality then angles can be measured on the euclidean plane that contains these three states fig 1 a the angle 0 ɵ xi xj xk 180 is defined as the change in direction of vector xj xk with respect to vector xi xj in this plane the trajectory is linear when ɵi 0 if ɵi 180 trajectory is still linear but opposite in sense finally the overall directionality of trajectories provides information about the consistency with which the site is following the same direction and therefore the stability of the drivers of ecological dynamics that condition ecological states the directionality statistic de cáceres et al 2019 of a trajectory is measured using the following d i r t w i j k 180 θ i j k 180 w i j k where ɵijk ɵ xi xj xk wijk d xi xj d xj xk and summation is over all r time ordered triplets dir t is bounded between 0 and 1 where the maximum value corresponds to a straight trajectory this metric is useful to distinguish between communities subjected to stabilizing non directional selection from those influenced by directional or disruptive selections lamothe et al 2019 matthews et al 2013 2 1 2 2 trajectory analysis with respect to an initial state net change lt1 tj let x1 be an initial or baseline state the net change is defined for any pair of states x 1 x j as the length i e distance lt1 tj d x1 xj between x1 and xj fig 1 b when calculated at the scale of an overall study period between x1 and xn survey this metric evaluates the difference between the community at the end of the study period and its initial state overall net trajectory change net change ratio ncr the net change ratio is defined as the ratio between the overall net trajectory change and the trajectory path length ncr lt1 t n survey l t ncr informs about the straightness of recovering or departing processes with respect to the initial state a high ncr indicates that a great part of the trajectory path contributes to net changes and illustrate a relative stability of drivers of ecological dynamics inversely a low ncr coupled with high segment lengths illustrates instability of drivers of ecological dynamics and highlights that a small part of the trajectory path contributes to net changes in this sense ncr and dir t are complementary metrics high dir t would be equal to high ncr but a low dir t may not be equal to low ncr depending on segment lengths recovering or departing trajectory rdt let us now consider a x1 xj xk triplet where the first element corresponds to the baseline state t1 tj tk the net change of the x 1 xj pair lt1 tj d x1 xj and the net change of the x 1 xk pair lt1 tk d x1 xk can be used to qualify the dynamics with respect to the initial state as recovering i e return to the initial state or departing i e increasing distance from the initial state let us define rdt recovering or departing trajectory metric as the difference between these two distances rdt d x1 xj d x1 xk rdt 0 indicates a closer ecological state in xk than in xj and consequently implies a recovering towards the initial state ris x1 between xj and xk fig 2 inversely rdt 0 indicates a farther ecological state in xk than in xj and consequently implies a departure from the initial state dis between xj and xk rdt could help to determine the effectiveness of management on the ecological state of a community with respect to a baseline state defined as an objective to be achieved or inversely the impact of a natural or anthropogenic event additionally in a context of disturbances in which x1 xj and xk represent pre disturbance disturbed and post disturbance states respectively rdt can be used as a measure of the ecosystem resilience 2 1 2 3 linearity of changes with respect to an initial state linearity with respect to the initial state ω we propose to calculate the angle ω x1 xj xk between trajectory vectors x1 xj and xj xk in a 0 180 system considering 0 as the same direction of the first vector fig 1 c angles allow assessing the linearity of changes with respect to an initial state lis according to a vector of reference i e first segment or subtrajectory aggregation of segments of an ecological trajectory in the euclidean space when space ω is 2d ω as well as ɵ can be reported in a 0 360 system if desired see examples in fig 10 and 13 the direction angles within a trajectory constitutes an important component of the ecological variability as different directions do not make the same ecological sense even if the lengths or speeds of these trajectories are equivalent there is a correspondence between ω i angles and rdt indeed if angle ω i 90 or ω i 270 the trajectory departs from the x1 initial state i e rdt 0 regardless of trajectory length on the contrary if 90 ω i 270 the trajectory recovers ris area rdt 0 or departs dis area rdt 0 depending on both angle and length values fig 2 2 1 2 4 directions with respect to the plane formed by two axes if users decide that the variance is sufficiently explained by the first two axes of an ordination it becomes relevant to consider all trajectory segment directions with respect to the interpretation of axes normally done using the loadings of original variables or their degree of correlation with additional variables segment directions in 2d ordination α we propose to assess angles α xi xj axis 2 considering the second axis of the ordination diagram as the north 0 fig 1 d α allows comparing segment direction with respect to the influence of the variables used to interpret the two ordination axes 2 1 2 5 testing and comparing trajectory directions circular data need special treatment in data analysis an angle of 355 is much similar to an angle of 5 than it is to an angle of 330 hence a simple arithmetic mean for example can be quite misleading landler et al 2018 in order to analyse the uniformity of directions landler et al 2018 recommended using the rayleigh test when unimodal departure from uniformity is expected and the hermans rasson test hr for multimodal departures landler et al 2019 such tests allows verifying if there is a unimodal bias in the distribution of angles directions i e if the direction of vector x j x k changes with respect to vector xi xj are evenly distributed null hypothesis or concentrated around one or more particular directions one should prioritize the rayleigh or the hr tests depending the type of distribution of direction and following landler et al 2019 recommendations the watson william s two test is used to test the homogeneity null hypothesis or the significance of difference of segment direction between different factors 2 1 3 software to facilitate conducting the extension of the cta framework function options and new functions have been developed to calculate metrics considering x1 as a constant baseline over time this new set of cta tools has been integrated into a new version v 1 7 9 of the package vegclust de cáceres et al 2010 available on cran and github repositories 2 2 representing the variability of ecological states and trajectories 2 2 1 mapping trajectory dynamics with respect to an initial state here we suggest the use of maps to represent site scale dynamics through geometrical properties of trajectories in synthetic figures accounting for temporal variability at the sampling unit scale in order to avoid multiple distance maps between every pair of surveys we propose the use of a single map to represent all at once for each site of a study area 1 net change between x1 and xn survey 2 segment length or subtrajectory length sb si 1 and sj i and 3 ris or dis segment or subtrajectory lengths between xi and xn survey symbols proposed in our synthetic map to represent net change and intermediate segments or subtrajectories defined arbitrarily if n surveys 3 are detailed in fig 3 net changes are represented through a circular symbol proportional to the length to vector x1 xj i on both sides a bottom triangle symbol represents the x 1 x i 1 vector and a top triangle the x i 1 x j i vector for both triangles the size is proportional to the length of respective vectors while the orientation and colour of the top triangle illustrate the direction recovering or departing of the second vector with respect to the initial or baseline state when more than three ecological states are used directionality of subtrajectories can be represented with colors in both triangles fig 4 in this map circles representing net changes are drawn on the geographical coordinates of sampling locations while the bottom and top triangles are placed on the map by subtracting or adding an arbitrary value to the y coordinate it may be relevant to define subtrajectories according to a critical event which influence ecological states e g new pressures management activities disturbance fire storm volcanic eruption oil spill or to a period considered as a baseline in order to help to better understand the shape of trajectories in terms of lengths and angles before and after perturbation in this case one should adapt the temporal period represented in the bottom triangle inversely without a priori knowledge about such event the occurrence of saltatory and non directional trajectories lamothe et al 2019 matthews et al 2013 which vary with the overall shape of the trajectory path could help to identify key periods in the history of an ecosystem regarding environmental or other contextual parameters 2 2 2 adding cta metrics to ordination diagrams trajectories are traditionally represented on 2d or 3d ordination diagrams using arrows for segments here we propose to complete this kind of chart by adding information about trajectory metrics such as net changes data point symbols represent the coordinates of each ecological state according to the axes of the ordination diagram and lines represent segments between transitional ecological states the novelty lies in representing the distance to the initial state i e first state of the time series and time by the dot size and colour respectively if a single trajectory is represented and one wants to better illustrate the evolution of net changes over time the trajectory can be centred around the initial state by subtracting the coordinates of the state corresponding to the initial state x1 from the coordinates of all ecological states 2 2 3 trajectory rose diagrams we propose to use a trajectory rose tr to represent the distribution of directions in the multivariate space ω as it is traditionally done in meteorology to represent wind directions and speeds azorin molina et al 2017 cieszyńska and stramska 2018 or in currentology dalbosco et al 2020 dufresne et al 2014 the tr consists of a circular bar plot of angles ranging from 0â to 360â the barplot structure of tr allows representing factors in different bar sections depending on the aim of the analysis users can choose to represent ɵ ω or α angles in a tr 2 2 3 1 distribution of ɵ ω values the baseline state tr provides a synthetic visualisation of ecological trends at the scale of a study area according to directional changes 0 360 of one vector with respect to the previous one for each consecutive triplet over time users can choose to represent distributions of ɵ or ω angles in order to analyse changes of direction of each triplet or the direction of each segment with respect to the previous or the first segment of the trajectory respectively angles ɵi between segments xi xj i and xj i xk j are defined between 0 and 180 when considering all multivariate dimensions or can be reported in a 0 360 system if calculated from 2d coordinates angles ωi between segments x 1 x i 1 and x i 1 x j i are also reported in a 0 360 system when calculated on 2d coordinates at this step of the procedure the user must consider whether the variance explained by the two first components is high enough to evaluate angles in a 0 360 system a value of 0 indicates a straight dis segment with no change of direction with respect to x 1 x i 1 vector the distribution of angles is represented in barplots whose size indicates the number of segments following a given direction ris on the bottom part 90 ωris 270 and dis in both parts depending on the length of the second segment of each triplet lengths of vector xj xk are aggregated on the top of each bar section and coloured according to distance in order to underline if direction trends occur in short or long trajectories 2 2 3 2 distribution of α values α angles are calculated considering the second axis of the ordination diagram as the north 0 and represented in a tr in order to illustrate distribution of segment direction in a 2d euclidean space it allows the characterization of the nature of change by comparing segment direction with respect to the interpretation of ordination axes variables names aiding the interpretation of directions can be positioned in the periphery of the tr see fig 10 3 ecological applications four ecological applications were chosen to illustrate the proposed cta metrics and modes of representation in different ecological systems 3 1 ecological application 1 temporal variability of waterbird communities in a marine protected area the national nature reserve of saint brieuc brittany france is a marine protected area designed in 1998 to protect wintering birds anatidae populations are monitored each winter as part of the international waterbird census iwc cta has been performed on the nine most abundant species for which a census has been performed during 21 wintering from 2000 to 2020 supplementary data appendix a anatidae monitoring has been carried out each year in january and encompassed the overall presumed functional area i e intertidal feeding ground lengths angles and directionality were calculated supplementary data appendix b the temporal variability of the bird community was illustrated with an ordination diagram centred on the initial survey and representing time and net change using symbol colour and size as suggested in subsection 2 2 2 for the trajectory rose a bar plot of ɵ angles of each consecutive triplet ranging from 0 to 360 was produced range of 15 for each bar and this chart was transformed in a rose with the function coord polar of the package ggplot2 wickham 2016 lengths of trajectory segments ranged from 2 03 to 6 16 but were quite stable over time 3 46 1 06 total trajectory path 69 14 at the end of the study period distance to the initial state 5 79 was slightly higher than the mean value of net change 4 96 1 28 fig 5 shows the ordination diagram representing the temporal variability of the community with respect to the initial state during the 21 years of sampling the first axis explained twice as much variance 39 as the second axis 20 different species have influenced the anatidae community supplementary data appendix a three species mainly contribute to the first axis and are characterized by a clear decrease in numbers branta bernicla mareca penelope and to a lesser extent mareca strepera other species characterised by stable abundances or drastic interannual variations were mostly expressed on the second axis the first axis highlights the temporal pattern of the community which is confirmed by the clustering of the most recent sampling occasions on the positive side of the first axis fig 5 the dominance of 90 ɵ 270 84 2 and ris and dis alternation figs 5 and 6 supplementary data appendix a suggest an ecological turnover in the species involved in ecological change this results in a strong spring effect around the first state of each consecutive survey which explains the very small ncr between 2000 and 2020 8 35 and low directionality 0 375 in absence of straight departing 0 and recovering 180 clear dominance trajectory trends step by step to a different ecological state from 2000 to 2020 the anatidae community mainly varied depending on the decline of two of the most numerous species b bernicla and mareca penelope other influencing species are not consistent over time which resulted in a clear spring effect around the initial state cta results confirmed conclusions of sturbois and ponsero 2019 and bring new insights concerning the way that ecological variability could be expressed through trajectory properties of bird communities within a given site 3 2 ecological application 2 spatio temporal changes of benthic communities in a modified system controlled for a tidal power station the spatio temporal variability of benthic communities was studied in the rance estuary brittany france a modified system whose main physical characteristics are controlled by the functioning of a tidal power station desroy and retière 2004 the construction of the facility began in 1963 and was completed in 1966 before the building of this infrastructure the rance was a ria with sectors differentiated by saline stratification whereas the system is now clearly separated into two main entities the marine reservoir and the upstream estuary brackish water the construction step led to the formation of a hypohaline basin inducing immediate strong mortality events for benthic macrofauna and a period of instability 1967 1975 the control of the physical characteristics of the system has affected sediment dynamics and deeply modified benthic habitats bonnot courtois 1997 bonnot courtois and lafond 1991 retière 1979 soft bottom benthic communities were sampled at 34 stations in 1976 1995 and 2010 in the upstream estuary in order to analyse the ecological variability associated with the recovery process and sedimentary changes fig 7 desroy and retière 2004 temporal beta diversity index tbi legendre 2019 was run in order to verify if species gains or losses were responsible for net changes at the scale of both consecutive periods a hellinger transformation was performed on the overall data set prior to multivariate analysis pca and coordinates of sites on the ordination diagram for the three surveys were used as inputs for community trajectory analysis supplementary data appendix c a trajectory map was produced in order to synthetize trajectories of benthic communities on each site through the three surveys after data aggregation depending on the station location upstream vs down stream a second cta analysis was performed in order to verify if local changes resulted in larger scale variations the species richness dramatically decreased from 149 species in 1976 to 54 and 73 species in 1995 and 2010 respectively 27 species were common to the three surveys a high variability of faunal composition was observed since 14 species appeared and 70 disappeared between 1976 and 1995 vs 38 new species and 19 less between 1995 and 2010 at the scale of the overall monitoring period 34 new species were observed between 1976 and 2010 and 71 species disappeared tbi index 0 46 confirms that species losses dominated species gains between 1976 and 1995 losses for 18 stations and gains for 16 stations inversely gains dominated losses 0 60 for the 1995 2010 period losses for 10 stations vs gains for 24 stations according to the cumulative trajectory path length of all sites the first period was characterized by a higher ecological variability 539 69 15 87 7 70 than the second 469 92 13 82 5 14 considering trajectory path length at the station scale seven stations 59 66 63 67 57 61 58 represented 32 48 327 96 of the whole trajectory path and segment lengths were more important during the second period for 13 stations 31 71 two main spatial trajectory patterns were identified fig 8 eight stations mainly located in the upstream part south of the study area were characterized by lower net 19 67 3 84 and consecutive changes 9 07 2 30 inversely higher changes characterized other stations mainly located in the downstream part north both at the scale of the overall study period 37 60 13 98 and consecutive ones 16 41 6 43 this increasing change along the upstream downstream gradient is confirmed by significant correlations between latitude and net changes 0 40 p value 0 01944 and trajectory path lengths 0 45 p value 0 00685 rdt was positive for 12 sites and negative for 22 showing an overall departure dynamic from the initial state for 64 71 of sites mainly located in the northern part of the study area fig 8 lower ncr values indicate significant direction changes between 1976 and 1995 and 1995 2010 trajectory segments supplementary data appendix c it implies that changes are induced by different species groups between both periods differences in the magnitude of changes revealed at local scales areas also result in contrasted overall trends net change at the larger scale of upstream 23 59 and downstream 49 77 communities the community described in 1976 was already undergoing a recovery process which explains species losses and gains in the following surveys according to the trajectory length of both periods and departing trajectories occurring in 64 71 of the stations benthic communities are not yet stabilized in the study area this seems particularly true for downstream stations which suffered most changes in this area regular changes in environmental conditions according to the estuary functioning influenced by the power station would probably not lead to a stabilization of benthic communities except if some species characterized by high dynamics induce long term changes of sediment facies e g invasive species such as crepidula fornicata and ruditapes philippinarum future surveys will help to verify these hypotheses inversely upstream stations are more stable probably due to environmental factors influence of fresh water which limit the variability of communities through a drastic selection of species 3 3 ecological application 3 temporal sedimentary variability in a marine intertidal area sediment facies were studied at 42 sites in the intertidal area of the bay of saint brieuc in 1987 gros and hamon 1988 2001 bonnot courtois and dreau 2002 and 2019 sturbois et al unpublished data at these dates one sample of sediment was collected with a handcorer 5 cm diameter depth of 5 cm on each site and subsequently analysed for grain size distribution in the laboratory statistical analyses were performed with the package g2sd fournier et al 2014 sedimentary data from the three periods were combined in the same dataset subjected to cta analysis supplementary data appendix d and e two tr were then produced in order to illustrate the distribution of α angles for both periods with respect to sedimentary variables localised at the periphery of tr according to their position in the variable factor map pca finally hr and watson william s tests were performed to test the homogeneity of angles distribution and the difference of segment direction between periods respectively the first two dimensions of the pca explained 81 8 of the variance so consideration of trajectory and segment properties with respect to these components is allowable trajectory path was lower for the period 1987 2001 72 17 1 72 1 55 than for the period 2001 2019 99 67 2 37 1 96 which indicated more sedimentary variability in the second period however the sedimentary dynamics i e speed of changes was quantitatively quite similar for the two periods 1987 2001 5 16 vs 2001 2019 5 53 during the first period 7 stations contributed to 46 38 of the trajectory path whereas 12 stations were responsible for 59 20 of changes between 2001 and 2019 fig 9 supplementary data appendix d and e this reveals that few sites are characterized by a high sedimentary variability length 3 while changes in most stations were more moderate the tr qualitatively represents the pattern of the segments direction according to sedimentary variables fig 10 during the first period segment direction mainly occurred in the bottom part of the rose hr test t 11 07 p value 0 004 according to different sand variables from very fine to fine whereas for the segments of the second period it occurred in the top part of the rose hr test t 13 77 p value 0 002 according to very fine sand mud and coarse sediment variables watson test t 0 896 p value 0 001 these results are consistent with the conclusions of sturbois et al unpublished data who showed that thirty years sedimentary changes in the intertidal part of the bay of saint brieuc resulted in 1 an overall slight sloughing revealed by the increase in the contribution of very fine sediment classes over the study period 2 a high variability at few stations contrasting with moderate changes in the rest of the study area this ecological application confirmed that angles and lengths are relevant trajectory properties to qualitatively and quantitatively describe trajectory patterns according to period or other factors such as habitat management or pressure 3 4 ecological application 4 response of boreal forests to insect outbreaks the spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana clem is considered amongst the most severe defoliating insects of boreal and sub boreal forests of eastern north america blais 1957 every 30 to 40 years its populations synchronously reaches outbreak levels over large spatial scales generating dramatic ecological and economic impacts due to important mortality events in areas dominated by balsam fir abies balsamea l and spruce picea spp whereas balsam fir usually presents higher levels of defoliation and mortality rates than spruce species of northern latitudes a recent study sánchez pinillos et al 2019 found a higher resilience of forests dominated by balsam fir than by black spruce p mariana mill on the contrary black spruce forests proved to be highly resistant to the insect attack but collapsed under long and severe outbreaks we used a subset of plots affected by spruce budworm outbreaks and selected by sánchez pinillos et al 2019 from quebec s forest inventory ministère des ressources naturelles 2013 to assess forest responses to insect outbreaks with respect to individual pathways in particular we compared the dynamics of 74 mixed communities co dominated by balsam fir and white birch betula papyrifera marsh and 74 stands dominated by black spruce fig 11 forest plots were characterised with species abundance and size classes for the most common species cta metrics supplementary data appendix f were used to characterize forest responses to the perturbation and a trajectory map was used to illustrate spatial patterns of trajectories according to the three types of responses to the outbreak sánchez pinillos et al 2019 we finally used a tr of ω distribution to illustrate differential responses according to the type of forest the changes of mixed fir birch forests was reflected through longer trajectory paths 64 73 and lower net change 42 17 than the homologous in black spruce forests 47 70 and 59 95 respectively however both forests showed similar trajectory patterns with longer distances between the pre disturbance and disturbed states sum s1 fir birch 37 95 sum s1 spruce 39 12 than between the disturbed and post disturbance states sum s2 fir 26 77 sum s2 spruce 20 83 the trajectory map fig 12 underlines the different responses of forests to the outbreak 1 resistant plots were mainly characterized by departing dynamics and low segment length and net change 2 resilient plots mainly occurred through recovering dynamics high segment lengths and moderate net change and 3 changed plots were defined by departing dynamics and high segments lengths and net changes in agreement with sánchez pinillos et al 2019 a higher percentage of recovering trajectories was found at southern latitudes where balsam fir co dominates the stands with white birch thus 42 of the plots classified as fir white mixed forests showed recovering trajectories in comparison to the 30 1 of black spruce stands on the contrary shorter trajectories were found above latitude 49 reflecting the greater resistance of black spruce to the spruce budworm attack it is important to note that whereas we represented forest dynamics of all forest types in the same map one could be interested in assessing the spatial differences in the responses of a given forest community in such a case a potential alternative could be to generate independent maps or different symbols or colours for each forest type tr diagrams of ω distribution showed a clear rupture in trajectory direction between disturbed and final state for both forest typologies many plots did not show changes in forest classification it is important to note that dissimilarities between forest surveys were calculated by considering different size classes for the most common species in boreal forests p mariana p glauca a balsamea and b papyrifera the tr analyses therefore illustrated the changes in forest structure resulting from the death of the most vulnerable trees thus most black spruce forests remained with the same composition after the outbreak or changed toward forests with a lower basal area represented by a different forest typology fig 13 b pimahigh in the case of mixed forests of balsam fir and white birch fig 13 a abba bepa our results showed different successional stages including the dominance of white birch colonizing gaps a transient stage of mixed fir birch stands and a last successional stage dominated by balsam fir 4 discussion the cta framework represents a valuable approach to assess ecological dynamics based on the geometric analysis of trajectories defined in a multidimensional space of community resemblance geometric properties of trajectories projection of a community state onto a trajectory convergence divergence and geometric resemblance between a pair of trajectories spatial variation in community dynamics de cáceres et al 2019 here we went further in the definition of geometric properties of trajectories by complementing the available metrics and proposing synthetic methods of applied representation that facilitate the interpretation of ecosystem dynamics over time for that we integrated new tools options and new functions into the original version of the cta framework available in package vegclust on cran and github repositories 4 1 extending cta metrics the proposed extension makes the cta framework more complete in order to address a larger panel of ecological questions especially in applied ecology the new metrics can be useful for instance when monitoring ecosystem responses to disturbances or in the context of ecosystem restoration by focusing cta on geometric properties with respect to baseline ecological states net changes new angles and the rdt metrics along with recovering and departing characterisation of trajectories allow addressing these issues as shown in the case studies section the extension includes a new set of functions based on the two first axes of the dissimilarity space in which trajectories were originally defined this facilitates the use of cta to users aiming to restrict analyses to a 2d cartesian space or to study trajectories in a biplot including only two variables as the first two axes often explain a part of the total variance the user must be cautious with the interpretation of the angles used in trajectory roses particularly when the two first axes explain a small proportion of total variance when most variance proportion is captured we consider that these metrics can be compared to variables in multivariate spaces in order to provide ecological meaning to the direction when using ɵ and ω angles in tr cta returns angles between trajectory segments regarding 2d point coordinates of the third survey of each triplet with respect to the previous segment the variance explained by the first two axis remains also important here to evaluate the relevance of angles transformations even if the coordinates of the third point in the 2d space are only used to flip the 0 180 angles in positive or negative consequently this step does not influence the accuracy of angle calculations considering all components as each triplet forms its own plane it is not possible to provide an ecological meaning related to the environmental variables but we consider that this step of the procedure still contributes to efficiently illustrating the degree of ecological variability as shown in the second case study cta allows the comparison of cumulative departing or buffering recovering local trajectory patterns with changes at higher community levels in the multivariate space measuring changes at these two scales local vs assemblage or community help to determine if small scale changes result in larger scale variations it helps for the potential detection of 1 station dispersion occurring without significant centroïd variations at community scale or 2 cyclic community variability contrasting with constant departing trajectories in other community further cta extensions could be envisaged beyond the one presented here to complete the qualitative characterisation of recovering and departing trajectories an interesting potential extension of cta may concern the routine definition of trajectory shape with respect to the occurrence of saltatory and non directional trajectories lamothe et al 2019 matthews et al 2013 another perspective of cta extension could concern the integration of figures codes supplementary data appendix g in graphical functions in order to produce trajectory maps charts and roses 4 2 representing trajectory properties we presented and illustrated set of innovative figures to represent trajectory properties offering an interesting alternative to traditional representations used in community ecology and other fields where temporal series are naturally multivariate 4 2 1 maps of trajectory properties mapping trajectory properties allows the illustration of spatio temporal patterns taking into account all the variability contained in multivariate analysis information about net change and dynamics occurring within the whole study period at a site level is consequently efficiently synthesized and sites characterized by stability or high ecological variability are easily identifiable the forest application section 3 4 highlighted the ability of trajectory maps to illustrate the potential link between cta metrics and other indices in this article we used lengths trajectory path and net change as inputs to map ris and dis dynamics we encourage also users to represent other cta metrics e g overall trajectory length or speed directionality or ncr or the behaviour over time of diversity indices or any other ecological variables coming from other analytical frameworks 4 2 2 adding cta metrics to ordination diagrams an ordination diagram centred on the initial state of a trajectory allows highlighting both the whole shape of the trajectory i e lengths and angles and the distance to the baseline state i e the net change at each survey of the study period in ecological application 3 1 net changes include all n dimensional components but coordinates of data points and lines originate from 2d representation of trajectories if the first two multivariate axes do not explain a sufficient part of the variance the representation of the distance to the initial state should not be optimal for trajectory path which is the best fit with other components if one should prioritize between the representations of distances to initial states for the relative trajectory directions a good approach would be to centre trajectories considered individually in this way each trajectory path could express itself on the 2d graph with its maximal variability when the first two axes of multivariate analyses explain the main part of the variance the first option fulfills correctly both the distance and relative direction considerations in case of ecological cycles the net changes as well as directionality are two good metrics to illustrate distancing trajectories following by recovering patterns the relative to initial state chart proposed in section 2 2 2 and fig 5 or a simple 2d graph representing net changes according to time could be useful to represent alternative distancing and recovering trajectories inherent to ecological cycle however long time series are needed to be able to describe ecological cycles 4 2 3 using trajectory roses and circular statistics together with cta the trajectory rose concept offers an innovative way to represent angles and lengths at the scale of a study area with the possibility to explain metrics by explanatory variables using the bar sections of the tr ris or dis trajectories period habitat pressure management doing this the tr allows visualization of direction trend changes with corresponding lengths and offers a synthetic way to illustrate ecological variability in response to natural or anthropogenic factors the different variants of the tr diagrams related to different types of angles are useful in representing the distribution of temporal changes in the direction of community or ecosystem dynamics and circular statistics allows testing and comparing these patterns used together cta metrics and circular statistics are helpful to quantitatively analyse trajectories and compare directions since they provide important insights into elements of community or ecosystem dynamics that are not evident from qualitative descriptions of multivariate ordination diagrams 4 3 applications and limitations of the proposed framework multivariate ecological methods are descriptive by nature despite cta allows more precise measurement and illustration of ecological changes it suffers the same limitations consequently users should complete cta outputs by a strong specific examination of datasets i e species or other variables in order to improve the ecological meaning of observed changes as done in the four ecological applications of this paper or by complementing cta with additional analyses providing statistical background on community changes otherwise conclusions provide an incomplete picture and can mislead the description of ecological states cimon and cusson 2018 with potential misdirecting conservation actions or overstating conservation progress note that ordination spaces are specifically constructed for each given data set therefore any data transformation on the raw data or sampling decision is likely to affect trajectories and subsequently all metrics to be calculated we alert future users and urge them to test for this effect before any overall transformations change in sampling design and or suppression of rare species in a community data set furthermore when choosing a dissimilarity coefficient users should check the properties the coefficient has to determine whether they are suitable for the objectives of the study legendre and de cáceres 2013 and implications in cta performing users should also be aware of the importance of the definition of the first state of a time series if a sampling program starts in the middle of a disturbing event it will not be possible to measure the overall ecological response to disturbance because sampling design prevents the definition of a predisturbance state this missing part of the ecological trajectory depends on sampling starting according to disturbing events and the type of disturbance in applications characterized by cyclic variability the ecological cycle will be underlined whatever the first survey used to identify the first ecological state of the time series however the position of this first state within the ecological cycle would only be identified regarding future surveys despite the cta framework has no limit on the number of components considered in metric calculations some of new applications reporting angles ɵ ω in a 0 360 system angle α calculation refer to the first two components in this context performing cta analysis imposes a careful interpretation of the multivariate space in order to assess the consequences of such environment reduction consequently users have to assume and decide if the variance explained is sufficient to calculate these cta metrics 4 4 cta as a useful multivariate toolbox whereas the extended cta framework and the associated modes of representation constitute potential management and decision making tools we urge users interested in sharing our synthetic tools with managers or stakeholders that interpretation must be done carefully with a hand of experienced multivariate ecologists and necessarily coupled with a precise data examination in restoration or perturbation contexts lengths net change and rdt metrics allow a real time measurement i e after each survey of ecological dynamics in response to management interventions or potential disturbances and a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in achieving conservation objectives or the impact of natural or anthropogenic changes on environmental conditions in this perspective consideration of angles is complementary to length based approaches and allows for instance the identification of changes in variables responsible for ecological changes as in tr based on ɵ angles as well as the interpretation of the nature of these changes tr based on α angles our extended cta framework and our new representation tools can easily be applied to other input data and fields in ecology e g abundance biomass biometry functional traits food web and beyond as it is illustrated in the four case studies this framework provides useful tools in order to 1 assess the achievement of restoration goal recovering after perturbation 2 highlight ecosystem modifications departing to the initial state 3 highlight different ecosystem responses regarding chosen factors rdt and angles and 4 to potentially contribute to the documentation and the representation of long term monitoring observatories in conclusion the cta metrics and the extension provide a valuable toolbox for trained ecologists aware of multivariate applications and limitations to analyse ecological variability and trajectories with respect to a baseline state the case studies highlighted the complementarity and the ability of our figure concepts to illustrate spatio temporal trends of different

24697,ecological research focuses on the spatio temporal patterns of ecosystems and communities the recently proposed framework of community trajectory analysis considers community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance and utilizes geometrical properties of trajectories to compare and analyse temporal changes here we extend the initial framework which focused on consecutive trajectory segments by considering additional metrics with respect to initial or baseline states addressing questions about community dynamics and more generally temporal and spatial ecological variability requires synthetic and efficient modes of representation hence we propose a set of innovative maps charts and trajectory roses to represent trajectory properties and complement the panel of traditional modes of representation used in community ecology we use four case studies to highlight the complementarity and the ability of the new metrics and innovative figures to illustrate ecological trajectories and to facilitate their interpretation finally we encourage ecologists skilled in multivariate analysis to integrate cta into their toolbox in order to quantitatively evaluate spatio temporal changes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecological variability impact assessment initial state community dynamics trajectory analysis representation tools 1 introduction ecology aims to identify processes underlying the distribution and abundance of organisms along with those that determine how organisms modify their abiotic environment kendall 2015 two paradigms are widely accepted amongst ecologists 1 biological assemblages are amongst the best response variable to estimate the impact of changes in natural ecosystems and 2 temporal changes in community assemblages indicate that some processes have been at work to generate them legendre and gauthier 2014 temporal changes in biological assemblages are the sum of local colonisation and extinction events as well as changes in the biomass and relative abundance of taxa within and amongst samples buckley et al 2018 quantifying and forecasting temporal changes in biodiversity and ecological shifts due to both natural and anthropogenic drivers is therefore a central issue in ecology dornelas et al 2013 this requires repeatedly sampling target communities over time and often studying their evolution compared to an initial state and or a chosen baseline goal defined as an ecological state to be achieved bioret et al 2009 to this aim consecutive ecological states are defined by a set of environmental or biological parameters used as descriptors of the ecosystem existing on a given location at a given time chemical and physical parameters absolute or relative abundance of population species specific richness pollution level in a period of dramatic increase of anthropogenic impacts such approaches are particularly relevant for studying natural variability and have potential implications in management and ecological restoration or in the development of ecological indicators the development of community ecology has historically been influenced by static depictions of inherently dynamic processes which led to many important insights about the structure of communities yang 2020 analytical and representation methods of biodiversity changes over time constitute an essential and important domain of innovation cimon and cusson 2018 magurran et al 2019 to study dynamics of natural systems since the beginning of community ecology elton 1927 accordingly yang 2020 suggests specific and complementary ways to continue building towards a more temporally explicit framework for community ecology notably by increasing the representation of temporal changes and developing specific and general insights into event or factor driven dynamics in this way complementary metrics are needed to document community and environmental changes cimon and cusson 2018 while the availability of long term large scale and high resolution data is the most limiting factor to study temporal patterns in biodiversity dornelas et al 2013 the development of methodological approaches to analyse synthesize and ultimately represent the dynamics of ecological systems is also an essential issue until now most analytical and representation frameworks have been based on the comparison of synchronous observations across sites and between repeated surveys m de cáceres et al 2019 one common approach is to analyse independently the changes observed between two surveys and to repeat this step as many times as necessary to cover the corresponding study period however this type of procedure quickly becomes inefficient as the number of samples increases a potential solution to deal with long term data sets could be to discard intermediate surveys and to focus only on starting and ending time points of a study period however this may hide crucial changes occurring during intermediate periods i e transitional states and hence its usefulness to study the dynamics of ecological systems may be limited multivariate analyses have been widely adopted for many decades in ecology embracing all forms of statistical analyses applied to data in which more than one character are observed per individual kendall 1958 several multivariate statistical frameworks focus on testing hypotheses of community dynamics buckley et al 2018 consequently multivariate frameworks still constitute the primary approach to analyse ecological datasets and an important source of methodological innovations a common approach is the calculation of dissimilarity indices which allows differences between a pair of ecological states to be summarized in a single metric since community data tables can represent both temporal and spatial variation of ecological states the resulting symmetric dissimilarity matrices can contain spatial temporal or spatio temporal information then the use of ecological trajectories in a multivariate space defined by the calculation of a dissimilarity index between all pairs of observations allows to representing the dynamics of a system ordination methods are therefore often complemented with trajectory analyses in which changes over time or as a response to natural or anthropogenic pressures are represented by a set of vectors linking consecutive ecological states these approaches have been previously applied to a wide variety of ecological systems including plant assemblages austin 1977 fukami et al 2005 bird assemblages hudson and bouwman 2007 sica et al 2018 haig et al 2019 and aquatic matthews et al 2013 mathers et al 2016 boit and spencer 2019 david et al 2020 or marine ecosystems dauvin and ibanez 1987 smith et al 2010 legendre and salvat 2015 cimon and cusson 2018 in this context geometric properties of trajectories defined in the space of an ordination diagram constitute relevant parameters to study the dynamics of ecological systems including intermediate transitional states the geometric study of community trajectories has sometimes been defined by two or three axes of an ordination space boit and spencer 2019 matthews et al 2013 but this has the drawback of discarding the information contained in additional dimensions in order to generalize this approach m de cáceres et al 2019 considered community dynamics as trajectories in a chosen space of community resemblance with no limit in the number of dimensions included in the community trajectory analysis cta framework trajectories are considered as objects composed of trajectory segments to be analysed and compared using their metrics based on their geometry in a multivariate space in 2d multivariate ordinations accounting for fine scale variability hinders readability especially when the number of sites and or surveys is high even if different line formats and colours are used to facilitate the identification of different trajectories a common approach to represent the amount of change across space between two surveys t 1 and t 2 is to produce a single map i e a plot on geographical axes in which for instance the symbol size is proportional to the distance between states x1 and x2 for each sampling unit bacouillard et al 2020 kröncke et al 2011 however with this method the addition of one more survey involves the production of two more maps to represent changes between t2 and t3 states and the overall change between t1 and t3 after the last survey for three ecological surveys this method is still doable but it fails to represent simultaneously all ecological trajectory segments and more importantly information about ecological directions although mapping diversity or similarity indices are fused in many ecological studies granger et al 2015 mapping temporal changes through symbols representing trajectory metrics rather than the dissimilarity between consecutive surveys has not yet been sufficiently explored in our opinion considering the direction of ecosystem dynamics circular statistics analysis of directions ranging from 0 to 360 batschelet 1981 which are commonly used in behavioural ecology appear as promising alternatives to quantitatively represent the direction of dynamics of ecological systems and to complement traditional modes of representation in this perspective circular statistics may offer significant insights to represent trajectory properties that are not evident from qualitative comparisons of ordination diagrams as suggested for food webs by schmidt et al 2007 in this paper we propose an extension of the cta framework to represent temporal changes between more than two temporal surveys with respect to a chosen baseline state as initially defined in m de cáceres et al 2019 cta was focused on the study of ecological states corresponding to consecutive surveys a complementary overarching question being to know how ecological states change with respect to an initial state and or to a baseline an alternative way to analyse trajectories can be developped considering these fixed ecological states as central in the analysis as cta allows calculating lengths angles between trajectory segments and directionality of trajectories it is likely to be a complementary framework to approaches comparing data to initial state based on distances or distance sequences bacouillard et al 2020 bagchi et al 2017 legendre 2019 legendre and salvat 2015 differences in cluster classification kröncke et al 2011 or shifts along multivariate axes mclean et al 2019 the main contributions of this article concern 1 the extension of cta with new metrics that describe community trajectories with respect to a chosen state and new ways of defining angles 2 the synthetic representation of trajectories through three innovative figure concepts a map of changes between ecological states including information about recovering and departing dynamics with respect to a baseline or initial state b a chart of trajectories from initial state to represent trajectory paths and overall changes c trajectory rose to summarise in a circular framework the direction and length of ecological trajectories four case studies are then developed to illustrate the use of our proposed metrics and representation tools finally their potential applications and limitations are discussed 2 methods the methods detailed in the following subsections are based on trigonometrical properties of trajectories in n dimensional spaces and their representation in innovative synthetic figures 2 1 characterizing ecological trajectories 2 1 1 cta framework we follow here the terminology of de cáceres et al 2019 for describing and comparing community trajectories in a multidimensional space given a target community whose dynamics are surveyed let o1 o2 o n be an ordered set of n observations n 1 and t1 t2 tn the corresponding set of ordered survey times i e t1 t2 tn fig 1 a for all i in 1 2 n xi contains the coordinates or ecological state corresponding to oi in a multidimensional space ω the geometry of the trajectory t is formalized using a set of n 1 directed segments s1 sn 1 where si xi xi 1 is a segment with endpoints community states xi and x i 1 fig 1 a the multivariate space ω supporting cta is defined by the choice of dissimilarity coefficients e g bray curtis which is used to evaluate resemblance between pairs of community observations legendre and de cáceres 2013 m de cáceres et al 2019 note that users can choose the scale of cta by setting the scale at which communities are defined for example community trajectories may be studied at the site level or at larger scales e g landscape or regional level if community data are aggregated across sites 2 1 2 trajectory metrics original cta metrics relevant for this paper are first introduced section 2 1 2 1 and new contributions are detailed from section 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 original cta metrics the trajectory segment length is the distance between two consecutive ecological states de cáceres et al 2019 the greater the length of a trajectory segment the greater the distance between ecological states is the length of a segment si is given by the distance between its two endpoints in space ω fig 1 a l si d xi x i 1 the trajectory path length de cáceres et al 2019 is the total length of all site trajectory segments over surveys of a study period this metric contributes to informing about the overall temporal variation of the state of a site within a study period l t i 1 n 1 l s i i 1 n 1 d x i x i 1 lengths of segments or subtrajectories are influenced by the time interval between surveys hence lengths alone do not allow proper consideration of ecological dynamics i e the speed of change to this aim a better alternative is to consider trajectory speeds after dividing lengths by the time interval between observations s si l si ti 1 ti another aspect of community dynamics is approached by the calculation of angles de cáceres et al 2019 let xi xj xk be a triplet of ecological states of a trajectory t that are ordered in time i e where ti tj tk if the set of distances d xi xj d xi xk d xj xk fulfills the triangle inequality then angles can be measured on the euclidean plane that contains these three states fig 1 a the angle 0 ɵ xi xj xk 180 is defined as the change in direction of vector xj xk with respect to vector xi xj in this plane the trajectory is linear when ɵi 0 if ɵi 180 trajectory is still linear but opposite in sense finally the overall directionality of trajectories provides information about the consistency with which the site is following the same direction and therefore the stability of the drivers of ecological dynamics that condition ecological states the directionality statistic de cáceres et al 2019 of a trajectory is measured using the following d i r t w i j k 180 θ i j k 180 w i j k where ɵijk ɵ xi xj xk wijk d xi xj d xj xk and summation is over all r time ordered triplets dir t is bounded between 0 and 1 where the maximum value corresponds to a straight trajectory this metric is useful to distinguish between communities subjected to stabilizing non directional selection from those influenced by directional or disruptive selections lamothe et al 2019 matthews et al 2013 2 1 2 2 trajectory analysis with respect to an initial state net change lt1 tj let x1 be an initial or baseline state the net change is defined for any pair of states x 1 x j as the length i e distance lt1 tj d x1 xj between x1 and xj fig 1 b when calculated at the scale of an overall study period between x1 and xn survey this metric evaluates the difference between the community at the end of the study period and its initial state overall net trajectory change net change ratio ncr the net change ratio is defined as the ratio between the overall net trajectory change and the trajectory path length ncr lt1 t n survey l t ncr informs about the straightness of recovering or departing processes with respect to the initial state a high ncr indicates that a great part of the trajectory path contributes to net changes and illustrate a relative stability of drivers of ecological dynamics inversely a low ncr coupled with high segment lengths illustrates instability of drivers of ecological dynamics and highlights that a small part of the trajectory path contributes to net changes in this sense ncr and dir t are complementary metrics high dir t would be equal to high ncr but a low dir t may not be equal to low ncr depending on segment lengths recovering or departing trajectory rdt let us now consider a x1 xj xk triplet where the first element corresponds to the baseline state t1 tj tk the net change of the x 1 xj pair lt1 tj d x1 xj and the net change of the x 1 xk pair lt1 tk d x1 xk can be used to qualify the dynamics with respect to the initial state as recovering i e return to the initial state or departing i e increasing distance from the initial state let us define rdt recovering or departing trajectory metric as the difference between these two distances rdt d x1 xj d x1 xk rdt 0 indicates a closer ecological state in xk than in xj and consequently implies a recovering towards the initial state ris x1 between xj and xk fig 2 inversely rdt 0 indicates a farther ecological state in xk than in xj and consequently implies a departure from the initial state dis between xj and xk rdt could help to determine the effectiveness of management on the ecological state of a community with respect to a baseline state defined as an objective to be achieved or inversely the impact of a natural or anthropogenic event additionally in a context of disturbances in which x1 xj and xk represent pre disturbance disturbed and post disturbance states respectively rdt can be used as a measure of the ecosystem resilience 2 1 2 3 linearity of changes with respect to an initial state linearity with respect to the initial state ω we propose to calculate the angle ω x1 xj xk between trajectory vectors x1 xj and xj xk in a 0 180 system considering 0 as the same direction of the first vector fig 1 c angles allow assessing the linearity of changes with respect to an initial state lis according to a vector of reference i e first segment or subtrajectory aggregation of segments of an ecological trajectory in the euclidean space when space ω is 2d ω as well as ɵ can be reported in a 0 360 system if desired see examples in fig 10 and 13 the direction angles within a trajectory constitutes an important component of the ecological variability as different directions do not make the same ecological sense even if the lengths or speeds of these trajectories are equivalent there is a correspondence between ω i angles and rdt indeed if angle ω i 90 or ω i 270 the trajectory departs from the x1 initial state i e rdt 0 regardless of trajectory length on the contrary if 90 ω i 270 the trajectory recovers ris area rdt 0 or departs dis area rdt 0 depending on both angle and length values fig 2 2 1 2 4 directions with respect to the plane formed by two axes if users decide that the variance is sufficiently explained by the first two axes of an ordination it becomes relevant to consider all trajectory segment directions with respect to the interpretation of axes normally done using the loadings of original variables or their degree of correlation with additional variables segment directions in 2d ordination α we propose to assess angles α xi xj axis 2 considering the second axis of the ordination diagram as the north 0 fig 1 d α allows comparing segment direction with respect to the influence of the variables used to interpret the two ordination axes 2 1 2 5 testing and comparing trajectory directions circular data need special treatment in data analysis an angle of 355 is much similar to an angle of 5 than it is to an angle of 330 hence a simple arithmetic mean for example can be quite misleading landler et al 2018 in order to analyse the uniformity of directions landler et al 2018 recommended using the rayleigh test when unimodal departure from uniformity is expected and the hermans rasson test hr for multimodal departures landler et al 2019 such tests allows verifying if there is a unimodal bias in the distribution of angles directions i e if the direction of vector x j x k changes with respect to vector xi xj are evenly distributed null hypothesis or concentrated around one or more particular directions one should prioritize the rayleigh or the hr tests depending the type of distribution of direction and following landler et al 2019 recommendations the watson william s two test is used to test the homogeneity null hypothesis or the significance of difference of segment direction between different factors 2 1 3 software to facilitate conducting the extension of the cta framework function options and new functions have been developed to calculate metrics considering x1 as a constant baseline over time this new set of cta tools has been integrated into a new version v 1 7 9 of the package vegclust de cáceres et al 2010 available on cran and github repositories 2 2 representing the variability of ecological states and trajectories 2 2 1 mapping trajectory dynamics with respect to an initial state here we suggest the use of maps to represent site scale dynamics through geometrical properties of trajectories in synthetic figures accounting for temporal variability at the sampling unit scale in order to avoid multiple distance maps between every pair of surveys we propose the use of a single map to represent all at once for each site of a study area 1 net change between x1 and xn survey 2 segment length or subtrajectory length sb si 1 and sj i and 3 ris or dis segment or subtrajectory lengths between xi and xn survey symbols proposed in our synthetic map to represent net change and intermediate segments or subtrajectories defined arbitrarily if n surveys 3 are detailed in fig 3 net changes are represented through a circular symbol proportional to the length to vector x1 xj i on both sides a bottom triangle symbol represents the x 1 x i 1 vector and a top triangle the x i 1 x j i vector for both triangles the size is proportional to the length of respective vectors while the orientation and colour of the top triangle illustrate the direction recovering or departing of the second vector with respect to the initial or baseline state when more than three ecological states are used directionality of subtrajectories can be represented with colors in both triangles fig 4 in this map circles representing net changes are drawn on the geographical coordinates of sampling locations while the bottom and top triangles are placed on the map by subtracting or adding an arbitrary value to the y coordinate it may be relevant to define subtrajectories according to a critical event which influence ecological states e g new pressures management activities disturbance fire storm volcanic eruption oil spill or to a period considered as a baseline in order to help to better understand the shape of trajectories in terms of lengths and angles before and after perturbation in this case one should adapt the temporal period represented in the bottom triangle inversely without a priori knowledge about such event the occurrence of saltatory and non directional trajectories lamothe et al 2019 matthews et al 2013 which vary with the overall shape of the trajectory path could help to identify key periods in the history of an ecosystem regarding environmental or other contextual parameters 2 2 2 adding cta metrics to ordination diagrams trajectories are traditionally represented on 2d or 3d ordination diagrams using arrows for segments here we propose to complete this kind of chart by adding information about trajectory metrics such as net changes data point symbols represent the coordinates of each ecological state according to the axes of the ordination diagram and lines represent segments between transitional ecological states the novelty lies in representing the distance to the initial state i e first state of the time series and time by the dot size and colour respectively if a single trajectory is represented and one wants to better illustrate the evolution of net changes over time the trajectory can be centred around the initial state by subtracting the coordinates of the state corresponding to the initial state x1 from the coordinates of all ecological states 2 2 3 trajectory rose diagrams we propose to use a trajectory rose tr to represent the distribution of directions in the multivariate space ω as it is traditionally done in meteorology to represent wind directions and speeds azorin molina et al 2017 cieszyńska and stramska 2018 or in currentology dalbosco et al 2020 dufresne et al 2014 the tr consists of a circular bar plot of angles ranging from 0â to 360â the barplot structure of tr allows representing factors in different bar sections depending on the aim of the analysis users can choose to represent ɵ ω or α angles in a tr 2 2 3 1 distribution of ɵ ω values the baseline state tr provides a synthetic visualisation of ecological trends at the scale of a study area according to directional changes 0 360 of one vector with respect to the previous one for each consecutive triplet over time users can choose to represent distributions of ɵ or ω angles in order to analyse changes of direction of each triplet or the direction of each segment with respect to the previous or the first segment of the trajectory respectively angles ɵi between segments xi xj i and xj i xk j are defined between 0 and 180 when considering all multivariate dimensions or can be reported in a 0 360 system if calculated from 2d coordinates angles ωi between segments x 1 x i 1 and x i 1 x j i are also reported in a 0 360 system when calculated on 2d coordinates at this step of the procedure the user must consider whether the variance explained by the two first components is high enough to evaluate angles in a 0 360 system a value of 0 indicates a straight dis segment with no change of direction with respect to x 1 x i 1 vector the distribution of angles is represented in barplots whose size indicates the number of segments following a given direction ris on the bottom part 90 ωris 270 and dis in both parts depending on the length of the second segment of each triplet lengths of vector xj xk are aggregated on the top of each bar section and coloured according to distance in order to underline if direction trends occur in short or long trajectories 2 2 3 2 distribution of α values α angles are calculated considering the second axis of the ordination diagram as the north 0 and represented in a tr in order to illustrate distribution of segment direction in a 2d euclidean space it allows the characterization of the nature of change by comparing segment direction with respect to the interpretation of ordination axes variables names aiding the interpretation of directions can be positioned in the periphery of the tr see fig 10 3 ecological applications four ecological applications were chosen to illustrate the proposed cta metrics and modes of representation in different ecological systems 3 1 ecological application 1 temporal variability of waterbird communities in a marine protected area the national nature reserve of saint brieuc brittany france is a marine protected area designed in 1998 to protect wintering birds anatidae populations are monitored each winter as part of the international waterbird census iwc cta has been performed on the nine most abundant species for which a census has been performed during 21 wintering from 2000 to 2020 supplementary data appendix a anatidae monitoring has been carried out each year in january and encompassed the overall presumed functional area i e intertidal feeding ground lengths angles and directionality were calculated supplementary data appendix b the temporal variability of the bird community was illustrated with an ordination diagram centred on the initial survey and representing time and net change using symbol colour and size as suggested in subsection 2 2 2 for the trajectory rose a bar plot of ɵ angles of each consecutive triplet ranging from 0 to 360 was produced range of 15 for each bar and this chart was transformed in a rose with the function coord polar of the package ggplot2 wickham 2016 lengths of trajectory segments ranged from 2 03 to 6 16 but were quite stable over time 3 46 1 06 total trajectory path 69 14 at the end of the study period distance to the initial state 5 79 was slightly higher than the mean value of net change 4 96 1 28 fig 5 shows the ordination diagram representing the temporal variability of the community with respect to the initial state during the 21 years of sampling the first axis explained twice as much variance 39 as the second axis 20 different species have influenced the anatidae community supplementary data appendix a three species mainly contribute to the first axis and are characterized by a clear decrease in numbers branta bernicla mareca penelope and to a lesser extent mareca strepera other species characterised by stable abundances or drastic interannual variations were mostly expressed on the second axis the first axis highlights the temporal pattern of the community which is confirmed by the clustering of the most recent sampling occasions on the positive side of the first axis fig 5 the dominance of 90 ɵ 270 84 2 and ris and dis alternation figs 5 and 6 supplementary data appendix a suggest an ecological turnover in the species involved in ecological change this results in a strong spring effect around the first state of each consecutive survey which explains the very small ncr between 2000 and 2020 8 35 and low directionality 0 375 in absence of straight departing 0 and recovering 180 clear dominance trajectory trends step by step to a different ecological state from 2000 to 2020 the anatidae community mainly varied depending on the decline of two of the most numerous species b bernicla and mareca penelope other influencing species are not consistent over time which resulted in a clear spring effect around the initial state cta results confirmed conclusions of sturbois and ponsero 2019 and bring new insights concerning the way that ecological variability could be expressed through trajectory properties of bird communities within a given site 3 2 ecological application 2 spatio temporal changes of benthic communities in a modified system controlled for a tidal power station the spatio temporal variability of benthic communities was studied in the rance estuary brittany france a modified system whose main physical characteristics are controlled by the functioning of a tidal power station desroy and retière 2004 the construction of the facility began in 1963 and was completed in 1966 before the building of this infrastructure the rance was a ria with sectors differentiated by saline stratification whereas the system is now clearly separated into two main entities the marine reservoir and the upstream estuary brackish water the construction step led to the formation of a hypohaline basin inducing immediate strong mortality events for benthic macrofauna and a period of instability 1967 1975 the control of the physical characteristics of the system has affected sediment dynamics and deeply modified benthic habitats bonnot courtois 1997 bonnot courtois and lafond 1991 retière 1979 soft bottom benthic communities were sampled at 34 stations in 1976 1995 and 2010 in the upstream estuary in order to analyse the ecological variability associated with the recovery process and sedimentary changes fig 7 desroy and retière 2004 temporal beta diversity index tbi legendre 2019 was run in order to verify if species gains or losses were responsible for net changes at the scale of both consecutive periods a hellinger transformation was performed on the overall data set prior to multivariate analysis pca and coordinates of sites on the ordination diagram for the three surveys were used as inputs for community trajectory analysis supplementary data appendix c a trajectory map was produced in order to synthetize trajectories of benthic communities on each site through the three surveys after data aggregation depending on the station location upstream vs down stream a second cta analysis was performed in order to verify if local changes resulted in larger scale variations the species richness dramatically decreased from 149 species in 1976 to 54 and 73 species in 1995 and 2010 respectively 27 species were common to the three surveys a high variability of faunal composition was observed since 14 species appeared and 70 disappeared between 1976 and 1995 vs 38 new species and 19 less between 1995 and 2010 at the scale of the overall monitoring period 34 new species were observed between 1976 and 2010 and 71 species disappeared tbi index 0 46 confirms that species losses dominated species gains between 1976 and 1995 losses for 18 stations and gains for 16 stations inversely gains dominated losses 0 60 for the 1995 2010 period losses for 10 stations vs gains for 24 stations according to the cumulative trajectory path length of all sites the first period was characterized by a higher ecological variability 539 69 15 87 7 70 than the second 469 92 13 82 5 14 considering trajectory path length at the station scale seven stations 59 66 63 67 57 61 58 represented 32 48 327 96 of the whole trajectory path and segment lengths were more important during the second period for 13 stations 31 71 two main spatial trajectory patterns were identified fig 8 eight stations mainly located in the upstream part south of the study area were characterized by lower net 19 67 3 84 and consecutive changes 9 07 2 30 inversely higher changes characterized other stations mainly located in the downstream part north both at the scale of the overall study period 37 60 13 98 and consecutive ones 16 41 6 43 this increasing change along the upstream downstream gradient is confirmed by significant correlations between latitude and net changes 0 40 p value 0 01944 and trajectory path lengths 0 45 p value 0 00685 rdt was positive for 12 sites and negative for 22 showing an overall departure dynamic from the initial state for 64 71 of sites mainly located in the northern part of the study area fig 8 lower ncr values indicate significant direction changes between 1976 and 1995 and 1995 2010 trajectory segments supplementary data appendix c it implies that changes are induced by different species groups between both periods differences in the magnitude of changes revealed at local scales areas also result in contrasted overall trends net change at the larger scale of upstream 23 59 and downstream 49 77 communities the community described in 1976 was already undergoing a recovery process which explains species losses and gains in the following surveys according to the trajectory length of both periods and departing trajectories occurring in 64 71 of the stations benthic communities are not yet stabilized in the study area this seems particularly true for downstream stations which suffered most changes in this area regular changes in environmental conditions according to the estuary functioning influenced by the power station would probably not lead to a stabilization of benthic communities except if some species characterized by high dynamics induce long term changes of sediment facies e g invasive species such as crepidula fornicata and ruditapes philippinarum future surveys will help to verify these hypotheses inversely upstream stations are more stable probably due to environmental factors influence of fresh water which limit the variability of communities through a drastic selection of species 3 3 ecological application 3 temporal sedimentary variability in a marine intertidal area sediment facies were studied at 42 sites in the intertidal area of the bay of saint brieuc in 1987 gros and hamon 1988 2001 bonnot courtois and dreau 2002 and 2019 sturbois et al unpublished data at these dates one sample of sediment was collected with a handcorer 5 cm diameter depth of 5 cm on each site and subsequently analysed for grain size distribution in the laboratory statistical analyses were performed with the package g2sd fournier et al 2014 sedimentary data from the three periods were combined in the same dataset subjected to cta analysis supplementary data appendix d and e two tr were then produced in order to illustrate the distribution of α angles for both periods with respect to sedimentary variables localised at the periphery of tr according to their position in the variable factor map pca finally hr and watson william s tests were performed to test the homogeneity of angles distribution and the difference of segment direction between periods respectively the first two dimensions of the pca explained 81 8 of the variance so consideration of trajectory and segment properties with respect to these components is allowable trajectory path was lower for the period 1987 2001 72 17 1 72 1 55 than for the period 2001 2019 99 67 2 37 1 96 which indicated more sedimentary variability in the second period however the sedimentary dynamics i e speed of changes was quantitatively quite similar for the two periods 1987 2001 5 16 vs 2001 2019 5 53 during the first period 7 stations contributed to 46 38 of the trajectory path whereas 12 stations were responsible for 59 20 of changes between 2001 and 2019 fig 9 supplementary data appendix d and e this reveals that few sites are characterized by a high sedimentary variability length 3 while changes in most stations were more moderate the tr qualitatively represents the pattern of the segments direction according to sedimentary variables fig 10 during the first period segment direction mainly occurred in the bottom part of the rose hr test t 11 07 p value 0 004 according to different sand variables from very fine to fine whereas for the segments of the second period it occurred in the top part of the rose hr test t 13 77 p value 0 002 according to very fine sand mud and coarse sediment variables watson test t 0 896 p value 0 001 these results are consistent with the conclusions of sturbois et al unpublished data who showed that thirty years sedimentary changes in the intertidal part of the bay of saint brieuc resulted in 1 an overall slight sloughing revealed by the increase in the contribution of very fine sediment classes over the study period 2 a high variability at few stations contrasting with moderate changes in the rest of the study area this ecological application confirmed that angles and lengths are relevant trajectory properties to qualitatively and quantitatively describe trajectory patterns according to period or other factors such as habitat management or pressure 3 4 ecological application 4 response of boreal forests to insect outbreaks the spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana clem is considered amongst the most severe defoliating insects of boreal and sub boreal forests of eastern north america blais 1957 every 30 to 40 years its populations synchronously reaches outbreak levels over large spatial scales generating dramatic ecological and economic impacts due to important mortality events in areas dominated by balsam fir abies balsamea l and spruce picea spp whereas balsam fir usually presents higher levels of defoliation and mortality rates than spruce species of northern latitudes a recent study sánchez pinillos et al 2019 found a higher resilience of forests dominated by balsam fir than by black spruce p mariana mill on the contrary black spruce forests proved to be highly resistant to the insect attack but collapsed under long and severe outbreaks we used a subset of plots affected by spruce budworm outbreaks and selected by sánchez pinillos et al 2019 from quebec s forest inventory ministère des ressources naturelles 2013 to assess forest responses to insect outbreaks with respect to individual pathways in particular we compared the dynamics of 74 mixed communities co dominated by balsam fir and white birch betula papyrifera marsh and 74 stands dominated by black spruce fig 11 forest plots were characterised with species abundance and size classes for the most common species cta metrics supplementary data appendix f were used to characterize forest responses to the perturbation and a trajectory map was used to illustrate spatial patterns of trajectories according to the three types of responses to the outbreak sánchez pinillos et al 2019 we finally used a tr of ω distribution to illustrate differential responses according to the type of forest the changes of mixed fir birch forests was reflected through longer trajectory paths 64 73 and lower net change 42 17 than the homologous in black spruce forests 47 70 and 59 95 respectively however both forests showed similar trajectory patterns with longer distances between the pre disturbance and disturbed states sum s1 fir birch 37 95 sum s1 spruce 39 12 than between the disturbed and post disturbance states sum s2 fir 26 77 sum s2 spruce 20 83 the trajectory map fig 12 underlines the different responses of forests to the outbreak 1 resistant plots were mainly characterized by departing dynamics and low segment length and net change 2 resilient plots mainly occurred through recovering dynamics high segment lengths and moderate net change and 3 changed plots were defined by departing dynamics and high segments lengths and net changes in agreement with sánchez pinillos et al 2019 a higher percentage of recovering trajectories was found at southern latitudes where balsam fir co dominates the stands with white birch thus 42 of the plots classified as fir white mixed forests showed recovering trajectories in comparison to the 30 1 of black spruce stands on the contrary shorter trajectories were found above latitude 49 reflecting the greater resistance of black spruce to the spruce budworm attack it is important to note that whereas we represented forest dynamics of all forest types in the same map one could be interested in assessing the spatial differences in the responses of a given forest community in such a case a potential alternative could be to generate independent maps or different symbols or colours for each forest type tr diagrams of ω distribution showed a clear rupture in trajectory direction between disturbed and final state for both forest typologies many plots did not show changes in forest classification it is important to note that dissimilarities between forest surveys were calculated by considering different size classes for the most common species in boreal forests p mariana p glauca a balsamea and b papyrifera the tr analyses therefore illustrated the changes in forest structure resulting from the death of the most vulnerable trees thus most black spruce forests remained with the same composition after the outbreak or changed toward forests with a lower basal area represented by a different forest typology fig 13 b pimahigh in the case of mixed forests of balsam fir and white birch fig 13 a abba bepa our results showed different successional stages including the dominance of white birch colonizing gaps a transient stage of mixed fir birch stands and a last successional stage dominated by balsam fir 4 discussion the cta framework represents a valuable approach to assess ecological dynamics based on the geometric analysis of trajectories defined in a multidimensional space of community resemblance geometric properties of trajectories projection of a community state onto a trajectory convergence divergence and geometric resemblance between a pair of trajectories spatial variation in community dynamics de cáceres et al 2019 here we went further in the definition of geometric properties of trajectories by complementing the available metrics and proposing synthetic methods of applied representation that facilitate the interpretation of ecosystem dynamics over time for that we integrated new tools options and new functions into the original version of the cta framework available in package vegclust on cran and github repositories 4 1 extending cta metrics the proposed extension makes the cta framework more complete in order to address a larger panel of ecological questions especially in applied ecology the new metrics can be useful for instance when monitoring ecosystem responses to disturbances or in the context of ecosystem restoration by focusing cta on geometric properties with respect to baseline ecological states net changes new angles and the rdt metrics along with recovering and departing characterisation of trajectories allow addressing these issues as shown in the case studies section the extension includes a new set of functions based on the two first axes of the dissimilarity space in which trajectories were originally defined this facilitates the use of cta to users aiming to restrict analyses to a 2d cartesian space or to study trajectories in a biplot including only two variables as the first two axes often explain a part of the total variance the user must be cautious with the interpretation of the angles used in trajectory roses particularly when the two first axes explain a small proportion of total variance when most variance proportion is captured we consider that these metrics can be compared to variables in multivariate spaces in order to provide ecological meaning to the direction when using ɵ and ω angles in tr cta returns angles between trajectory segments regarding 2d point coordinates of the third survey of each triplet with respect to the previous segment the variance explained by the first two axis remains also important here to evaluate the relevance of angles transformations even if the coordinates of the third point in the 2d space are only used to flip the 0 180 angles in positive or negative consequently this step does not influence the accuracy of angle calculations considering all components as each triplet forms its own plane it is not possible to provide an ecological meaning related to the environmental variables but we consider that this step of the procedure still contributes to efficiently illustrating the degree of ecological variability as shown in the second case study cta allows the comparison of cumulative departing or buffering recovering local trajectory patterns with changes at higher community levels in the multivariate space measuring changes at these two scales local vs assemblage or community help to determine if small scale changes result in larger scale variations it helps for the potential detection of 1 station dispersion occurring without significant centroïd variations at community scale or 2 cyclic community variability contrasting with constant departing trajectories in other community further cta extensions could be envisaged beyond the one presented here to complete the qualitative characterisation of recovering and departing trajectories an interesting potential extension of cta may concern the routine definition of trajectory shape with respect to the occurrence of saltatory and non directional trajectories lamothe et al 2019 matthews et al 2013 another perspective of cta extension could concern the integration of figures codes supplementary data appendix g in graphical functions in order to produce trajectory maps charts and roses 4 2 representing trajectory properties we presented and illustrated set of innovative figures to represent trajectory properties offering an interesting alternative to traditional representations used in community ecology and other fields where temporal series are naturally multivariate 4 2 1 maps of trajectory properties mapping trajectory properties allows the illustration of spatio temporal patterns taking into account all the variability contained in multivariate analysis information about net change and dynamics occurring within the whole study period at a site level is consequently efficiently synthesized and sites characterized by stability or high ecological variability are easily identifiable the forest application section 3 4 highlighted the ability of trajectory maps to illustrate the potential link between cta metrics and other indices in this article we used lengths trajectory path and net change as inputs to map ris and dis dynamics we encourage also users to represent other cta metrics e g overall trajectory length or speed directionality or ncr or the behaviour over time of diversity indices or any other ecological variables coming from other analytical frameworks 4 2 2 adding cta metrics to ordination diagrams an ordination diagram centred on the initial state of a trajectory allows highlighting both the whole shape of the trajectory i e lengths and angles and the distance to the baseline state i e the net change at each survey of the study period in ecological application 3 1 net changes include all n dimensional components but coordinates of data points and lines originate from 2d representation of trajectories if the first two multivariate axes do not explain a sufficient part of the variance the representation of the distance to the initial state should not be optimal for trajectory path which is the best fit with other components if one should prioritize between the representations of distances to initial states for the relative trajectory directions a good approach would be to centre trajectories considered individually in this way each trajectory path could express itself on the 2d graph with its maximal variability when the first two axes of multivariate analyses explain the main part of the variance the first option fulfills correctly both the distance and relative direction considerations in case of ecological cycles the net changes as well as directionality are two good metrics to illustrate distancing trajectories following by recovering patterns the relative to initial state chart proposed in section 2 2 2 and fig 5 or a simple 2d graph representing net changes according to time could be useful to represent alternative distancing and recovering trajectories inherent to ecological cycle however long time series are needed to be able to describe ecological cycles 4 2 3 using trajectory roses and circular statistics together with cta the trajectory rose concept offers an innovative way to represent angles and lengths at the scale of a study area with the possibility to explain metrics by explanatory variables using the bar sections of the tr ris or dis trajectories period habitat pressure management doing this the tr allows visualization of direction trend changes with corresponding lengths and offers a synthetic way to illustrate ecological variability in response to natural or anthropogenic factors the different variants of the tr diagrams related to different types of angles are useful in representing the distribution of temporal changes in the direction of community or ecosystem dynamics and circular statistics allows testing and comparing these patterns used together cta metrics and circular statistics are helpful to quantitatively analyse trajectories and compare directions since they provide important insights into elements of community or ecosystem dynamics that are not evident from qualitative descriptions of multivariate ordination diagrams 4 3 applications and limitations of the proposed framework multivariate ecological methods are descriptive by nature despite cta allows more precise measurement and illustration of ecological changes it suffers the same limitations consequently users should complete cta outputs by a strong specific examination of datasets i e species or other variables in order to improve the ecological meaning of observed changes as done in the four ecological applications of this paper or by complementing cta with additional analyses providing statistical background on community changes otherwise conclusions provide an incomplete picture and can mislead the description of ecological states cimon and cusson 2018 with potential misdirecting conservation actions or overstating conservation progress note that ordination spaces are specifically constructed for each given data set therefore any data transformation on the raw data or sampling decision is likely to affect trajectories and subsequently all metrics to be calculated we alert future users and urge them to test for this effect before any overall transformations change in sampling design and or suppression of rare species in a community data set furthermore when choosing a dissimilarity coefficient users should check the properties the coefficient has to determine whether they are suitable for the objectives of the study legendre and de cáceres 2013 and implications in cta performing users should also be aware of the importance of the definition of the first state of a time series if a sampling program starts in the middle of a disturbing event it will not be possible to measure the overall ecological response to disturbance because sampling design prevents the definition of a predisturbance state this missing part of the ecological trajectory depends on sampling starting according to disturbing events and the type of disturbance in applications characterized by cyclic variability the ecological cycle will be underlined whatever the first survey used to identify the first ecological state of the time series however the position of this first state within the ecological cycle would only be identified regarding future surveys despite the cta framework has no limit on the number of components considered in metric calculations some of new applications reporting angles ɵ ω in a 0 360 system angle α calculation refer to the first two components in this context performing cta analysis imposes a careful interpretation of the multivariate space in order to assess the consequences of such environment reduction consequently users have to assume and decide if the variance explained is sufficient to calculate these cta metrics 4 4 cta as a useful multivariate toolbox whereas the extended cta framework and the associated modes of representation constitute potential management and decision making tools we urge users interested in sharing our synthetic tools with managers or stakeholders that interpretation must be done carefully with a hand of experienced multivariate ecologists and necessarily coupled with a precise data examination in restoration or perturbation contexts lengths net change and rdt metrics allow a real time measurement i e after each survey of ecological dynamics in response to management interventions or potential disturbances and a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in achieving conservation objectives or the impact of natural or anthropogenic changes on environmental conditions in this perspective consideration of angles is complementary to length based approaches and allows for instance the identification of changes in variables responsible for ecological changes as in tr based on ɵ angles as well as the interpretation of the nature of these changes tr based on α angles our extended cta framework and our new representation tools can easily be applied to other input data and fields in ecology e g abundance biomass biometry functional traits food web and beyond as it is illustrated in the four case studies this framework provides useful tools in order to 1 assess the achievement of restoration goal recovering after perturbation 2 highlight ecosystem modifications departing to the initial state 3 highlight different ecosystem responses regarding chosen factors rdt and angles and 4 to potentially contribute to the documentation and the representation of long term monitoring observatories in conclusion the cta metrics and the extension provide a valuable toolbox for trained ecologists aware of multivariate applications and limitations to analyse ecological variability and trajectories with respect to a baseline state the case studies highlighted the complementarity and the ability of our figure concepts to illustrate spatio temporal trends of different

24698,conflicts between opposing objectives of wildlife conservation and agriculture are increasing globally due to rising human food production and competition with wildlife over land use conservation conflicts are often complex and driven by variability and uncertainty in wildlife distribution and stakeholder wealth and power to manage conflicts empowering local stakeholders by decentralizing decisions and actions has been suggested to promote democratization and awareness of stakeholders there is however a current gap in the understanding of how stakeholder empowerment e g farmers and managers practical time or monetary resources affects policy effectiveness in this study we apply an individual based model of management strategy evaluation to simulate the conservation conflict surrounding protected and thriving common cranes grus grus causing damage to agricultural production in sweden and along the european flyways we model the effect of farmer empowerment i e increasing budgets to affect populations and agricultural production in four management scenarios in which we manipulate the availability and cost of two actions farmers may take in response to crane presence on their land non lethal scaring or lethal culling control we find that lower budgets lead to increases in population size due to increased use of less costly scaring instead of shooting higher farmer budgets lead to increased population extinction risk intermediate budgets allow farmers to control the population size around the management target and limit impact on agricultural production to intermediate levels our study highlights that stakeholder empowerment and culling strategies based on the number of stakeholders and particularly their power to implement effective actions needs careful consideration and monitoring when setting management targets and strategies further our results show that empowering individual farmers has the potential to contribute to conflict management and to balance agricultural with conservation objectives but increased stakeholder involvement also requires careful planning and monitoring keywords conservation conflict grus

protection habitat restoration and sustainable agriculture are increasing globally due to a rising human demand for food production and consequent competition with wildlife over land use henle et al

herbivore populations conflicts often arise when wildlife forage on and cause damage to crops and when management options to reduce this are limited due to protection of the species or social opposition towards mitigation interventions dickman 2010 particularly good examples of such wicked conservation conflicts involve protected cranes grus spp and geese branta anser spp which currently have exponentially increasing populations causing negative impacts on agricultural land in europe and north america especially on land surrounding protected areas designated for those species and biodiversity in general cusack et al 2019 fox and madsen 2017 nilsson et al 2019 negative impacts caused by wildlife are often managed by culling to reduce populations under the assumption that agricultural loss will decrease accordingly montràs janer et al 2019 however due to protection or practical limitations non lethal mitigation methods e g scaring diversionary feeding monetary compensation are often required instead of culling cusack et al 2019 ec 2009 owen 1990 yet the management of many species including cranes and geese remains problematic in part due to time lags in centralized managers actions as a response to negative impact on agricultural production cusack et al 2019 this may aggravate conflicts by weakening stakeholder trust and willingness to act in line

proposed to integrate complexity and democratization into the management process mason et al 2018 raik et al 2008 redpath et al 2017 however there is currently a gap in the understanding of how stakeholder empowerment i e practical time or monetary resources affects sustainability and extinction risk of the population as well as agricultural production in the extreme decentralizing decisions to farming stakeholders without providing budgets to enact actions may fuel frustration and conflict with policy makers and managers and lead to ineffective management whereas unlimited farming stakeholder budgets may cause conflicts when conservation stakeholder objectives supersede management objectives mason et al 2018 redpath et al 2013 decision making in natural resource management is traditionally assumed to be based on stakeholder objectives to maximize their returns in terms of livelihood given a limited set of actions ability and budget to perform them d hodgson et al 2020 milner gulland 2011 for example farmers aim to maximize their agricultural production given the land and labor they have whereas managers might instead aim to keep wildlife populations within a range where long term viability is ensured given their ability to monitor the population and enforce their policies in pursuing these aims practical limitations e g available time and resources will constrain the power of both farmers and managers to act leading to trade offs in decision making game theory formally describes situations with such strategic actions in which the consequences of an individual s decisions are influenced by the decisions taken by others hauert et al 2006 for example the success of a manager s decisions toward fulfilling conservation objectives through policy or economic incentives might be affected by the decisions of stakeholders to comply or not colyvan et al 2011 milner gulland 2011 redpath et al 2018 hence while many existing models assume that policy will be enacted faithfully this assumption might not always be realistic such as under used culling quotas due to deficient number of hunters butterworth 1999 milne 2018 milner gulland 2012 small perturbations in stakeholder behavior or policy in uncertain and dynamic systems might result in severe and unforeseen implications for the dynamics of the entire system including both human behavior i e social tipping points and increased extinction risk in the focal wildlife population i e ecological tipping points heal and kunreuther 2012 scheffer et al 2012 complexity and uncertainty make empirical evaluation of management outcomes i e agent responses challenging to account for uncertainty at multiple points in the management process the management strategy evaluation i e mse framework has been developed smith 1999 however until now mse models have incorporated constant decision making rules for single managers or farmers over time bunnefeld et al 2013 melbourne thomas et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 a newly developed framework for generalized management strategy evaluation i e gmse includes scenarios that can include multiple independent stakeholders making individual decisions as influenced by changes in resources policy and individual circumstance duthie et al 2018 in this study we apply the management strategy evaluation framework using the gmse r package to simulate the conservation conflict case of protected common cranes congregating in large numbers i e up to 26 000 ind at agricultural staging sites in sweden causing significant damage to agricultural production inspected and compensated damage totals up to 200 000 euros year montràs janer et al 2019 nilsson et al 2019 cranes are protected in annex i in the european birds directive and thus from culling to regulate the population the directive states that the listed species survival and reproduction must be ensured in their distribution range but allows for licensed lethal culling to mitigate negative impact on human livelihoods and when non lethal damage preventive measures e g scaring diversionary feeding have been found unsuccessful ec 2009 due to the protective legislation no management targets are defined for the maximum populations size on either staging site or flyway level but as these populations will likely continue to grow so will the stakeholder demand for lethal or non lethal crop damage preventive strategies and the severity of the conservation conflict fox and madsen 2017 montràs janer et al 2019 by applying the mse framework in this study we aim to identify the effect of increasing stakeholder power i e decentralizing decisions to enact policy on all aspects of the system including the objectives to keep a viable wildlife population and sustainable agricultural production over time and the implications for managing conflict more specifically we investigate how increasing the ability of individual stakeholders to enact decisions at the farm scale affects broader scale changes in expected crane population sizes and agricultural production in four possible management scenarios a no management and no stakeholder power to affect cranes b scaring and culling of cranes with a management objective to allow the population to increase to an effectively high management target i e 100 000 ind c only culling allowed but with an effectively high management target and d scaring and culling with a management objective to keep the population at a lower target i e 15 000 ind to lower the negative impact on agricultural production 2 model the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 as updated by grimm et al 2020 the full odd description including the details section and r code to replicate all simulations can be found in supplementary material 1 2 1 purpose and patterns the purpose of the model is to predict how increasing the ability of individual stakeholders to enact decisions at the farm scale affects broader scale changes in expected crane population sizes and agricultural production in four possible management scenarios over 30 years to do this we used the package gmse v0 6 0 4 in r duthie et al 2018 gmse simulates the management strategy evaluation process in a way that models goal oriented behavior and spatial distribution of individual stakeholders managers and wildlife using an individual based i e agent based framework bunnefeld et al 2011 duthie et al 2018 the four management scenarios simulated were a no management and no stakeholder power to affect cranes b scaring and culling of cranes with a management objective to allow the population to increase to an effectively high management target i e 100 000 ind c only culling allowed but with an effectively high management target and d scaring and culling with a management objective to keep the population at a lower target i e 15 000 ind to lower the negative impact on agricultural production 2 1 1 management scenario a scenario a is a null model for population size and mean agricultural production when no scaring or culling is conducted and the crane population can grow exponentially currently there is a lack of management targets both nationally and for the whole population along the flyways so this reflects the current lack of population regulation 2 1 2 management scenario b scenario b models current management in sweden which allows for intensive scaring methods to reduce loss in agricultural production specifically using scaring by the use of gas cannons scare crows flags very limited culling i e up to 15 individuals licensed to a minority of the farmers is occasionally permitted by the managing authorities eea n d in our model the strict licensing procedure for culling is represented by a high cost for culling for the farmer unlike scaring and was regulated in the simulations by setting a very high management target i e ensuring a condition where the manager would always set a high cost for culling non lethal scaring may divert cranes from single cells at the landscape but will not affect population size and a scenario only permitting scaring was therefore not considered 2 1 3 management scenario c scenario c models a hypothetical scenario where although culling is expected to be costly thus the manager is expected to keep costs of culling very high there either is no alternative action possible or alternative actions like scaring are prohibited or widely perceived to be ineffective and therefore never taken 2 1 4 management scenario d scenario d models a situation where managers permit both scaring and culling but managers attempt to keep the crane population at a size well below presumed carrying capacity this allows for a more dynamic allocation of budget for both farmers and managers which consequently mimics a trade off between the objectives to sustain agricultural production while ensuring viability of the crane population we evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce the pattern of population growth in the previous 30 years leading up to the current population year 2020 by parameterizing the model with the parameter values i e initial population size and reproductive output for details see initialization in supplementary material 1 derived from the model simulations and based on previous empirical data on crane numbers we can test if the model reproduces the pattern of population growth given realistic initial conditions recovering this pattern demonstrates that the model was fit for purpose in that we could then use it to test new scenarios against i e management scenario a d 2 2 entities state variables and scales farmers managers and cranes operate on an agricultural landscape l modelled as a torus of discrete cells owned by individual farmers and producing a potentially variable yield of agricultural crop i e agricultural production each landscape cell thus has unique traits including farmer ownership x y location lxy agricultural production and density of cranes in each time step only one farmer can own a single lxy cell but any number of cranes can occupy a single cell in this study l was constructed as a grid of 100 100 cells representing a total staging area of about 200 km2 nilsson et al 2018 utilized by a total of 50 farmers earning the majority of their livelihood from agriculture 1 km2 per farmer holmer 2016 the swedish board of agriculture 2017 gmse models discrete individuals which here include farmers managers and cranes each individual has potentially unique traits which potentially affect their behavior each farmer owns a fixed number of contiguous landscape cells l see above on which they can perform one or more types of actions each farmer has a budget bf for performing actions which can be broadly interpreted to encompass one or more factors limiting the total number of actions possible for the farmer during a single time step such as time money or available equipment thus individual farmers traits include their budget and farm location managers do not own landscape cells but instead set policy that affects the costs of performing actions for farmers caction managers have traits in terms of a budget bm for setting policy which can be broadly interpreted to encompass the factors that limit the power of managers to make and enforce policy decisions managers either do not attempt to regulate crane population density or attempt to maintain cranes at some target population density n at every time step by setting policy i e costs for farmer actions the traits for individual cranes are location age and reproductive output in this study a single time step is modelled as one year for a definitions of state variable entities landscape and model parameters see table s1 in supplementary material 1 2 3 process overview and scheduling the model includes four sub models operating in sequence over a single time step fig 1 for detailed information on definition and use of parameters and modeling procedure see supplementary material 1 2 4 the crane population sub model the first sub model simulates the population dynamics of nt cranes in time step t cranes arrive at a randomly selected cell within rm cells of the one that they left in t 1 with equal probability crane cell location is randomly selected in t 1 then feed rfe times between each feeding cranes move to a cell within rm cells in any direction from the currently occupied cell on the landscape randomly selected with equal probability cranes then give birth to young then potentially die of old age initial population size for each simulation was independently sampled from the distribution of simulated terminal abundances from the 100 nrep replicate simulations in years 1989 2019 see initialization in supplementary material 1 fig s1 in supplementary material 2 2 5 the observation sub model the observation model uses a monitoring method in which cranes are counted with complete accuracy on a subset of the landscape i e 10 10 cells and density is then extrapolated to estimate the crane population size assuming the same density over the entire landscape hence estimated population size n might deviate from the true n 2 6 the manager sub model the manager sub model assesses n in relation to a management target and sets policy by defining action costs caction these may be conceptualized as e g time practical or monetary costs for different actions farmers may take to affect agricultural production including culling or scaring cranes managers use an evolutionary algorithm to set costs for each action this algorithm models the heuristic process of the manager considering different potential policies and choosing one that will result in a crane population density nearer to the manager s target see supplementary material 1 once the algorithm is completed managers enact the cost of each available farmer action the total budget for the manager was kept constant in the model i e bm 1000 see supplemental material 1 for details on parameterization of the evolutionary algorithm 2 7 the farmer sub model in the farmer sub model farmers implement actions with the objective to maximize their own agricultural production constrained by the costs of individual actions as set by the manager s policy and the farmers annual budgets bf as with manager policy decisions farmer decisions are chosen by running a single independent evolutionary algorithm for each farmer in each time step farmers recognize that the presence of cranes on a landscape cell has a negative effect on agricultural production and will therefore adaptively use actions to try to effectively decrease the presence of cranes individual stakeholder decisions consequently affect cranes and agricultural production over multiple time steps all actions of all farmers are performed in a random order so that for example one farmer does not do all of their scaring or culling before another farmer and thereby cause differences in farmer s agricultural production due to the order of farmer actions farmers can only take actions on land that they own 2 8 design concepts 2 8 1 basic principles to account for uncertainty at multiple points in a natural resource management process the management strategy evaluation i e mse framework has been developed smith 1999 mse models have incorporated constant decision making rules for single managers or farmers over time bunnefeld et al 2013 melbourne thomas et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 however the generalized management strategy evaluation framework i e gmse used in this study includes multiple independent stakeholders making individual decisions as influenced by changes in resources policy and individual circumstance duthie et al 2018 gmse simulates the management strategy evaluation process in a way that models goal oriented behavior and spatial distribution of individual stakeholders managers and wildlife using an individual based i e agent based framework bunnefeld et al 2011 duthie et al 2018 the observation model uses a virtual ecologist approach zurell et al 2010 to model manager observation of the crane population 2 8 2 emergence crane population dynamics and agricultural production emerge over time based on the individual decisions of the manager i e setting policy and farmers i e taking action 2 8 3 adaptation evolutionary algorithms are useful heuristic tools that mimic the process of biological evolution to find solutions to highly complex problems hamblin 2013 in our simulations these complex problems refer to modeling the goal oriented decision making of managers and farmers managers must attempt to use their available budget to set costs that keep crane populations near a pre specified target while farmers must attempt to use their available budget and any actions available to maximize agricultural production the possible actions that farmers can take to reduce impact on agricultural production include non lethal scaring one action of which causes one crane to randomly relocate to a new cell before damaging crops note this could potentially result in the crane resettling on another cell owned by the acting farmer or culling one action of which causes one crane to be completely removed from the landscape before damaging crops see scenario a b decisions within the model are made under uncertainty as is realistic for stakeholders in empirical social ecological systems and behavior is consequently heuristic often suboptimal the section the evolutionary algorithm used in the manager and farmers sub models in supplementary material 1 explains how the evolutionary algorithm is used to model manager and farmer decision making with further detail of this general approach available in supporting information 1 of duthie et al 2018 2 8 4 objectives the objective of the farmers is to maximize total agricultural production yf across all of the landscape cells that they own whereas the managers objective is to set a policy in terms of action costs that minimizes the distance between the crane population target and the current population level duthie et al 2018 2 8 5 learning we included a learning process in each run of the evolutionary algorithm by seeding it with 20 copies of the strategy from the previous time step allowing it to potentially learn from the previous time step and more efficiently find a successful strategy given similar conditions 2 8 6 prediction managers predict farmers actions in the evolutionary algorithm fitness function by assuming that the total number of actions in a time step will be proportional to those in the previous time step weighted by its cost e g if the cost doubles then half the number of actions are predicted 2 8 7 sensing sensing is incorporated in the modeling in that farmers know that cranes decrease agricultural production farmers also know which landscape cells and what proportion of the landscape that they own the costs of actions and the probability of cranes landing back in their owned cells after being scared managers estimate how many cranes are on the landscape they also know the total number of actions taken by farmers in the previous time step that culling decreases the number of cranes by one plus the number of offspring that it is expected to produce and that scaring does not decrease the crane number 2 8 8 interaction cranes interact with the landscape by decreasing the agricultural production on the cell that they occupy and feed individual farmers manager and cranes also interact with each other by adaptively making decisions based on current conditions managers make decisions based on estimated crane abundance and previous farmer actions whereas farmers make decisions based on crane distribution on their land management policy i e available actions and budget for details about interactions see descriptions of sub models and sensing 2 8 9 stochasticity in dynamic socio ecological systems like the one studied here it may be likely that empowerment of farmers i e budgets bf to perform actions varies among individuals at a given time step to assess the effect of such potential variability in farmer s budgets we repeated simulations for each of the scenarios with budgets varying among individuals by bf 50 in each time step stochasticity was also included in the crane population sub model by allowing movement of cranes to random cells within a given spatial range and by sampling the crane offspring number from a poisson distribution with a rate parameter of rb 0 118 2 8 10 collectives no collectives are implemented in the model 2 8 11 observation we simulated increasingly empowered farmers running simulation for a range of available budgets bf 50 100 3950 4000 with 40 simulation replicates for each budget value across four management scenarios a d over 30 years we extracted selected performance metrics for each time step t year 2020 2049 crane population size n percentage of maximum agricultural production i e observed agricultural production yf maximum agricultural production over the individual farmers cells scenario a b number of culled individuals per farmer scenario b d and number of scaring actions performed per farmer scenario b d table 1 3 results we found that empowering farmers to enact actions affects management outcomes in terms of crane population size at staging sites and agricultural production at farm level figs 2 4 s2 in supplementary material 2 very low levels of farmer budget led to increases in the population because farmers chose scaring as a less budget demanding action which helped individual farmers in the short term by scaring birds off their land but led to high population size across all farms on the landscape in the longer term figs 2 4c d s2 in supplementary material 2 on the contrary very high farmer budgets led to high extinction risk up to 22 5 of the population fig 3 d s3 in supplementary material 2 whereas simulations of intermediate budgets allowed farmers to control the population size around the management target and kept the impact on agricultural production to intermediary levels figs 2 4 d 3 1 management scenario a scenario a illustrates a long term and exponential increase of the crane population from year 2020 mean n 19 123 to 2049 mean n 109 298 fig 2a changing farmer budget did not affect expected population size or agricultural production at t 5 year 2024 figs 3a 4a due to lack of management and inability to scare or cull i e scaring and or culling and targeted population n n 3 2 management scenario b results from scenario b demonstrate a long term and exponential population increase over years in the same way as in scenario a year 2021 mean n 19 018 ind and for 2050 mean n 102 275 fig 2a b as the management target was always higher than the realized population i e n n at year 2024 the manager set the costs for culling high relative to scaring mean cculling 7 1 cscaring to sustain the population which incentivized the farmers to allocate their budget to scaring instead of culling in year 2024 fig s4 in supplementary material 2 nevertheless occasional and limited culling mean culled cranes per farmer 0 004 occurred as farmer budget increased consequently the population size in year 2024 decreased slightly relative to scenario a mean n from 22 691 to 18 201 ind fig 3b and mean agricultural production increased from 64 9 to 71 0 of total expected production fig 4b within the range of increasing farmer budget bf 50 4000 3 3 management scenario c in scenario c the population increased exponentially over years given intermediate farmer budgets bf 1000 for 2021 mean n 18 931 and for 2050 mean n 67 496 fig 2c however the population growth was slower compared to scenario a and b fig 2a b c further for a given time step t 5 increasing farmer budgets caused the population size in 2024 to decline e g mean n 23 392 for bf 50 and n 13 120 for bf 4000 fig 3c as a consequence of increased number of culled cranes per farmer i e 0 36 cranes for bf 50 4000 fig s5c in supplementary material 2 as a result of population limiting effects the agricultural production increased from 64 7 to 78 4 along the same range of farmers budgets fig 4c since culling is the only available but yet costly action stakeholders will have no alternative to culling when budget allows this causes stakeholders to take action uniformly when budgets exceed the cost of culling bf caction fig s5c in supplementary material 2 however when adding variability to the farmer budget the small threshold effects in population size and agricultural production smooths out as the farmer budgets exceeds their costs and incentivize actions at varying times fig s6 in supplementary material 2 3 4 management scenario d in scenario d the population approached the management target of 15 000 cranes with increasing farmer budgets and aligned with the targeted population size for a limited intermediate budget range bf 550 850 however the population declined to below the targeted population size when farmer budgets further increased bf 850 as result of stakeholder power overriding manager ability to set costs to minimize culling figs 3d 4d the lowered manager target compared to scenario a c caused the manager to dynamically adjust the relative costs of scaring and culling depending on the size of the current population relative to the target when current population size was greater than the defined target the managers incentivized culling by lowering the culling costs relative to scaring whereas the opposite occurred if the population is lower than the defined target this is also illustrated by a continuously increasing number of culled cranes per farmer i e up to 35 cranes per farmer fig s5d in supplementary material 2 until the population aligns with the management target bf 550 850 fig 2d fig 3d and occasionally with even greater number of culled cranes per farmer maximum 57 ind fig s5d in supplementary material 2 as farmer budget outstripped the power of managers to set culling cost mean agricultural production varies between 73 9 75 9 when the population aligned with the targeted population size but increased further up to 95 3 as the population declines along the range of further increasing farmer budgets bf 900 4000 and below the targeted population size with an extinction risk of 22 5 fig 4d fig s3d in supplementary material 2 4 discussion 4 1 stakeholder empowerment in multi objective management in order to manage conservation conflicts collaboration between stakeholders and managing authorities to decide on trade offs between multiple objectives e g sustaining crane population and agricultural production and providing local stakeholders with power to enact management have been addressed as critical and potentially more important than merely reducing negative impact from wildlife mason et al 2018 redpath et al 2017 2013 however predicting the effects of providing stakeholders with power on the likelihood of adverse negative consequences e g high extinction risk or the crane population being far from the management target and low agricultural production have generally been over looked when predicting management outcomes and risk of conflict from models but see bunnefeld et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 our findings demonstrate that empowering a large number of stakeholders comes with the challenge of finding a delicate balance of the degree of empowerment very high farmer stakeholder power means the wildlife population is at an increased risk of extinction e g up to 22 5 year 2024 in scenario d when lethal control is an option whereas very low stakeholder power means high wildlife populations and extensive negative impact on agricultural production our study shows that knowledge and management of stakeholder power and actions is needed to manage a sensitive trade off between wildlife conservation and agriculture furthermore our study shows that by modeling the interaction between two groups of stakeholders manager and farmers with potentially opposing views we contribute to our understanding of the complexity as well as challenges and risks of stakeholder empowerment and decentralization of decision making as the protected crane population along the european flyways likely will continue to increase so will the negative impact on agricultural production and trade offs in management objectives between agricultural production and a sustainable crane population affecting associated conservation conflict a multiple objective management will require interventions to regulate the population size with sustainable culling strategies careful monitoring and modeling efforts to predict the likely impacts of alternative strategies cusack et al 2019 johnson et al 2014 our modeling demonstrates that a large community of farmers managing the crane population in a coordinated fashion may effectively regulate the population and thus maintain or even increase agricultural production scenario c d the specifics of the quota system set by the manager will have an effect on population size for example culling quotas of a limited number of cranes to all individual farmers as opposed to e g higher quotas to a very small number of individuals as currently is the case may be an approach to increase equitable distribution of individual power redpath et al 2017 however our simulations also highlight that the total number of licenses to cull cranes needs to be carefully considered to maintain population sustainability fig 2c d s5 in supplementary material 2 this is true especially if no other management actions e g scaring diversionary fields are possible as even small increases of a few cranes to cull per stakeholder may cause the population growth rate to decline scenario c d today s license system in sweden is based on very limited quotas from the county administrative boards up to 10 cranes to a minority of the farmers eea n d which based on our results likely have insignificant effects on either population size or agricultural production yet our findings show that the extent to which farmers impact on the crane population and agricultural production can be significant and is dependent on the power given to the farmers this could be an effective way to perform management in line with policy and to decrease practical or monetary costs for farmers it could for example include compensation schemes for farmers to pay for labor connected to culling or scaring actions provision of scaring devices decoys or hides for culling and coordination and help by employed personnel to scare and cull cranes hake et al 2010 nilsson et al 2018 our study exemplifies that if licensed culling would be permitted i e relocated from annex i to annex ii in the eu birds directive ec 2009 extensive stakeholder effort would be needed to reduce the population to a lower management target e g 25 culled individuals per farmer after 5 years in our model accordingly our findings have implications for the evidence informed flyway management plans implemented for several thriving goose species under the united nations african eurasian waterbird agreement aewa madsen et al 2017 stroud et al 2017 these management plans consist of agreed population targets to be delivered via adaptive management population monitoring population estimation and country specific culling quotas madsen et al 2017 our study highlights that stakeholder empowerment and culling strategies based on the number of stakeholders and particularly their power to implement effective actions needs careful consideration and monitoring when setting population targets and decentralized policy baynham herd et al 2018 mason et al 2017 williams and madsen 2013 4 2 the management strategy evaluation framework to model social ecological systems our findings demonstrate how individual based modeling and the management strategy evaluation framework can be used to investigate the effects of manager s and stakeholders interactive decisions in management of natural resources and wicked conservation conflicts in complex and uncertain systems such as for a protected and increasing crane population causing negative impact on agricultural production bunnefeld et al 2011 duthie et al 2018 smith 1999 until now mse models have used constant decision making rules for single stakeholders over time bunnefeld et al 2013 melbourne thomas et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 whereas we used gmse to simulate scenarios including a large number of individual stakeholders taking decisions independently as influenced by changes in the wildlife population agricultural production and policy set by the manager gmse is freely available as a package in the r environment and includes a graphical user interface that can be accessed from the r console or a browser online gui duthie 2020 all gmse code is open source further allowing the development of increased use of the model and the empowerment of all stakeholders through investment in communication and co development of the model duthie et al 2018 socio ecological and individual based models like these simplify empirical systems to investigate key concepts and clarify theory and inevitably make complex trade offs between the extent of realism and integration of knowledge schlüter et al 2019 our model necessarily makes some restrictive assumptions about crane ecology and management due to limited access to empirical data for model parameterization for example we do not have data on individual cranes impact on agricultural production or on the exact economic consequences for farmers which likely is influenced by e g market prices weather and timing of harvest montràs janer et al 2019 nilsson et al 2016 further socio ecological and individual based models are based on the assumption that human decision making is bounded rationale schlüter et al 2019 in our model farmers and managers are assumed to make decisions relating to a single objective i e farmers to maximize production managers to minimize the difference between current and targeted crane population size instead in real world situations individual managers and farmers with diverse norms are likely to adaptively make trade offs between multiple objectives over time and in relation to decisions taken by other stakeholders schill et al 2019 in the context of cranes and farming an example could be farmers potentially tolerating a certain number of cranes and thus negative impact on their agricultural production to sustain biodiversity given certain management conditions the mechanisms for such stakeholder multi objective trade offs are not very well understood to date and require further empirical and theoretical study bunnefeld et al 2017 schill et al 2019 4 3 conclusions a large number of stakeholders e g farmers and managers naturally causes complications to optimal trade offs in decision making in natural resource management and small changes in stakeholder behavior or policy are found to potentially have large scale implications for the dynamics of entire socio ecological systems heal and kunreuther 2012 scheffer et al 2012 to advance previous modeling of the mse framework we used the gmse model to simulate and predict the long term effects of empowering multiple farmers to dynamically respond to policy the crane population and impact on agricultural production under uncertainty our findings demonstrate that empowering a large number of farming stakeholders to pursue their management objectives comes with the challenge of finding a sensitive balance of the degree of empowerment not providing stakeholders with budgets to enact actions may lead to frustration ineffective management and risk of conflict whereas unlimited farming stakeholder budgets may cause conflicts when conservation stakeholder objectives override management objectives mason et al 2018 redpath et al 2013 this suggests that collaboration between managing authorities and stakeholders may be critical to agree on and act in line with multi objective management targets carefully considered levels of stakeholder empowerment may so enhance democratization and trust between parties with the

24698,conflicts between opposing objectives of wildlife conservation and agriculture are increasing globally due to rising human food production and competition with wildlife over land use conservation conflicts are often complex and driven by variability and uncertainty in wildlife distribution and stakeholder wealth and power to manage conflicts empowering local stakeholders by decentralizing decisions and actions has been suggested to promote democratization and awareness of stakeholders there is however a current gap in the understanding of how stakeholder empowerment e g farmers and managers practical time or monetary resources affects policy effectiveness in this study we apply an individual based model of management strategy evaluation to simulate the conservation conflict surrounding protected and thriving common cranes grus grus causing damage to agricultural production in sweden and along the european flyways we model the effect of farmer empowerment i e increasing budgets to affect populations and agricultural production in four management scenarios in which we manipulate the availability and cost of two actions farmers may take in response to crane presence on their land non lethal scaring or lethal culling control we find that lower budgets lead to increases in population size due to increased use of less costly scaring instead of shooting higher farmer budgets lead to increased population extinction risk intermediate budgets allow farmers to control the population size around the management target and limit impact on agricultural production to intermediate levels our study highlights that stakeholder empowerment and culling strategies based on the number of stakeholders and particularly their power to implement effective actions needs careful consideration and monitoring when setting management targets and strategies further our results show that empowering individual farmers has the potential to contribute to conflict management and to balance agricultural with conservation objectives but increased stakeholder involvement also requires careful planning and monitoring keywords conservation conflict grus grus human decision making individual based model management strategy evaluation multi objective management 1 introduction conflicts between the objectives of wildlife conservation i e species protection habitat restoration and sustainable agriculture are increasing globally due to a rising human demand for food production and consequent competition with wildlife over land use henle et al 2008 redpath et al 2013 such conflicts have been identified as one of the major causes of failed management strategies and can thus result in negative impacts on conservation outcomes and stakeholders livelihoods and psychosocial wellbeing barua et al 2013 hodgson et al 2019 redpath et al 2013 due to their complex and dynamic nature conflicts like these are often described as wicked problems characterized and driven by the variation and uncertainty in e g wildlife distribution and inequity in stakeholder wealth and power bennett et al 2017 mason et al 2018 young et al 2016 in the case of herbivore populations conflicts often arise when wildlife forage on and cause damage to crops and when management options to reduce this are limited due to protection of the species or social opposition towards mitigation interventions dickman 2010 particularly good examples of such wicked conservation conflicts involve protected cranes grus spp and geese branta anser spp which currently have exponentially increasing populations causing negative impacts on agricultural land in europe and north america especially on land surrounding protected areas designated for those species and biodiversity in general cusack et al 2019 fox and madsen 2017 nilsson et al 2019 negative impacts caused by wildlife are often managed by culling to reduce populations under the assumption that agricultural loss will decrease accordingly montràs janer et al 2019 however due to protection or practical limitations non lethal mitigation methods e g scaring diversionary feeding monetary compensation are often required instead of culling cusack et al 2019 ec 2009 owen 1990 yet the management of many species including cranes and geese remains problematic in part due to time lags in centralized managers actions as a response to negative impact on agricultural production cusack et al 2019 this may aggravate conflicts by weakening stakeholder trust and willingness to act in line with policy bennett et al 2017 cusack et al 2019 young et al 2016 to manage conflicts like these empowering local stakeholders and their expertise by decentralizing decisions and actions has been proposed to integrate complexity and democratization into the management process mason et al 2018 raik et al 2008 redpath et al 2017 however there is currently a gap in the understanding of how stakeholder empowerment i e practical time or monetary resources affects sustainability and extinction risk of the population as well as agricultural production in the extreme decentralizing decisions to farming stakeholders without providing budgets to enact actions may fuel frustration and conflict with policy makers and managers and lead to ineffective management whereas unlimited farming stakeholder budgets may cause conflicts when conservation stakeholder objectives supersede management objectives mason et al 2018 redpath et al 2013 decision making in natural resource management is traditionally assumed to be based on stakeholder objectives to maximize their returns in terms of livelihood given a limited set of actions ability and budget to perform them d hodgson et al 2020 milner gulland 2011 for example farmers aim to maximize their agricultural production given the land and labor they have whereas managers might instead aim to keep wildlife populations within a range where long term viability is ensured given their ability to monitor the population and enforce their policies in pursuing these aims practical limitations e g available time and resources will constrain the power of both farmers and managers to act leading to trade offs in decision making game theory formally describes situations with such strategic actions in which the consequences of an individual s decisions are influenced by the decisions taken by others hauert et al 2006 for example the success of a manager s decisions toward fulfilling conservation objectives through policy or economic incentives might be affected by the decisions of stakeholders to comply or not colyvan et al 2011 milner gulland 2011 redpath et al 2018 hence while many existing models assume that policy will be enacted faithfully this assumption might not always be realistic such as under used culling quotas due to deficient number of hunters butterworth 1999 milne 2018 milner gulland 2012 small perturbations in stakeholder behavior or policy in uncertain and dynamic systems might result in severe and unforeseen implications for the dynamics of the entire system including both human behavior i e social tipping points and increased extinction risk in the focal wildlife population i e ecological tipping points heal and kunreuther 2012 scheffer et al 2012 complexity and uncertainty make empirical evaluation of management outcomes i e agent responses challenging to account for uncertainty at multiple points in the management process the management strategy evaluation i e mse framework has been developed smith 1999 however until now mse models have incorporated constant decision making rules for single managers or farmers over time bunnefeld et al 2013 melbourne thomas et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 a newly developed framework for generalized management strategy evaluation i e gmse includes scenarios that can include multiple independent stakeholders making individual decisions as influenced by changes in resources policy and individual circumstance duthie et al 2018 in this study we apply the management strategy evaluation framework using the gmse r package to simulate the conservation conflict case of protected common cranes congregating in large numbers i e up to 26 000 ind at agricultural staging sites in sweden causing significant damage to agricultural production inspected and compensated damage totals up to 200 000 euros year montràs janer et al 2019 nilsson et al 2019 cranes are protected in annex i in the european birds directive and thus from culling to regulate the population the directive states that the listed species survival and reproduction must be ensured in their distribution range but allows for licensed lethal culling to mitigate negative impact on human livelihoods and when non lethal damage preventive measures e g scaring diversionary feeding have been found unsuccessful ec 2009 due to the protective legislation no management targets are defined for the maximum populations size on either staging site or flyway level but as these populations will likely continue to grow so will the stakeholder demand for lethal or non lethal crop damage preventive strategies and the severity of the conservation conflict fox and madsen 2017 montràs janer et al 2019 by applying the mse framework in this study we aim to identify the effect of increasing stakeholder power i e decentralizing decisions to enact policy on all aspects of the system including the objectives to keep a viable wildlife population and sustainable agricultural production over time and the implications for managing conflict more specifically we investigate how increasing the ability of individual stakeholders to enact decisions at the farm scale affects broader scale changes in expected crane population sizes and agricultural production in four possible management scenarios a no management and no stakeholder power to affect cranes b scaring and culling of cranes with a management objective to allow the population to increase to an effectively high management target i e 100 000 ind c only culling allowed but with an effectively high management target and d scaring and culling with a management objective to keep the population at a lower target i e 15 000 ind to lower the negative impact on agricultural production 2 model the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 as updated by grimm et al 2020 the full odd description including the details section and r code to replicate all simulations can be found in supplementary material 1 2 1 purpose and patterns the purpose of the model is to predict how increasing the ability of individual stakeholders to enact decisions at the farm scale affects broader scale changes in expected crane population sizes and agricultural production in four possible management scenarios over 30 years to do this we used the package gmse v0 6 0 4 in r duthie et al 2018 gmse simulates the management strategy evaluation process in a way that models goal oriented behavior and spatial distribution of individual stakeholders managers and wildlife using an individual based i e agent based framework bunnefeld et al 2011 duthie et al 2018 the four management scenarios simulated were a no management and no stakeholder power to affect cranes b scaring and culling of cranes with a management objective to allow the population to increase to an effectively high management target i e 100 000 ind c only culling allowed but with an effectively high management target and d scaring and culling with a management objective to keep the population at a lower target i e 15 000 ind to lower the negative impact on agricultural production 2 1 1 management scenario a scenario a is a null model for population size and mean agricultural production when no scaring or culling is conducted and the crane population can grow exponentially currently there is a lack of management targets both nationally and for the whole population along the flyways so this reflects the current lack of population regulation 2 1 2 management scenario b scenario b models current management in sweden which allows for intensive scaring methods to reduce loss in agricultural production specifically using scaring by the use of gas cannons scare crows flags very limited culling i e up to 15 individuals licensed to a minority of the farmers is occasionally permitted by the managing authorities eea n d in our model the strict licensing procedure for culling is represented by a high cost for culling for the farmer unlike scaring and was regulated in the simulations by setting a very high management target i e ensuring a condition where the manager would always set a high cost for culling non lethal scaring may divert cranes from single cells at the landscape but will not affect population size and a scenario only permitting scaring was therefore not considered 2 1 3 management scenario c scenario c models a hypothetical scenario where although culling is expected to be costly thus the manager is expected to keep costs of culling very high there either is no alternative action possible or alternative actions like scaring are prohibited or widely perceived to be ineffective and therefore never taken 2 1 4 management scenario d scenario d models a situation where managers permit both scaring and culling but managers attempt to keep the crane population at a size well below presumed carrying capacity this allows for a more dynamic allocation of budget for both farmers and managers which consequently mimics a trade off between the objectives to sustain agricultural production while ensuring viability of the crane population we evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce the pattern of population growth in the previous 30 years leading up to the current population year 2020 by parameterizing the model with the parameter values i e initial population size and reproductive output for details see initialization in supplementary material 1 derived from the model simulations and based on previous empirical data on crane numbers we can test if the model reproduces the pattern of population growth given realistic initial conditions recovering this pattern demonstrates that the model was fit for purpose in that we could then use it to test new scenarios against i e management scenario a d 2 2 entities state variables and scales farmers managers and cranes operate on an agricultural landscape l modelled as a torus of discrete cells owned by individual farmers and producing a potentially variable yield of agricultural crop i e agricultural production each landscape cell thus has unique traits including farmer ownership x y location lxy agricultural production and density of cranes in each time step only one farmer can own a single lxy cell but any number of cranes can occupy a single cell in this study l was constructed as a grid of 100 100 cells representing a total staging area of about 200 km2 nilsson et al 2018 utilized by a total of 50 farmers earning the majority of their livelihood from agriculture 1 km2 per farmer holmer 2016 the swedish board of agriculture 2017 gmse models discrete individuals which here include farmers managers and cranes each individual has potentially unique traits which potentially affect their behavior each farmer owns a fixed number of contiguous landscape cells l see above on which they can perform one or more types of actions each farmer has a budget bf for performing actions which can be broadly interpreted to encompass one or more factors limiting the total number of actions possible for the farmer during a single time step such as time money or available equipment thus individual farmers traits include their budget and farm location managers do not own landscape cells but instead set policy that affects the costs of performing actions for farmers caction managers have traits in terms of a budget bm for setting policy which can be broadly interpreted to encompass the factors that limit the power of managers to make and enforce policy decisions managers either do not attempt to regulate crane population density or attempt to maintain cranes at some target population density n at every time step by setting policy i e costs for farmer actions the traits for individual cranes are location age and reproductive output in this study a single time step is modelled as one year for a definitions of state variable entities landscape and model parameters see table s1 in supplementary material 1 2 3 process overview and scheduling the model includes four sub models operating in sequence over a single time step fig 1 for detailed information on definition and use of parameters and modeling procedure see supplementary material 1 2 4 the crane population sub model the first sub model simulates the population dynamics of nt cranes in time step t cranes arrive at a randomly selected cell within rm cells of the one that they left in t 1 with equal probability crane cell location is randomly selected in t 1 then feed rfe times between each feeding cranes move to a cell within rm cells in any direction from the currently occupied cell on the landscape randomly selected with equal probability cranes then give birth to young then potentially die of old age initial population size for each simulation was independently sampled from the distribution of simulated terminal abundances from the 100 nrep replicate simulations in years 1989 2019 see initialization in supplementary material 1 fig s1 in supplementary material 2 2 5 the observation sub model the observation model uses a monitoring method in which cranes are counted with complete accuracy on a subset of the landscape i e 10 10 cells and density is then extrapolated to estimate the crane population size assuming the same density over the entire landscape hence estimated population size n might deviate from the true n 2 6 the manager sub model the manager sub model assesses n in relation to a management target and sets policy by defining action costs caction these may be conceptualized as e g time practical or monetary costs for different actions farmers may take to affect agricultural production including culling or scaring cranes managers use an evolutionary algorithm to set costs for each action this algorithm models the heuristic process of the manager considering different potential policies and choosing one that will result in a crane population density nearer to the manager s target see supplementary material 1 once the algorithm is completed managers enact the cost of each available farmer action the total budget for the manager was kept constant in the model i e bm 1000 see supplemental material 1 for details on parameterization of the evolutionary algorithm 2 7 the farmer sub model in the farmer sub model farmers implement actions with the objective to maximize their own agricultural production constrained by the costs of individual actions as set by the manager s policy and the farmers annual budgets bf as with manager policy decisions farmer decisions are chosen by running a single independent evolutionary algorithm for each farmer in each time step farmers recognize that the presence of cranes on a landscape cell has a negative effect on agricultural production and will therefore adaptively use actions to try to effectively decrease the presence of cranes individual stakeholder decisions consequently affect cranes and agricultural production over multiple time steps all actions of all farmers are performed in a random order so that for example one farmer does not do all of their scaring or culling before another farmer and thereby cause differences in farmer s agricultural production due to the order of farmer actions farmers can only take actions on land that they own 2 8 design concepts 2 8 1 basic principles to account for uncertainty at multiple points in a natural resource management process the management strategy evaluation i e mse framework has been developed smith 1999 mse models have incorporated constant decision making rules for single managers or farmers over time bunnefeld et al 2013 melbourne thomas et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 however the generalized management strategy evaluation framework i e gmse used in this study includes multiple independent stakeholders making individual decisions as influenced by changes in resources policy and individual circumstance duthie et al 2018 gmse simulates the management strategy evaluation process in a way that models goal oriented behavior and spatial distribution of individual stakeholders managers and wildlife using an individual based i e agent based framework bunnefeld et al 2011 duthie et al 2018 the observation model uses a virtual ecologist approach zurell et al 2010 to model manager observation of the crane population 2 8 2 emergence crane population dynamics and agricultural production emerge over time based on the individual decisions of the manager i e setting policy and farmers i e taking action 2 8 3 adaptation evolutionary algorithms are useful heuristic tools that mimic the process of biological evolution to find solutions to highly complex problems hamblin 2013 in our simulations these complex problems refer to modeling the goal oriented decision making of managers and farmers managers must attempt to use their available budget to set costs that keep crane populations near a pre specified target while farmers must attempt to use their available budget and any actions available to maximize agricultural production the possible actions that farmers can take to reduce impact on agricultural production include non lethal scaring one action of which causes one crane to randomly relocate to a new cell before damaging crops note this could potentially result in the crane resettling on another cell owned by the acting farmer or culling one action of which causes one crane to be completely removed from the landscape before damaging crops see scenario a b decisions within the model are made under uncertainty as is realistic for stakeholders in empirical social ecological systems and behavior is consequently heuristic often suboptimal the section the evolutionary algorithm used in the manager and farmers sub models in supplementary material 1 explains how the evolutionary algorithm is used to model manager and farmer decision making with further detail of this general approach available in supporting information 1 of duthie et al 2018 2 8 4 objectives the objective of the farmers is to maximize total agricultural production yf across all of the landscape cells that they own whereas the managers objective is to set a policy in terms of action costs that minimizes the distance between the crane population target and the current population level duthie et al 2018 2 8 5 learning we included a learning process in each run of the evolutionary algorithm by seeding it with 20 copies of the strategy from the previous time step allowing it to potentially learn from the previous time step and more efficiently find a successful strategy given similar conditions 2 8 6 prediction managers predict farmers actions in the evolutionary algorithm fitness function by assuming that the total number of actions in a time step will be proportional to those in the previous time step weighted by its cost e g if the cost doubles then half the number of actions are predicted 2 8 7 sensing sensing is incorporated in the modeling in that farmers know that cranes decrease agricultural production farmers also know which landscape cells and what proportion of the landscape that they own the costs of actions and the probability of cranes landing back in their owned cells after being scared managers estimate how many cranes are on the landscape they also know the total number of actions taken by farmers in the previous time step that culling decreases the number of cranes by one plus the number of offspring that it is expected to produce and that scaring does not decrease the crane number 2 8 8 interaction cranes interact with the landscape by decreasing the agricultural production on the cell that they occupy and feed individual farmers manager and cranes also interact with each other by adaptively making decisions based on current conditions managers make decisions based on estimated crane abundance and previous farmer actions whereas farmers make decisions based on crane distribution on their land management policy i e available actions and budget for details about interactions see descriptions of sub models and sensing 2 8 9 stochasticity in dynamic socio ecological systems like the one studied here it may be likely that empowerment of farmers i e budgets bf to perform actions varies among individuals at a given time step to assess the effect of such potential variability in farmer s budgets we repeated simulations for each of the scenarios with budgets varying among individuals by bf 50 in each time step stochasticity was also included in the crane population sub model by allowing movement of cranes to random cells within a given spatial range and by sampling the crane offspring number from a poisson distribution with a rate parameter of rb 0 118 2 8 10 collectives no collectives are implemented in the model 2 8 11 observation we simulated increasingly empowered farmers running simulation for a range of available budgets bf 50 100 3950 4000 with 40 simulation replicates for each budget value across four management scenarios a d over 30 years we extracted selected performance metrics for each time step t year 2020 2049 crane population size n percentage of maximum agricultural production i e observed agricultural production yf maximum agricultural production over the individual farmers cells scenario a b number of culled individuals per farmer scenario b d and number of scaring actions performed per farmer scenario b d table 1 3 results we found that empowering farmers to enact actions affects management outcomes in terms of crane population size at staging sites and agricultural production at farm level figs 2 4 s2 in supplementary material 2 very low levels of farmer budget led to increases in the population because farmers chose scaring as a less budget demanding action which helped individual farmers in the short term by scaring birds off their land but led to high population size across all farms on the landscape in the longer term figs 2 4c d s2 in supplementary material 2 on the contrary very high farmer budgets led to high extinction risk up to 22 5 of the population fig 3 d s3 in supplementary material 2 whereas simulations of intermediate budgets allowed farmers to control the population size around the management target and kept the impact on agricultural production to intermediary levels figs 2 4 d 3 1 management scenario a scenario a illustrates a long term and exponential increase of the crane population from year 2020 mean n 19 123 to 2049 mean n 109 298 fig 2a changing farmer budget did not affect expected population size or agricultural production at t 5 year 2024 figs 3a 4a due to lack of management and inability to scare or cull i e scaring and or culling and targeted population n n 3 2 management scenario b results from scenario b demonstrate a long term and exponential population increase over years in the same way as in scenario a year 2021 mean n 19 018 ind and for 2050 mean n 102 275 fig 2a b as the management target was always higher than the realized population i e n n at year 2024 the manager set the costs for culling high relative to scaring mean cculling 7 1 cscaring to sustain the population which incentivized the farmers to allocate their budget to scaring instead of culling in year 2024 fig s4 in supplementary material 2 nevertheless occasional and limited culling mean culled cranes per farmer 0 004 occurred as farmer budget increased consequently the population size in year 2024 decreased slightly relative to scenario a mean n from 22 691 to 18 201 ind fig 3b and mean agricultural production increased from 64 9 to 71 0 of total expected production fig 4b within the range of increasing farmer budget bf 50 4000 3 3 management scenario c in scenario c the population increased exponentially over years given intermediate farmer budgets bf 1000 for 2021 mean n 18 931 and for 2050 mean n 67 496 fig 2c however the population growth was slower compared to scenario a and b fig 2a b c further for a given time step t 5 increasing farmer budgets caused the population size in 2024 to decline e g mean n 23 392 for bf 50 and n 13 120 for bf 4000 fig 3c as a consequence of increased number of culled cranes per farmer i e 0 36 cranes for bf 50 4000 fig s5c in supplementary material 2 as a result of population limiting effects the agricultural production increased from 64 7 to 78 4 along the same range of farmers budgets fig 4c since culling is the only available but yet costly action stakeholders will have no alternative to culling when budget allows this causes stakeholders to take action uniformly when budgets exceed the cost of culling bf caction fig s5c in supplementary material 2 however when adding variability to the farmer budget the small threshold effects in population size and agricultural production smooths out as the farmer budgets exceeds their costs and incentivize actions at varying times fig s6 in supplementary material 2 3 4 management scenario d in scenario d the population approached the management target of 15 000 cranes with increasing farmer budgets and aligned with the targeted population size for a limited intermediate budget range bf 550 850 however the population declined to below the targeted population size when farmer budgets further increased bf 850 as result of stakeholder power overriding manager ability to set costs to minimize culling figs 3d 4d the lowered manager target compared to scenario a c caused the manager to dynamically adjust the relative costs of scaring and culling depending on the size of the current population relative to the target when current population size was greater than the defined target the managers incentivized culling by lowering the culling costs relative to scaring whereas the opposite occurred if the population is lower than the defined target this is also illustrated by a continuously increasing number of culled cranes per farmer i e up to 35 cranes per farmer fig s5d in supplementary material 2 until the population aligns with the management target bf 550 850 fig 2d fig 3d and occasionally with even greater number of culled cranes per farmer maximum 57 ind fig s5d in supplementary material 2 as farmer budget outstripped the power of managers to set culling cost mean agricultural production varies between 73 9 75 9 when the population aligned with the targeted population size but increased further up to 95 3 as the population declines along the range of further increasing farmer budgets bf 900 4000 and below the targeted population size with an extinction risk of 22 5 fig 4d fig s3d in supplementary material 2 4 discussion 4 1 stakeholder empowerment in multi objective management in order to manage conservation conflicts collaboration between stakeholders and managing authorities to decide on trade offs between multiple objectives e g sustaining crane population and agricultural production and providing local stakeholders with power to enact management have been addressed as critical and potentially more important than merely reducing negative impact from wildlife mason et al 2018 redpath et al 2017 2013 however predicting the effects of providing stakeholders with power on the likelihood of adverse negative consequences e g high extinction risk or the crane population being far from the management target and low agricultural production have generally been over looked when predicting management outcomes and risk of conflict from models but see bunnefeld et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 our findings demonstrate that empowering a large number of stakeholders comes with the challenge of finding a delicate balance of the degree of empowerment very high farmer stakeholder power means the wildlife population is at an increased risk of extinction e g up to 22 5 year 2024 in scenario d when lethal control is an option whereas very low stakeholder power means high wildlife populations and extensive negative impact on agricultural production our study shows that knowledge and management of stakeholder power and actions is needed to manage a sensitive trade off between wildlife conservation and agriculture furthermore our study shows that by modeling the interaction between two groups of stakeholders manager and farmers with potentially opposing views we contribute to our understanding of the complexity as well as challenges and risks of stakeholder empowerment and decentralization of decision making as the protected crane population along the european flyways likely will continue to increase so will the negative impact on agricultural production and trade offs in management objectives between agricultural production and a sustainable crane population affecting associated conservation conflict a multiple objective management will require interventions to regulate the population size with sustainable culling strategies careful monitoring and modeling efforts to predict the likely impacts of alternative strategies cusack et al 2019 johnson et al 2014 our modeling demonstrates that a large community of farmers managing the crane population in a coordinated fashion may effectively regulate the population and thus maintain or even increase agricultural production scenario c d the specifics of the quota system set by the manager will have an effect on population size for example culling quotas of a limited number of cranes to all individual farmers as opposed to e g higher quotas to a very small number of individuals as currently is the case may be an approach to increase equitable distribution of individual power redpath et al 2017 however our simulations also highlight that the total number of licenses to cull cranes needs to be carefully considered to maintain population sustainability fig 2c d s5 in supplementary material 2 this is true especially if no other management actions e g scaring diversionary fields are possible as even small increases of a few cranes to cull per stakeholder may cause the population growth rate to decline scenario c d today s license system in sweden is based on very limited quotas from the county administrative boards up to 10 cranes to a minority of the farmers eea n d which based on our results likely have insignificant effects on either population size or agricultural production yet our findings show that the extent to which farmers impact on the crane population and agricultural production can be significant and is dependent on the power given to the farmers this could be an effective way to perform management in line with policy and to decrease practical or monetary costs for farmers it could for example include compensation schemes for farmers to pay for labor connected to culling or scaring actions provision of scaring devices decoys or hides for culling and coordination and help by employed personnel to scare and cull cranes hake et al 2010 nilsson et al 2018 our study exemplifies that if licensed culling would be permitted i e relocated from annex i to annex ii in the eu birds directive ec 2009 extensive stakeholder effort would be needed to reduce the population to a lower management target e g 25 culled individuals per farmer after 5 years in our model accordingly our findings have implications for the evidence informed flyway management plans implemented for several thriving goose species under the united nations african eurasian waterbird agreement aewa madsen et al 2017 stroud et al 2017 these management plans consist of agreed population targets to be delivered via adaptive management population monitoring population estimation and country specific culling quotas madsen et al 2017 our study highlights that stakeholder empowerment and culling strategies based on the number of stakeholders and particularly their power to implement effective actions needs careful consideration and monitoring when setting population targets and decentralized policy baynham herd et al 2018 mason et al 2017 williams and madsen 2013 4 2 the management strategy evaluation framework to model social ecological systems our findings demonstrate how individual based modeling and the management strategy evaluation framework can be used to investigate the effects of manager s and stakeholders interactive decisions in management of natural resources and wicked conservation conflicts in complex and uncertain systems such as for a protected and increasing crane population causing negative impact on agricultural production bunnefeld et al 2011 duthie et al 2018 smith 1999 until now mse models have used constant decision making rules for single stakeholders over time bunnefeld et al 2013 melbourne thomas et al 2017 milner gulland 2011 whereas we used gmse to simulate scenarios including a large number of individual stakeholders taking decisions independently as influenced by changes in the wildlife population agricultural production and policy set by the manager gmse is freely available as a package in the r environment and includes a graphical user interface that can be accessed from the r console or a browser online gui duthie 2020 all gmse code is open source further allowing the development of increased use of the model and the empowerment of all stakeholders through investment in communication and co development of the model duthie et al 2018 socio ecological and individual based models like these simplify empirical systems to investigate key concepts and clarify theory and inevitably make complex trade offs between the extent of realism and integration of knowledge schlüter et al 2019 our model necessarily makes some restrictive assumptions about crane ecology and management due to limited access to empirical data for model parameterization for example we do not have data on individual cranes impact on agricultural production or on the exact economic consequences for farmers which likely is influenced by e g market prices weather and timing of harvest montràs janer et al 2019 nilsson et al 2016 further socio ecological and individual based models are based on the assumption that human decision making is bounded rationale schlüter et al 2019 in our model farmers and managers are assumed to make decisions relating to a single objective i e farmers to maximize production managers to minimize the difference between current and targeted crane population size instead in real world situations individual managers and farmers with diverse norms are likely to adaptively make trade offs between multiple objectives over time and in relation to decisions taken by other stakeholders schill et al 2019 in the context of cranes and farming an example could be farmers potentially tolerating a certain number of cranes and thus negative impact on their agricultural production to sustain biodiversity given certain management conditions the mechanisms for such stakeholder multi objective trade offs are not very well understood to date and require further empirical and theoretical study bunnefeld et al 2017 schill et al 2019 4 3 conclusions a large number of stakeholders e g farmers and managers naturally causes complications to optimal trade offs in decision making in natural resource management and small changes in stakeholder behavior or policy are found to potentially have large scale implications for the dynamics of entire socio ecological systems heal and kunreuther 2012 scheffer et al 2012 to advance previous modeling of the mse framework we used the gmse model to simulate and predict the long term effects of empowering multiple farmers to dynamically respond to policy the crane population and impact on agricultural production under uncertainty our findings demonstrate that empowering a large number of farming stakeholders to pursue their management objectives comes with the challenge of finding a sensitive balance of the degree of empowerment not providing stakeholders with budgets to enact actions may lead to frustration ineffective management and risk of conflict whereas unlimited farming stakeholder budgets may cause conflicts when conservation stakeholder objectives override management objectives mason et al 2018 redpath et al 2013 this suggests that collaboration between managing authorities and stakeholders may be critical to agree on and act in line with multi objective management targets carefully considered levels of stakeholder empowerment may so enhance democratization and trust between parties with the

24699,grasslands are an important habitat for many plant species whose functional diversity and composition influences ecosystem functioning and services despite several field studies still uncertainties remain about the interplay of species traits and ecosystem processes that lead to the functional diversity observed in grasslands here we used an individual based process oriented model to simulate a biodiversity field experiment located in central europe with the focus on plant functional types pft the simulation model well reproduced vegetation attributes of grassland communities at different diversity levels of up to four pfts of grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes to understand how plant traits and competition between plants affects the functional composition of grasslands we tested in a simulation study the impact of different ecosystem processes and detected sensitive plant traits according to our model results competition for space affects community productivity stronger than competition for light while some traits increase and strengthen the growth of plants other functional traits make plants stronger through advantages in demographic processes our model based findings can be substantiated by several independent field studies in terms of relative yield plant density plant biomass and life span of plant functional types the methods and analyses shown here represent a promising step for the development of grassland models to investigate the complex structures and dynamics of temperate grasslands in complement to field studies

species this may be at the expense of other ecosystem services such as stability allan et al 2015 schäfer et al 2019 tilman and downing 1994 in order to propose recommendations for future management of grasslands e g adapted regimes or establishment of protected areas it is necessary to understand the relationship between the biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem like species composition soil climate and anthropogenic interventions for this purpose field experiments offer amongst others the possibility to investigate the dynamics of different species compositions in grasslands various experiments have dealt with the relationship between productivity and biodiversity with different results adler et al 2011 wang et al 2019 mittelbach et al 2001 but only few of them also considered functional diversity díaz and cabido 2001 for instance an experiment at cedar creek minnesota usa revealed that not only species diversity but also functional diversity and functional composition have a major impact on ecosystem processes such as productivity plant nitrogen tilman et al 1997 and soil carbon and nitrogen fornara and tilman 2008 european wide projects e g biodepth spehn et al 2005 showed that herbs and legumes are significant determinants of productivity hector et al 1999 experiments in germany jena biodiversity experiment roscher et al 2004 weisser et al 2017 with manipulated plant diversity and functional composition discovered that functional diversity has a positive effect not only on species diversity but also on community biomass marquard et al 2009b roscher et al roscher et al 2012 further emphasized in this experiment that functional composition explains variation in community biomass to a greater extent than species richness field studies dealing also with land use e g biodiversity exploratories fischer et al 2010 showed that indirect land use effects mediated by biodiversity loss and shifts in functional composition play a central role for multiple ecosystem services allan et al 2015 besides field experiments simulation models can be used to investigate and understand vegetation dynamics models can benefit from field experiments as measurement data can help to describe mechanisms and thus can serve as an excellent basis for the parameterization of the model in particular experiments manipulating biodiversity in a controlled design such as the jena biodiversity experiment are well suited for this purpose since the combination of different monocultures and mixtures of species allows to analyze plant interactions in grasslands grassland models have been developed for different purposes thornley 1998 taubert et al 2012 ross et al 1972 moulin et al 2018 johst et al 2015 may et al 2009 for the integration of different species into a model it is common to use the concept of classifying species into plant functional types pft since average functional properties are often sufficient to describe certain ecosystem functions lavorel et al 1997 roscher et al 2018 díaz and cabido 1997 thereby a pft can be considered as a representative of a group of species with similar ecological and morphological traits for instance a population based model used the concept of pfts to predict the accumulation rate of forage under different management practices for a variety of plant communities duru et al 2009 parameterizing pfts however can be challenging since field measurements often focus on populations of specific plant species grouping of species to pfts and the determination of their traits or model parameters requires an understanding how modeled processes pft traits and the resulting simulated community dynamics interplay in addition simulation models are simplified representations of reality different degrees of detail in the description of processes are dependent on a detailed knowledge of species traits which are not always measurable in the field and therefore require inverse parameterization of the model due to this grassland models often focus on simulating a few measurable vegetation attributes at the population or community level moulin et al 2018 duru et al 2009 but the simulated dynamics still can include uncertainties about the underlying mechanisms at the individual plant level e g a certain community biomass might be achieved by a few large plants or numerous small plants individual based simulation models allow a closer and more extensive look on vegetation attributes at the community population and individual plant level and enable to discover the impact of species traits on individual plant growth inter and intraspecific plant interactions and the resulting community dynamics here we test the individual based process oriented grassland model grassmind for simulating the dynamics of different species mixtures using the concept of pfts based on field measurements of the jena biodiversity experiment located in central europe roscher et al 2004 weisser et al 2017 field measurements of monocultures and mixtures in this field experiment include several vegetation attributes at the same time aboveground biomass agb leaf area index lai vegetation height and cover observed at the community and partly at the species level we use measurements from different plots of different species diversity monocultures and multi species mixtures aggregated according to four pfts grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes to represent functional diversity measured plant traits are only available for a few pft traits or model parameter remaining pft traits therefore require inverse model parameterization in such a way that the four measured vegetation attributes for four plots of one pft and one mixture of pfts can be reproduced by consistent simulation results based on the model we want to gain a deeper insight into key processes and plant traits that influence productivity and the functional composition in grasslands here proportional biomass of plant functional types to put it more precisely we want to answer the following questions 1 can we parameterize an individual based grassland model for a biodiversity experiment based on four pfts 2 which vegetation attributes of the community can be described best by the simulation model for grasslands of different functional diversities 3 which are the most influencing plant traits and processes regarding functional composition for this we first inversely parameterized field plots consisting of one pft only transferred the parameters to a 4 pft mixture and then tested this model parameterization for field plots of 2 and 3 pft mixtures by a robustness and sensitivity analysis we thereafter identified the impact of plant competition for light and space as well as different plant traits on functional composition 2 1 the model grassmind grassmind is a process oriented grassland model which has the advantage of simulating each single plant on a daily basis since the model includes many detailed processes we describe here only the most relevant processes for our study main processes are the photosynthesis respiration reproduction and mortality of individual plants a detailed description of the grassmind model can be found in taubert et al 2020a taubert et al 2020b and under www formind org downloads note that in this study we assume unlimited water and nitrogen supply for each plant in the model therefore belowground processes in soil such as competition for water and nitrogen are excluded at the individual level plants are established as seedlings and then grow in height and width based on the net primary productivity npp calculated from photosynthesis and respiration individual plants may differ in their traits pft specific model parameters which affect plant growth for example physiological traits that influence photosynthesis are amongst others specific leaf area sla and leaf life span lls plant growth is modeled according to a species specific constant ratio hw of an individual plant s height to its width or lateral extent a mowing event causes all plants to be shortened to a certain height e g to 10 cm while maintaining the width of the plants cut biomass is assumed to be removed subsequently plants grow only in height until the pft specific ratio hw is reached again at the community level plant growth can be limited due to shading by other plants asymmetric competition for light competition for light is modeled implicitly for all plants on a 1 m² plot tall plants shade smaller ones which affects photosynthesis and can reduce growth more precisely the global radiation i 0 is reduced from the top to the floor in height layers 1 cm width taking into account the leaf area l a i i contributed by individual plants in each height layer i monsi and saeki 2005 1 i s i 0 e i s l a i i as a result the global radiation is increasingly attenuated towards the lower end of the plot the plant height determines which height layer s a plant can reach and thus the irradiance the plant can receive we evaluate a plant s light limitation with the light reduction factor r l 1 i s i 0 further influencing factors of plant growth include daily abiotic variables like air temperature global radiation and day length competition for space prevents too many plants growing into a simulated plot this density dependent mortality reduces plant density n number of plants on the plot if community cover exceeds plot area if so the number n c r o w d 1 d of dying plants is 2 n c r o w d n 1 1 c c where c c is the fraction of vegetation cover in the plot ranging between 0 and 1 similarly we assess space limitation by a competition factor r s 1 1 c c generally light competition affects mainly the vertical community structure and space competition the horizontal grassland structure reproduction is modeled by a pft specific seed ingrowth this daily ingrowth encompasses also the constant incoming seed rain from the surrounding landscape simulated seed ingrowth starts from bare ground with the date of sowing the grassland after a pft specific time age rep growing seedlings turn into adult plants some plant characteristics then change for instance the allocation alloc shoot investing partly energy in seed production and the intrinsic mortality rate of plants m seed to m basic mortality of plants is included as stochastic events both mortality processes base mortality and mortality due to space competition select plants at random that die with their biomass being transferred to the litter pool the random selection of dying plants can have a large impact on model results as dead plants disappear immediately for example the death of the highest plant can lead to an immediate drastic decrease in vegetation height if it is by far the only large plant present in the community in contrast the death of a small plant usually does not cause markedly changes in vegetation attributes of a grassland community to account for stochastic effects in our analyses we calculated the average of results over ten simulation runs corresponding to an area of 10 m² see s2 results for effects of larger areas simulation results of the model include daily vegetation attributes we used the community and pft specific aboveground biomass agb by summing up the agb of all plants or the agb of plants belonging to a certain pft leaf area index lai is derived by calculating the leaf area from aboveground total agb and the constant specific leaf area of a plant pft specific model parameter as vegetation height we used the height of the highest plant within the community to obtain green vegetation cover i e coverage by living plant parts the sum of all plants cover was multiplied by the ratio of green lai to total lai 2 2 field data the jena experiment as reference data for our model we used measurements from the jena biodiversity experiment the jena experiment is one of the longest running biodiversity experiments in europe weigelt et al 2010 weisser et al 2017 the main experiment established in 2002 consists of 82 grassland plots 20 20 m² with up to 60 different species roscher et al 2004 it is located near jena germany 50 55 n 11 35 e close to the river saale the climate measurements see sect s1 methods for details show a mean temperature of 9 6 c and a mean annual precipitation of 539 6 mm from 2002 to 2008 the field site was formerly used as arable land and therefore the soil type eutric fluvisol was highly fertilized in recent decades roscher et al 2009 fischer et al 2019 besides two mowing events per year cutting height of 10 cm regular weeding was carried out in spring and summer bi annual field measurements include agb and vegetation cover per species as well as the community lai and vegetation height over seven consecutive years 2002 to 2008 2 3 parameterization of the model species grouping inverse parameterization validation evaluation 2 3 1 species grouping for the parameterization of the model for the jena experiment we used plant functional types pfts roscher et al roscher et al 2004 classified the existing species into four groups based on a multivariate cluster analysis of ecological and morphological traits hence we parameterized four pfts which are trait averaged typical representatives of grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes including typical species occurring in central europe 2 3 2 parameterization we used publicly available data over seven consecutive years 2002 2008 from the jena biodiversity experiment heisse et al 2007 weigelt et al 2010 climate data were taken from two facilities in jena and included daily air temperature irradiance and day length for details on the preparation of the climate data see sect s1 methods the field data was used as follows on each field plot the agb per species above 3 cm height leaf area index lai vegetation height and vegetation cover per species were measured bi annually from 2003 to 2008 and once in 2002 82 plots in total weigelt et al 2010 we grouped the field plots according to their plant functional types grasses g small herbs s tall herb t and legumes l and functional diversity level plots only of one pft g 9 plots s 8 plots t 9 plots or l 8 plots and the 4 pft mixture gstl 16 plots and averaged each vegetation attribute for each measurement date for agb and vegetation cover also pft proportions of each plot were available except for one measurement in 2004 for missing proportions in 2004 we assumed the average agb proportions of all other available agb measurements in the respective plot since weeding or the invasion of unknown species is not considered in our model but is carried out in the field plots we corrected vegetation cover of the target species proportionally i e sum of cover of target species bare ground and dead material excluding weed cover equals 100 the calculated correction factors were also applied to measured agb values to exclude weed agb as a result we obtained one time series for each vegetation attribute of the community and partly pft specific per field plot for each single pft g s t l and the 4 pft plot gstl to parameterize the grassland model grassmind 17 parameters for each pft had to be specified six parameters per pft were taken from field measurements and literature table s1 the remaining parameters were determined by inverse parameterization table s1 the inverse parameterization of the grassland model comprised two steps fig s1 first we inversely parameterized each pft separately in 1 pft plots g s t l second we combined these four estimated parameter sets in the mixture of four pfts gstl and corrected only one parameter per pft i e the ingrowth of seeds n seed by inverse parameterization the corrected values of n seed were then also used in the parameter sets of 1 pft plots first step when comparing simulation results and field measurements as reference data for the inverse parameterization we used the measured vegetation attributes for measurement dates see sect s1 methods a simulation run was performed over all seven years 2002 to 2008 and began on the day the field experiment was sown in the field 11 to 16 may 2002 weisser et al 2017 in the model 16 may 2002 mowing height and mowing dates in the model correspond to those of the experiment for exact dates see sect s1 methods for further details on the parameterization validation and evaluation see sect s1 methods 2 3 3 robustness analysis the advantage of process based models is the possibility to switch on or off different processes in this way it is possible to analyze the effects of certain processes on model results each process alone as well as their interaction ellner et al 2019 in this study the role of competition for light and space has been analyzed for this the model s starting conditions settings and parameter values remained similar to those used in the parameterization then in addition to the standard run in which competition for light and space was switched on we performed a a mode where competition for light was switched off and competition for space remained activated b a mode where competition for space was switched off and competition for light remained activated and c a mode where both competition processes were not activated thereby switching off space competition means that plants do no longer die because of limited space on a plot n c r o w d 0 for all time steps see eq 2 thus plants can unlimitedly overlap which in turn causes an increase in light competition on the other site switching off light competition means that plants do not shade each other anymore hence small plants that grow below taller ones also receive the full daily global radiation so their photosynthesis is not limited due to reduced light availability i s i 0 for all height layers s and time steps see eq 1 this can cause an increase of space competition as plants grow faster to compare the different modes and detect which process has a high influence on the vegetation dynamics we analyzed changes in the simulated vegetation attributes for the calculation of plant density number of plants per m² mean values were taken over the measurement dates of agb see sect s1 methods 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of various model parameters for this the morris method allowed to investigate the effect of changes in a plant trait on simulated vegetation attributes for details see sect s1 methods morris 1991 3 results we analyzed vegetation attributes within the measured field plots and compared them with our simulations afterwards results of the robustness and sensitivity analysis are shown 3 1 field data description measured vegetation attributes showed large differences between the 1 pft plots fig 1 a legumes were the most productive with on average twice as much aboveground biomass agb and a 50 higher leaf area index lai but only slightly higher vegetation height and vegetation cover compared to grasses grasses had the second highest productivity however they were comparable to tall herbs for agb and lai and differed with regard to a larger height and a smaller degree of vegetation cover than tall herbs small herbs showed the lowest values their agb was only one fourth of legumes agb the grassland with four pfts was on average less productive than plots of only legumes average agb of approx 370 g m² per measurement in 4 pft mixture compared to the average agb of approx 385 g m² in legume plots vegetation height and lai were similar to those of the legume plot but cover of green leaves was higher in the mixture plot within the mixture legumes were the dominant pft with the highest biomass proportion 41 vegetation cover was similar between 1 pft plots 70 to 81 as well as within the pft proportions of the 4 pft mixture 20 to 24 per pft variation of agb between plots consisting of different species and richness levels was low in plots of small herbs and high in plots of legumes fig s2 3 2 simulation results the grassland model could well reproduce the field measurements simulation and field measurements agreed in all vegetation attributes for each 1 pft plot averaged over time fig 1b simulated agb average over 13 time points deviated by a maximum of 6 from mean measurements within the 1 pft plots agb of the 4 pft mixture was underestimated by 19 in the model like in the field simulated legumes were the most productive 1 pft plot and dominate in the mixture although they showed a total biomass of only 2 below the measurement in the field mixture 150 g m² legumes in the simulations were much stronger than other pfts agb proportion compared to the observations 50 in the simulation to 41 in the measurements agb of other pfts was underestimated in the simulated mixture up to 54 less agb than in observations the range of temporal variations of vegetation attributes in the simulation was mostly similar to the measured range of temporal variations fig 1a b time series of vegetation attributes were also in good agreement between simulations and field measurements figs 1c and s2 surprisingly both showed nearly equal temporal patterns for each vegetation attribute although only the total sum over seven years was used for model calibration figs s2 s3 overall simulated vegetation cover and lai showed small deviations from field measurements average deviation of 6 each with respect to mean community attributes over all measurements averaged nrmse 0 16 vegetation cover averaged nrmse 0 52 lai fig 1 table s3 validation of the parameterized grassland model was done by using independent data on grassland plots consisting of two and three pfts all simulated grasslands resulted in a slight to moderate underestimation and only one 2 pft mixture small herbs and legumes showed an overestimation of agb in the simulation results fig s4a again legumes were often dominant with high agb proportion in the simulated and measured mixtures and were partly overestimated by the model in two of the five mixtures in which legumes occurred fig s4b the validation analysis revealed that vegetation cover was the best fitted attribute of the simulation model 10 3 deviation on average over all measurements and plots though vegetation height was estimated slightly better in total than lai 14 4 and 14 5 deviation see also table s4 for statistical measures including each measurement 3 3 relationships to plant functional type richness for our analyses we used averaged measured vegetation attributes over the years 2002 to 2008 by doing this we found a higher productivity in plots of legumes than in functional mixtures which at first sight seems to contradict previous studies marquard et al 2009b however by calculating annual averages of all plots with a certain number of pfts one to four we received a similar relationship in the simulations the community agb increased with higher pft richness fig s5a our simulations reproduced this gradient well but with a smaller slope fig s5a furthermore annual averages of lai also increased with pft richness but opposite trends were detected for vegetation height and vegetation cover fig s5b d 3 4 mean relative yield mean relative plant biomass and mean relative plant density we compared simulated agb in grasslands of one pft with its proportion in all mixtures of 2 to 4 pfts defined as mean relative yield ryi grasses and small herbs showed on average underyielding ryi 1 e g ryi 0 6 for grasses while tall herbs and legumes produced proportionally more agb in mixtures ryi 1 e g ryi 1 2 for tall herbs table s5 furthermore legumes were the only plants that increased on average in mean plant biomass agb per plant and simultaneously in mean plant density number of plants per m² considering all mixtures rbi 1 and rdi 1 similarly calculated as ryi table s5 a stronger decrease of plant density e g a lower rdi from 1 pft plots to mixtures while having a high ryi could be compensated by an increase in plant biomass rbi and thus the establishment of taller plants as is the case for tall herbs rdi 0 5 rbi 3 4 pfts with taller plants and larger plant agb were more likely to shade other plants also of other pfts which in turn could suffer from a lower light availability 3 5 impact of light and space competition on productivity and functional composition to understand the importance of different processes for plant growth in plots consisting of one and four pfts the model could be used to analyze the impact of competition for light and space between plants overall both processes affected productivity but in different directions and dimensions within the plots competition for space caused much stronger changes in vegetation attributes than competition for light between plots of one pft vegetation attributes were changed to different extents and with different causes by competition fig 2 a in terms of agb and vegetation cover small herbs and legumes changed most whereas for vegetation height tall herbs were the most sensitive to space limitation less agb and vegetation height with no light competition fig 2a was caused by an increased density of smaller plants due to an increased mortality of few larger plants and thus higher vegetation cover no space competition caused opposing effects in vegetation height whose decrease e g in grasses was the result of slower plant growth due to permanently strong light competition an increase in vegetation height was related to a much lower plant density so that only a few tall plants survived suffering less from light competition this was observed for tall herbs which indicated space competition to be the dominant process limiting their growth changes in the analyzed competition factors supported that competition for space is dominant in plots of grasses tall herbs and legumes whereas competition for light is dominant in plots of small herbs and the 4 pft mixture for details see s2 results and fig s6 in grasslands with four pfts switching off light competition led to an agb decrease of about 6 whereas no space competition between plants resulted in almost 40 times higher values the other four attributes lai vegetation height and green cover plant density were similarly affected fig s7 within the mixture changes of all vegetation attributes were mainly driven by changes of legumes attributes interestingly only the height of legumes increased immensely when space competition was switched off while that of grasses small herbs and tall herbs decreased fig 2b this indicated that legumes prevent the growth of other pfts and space competition made them less competitive however although competition for light and space reduced the growth of legumes and partially increased the productivity of other pfts the proportion of legumes always remained by far the highest 50 with no light competition and 85 with no space competition 3 6 impact of plant traits on productivity and functional composition plant traits with most impact on vegetation attributes were identified by a sensitivity analysis see methods for details for 1 pft plots two geometric plant traits height width ratio of plants hw and specific leaf area sla two physiological traits light extinction coefficient k and slope of the light response curve α and one demographic trait mortality of seedlings m seed caused the largest absolute changes in agb fig s6a higher values of hw and α resulted clearly in an increase of biomass whereas higher values of m seed and k resulted in a decrease fig 3 a the effect of these parameters on the simulation results was linear and additive large mean and low standard deviation of elementary effect lying outside the wedge of gray lines in the figure morris 1991 ruano et al 2011 on the other hand a higher sla could lead to higher or lower agb values on average negative because of interactions with other plant parameters or due to nonlinear effects to find out which traits affect the dominance of legumes we varied trait parameters of legumes in the 4 pft mixture two physiological traits k and α one demographic m seed and one geometric trait hw belonged to the most influential traits of legumes concerning their agb proportion fig s6b now instead of sla two further demographic legume traits seed ingrowth n seed and germination rate of seeds germ were also relevant the parameters k α m seed and hw affected change in agb of legumes similarly except for hw whose higher values led in the mixture to a reduced agb of legumes fig 3b the agb of small herbs was least affected by changes in legume traits low elementary effect fig 3b the reduced agb of legumes due to its increased trait values of m seed and hw increased agb of the other pfts with α n seed and germ contrary results were observed increased trait values of legumes led to more agb of legumes and to less agb of the other pfts the legume trait k had the weakest effect on the other pfts an increased value only led to a slightly higher agb for grasses and small herbs and to a slightly lower agb for tall herbs the analysis outlined diverse effects of traits on agb of the different pfts higher values of hw α sla and germ and lower values of m seed and k strengthened generally the productivity in plots of one pft and weakened in the 4 pft mixture the productivity of pfts other than legumes due to increased competition in turn n seed only made legumes more competitive in the 4 pft mixture but did not considerably affect the productivity of 1 pft plots despite the clear trend for the above mentioned parameters except for sla see methods and fig 3 for almost none of the traits the mean elementary effect μ of a varied trait on agb equaled the absolute mean elementary effect μ this means that changes in trait parameter values in one direction increased or decreased the agb depending on values of other parameters 4 discussion by using field measurements from a local biodiversity experiment we showed that it is possible to simulate the growth and dynamics of grasslands with an individual based model we were able to cover four different vegetation attributes aboveground biomass agb in total and per pft and vegetation cover in total and per pft as well as vegetation height and leaf area index lai model results revealed good fits compared to field measurements for plots of one pft but showed an underestimation of vegetation attributes in mixtures 2 to 4 pfts nevertheless simulations also reproduced the observed positive relationship between productivity and pft richness annual dynamics of vegetation attributes matched well those measured in the field although only mean vegetation attributes over all years were used for calibration fig s2 the parameterized grassland model enabled us to analyze the relative importance of specific processes and plant traits on the functional composition in grasslands competition for space had a much stronger impact on grassland agb than competition for light increasing space competition led to a decreasing proportion of legumes and increased grasses small herbs and tall herbs nevertheless legumes always remained the dominant pft a global sensitivity analysis revealed key trait parameters of different processes geometry productivity and reproduction of plants with high influence on agb in grasslands some traits differed in their sensitivity between plots of one pft with only intraspecific interactions between plants and more pfts with additional interspecific interactions between plants some traits had a high impact on functional composition by generally increasing the growth of plants while other traits made a pft more competitive through advantages in demographic processes 4 1 understanding the functional composition trait and process influences in the model with a sensitivity analysis we obtained information on relevant plant traits that influence agb and functional composition a global sensitivity analysis enables to detect global trends nonlinearity and interactions with other trait parameters in contrast to a local sensitivity analysis for which changes of only one parameter are analyzed locally changing one trait parameter can have opposite effects depending on the strengths of other processes for example if plants grow more in height than in width it can result in more community agb as there is more space for other plants at the same time however larger plants increase light competition this affects not only the growth of smaller plants through shading but also the productivity of the plant itself through stronger self shading thus a global sensitivity analysis allowed us to explore in the case of two interacting processes which one is dominating when varying one specific trait the robustness analysis indicated that different processes dominated with respect to plant growth and interactions competition for light and space affected the pfts differently e g largest impacts on agb of dominant legumes in the mixture by the analysis of mean relative yield mean plant biomass and mean plant density the individual based model further allowed us to understand the mechanisms that led to the strength of legumes in mixtures extended model analysis on the trait variation of all four pfts at the same time might reveal additional insights on the competitive advantages of each pft in comparison to the other ones in the mixture 4 2 comparison to field study results plant densities and plant sizes plant density the number of plants per m² and mean biomass per plant for each pft have many similarities when comparing our simulation results to those from field measurements of the jena experiment marquard et al 2009a in the field tall herbs generally produced large but few plants while grasses produced small but numerous plants which is consistent with our model results table s5 marquard et al 2009a revealed that legumes were often among the overyielding species and grasses tend to underyield in mixtures which is also visible in our model results table s5 additionally the discussed linkage between mean relative yield and mean relative density if ryi 1 then rdi 1 as well as between mean relative yield and mean relative size if ryi 1 then rbi 1 marquard et al 2009a can be observed also in our simulation results with the exception of tall herbs showing a ryi 1 2 and a rdi 0 5 table s5 an additional result of marquard et al 2009a has been that grassland biomass is positively related to plant density and to agb per plant and plant agb increases with plant density in our simulation we obtained similar trends fig s9 in the study of marquard et al 2009a plant density ranged approx between 100 and 10 000 plants per m² and plant agb ranged between about 0 1 g and 10 g plots of different species richness measured in may 2006 whereas our simulations showed a narrower range 100 to 500 plants per m² and 0 3 g to 2 2 g per plant mean values over dates of agb measurement see sect s1 methods we found further similarities of our simulations with an independent field study investigating life spans of plants of different pfts lauenroth and adler 2008 for details see sect s2 results 4 3 limitations of individual based grassland models possible enhancements and perspectives in this study we demonstrated that an individual based grassland model is able to simulate aggregated measured vegetation dynamics by including only a few abiotic variables daily air temperature irradiance and day length competition between plants focused on aboveground resources like light and space as we excluded information on precipitation and plant soil interactions we assumed sufficient water supply due to the field experiment s closeness to a river and sufficient nitrogen availability due to former land use roscher et al 2009 fischer et al 2019 strikingly competition for light and space was sufficient to reproduce not only measured vegetation dynamics but also the positive relationship between functional richness and productivity and its variation within each diversity level with a less pronounced slope in the model compared to observations fig s5 at other sites however soil resource dynamics might influence community structure and functional composition stronger spehn et al 2002 pirhofer walzl et al 2012 fay et al 2015 in this case it is possible to couple grassland models with established soil models e g daycent parton et al 1998 although the vegetation attributes in plots of 1 pft can be reproduced accurately by the model larger deviations occur in the mixtures of different pfts figs 1 s2 this can be due to different reasons for example species specific influence of air temperature on plant productivity fig s5 or trait plasticity is currently not included in the model however plants could change their growth strategies and thus their traits in response to management climate interactions with other plants and plant age abakumova et al 2016 lipowsky et al 2015 valladares et al 2007 further analyses and development in the modeling of interaction processes and their parameterization can provide additional insights but also require specific measurements and experiments as well as suitable measures to compare them with individual based models e g measures describing the strengths of interaction and competition between plants burns and strauss 2012 kraft et al 2015 with regard to the approach of grouping species to plant functional types we were able to aggregate field observations to average plots of the assigned pft derived attributes can thus be interpreted as dominant traits of the pft species richness and composition as well as intraspecific trait variation within pfts can also impact community productivity and functional composition marquard et al 2009a 2009b moulin et al 2018 tilman et al 1997 buchmann et al 2018 combining trait distributions and grassland modeling allows to add trait variation to pfts based on our sensitivity analysis parameters with low influence such as seed biomass or leaf life span could remain constant at an average value while only trait parameters with higher influence on vegetation attributes could be varied among plants e g by adding random fluctuations to traits of new seedlings by this not only interspecific diversity but also intraspecific diversity within the community e g crawford et al 2019 which includes phenotypic and genetic variation wellstein et al 2013 garnier et al 2007 could be considered thereby plants could adapt to changing environmental conditions due to higher mortality of individuals with poor suitability which can enable to analyze intraspecific trait environment relationships within habitats the use of a process oriented model allows to investigate the influence of additional factors on vegetation dynamics for instance mowing frequencies or air temperature could be varied in order to conduct theoretical experiments that may not be feasible in the field völler et al 2017 gilhaus et al 2017 although field sites can differ in environmental factors models provide the opportunity to analyze their effects separately and jointly and in different intensities in addition models enable to analyze underlying processes structuring communities which are difficult to measure experimentally such as the importance of competition for light versus space field measurements on the light climate and leaf area density in distinct height layers in a grassland mixture as well as mean characteristics of different pfts could support such a model based analysis such studies can build a first step towards deriving parameterizations that are regionally transferable for this abiotic factors such as climate and soil and also management regimes differ regionally while traits of pfts should remain unchanged however it is still an open question whether feedbacks between environmental changes and species traits need to be considered field experiments can support such future model developments at the same time confronting different modeling approaches with similar research questions can enable to identify decisive mechanistic processes model strengths and model weaknesses then in turn models can provide suggestions and recommendations for future field experiments as well as for the management or conservation of grassland communities 5 conclusions in summary our results show that an individual based and process oriented simulation model can reproduce aggregated dynamics of four vegetation attributes in grasslands not only the dynamics of plots along a gradient of functional diversity with plant functional types of grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes can be simulated but also the positive effect of functional richness on grassland productivity model analyses showed that competition for space has a stronger influence on functional composition than competition for light moreover we identified specific traits that can make a plant functional type more productive and more competitive in mixtures the methods and analyses shown represent a promising step for the

24699,grasslands are an important habitat for many plant species whose functional diversity and composition influences ecosystem functioning and services despite several field studies still uncertainties remain about the interplay of species traits and ecosystem processes that lead to the functional diversity observed in grasslands here we used an individual based process oriented model to simulate a biodiversity field experiment located in central europe with the focus on plant functional types pft the simulation model well reproduced vegetation attributes of grassland communities at different diversity levels of up to four pfts of grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes to understand how plant traits and competition between plants affects the functional composition of grasslands we tested in a simulation study the impact of different ecosystem processes and detected sensitive plant traits according to our model results competition for space affects community productivity stronger than competition for light while some traits increase and strengthen the growth of plants other functional traits make plants stronger through advantages in demographic processes our model based findings can be substantiated by several independent field studies in terms of relative yield plant density plant biomass and life span of plant functional types the methods and analyses shown here represent a promising step for the development of grassland models to investigate the complex structures and dynamics of temperate grasslands in complement to field studies keywords temperate grassland individual based modeling plant functional types functional composition plant traits competition 1 introduction more than a third of the european agricultural area is covered by grassland smit et al 2008 temperate grasslands provide a wide range of ecosystem services sala and paruelo 1997 lemaire et al 2011 and an important habitat for many plant species wilson et al 2012 increased anthropogenic interventions already have caused species loss and an altered functional composition in grasslands socher et al 2012 bernhardt römermann et al 2011 niu et al 2014 for example intensive management high mowing and fertilizing frequencies has led to increased biomass yields schaub et al 2020 by shifting species composition towards fast growing acquisitive plant species this may be at the expense of other ecosystem services such as stability allan et al 2015 schäfer et al 2019 tilman and downing 1994 in order to propose recommendations for future management of grasslands e g adapted regimes or establishment of protected areas it is necessary to understand the relationship between the biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem like species composition soil climate and anthropogenic interventions for this purpose field experiments offer amongst others the possibility to investigate the dynamics of different species compositions in grasslands various experiments have dealt with the relationship between productivity and biodiversity with different results adler et al 2011 wang et al 2019 mittelbach et al 2001 but only few of them also considered functional diversity díaz and cabido 2001 for instance an experiment at cedar creek minnesota usa revealed that not only species diversity but also functional diversity and functional composition have a major impact on ecosystem processes such as productivity plant nitrogen tilman et al 1997 and soil carbon and nitrogen fornara and tilman 2008 european wide projects e g biodepth spehn et al 2005 showed that herbs and legumes are significant determinants of productivity hector et al 1999 experiments in germany jena biodiversity experiment roscher et al 2004 weisser et al 2017 with manipulated plant diversity and functional composition discovered that functional diversity has a positive effect not only on species diversity but also on community biomass marquard et al 2009b roscher et al roscher et al 2012 further emphasized in this experiment that functional composition explains variation in community biomass to a greater extent than species richness field studies dealing also with land use e g biodiversity exploratories fischer et al 2010 showed that indirect land use effects mediated by biodiversity loss and shifts in functional composition play a central role for multiple ecosystem services allan et al 2015 besides field experiments simulation models can be used to investigate and understand vegetation dynamics models can benefit from field experiments as measurement data can help to describe mechanisms and thus can serve as an excellent basis for the parameterization of the model in particular experiments manipulating biodiversity in a controlled design such as the jena biodiversity experiment are well suited for this purpose since the combination of different monocultures and mixtures of species allows to analyze plant interactions in grasslands grassland models have been developed for different purposes thornley 1998 taubert et al 2012 ross et al 1972 moulin et al 2018 johst et al 2015 may et al 2009 for the integration of different species into a model it is common to use the concept of classifying species into plant functional types pft since average functional properties are often sufficient to describe certain ecosystem functions lavorel et al 1997 roscher et al 2018 díaz and cabido 1997 thereby a pft can be considered as a representative of a group of species with similar ecological and morphological traits for instance a population based model used the concept of pfts to predict the accumulation rate of forage under different management practices for a variety of plant communities duru et al 2009 parameterizing pfts however can be challenging since field measurements often focus on populations of specific plant species grouping of species to pfts and the determination of their traits or model parameters requires an understanding how modeled processes pft traits and the resulting simulated community dynamics interplay in addition simulation models are simplified representations of reality different degrees of detail in the description of processes are dependent on a detailed knowledge of species traits which are not always measurable in the field and therefore require inverse parameterization of the model due to this grassland models often focus on simulating a few measurable vegetation attributes at the population or community level moulin et al 2018 duru et al 2009 but the simulated dynamics still can include uncertainties about the underlying mechanisms at the individual plant level e g a certain community biomass might be achieved by a few large plants or numerous small plants individual based simulation models allow a closer and more extensive look on vegetation attributes at the community population and individual plant level and enable to discover the impact of species traits on individual plant growth inter and intraspecific plant interactions and the resulting community dynamics here we test the individual based process oriented grassland model grassmind for simulating the dynamics of different species mixtures using the concept of pfts based on field measurements of the jena biodiversity experiment located in central europe roscher et al 2004 weisser et al 2017 field measurements of monocultures and mixtures in this field experiment include several vegetation attributes at the same time aboveground biomass agb leaf area index lai vegetation height and cover observed at the community and partly at the species level we use measurements from different plots of different species diversity monocultures and multi species mixtures aggregated according to four pfts grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes to represent functional diversity measured plant traits are only available for a few pft traits or model parameter remaining pft traits therefore require inverse model parameterization in such a way that the four measured vegetation attributes for four plots of one pft and one mixture of pfts can be reproduced by consistent simulation results based on the model we want to gain a deeper insight into key processes and plant traits that influence productivity and the functional composition in grasslands here proportional biomass of plant functional types to put it more precisely we want to answer the following questions 1 can we parameterize an individual based grassland model for a biodiversity experiment based on four pfts 2 which vegetation attributes of the community can be described best by the simulation model for grasslands of different functional diversities 3 which are the most influencing plant traits and processes regarding functional composition for this we first inversely parameterized field plots consisting of one pft only transferred the parameters to a 4 pft mixture and then tested this model parameterization for field plots of 2 and 3 pft mixtures by a robustness and sensitivity analysis we thereafter identified the impact of plant competition for light and space as well as different plant traits on functional composition 2 1 the model grassmind grassmind is a process oriented grassland model which has the advantage of simulating each single plant on a daily basis since the model includes many detailed processes we describe here only the most relevant processes for our study main processes are the photosynthesis respiration reproduction and mortality of individual plants a detailed description of the grassmind model can be found in taubert et al 2020a taubert et al 2020b and under www formind org downloads note that in this study we assume unlimited water and nitrogen supply for each plant in the model therefore belowground processes in soil such as competition for water and nitrogen are excluded at the individual level plants are established as seedlings and then grow in height and width based on the net primary productivity npp calculated from photosynthesis and respiration individual plants may differ in their traits pft specific model parameters which affect plant growth for example physiological traits that influence photosynthesis are amongst others specific leaf area sla and leaf life span lls plant growth is modeled according to a species specific constant ratio hw of an individual plant s height to its width or lateral extent a mowing event causes all plants to be shortened to a certain height e g to 10 cm while maintaining the width of the plants cut biomass is assumed to be removed subsequently plants grow only in height until the pft specific ratio hw is reached again at the community level plant growth can be limited due to shading by other plants asymmetric competition for light competition for light is modeled implicitly for all plants on a 1 m² plot tall plants shade smaller ones which affects photosynthesis and can reduce growth more precisely the global radiation i 0 is reduced from the top to the floor in height layers 1 cm width taking into account the leaf area l a i i contributed by individual plants in each height layer i monsi and saeki 2005 1 i s i 0 e i s l a i i as a result the global radiation is increasingly attenuated towards the lower end of the plot the plant height determines which height layer s a plant can reach and thus the irradiance the plant can receive we evaluate a plant s light limitation with the light reduction factor r l 1 i s i 0 further influencing factors of plant growth include daily abiotic variables like air temperature global radiation and day length competition for space prevents too many plants growing into a simulated plot this density dependent mortality reduces plant density n number of plants on the plot if community cover exceeds plot area if so the number n c r o w d 1 d of dying plants is 2 n c r o w d n 1 1 c c where c c is the fraction of vegetation cover in the plot ranging between 0 and 1 similarly we assess space limitation by a competition factor r s 1 1 c c generally light competition affects mainly the vertical community structure and space competition the horizontal grassland structure reproduction is modeled by a pft specific seed ingrowth this daily ingrowth encompasses also the constant incoming seed rain from the surrounding landscape simulated seed ingrowth starts from bare ground with the date of sowing the grassland after a pft specific time age rep growing seedlings turn into adult plants some plant characteristics then change for instance the allocation alloc shoot investing partly energy in seed production and the intrinsic mortality rate of plants m seed to m basic mortality of plants is included as stochastic events both mortality processes base mortality and mortality due to space competition select plants at random that die with their biomass being transferred to the litter pool the random selection of dying plants can have a large impact on model results as dead plants disappear immediately for example the death of the highest plant can lead to an immediate drastic decrease in vegetation height if it is by far the only large plant present in the community in contrast the death of a small plant usually does not cause markedly changes in vegetation attributes of a grassland community to account for stochastic effects in our analyses we calculated the average of results over ten simulation runs corresponding to an area of 10 m² see s2 results for effects of larger areas simulation results of the model include daily vegetation attributes we used the community and pft specific aboveground biomass agb by summing up the agb of all plants or the agb of plants belonging to a certain pft leaf area index lai is derived by calculating the leaf area from aboveground total agb and the constant specific leaf area of a plant pft specific model parameter as vegetation height we used the height of the highest plant within the community to obtain green vegetation cover i e coverage by living plant parts the sum of all plants cover was multiplied by the ratio of green lai to total lai 2 2 field data the jena experiment as reference data for our model we used measurements from the jena biodiversity experiment the jena experiment is one of the longest running biodiversity experiments in europe weigelt et al 2010 weisser et al 2017 the main experiment established in 2002 consists of 82 grassland plots 20 20 m² with up to 60 different species roscher et al 2004 it is located near jena germany 50 55 n 11 35 e close to the river saale the climate measurements see sect s1 methods for details show a mean temperature of 9 6 c and a mean annual precipitation of 539 6 mm from 2002 to 2008 the field site was formerly used as arable land and therefore the soil type eutric fluvisol was highly fertilized in recent decades roscher et al 2009 fischer et al 2019 besides two mowing events per year cutting height of 10 cm regular weeding was carried out in spring and summer bi annual field measurements include agb and vegetation cover per species as well as the community lai and vegetation height over seven consecutive years 2002 to 2008 2 3 parameterization of the model species grouping inverse parameterization validation evaluation 2 3 1 species grouping for the parameterization of the model for the jena experiment we used plant functional types pfts roscher et al roscher et al 2004 classified the existing species into four groups based on a multivariate cluster analysis of ecological and morphological traits hence we parameterized four pfts which are trait averaged typical representatives of grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes including typical species occurring in central europe 2 3 2 parameterization we used publicly available data over seven consecutive years 2002 2008 from the jena biodiversity experiment heisse et al 2007 weigelt et al 2010 climate data were taken from two facilities in jena and included daily air temperature irradiance and day length for details on the preparation of the climate data see sect s1 methods the field data was used as follows on each field plot the agb per species above 3 cm height leaf area index lai vegetation height and vegetation cover per species were measured bi annually from 2003 to 2008 and once in 2002 82 plots in total weigelt et al 2010 we grouped the field plots according to their plant functional types grasses g small herbs s tall herb t and legumes l and functional diversity level plots only of one pft g 9 plots s 8 plots t 9 plots or l 8 plots and the 4 pft mixture gstl 16 plots and averaged each vegetation attribute for each measurement date for agb and vegetation cover also pft proportions of each plot were available except for one measurement in 2004 for missing proportions in 2004 we assumed the average agb proportions of all other available agb measurements in the respective plot since weeding or the invasion of unknown species is not considered in our model but is carried out in the field plots we corrected vegetation cover of the target species proportionally i e sum of cover of target species bare ground and dead material excluding weed cover equals 100 the calculated correction factors were also applied to measured agb values to exclude weed agb as a result we obtained one time series for each vegetation attribute of the community and partly pft specific per field plot for each single pft g s t l and the 4 pft plot gstl to parameterize the grassland model grassmind 17 parameters for each pft had to be specified six parameters per pft were taken from field measurements and literature table s1 the remaining parameters were determined by inverse parameterization table s1 the inverse parameterization of the grassland model comprised two steps fig s1 first we inversely parameterized each pft separately in 1 pft plots g s t l second we combined these four estimated parameter sets in the mixture of four pfts gstl and corrected only one parameter per pft i e the ingrowth of seeds n seed by inverse parameterization the corrected values of n seed were then also used in the parameter sets of 1 pft plots first step when comparing simulation results and field measurements as reference data for the inverse parameterization we used the measured vegetation attributes for measurement dates see sect s1 methods a simulation run was performed over all seven years 2002 to 2008 and began on the day the field experiment was sown in the field 11 to 16 may 2002 weisser et al 2017 in the model 16 may 2002 mowing height and mowing dates in the model correspond to those of the experiment for exact dates see sect s1 methods for further details on the parameterization validation and evaluation see sect s1 methods 2 3 3 robustness analysis the advantage of process based models is the possibility to switch on or off different processes in this way it is possible to analyze the effects of certain processes on model results each process alone as well as their interaction ellner et al 2019 in this study the role of competition for light and space has been analyzed for this the model s starting conditions settings and parameter values remained similar to those used in the parameterization then in addition to the standard run in which competition for light and space was switched on we performed a a mode where competition for light was switched off and competition for space remained activated b a mode where competition for space was switched off and competition for light remained activated and c a mode where both competition processes were not activated thereby switching off space competition means that plants do no longer die because of limited space on a plot n c r o w d 0 for all time steps see eq 2 thus plants can unlimitedly overlap which in turn causes an increase in light competition on the other site switching off light competition means that plants do not shade each other anymore hence small plants that grow below taller ones also receive the full daily global radiation so their photosynthesis is not limited due to reduced light availability i s i 0 for all height layers s and time steps see eq 1 this can cause an increase of space competition as plants grow faster to compare the different modes and detect which process has a high influence on the vegetation dynamics we analyzed changes in the simulated vegetation attributes for the calculation of plant density number of plants per m² mean values were taken over the measurement dates of agb see sect s1 methods 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of various model parameters for this the morris method allowed to investigate the effect of changes in a plant trait on simulated vegetation attributes for details see sect s1 methods morris 1991 3 results we analyzed vegetation attributes within the measured field plots and compared them with our simulations afterwards results of the robustness and sensitivity analysis are shown 3 1 field data description measured vegetation attributes showed large differences between the 1 pft plots fig 1 a legumes were the most productive with on average twice as much aboveground biomass agb and a 50 higher leaf area index lai but only slightly higher vegetation height and vegetation cover compared to grasses grasses had the second highest productivity however they were comparable to tall herbs for agb and lai and differed with regard to a larger height and a smaller degree of vegetation cover than tall herbs small herbs showed the lowest values their agb was only one fourth of legumes agb the grassland with four pfts was on average less productive than plots of only legumes average agb of approx 370 g m² per measurement in 4 pft mixture compared to the average agb of approx 385 g m² in legume plots vegetation height and lai were similar to those of the legume plot but cover of green leaves was higher in the mixture plot within the mixture legumes were the dominant pft with the highest biomass proportion 41 vegetation cover was similar between 1 pft plots 70 to 81 as well as within the pft proportions of the 4 pft mixture 20 to 24 per pft variation of agb between plots consisting of different species and richness levels was low in plots of small herbs and high in plots of legumes fig s2 3 2 simulation results the grassland model could well reproduce the field measurements simulation and field measurements agreed in all vegetation attributes for each 1 pft plot averaged over time fig 1b simulated agb average over 13 time points deviated by a maximum of 6 from mean measurements within the 1 pft plots agb of the 4 pft mixture was underestimated by 19 in the model like in the field simulated legumes were the most productive 1 pft plot and dominate in the mixture although they showed a total biomass of only 2 below the measurement in the field mixture 150 g m² legumes in the simulations were much stronger than other pfts agb proportion compared to the observations 50 in the simulation to 41 in the measurements agb of other pfts was underestimated in the simulated mixture up to 54 less agb than in observations the range of temporal variations of vegetation attributes in the simulation was mostly similar to the measured range of temporal variations fig 1a b time series of vegetation attributes were also in good agreement between simulations and field measurements figs 1c and s2 surprisingly both showed nearly equal temporal patterns for each vegetation attribute although only the total sum over seven years was used for model calibration figs s2 s3 overall simulated vegetation cover and lai showed small deviations from field measurements average deviation of 6 each with respect to mean community attributes over all measurements averaged nrmse 0 16 vegetation cover averaged nrmse 0 52 lai fig 1 table s3 validation of the parameterized grassland model was done by using independent data on grassland plots consisting of two and three pfts all simulated grasslands resulted in a slight to moderate underestimation and only one 2 pft mixture small herbs and legumes showed an overestimation of agb in the simulation results fig s4a again legumes were often dominant with high agb proportion in the simulated and measured mixtures and were partly overestimated by the model in two of the five mixtures in which legumes occurred fig s4b the validation analysis revealed that vegetation cover was the best fitted attribute of the simulation model 10 3 deviation on average over all measurements and plots though vegetation height was estimated slightly better in total than lai 14 4 and 14 5 deviation see also table s4 for statistical measures including each measurement 3 3 relationships to plant functional type richness for our analyses we used averaged measured vegetation attributes over the years 2002 to 2008 by doing this we found a higher productivity in plots of legumes than in functional mixtures which at first sight seems to contradict previous studies marquard et al 2009b however by calculating annual averages of all plots with a certain number of pfts one to four we received a similar relationship in the simulations the community agb increased with higher pft richness fig s5a our simulations reproduced this gradient well but with a smaller slope fig s5a furthermore annual averages of lai also increased with pft richness but opposite trends were detected for vegetation height and vegetation cover fig s5b d 3 4 mean relative yield mean relative plant biomass and mean relative plant density we compared simulated agb in grasslands of one pft with its proportion in all mixtures of 2 to 4 pfts defined as mean relative yield ryi grasses and small herbs showed on average underyielding ryi 1 e g ryi 0 6 for grasses while tall herbs and legumes produced proportionally more agb in mixtures ryi 1 e g ryi 1 2 for tall herbs table s5 furthermore legumes were the only plants that increased on average in mean plant biomass agb per plant and simultaneously in mean plant density number of plants per m² considering all mixtures rbi 1 and rdi 1 similarly calculated as ryi table s5 a stronger decrease of plant density e g a lower rdi from 1 pft plots to mixtures while having a high ryi could be compensated by an increase in plant biomass rbi and thus the establishment of taller plants as is the case for tall herbs rdi 0 5 rbi 3 4 pfts with taller plants and larger plant agb were more likely to shade other plants also of other pfts which in turn could suffer from a lower light availability 3 5 impact of light and space competition on productivity and functional composition to understand the importance of different processes for plant growth in plots consisting of one and four pfts the model could be used to analyze the impact of competition for light and space between plants overall both processes affected productivity but in different directions and dimensions within the plots competition for space caused much stronger changes in vegetation attributes than competition for light between plots of one pft vegetation attributes were changed to different extents and with different causes by competition fig 2 a in terms of agb and vegetation cover small herbs and legumes changed most whereas for vegetation height tall herbs were the most sensitive to space limitation less agb and vegetation height with no light competition fig 2a was caused by an increased density of smaller plants due to an increased mortality of few larger plants and thus higher vegetation cover no space competition caused opposing effects in vegetation height whose decrease e g in grasses was the result of slower plant growth due to permanently strong light competition an increase in vegetation height was related to a much lower plant density so that only a few tall plants survived suffering less from light competition this was observed for tall herbs which indicated space competition to be the dominant process limiting their growth changes in the analyzed competition factors supported that competition for space is dominant in plots of grasses tall herbs and legumes whereas competition for light is dominant in plots of small herbs and the 4 pft mixture for details see s2 results and fig s6 in grasslands with four pfts switching off light competition led to an agb decrease of about 6 whereas no space competition between plants resulted in almost 40 times higher values the other four attributes lai vegetation height and green cover plant density were similarly affected fig s7 within the mixture changes of all vegetation attributes were mainly driven by changes of legumes attributes interestingly only the height of legumes increased immensely when space competition was switched off while that of grasses small herbs and tall herbs decreased fig 2b this indicated that legumes prevent the growth of other pfts and space competition made them less competitive however although competition for light and space reduced the growth of legumes and partially increased the productivity of other pfts the proportion of legumes always remained by far the highest 50 with no light competition and 85 with no space competition 3 6 impact of plant traits on productivity and functional composition plant traits with most impact on vegetation attributes were identified by a sensitivity analysis see methods for details for 1 pft plots two geometric plant traits height width ratio of plants hw and specific leaf area sla two physiological traits light extinction coefficient k and slope of the light response curve α and one demographic trait mortality of seedlings m seed caused the largest absolute changes in agb fig s6a higher values of hw and α resulted clearly in an increase of biomass whereas higher values of m seed and k resulted in a decrease fig 3 a the effect of these parameters on the simulation results was linear and additive large mean and low standard deviation of elementary effect lying outside the wedge of gray lines in the figure morris 1991 ruano et al 2011 on the other hand a higher sla could lead to higher or lower agb values on average negative because of interactions with other plant parameters or due to nonlinear effects to find out which traits affect the dominance of legumes we varied trait parameters of legumes in the 4 pft mixture two physiological traits k and α one demographic m seed and one geometric trait hw belonged to the most influential traits of legumes concerning their agb proportion fig s6b now instead of sla two further demographic legume traits seed ingrowth n seed and germination rate of seeds germ were also relevant the parameters k α m seed and hw affected change in agb of legumes similarly except for hw whose higher values led in the mixture to a reduced agb of legumes fig 3b the agb of small herbs was least affected by changes in legume traits low elementary effect fig 3b the reduced agb of legumes due to its increased trait values of m seed and hw increased agb of the other pfts with α n seed and germ contrary results were observed increased trait values of legumes led to more agb of legumes and to less agb of the other pfts the legume trait k had the weakest effect on the other pfts an increased value only led to a slightly higher agb for grasses and small herbs and to a slightly lower agb for tall herbs the analysis outlined diverse effects of traits on agb of the different pfts higher values of hw α sla and germ and lower values of m seed and k strengthened generally the productivity in plots of one pft and weakened in the 4 pft mixture the productivity of pfts other than legumes due to increased competition in turn n seed only made legumes more competitive in the 4 pft mixture but did not considerably affect the productivity of 1 pft plots despite the clear trend for the above mentioned parameters except for sla see methods and fig 3 for almost none of the traits the mean elementary effect μ of a varied trait on agb equaled the absolute mean elementary effect μ this means that changes in trait parameter values in one direction increased or decreased the agb depending on values of other parameters 4 discussion by using field measurements from a local biodiversity experiment we showed that it is possible to simulate the growth and dynamics of grasslands with an individual based model we were able to cover four different vegetation attributes aboveground biomass agb in total and per pft and vegetation cover in total and per pft as well as vegetation height and leaf area index lai model results revealed good fits compared to field measurements for plots of one pft but showed an underestimation of vegetation attributes in mixtures 2 to 4 pfts nevertheless simulations also reproduced the observed positive relationship between productivity and pft richness annual dynamics of vegetation attributes matched well those measured in the field although only mean vegetation attributes over all years were used for calibration fig s2 the parameterized grassland model enabled us to analyze the relative importance of specific processes and plant traits on the functional composition in grasslands competition for space had a much stronger impact on grassland agb than competition for light increasing space competition led to a decreasing proportion of legumes and increased grasses small herbs and tall herbs nevertheless legumes always remained the dominant pft a global sensitivity analysis revealed key trait parameters of different processes geometry productivity and reproduction of plants with high influence on agb in grasslands some traits differed in their sensitivity between plots of one pft with only intraspecific interactions between plants and more pfts with additional interspecific interactions between plants some traits had a high impact on functional composition by generally increasing the growth of plants while other traits made a pft more competitive through advantages in demographic processes 4 1 understanding the functional composition trait and process influences in the model with a sensitivity analysis we obtained information on relevant plant traits that influence agb and functional composition a global sensitivity analysis enables to detect global trends nonlinearity and interactions with other trait parameters in contrast to a local sensitivity analysis for which changes of only one parameter are analyzed locally changing one trait parameter can have opposite effects depending on the strengths of other processes for example if plants grow more in height than in width it can result in more community agb as there is more space for other plants at the same time however larger plants increase light competition this affects not only the growth of smaller plants through shading but also the productivity of the plant itself through stronger self shading thus a global sensitivity analysis allowed us to explore in the case of two interacting processes which one is dominating when varying one specific trait the robustness analysis indicated that different processes dominated with respect to plant growth and interactions competition for light and space affected the pfts differently e g largest impacts on agb of dominant legumes in the mixture by the analysis of mean relative yield mean plant biomass and mean plant density the individual based model further allowed us to understand the mechanisms that led to the strength of legumes in mixtures extended model analysis on the trait variation of all four pfts at the same time might reveal additional insights on the competitive advantages of each pft in comparison to the other ones in the mixture 4 2 comparison to field study results plant densities and plant sizes plant density the number of plants per m² and mean biomass per plant for each pft have many similarities when comparing our simulation results to those from field measurements of the jena experiment marquard et al 2009a in the field tall herbs generally produced large but few plants while grasses produced small but numerous plants which is consistent with our model results table s5 marquard et al 2009a revealed that legumes were often among the overyielding species and grasses tend to underyield in mixtures which is also visible in our model results table s5 additionally the discussed linkage between mean relative yield and mean relative density if ryi 1 then rdi 1 as well as between mean relative yield and mean relative size if ryi 1 then rbi 1 marquard et al 2009a can be observed also in our simulation results with the exception of tall herbs showing a ryi 1 2 and a rdi 0 5 table s5 an additional result of marquard et al 2009a has been that grassland biomass is positively related to plant density and to agb per plant and plant agb increases with plant density in our simulation we obtained similar trends fig s9 in the study of marquard et al 2009a plant density ranged approx between 100 and 10 000 plants per m² and plant agb ranged between about 0 1 g and 10 g plots of different species richness measured in may 2006 whereas our simulations showed a narrower range 100 to 500 plants per m² and 0 3 g to 2 2 g per plant mean values over dates of agb measurement see sect s1 methods we found further similarities of our simulations with an independent field study investigating life spans of plants of different pfts lauenroth and adler 2008 for details see sect s2 results 4 3 limitations of individual based grassland models possible enhancements and perspectives in this study we demonstrated that an individual based grassland model is able to simulate aggregated measured vegetation dynamics by including only a few abiotic variables daily air temperature irradiance and day length competition between plants focused on aboveground resources like light and space as we excluded information on precipitation and plant soil interactions we assumed sufficient water supply due to the field experiment s closeness to a river and sufficient nitrogen availability due to former land use roscher et al 2009 fischer et al 2019 strikingly competition for light and space was sufficient to reproduce not only measured vegetation dynamics but also the positive relationship between functional richness and productivity and its variation within each diversity level with a less pronounced slope in the model compared to observations fig s5 at other sites however soil resource dynamics might influence community structure and functional composition stronger spehn et al 2002 pirhofer walzl et al 2012 fay et al 2015 in this case it is possible to couple grassland models with established soil models e g daycent parton et al 1998 although the vegetation attributes in plots of 1 pft can be reproduced accurately by the model larger deviations occur in the mixtures of different pfts figs 1 s2 this can be due to different reasons for example species specific influence of air temperature on plant productivity fig s5 or trait plasticity is currently not included in the model however plants could change their growth strategies and thus their traits in response to management climate interactions with other plants and plant age abakumova et al 2016 lipowsky et al 2015 valladares et al 2007 further analyses and development in the modeling of interaction processes and their parameterization can provide additional insights but also require specific measurements and experiments as well as suitable measures to compare them with individual based models e g measures describing the strengths of interaction and competition between plants burns and strauss 2012 kraft et al 2015 with regard to the approach of grouping species to plant functional types we were able to aggregate field observations to average plots of the assigned pft derived attributes can thus be interpreted as dominant traits of the pft species richness and composition as well as intraspecific trait variation within pfts can also impact community productivity and functional composition marquard et al 2009a 2009b moulin et al 2018 tilman et al 1997 buchmann et al 2018 combining trait distributions and grassland modeling allows to add trait variation to pfts based on our sensitivity analysis parameters with low influence such as seed biomass or leaf life span could remain constant at an average value while only trait parameters with higher influence on vegetation attributes could be varied among plants e g by adding random fluctuations to traits of new seedlings by this not only interspecific diversity but also intraspecific diversity within the community e g crawford et al 2019 which includes phenotypic and genetic variation wellstein et al 2013 garnier et al 2007 could be considered thereby plants could adapt to changing environmental conditions due to higher mortality of individuals with poor suitability which can enable to analyze intraspecific trait environment relationships within habitats the use of a process oriented model allows to investigate the influence of additional factors on vegetation dynamics for instance mowing frequencies or air temperature could be varied in order to conduct theoretical experiments that may not be feasible in the field völler et al 2017 gilhaus et al 2017 although field sites can differ in environmental factors models provide the opportunity to analyze their effects separately and jointly and in different intensities in addition models enable to analyze underlying processes structuring communities which are difficult to measure experimentally such as the importance of competition for light versus space field measurements on the light climate and leaf area density in distinct height layers in a grassland mixture as well as mean characteristics of different pfts could support such a model based analysis such studies can build a first step towards deriving parameterizations that are regionally transferable for this abiotic factors such as climate and soil and also management regimes differ regionally while traits of pfts should remain unchanged however it is still an open question whether feedbacks between environmental changes and species traits need to be considered field experiments can support such future model developments at the same time confronting different modeling approaches with similar research questions can enable to identify decisive mechanistic processes model strengths and model weaknesses then in turn models can provide suggestions and recommendations for future field experiments as well as for the management or conservation of grassland communities 5 conclusions in summary our results show that an individual based and process oriented simulation model can reproduce aggregated dynamics of four vegetation attributes in grasslands not only the dynamics of plots along a gradient of functional diversity with plant functional types of grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes can be simulated but also the positive effect of functional richness on grassland productivity model analyses showed that competition for space has a stronger influence on functional composition than competition for light moreover we identified specific traits that can make a plant functional type more productive and more competitive in mixtures the methods and analyses shown represent a promising step for the development of grassland models and how to apply them to complement field experiments data availability the data of the jena experiment used for the calibration can be obtained from http esapubs org
