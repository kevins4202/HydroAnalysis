6995,flood modelling in data sparse regions have been always limited to empirical statistical or geomorphic approaches that are suitable to produce regional hazard maps such coarse resolution maps are not adapted for basin scale applications small to medium sized basins 1000 km2 especially when detailed estimates of flows and water levels of a particular event is required and hence cannot replace the hydrological hydraulic modelling the latter is a challenging task in data sparse regions characterized by floods of typical duration times of a few hours which offer little opportunity for real time recording by traditional rain gauge networks remote sensing or satellite imaging such data sparseness is not always compatible with the resolution in both space and time of the hydrological and hydraulic models we propose a framework for flood modelling using sparse data from a coupled hydrological hydraulic model constrained by past storm events and post event measurements in space the approach is applied to the awali river basin 301 km2 in lebanon particularly to simulate the investigated early january 2013 extreme flood event which is considered one of the largest events in the last three decades the hydrological model was calibrated and evaluated with 12 past storm events aiming at defining narrow parameter ranges and uncertainty was performed with monte carlo simulations for these parameter ranges the hydraulic model based on a fine resolution dem was simulated using hydrological outflows and validated with 27 post event measurements in space of high water marks the resulting outflow values were satisfactory and uncertainty was reduced when compared with arbitrarily wide parameter ranges the hydrological model performance was highly variable but for the hydraulic model 93 of the observed water levels fall within the simulated uncertainty bounds with an rmse error of 0 26 m the proposed framework allows mapping the possible inundation and can be compared to

other natural disasters unisdr cred 2015 with the climate change who 2002 jonkman 2005 urbanization growth and land use change especially in flood prone areas the frequency and severity of floods is increasing at an alarming rate unisdr 2002 hence developing more accurate flood modelling tools to better understand and mitigate floods has become a global endeavour flood modelling applications in data sparse regions were always limited to uncertain probabilistic estimates of rainfall flood flows and water levels based on empirical e g koutroulis and tsanis 2010 statistical e g castellarin 2007 castellarin et al 2009 or geomorphic approaches e g manfreda et al 2014 such applications are useful for regional flood analysis such as national hazard maps that are mainly of coarse resolution and are not adapted for small to medium size basins 1000 km2 generally for basin scale applications and when more detailed understanding of a particular flood event is required and when the study area is relatively small such regional maps cannot do the favour especially when detailed estimates of flows and water levels are required and hence cannot replace the hydrological hydraulic modelling reliable information on the flood peak discharge gaume et al 2009 water levels saleh et al 2013 domeneghetti 2016 and the flood inundation extent merwade et al 2008 are among the major parameters required in any flood problem and flood modelling represents a way to obtain such information bates 2004 moussa and bocquillon 2009 it classically requires a coupling between a hydrologic model to simulate the rainfall runoff transformation along hill shades and estimate peak flood flows and a hydraulic model to simulate the propagation of flood wave along the river channel and establish the corresponding water levels along with terrain analysis to extract the flood inundation area dimitriadis et al 2016 model coupling has been applied by several authors in literature on relatively well gauged basins see for example knebl et al 2005 montanari et al 2009 lerat et al 2012 however when data are uncertain and too sparse to meet model requirements and when model coupling is required the question arises as to whether there is an opportunity to constrain the hydrological hydraulic model to simulate extreme floods and establish water levels that can be useful for flood assessment and mitigation worldwide the majority of river basins are either ungauged or poorly gauged and in some cases facing deterioration of the available measurement networks sivapalan et al 2003 efstratiadis et al 2014 in a broader classification most of the basins in the world and especially in developing countries are denoted as data sparse basins where reliable information on the characteristics and on the spatial and temporal coverage of extreme flood events are rare or inexistent see for example wilby and yu 2013 jarihani et al 2015 komi et al 2017 classical and sparse data are differentiated in table 1 data sparseness is often referred to measurements of limited spatiotemporal resolution point measurements of coarse time step and series with gaps or parameters that have not been collected during simultaneous periods samaniego et al 2011 mascaro et al 2013 some also add that such data may not be available in the period of interest or are of poor quality or unknown accuracy and the hydro meteorological network is of very low density that makes interpolation procedures or filling methods impossible satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 switzman et al 2015 in addition others point out to when detailed channel bed and topography information are coarse or unavailable neal et al 2012 in the mediterranean region data requirement is particularly acute because most floods occur on a short duration typically a portion of the day and are mainly generated by high intensity short duration localized rainfall events moussa and chahinian 2009 these floods characterized by response times often less than 2 h and typically occurring in catchments of drainage area not exceeding 1000 km2 borga et al 2008 can difficultly be captured even by the traditional rain gauge networks norbiato et al 2007 lumbroso and gaume 2012 in addition impossible direct current meter measurements of the flood peak discharge fukami et al 2008 coarse time step of measurements often skipping the peak conditions common failure of river stage gauge flood water exceeding the gauge measurement level resulting in underestimation of the peak discharge koutroulis and tsanis 2010 are common weaknesses that lead to poorly defined rating curves during floods maybe more than in other regions the specific rainfall and discharge data requirements result in classifying the mediterranean region as data sparse region when information on the flood event characteristics catchment hydrological characteristics and river channel characteristics are sparse or lacking interesting information can be inferred from recorded past storm events post event field investigations newspapers and social media reports and from crowdsourcing of information from local citizens on flood events characteristics whenever available from the hydrological modelling perspective past storm events can be extracted from the available simultaneous rainfall and flow data measurements these are often used in literature to estimate and calibrate the unknown model parameters see for example sangati et al 2009 massari et al 2014 however when past storm events data used for calibration are uncertain or does not meet model requirements bias and uncertainty arise in model predictions pappenberger et al 2008 additionally the calibration procedure may induce equifinality when input data and calibration equally fit the sparse validation data the latter can be raised through analysing the uncertainty propagation aronica et al 2002 a good understanding of the uncertainty associated with various parameters inherent in modelling is a critical requirement merwade et al 2008 accordingly when all relevant uncertainties are taken into consideration optimal decisions are to be expected apel et al 2008 domeneghetti et al 2013 from the hydraulic modelling perspective detailed post event surveys in space based on traces left by water and sediments provide a good opportunity when systematic water level and flow measurements are lacking horritt and bates 2002 borga et al 2008 surveyed channel cross sections and flood marks can be used in estimating the peak flood discharge gaume 2006 pictures and videos taken by witnesses during the flood event are interesting in highlighting affected areas and in understanding the events characteristics such as the flood duration flow type and velocity at the time of capturing le boursicaud et al 2016 fuentes andino et al 2017 field surveys and witnesses interviews can provide additional information such as the time of peak water levels and flood extent gaume and borga 2008 post event measurements have been used to validate the results of the hydraulic models several times in literature see for example hervouet 2000 romanowicz and beven 2003 horritt et al 2010 newspaper and social media information on storm events and floods is an interesting well available data source providing an opportunity to understand some of the events characteristics such information has been used several times in literature to search for historical flood events barredo 2007 develop a flood database and inventories barnolas and llasat 2007 llasat et al 2009 understand the flood regime changes hall et al 2014 support the hydrologic and hydraulic modelling of the flood events papaioannou et al 2016 evaluate flood risk llasat et al 2010 abdallah and hdeib 2015 and understand the socio economic impacts of floods lastoria et al 2006 moreover crowdsourced information from local citizens on flood events is now gaining favour and is facilitated by the wide spread of low cost monitoring technology and communication systems lowry and fienen 2013 montanari et al 2013 mazzoleni et al 2017 all these data sources can give information on the flood characteristics such as the affected areas the rainfall event characteristics depth intensity and duration timing of the flood event duration and time of peak possible flood depth and inundation area extent severity and recorded damages in this article we hypothesise that there is an opportunity to model flood events based on constraining a hydrological hydraulic model with sparse data discontinuous in space and time the focal point is the proposed modelling framework that involves the hydrologic model hec hms usace 2000 combined with the 1 d hydraulic model hec ras usace 2016 along with models calibration and evaluation with past storm events and flood post event measurements including uncertainty calculation based on monte carlo simulation the framework is tested and discussed through its application on a challenging study site of the eastern mediterranean awali catchment in lebanon the structure of the paper is as follows the first section describes the geographical and hydrological characteristics of the study site along with the sparse collected datasets the second section presents the proposed modelling framework with the hydrologic the hydraulic models outlines the parameterization strategy and the corresponding evaluation procedures finally the major results of the models processing and calibration are given and discussed through several challenges including the model coupling approach the reliability of the observational data and uncertainty propagation the post event measurements and their use in constraining the model 2 study site 2 1 geographical dataset the awali river basin is one of the coastal eastern mediterranean catchments located in southern lebanon covering an area of 301 km2 the river is one of the major lebanese perennial rivers witnessing floods every other year abdallah et al 2013 it is 48 km long originating from the barouk mountain at an altitude reaching 1 492 m and eventually flowing through the western face of mount lebanon and into the mediterranean sea the study area of the hydrological model was the whole catchment area divided into nine sub catchments whereas it was the lower main course of the river approximately 5 km of river length for the hydraulic model which is experiencing flooding after heavy rainfall events fig 1 the catchment has a rapidly varied topography ranging from elevated areas of mount lebanon 1950 m asl running parallel to the coast and characterized by a continuous snow cover during winter to flat plains along the low coastal area primarily utilized for agricultural purposes it is characterized by steep slopes which converge towards a valley where the awali river flows the lithology of the catchment covers a sequence from the middle jurassic rocks to the recent quaternary deposits the surface is mainly composed of the cenomanian sannine limestone formation c4 which consists of well stratified fractured interbedded limestones dolomites and marls dubertret 1945 the watershed underlies several aquifer formations including the high central lebanon cretaceous the kesrouan jurassic and the batroun jounieh cretaceous these aquifers are separated by unproductive formations leptosols is the dominant soil class in the catchment covering almost 64 of the total area the recent soil map of lebanon classified per the fao unesco legend world reference base for soil resources and the american soil taxonomy darwish et al 2006 was used to generate the hydrological soil groups hsg abdallah et al 2013 the catchment has a varied land use wooded lands and grasslands are dominant covering 46 5 and 26 8 of the total area respectively whereas agricultural areas and artificial urban areas cover 18 2 and 7 2 respectively lncsr lmoa 2010 the average basin slope in the b1 b2 b3 and b4 sub catchments is 33 6 33 3 29 9 29 3 respectively fig 2 detailed river and floodplain geometry was extracted from a fine resolution digital elevation model of 10 cm resolution generated for the purpose of this work several drone photography surveys covering the whole floodplain were performed to capture around 5000 raw images acquired in strips with adjacent photographs having an overlap of 80 in the flight direction and 70 between parallel flight tracks these images were then processed using the pix4dmapper software to generate the high resolution dem based on the criteria described by the american society of photogrammetry and remote sensing asprs 2004 the criteria involved identifying and filtering all above ground features to remove false blockages to flow such as bridges critical features influencing the flow of water such as walls and building were retained additionally the topography of the entire basin was available from a 10 m digital elevation model dem developed by the lebanese national center for remote sensing cnrs rs the latter was used to delineate the boundaries of the awali basin extract the corresponding stream network and estimate the basin s hydrological characteristics for the hydrological modelling part 2 2 hydrological dataset 2 2 1 rainfall the catchment has a mediterranean climate it receives its majority of mean annual rainfall of 1067 mm during the wet fall winter period extending from november to april with little or no rain between june and august the mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 and 700 mm along the coast and 1300 1400 mm over the mountains plassard 1972 daily rainfall measurements were obtained from seven meteorological stations operated by the lebanese national meteorological services lnms table 2 fig 1 these stations were recently established after the lebanese civil war 1975 1990 during which most of the stations ceased their operation and have however started recording since 1996 the number and distribution of rainfall stations of density around 130 km2 per rain gauge is considered satisfactory for the basin area following the wmo requirements of recommended minimum densities of stations early january 2013 a harsh winter storm lashed the eastern mediterranean coast with snow high winds and heavy rains flooding caused by torrential rains was recorded in several parts of the region including turkey syria lebanon and jordan noaa 2013 in lebanon the storm lasted for 6 days 5th 10th january and 277 mm total rainfall of 50 years return period was recorded leaving behind one of the largest floods in the last 25 years hourly rainfall records for the jan2013 storm are available from baysour meteo station p10 2 2 2 discharge two permanent limnigraphic gauge stations operated by the lebanese litani river authority lra take continuous hourly or 15 min measurements of surface water levels the marj bisri gauge station g 473 monitors the flow upstream along the bisri river and the saida gauge g 475 monitors the flow at 800 m upstream of the catchment s outlet on the mediterranean sea see fig 2 the average annual yield for the basin at g 475 is approximately 347 mm3 out of which 85 occurring during the winter stream flow is normally highest in february and lowest in september with an average daily flow of 11 m3 s table 3 flow data are also obtained through periodical field point flow measurements that are used to obtain a rough estimate of the monthly river flow volumes and calibrate the river rating curves due to the limited resources of the lra the shortage in the frequency of the direct field measurement leads to mis calibration of the rating curves 2 2 3 past storm events twelve past storm events occurring before the jan2013 flood event of simultaneous daily rainfall measurements and hourly water levels are used for model calibration hourly or 15 min water level records were transferred into flow hydrographs for the selected storm events based on the established rating curves among the selected events three have information on both gauges in saida and marj bisri and the rest nine events have only information on downstream saida gauge these events were derived from the period extending from 2000 till 2012 in which we consider no major changes on the characteristic of the river have occurred and the hydrometeorological network is the same one operating at the time of the flood these events vary in intensity of daily rainfall varying between 24 and 199 mm peak flow varying between 15 and 247 m3 s and duration varying between 1 and 7 days the selected events are the only clearly gauged and consistent for simulation events table 4 2 3 the january 2013 flood dataset the event of 07 january 2013 is one of the largest floods occurring in the last 25 years the post event measurements pictures videos and local witnesses makes this event interesting to assess the robustness of the proposed framework in reproducing flood events of no hydrometric measurements the presence of both hourly and daily rainfall measurements in addition to social media information on the duration of the storm event is also an added value 2 3 1 the flood magnitude on 6th of january 2013 at around 13 00 the intensity of light precipitation that lasted for several hours on the previous day started to increase reaching a maximum of 17 3 mm h at around 20 00 on the second day 7th of january at around 05 00 06 00 the awali river level rose and flooded in several locations along the coastal plains and in the middle marj bisri plain the downstream river gauge g 475 was subjected to failure by flood waters the flood left behind great damages to agricultural lands and green houses several cars and roadside walls were damaged causing massive traffic jams schools were obliged to close for three days 8th 10th january abdallah et al 2013 2 3 2 post event measurements field investigations of the jan2013 flood marks were performed two months after the flood event after which newspaper information local witnesses declarations and social media reports were analyzed at the time of the flood the post event field surveys were carried out to collect ground control and survey river cross sections measure water level traces that were still identified and estimate the peak discharge values identify hotspots and measure extent of floodplains interview locals who have witnessed the flood event and could support the authors not only by information but in many instances by photos and recorded videos collected photos and videos enabled to highlight some flood prone areas that were further investigated through field surveys to measure water levels a total of 57 post event points scattered in space were surveyed out of which 27 are measurements of high water marks fig 3 2 4 the sparse dataset in conclusion our data sparse region is a region characterised by data summarized in table 5 in the following form 1 past recorded storm events of daily rainfall measurements from ground rainfall gauges incapable of reflecting the rainfall intensity and spatial variability during the storm event hourly or 15 min water level measurements by two traditional river stage gauges mostly non functional during flood events and hourly or 15 min flow hydrographs extracted based on poorly defined rating curves 2 descriptive social media information on the past storm events related to the duration and spatial variability of the rainfall during the storm 3 a recent extreme flood event but destructed river stage gauge with daily and hourly rainfall measurements in one nearby rainfall station and post event measurements of peak flood discharge and high water marks 4 descriptive information from newspapers social media and field investigations on the extreme flood event related to the inundated areas time of flood peak duration of the storm and its spatial variability 3 the modelling framework 3 1 hydrological model hydrological rainfall runoff models vary in their complexity from simple lumped models to semi distributed and fully distributed models regardless that fully distributed models are capable of better representing the hydrological processes several difficulties arise when applying them in data sparse regions because of their complexity data requirements and parameter identifiability which may limit their efficiency and adequacy lerat et al 2012 however when sparse data is available semi distributed rainfall runoff models are still efficient alternatives thereof a semi distributed model based on the scs cn method for computing losses along with muskingum cunge and scs unit hydrograph methods for routing flow along channels and hillslopes were respectively selected the model was integrated within the hec hms software the modelling time step was equal to 30 min smaller than the sub basins estimated time of concentration to ensure that the flood peak is well captured by the model evapotranspiration losses were neglected based on the assumption that the evapotranspiration volume generated during a winter storm event is negligible compared to the runoff volume generated as demonstrated by knebl et al 2005 the baseflow in the model was estimated from the available water level records the induced flow by the hydropower production plants was estimated based on collected schedules of average monthly water flow in the facilities 1994 2015 rainfall runoff simulation of several events was then conducted for the whole catchment 301 km2 in a semi distributed approach over sub catchment units the simple scs curve number loss model scs 1972 was applied because it allows the estimation of direct surface runoff volume for given rainstorms based on a single parameter curve number which represents the basin s infiltration storage d asaro and grillone 2010 initial rough cn ranges are assigned for each sub catchment based on the knowledge of the land use and hsg combinations extracted from available information rainfall amounts calculated 5 days before each storm event reflect moderate soil moisture conditions of typical winter days in lebanon accordingly cn values fall within the average soil moisture conditions amcii 3 2 hydraulic model the 1d hec ras model was used to establish the water surface profiles this model was selected because it is a well known open software widely applied for hydraulic modelling it is usually combined with the hec hms and known for its low computational costs the hydraulic model is applied to the low main part of the river approximately 5 km of river length mostly subjected to flooding cross sections are performed at the gauge locations at locations of considerable changes in flow morphology slope geometry and roughness and at representative locations such as sub basins outlet of the hydrological model that serve as boundary conditions for the hydraulic model the centreline was traced together with the river banks based on the captured high resolution drone images the geometry of the river and floodplain is extracted from the fine resolution dem the results of the hydrological model are imported into the hydraulic model roughness values are initially estimated based on expert knowledge of channel properties these values are later manually calibrated by a trial and error approach to maximize the fit between the simulated water levels and the observed ones at arbitrarily selected post event locations on the river channel 3 3 modelling framework the modelling framework is divided into three major steps fig 4 step 1 involves performing the rainfall runoff modelling through hec hms software for selected past storm events parameters to be calibrated are selected based on the model sensitivity analysis model calibration and evaluation is performed aiming at defining a narrow range of model parameters which is taken equal to the estimated range from the calibration step 2 involves an uncertainty analysis based on the monte carlo sampling of model parameters within the narrow ranges estimated in step 1 the hydrological model is then run to simulate the hydrograph set of the jan2013 extreme event step 3 involves the hydraulic model simulation hec ras for the jan2013 flood event based on the hydrograph set obtained in step 2 to generate the respective water surface profiles post processing and terrain analysis to interpolate the water levels and extract the inundation area and flood map validation by the post event measurements a preliminary analysis was performed this includes the catchment and sub catchment delineation extraction of their characteristics and parameters and defining rough initial values of model parameters based on our knowledge of the basin s characteristics 3 3 1 hydrological model calibration and evaluation unlike classical calibration approaches that end up in a deterministic set of model parameters the calibration procedure herein is applied aiming at defining a narrow range of model parameters for uncertainty sampling this range is taken equal to the estimated range from the calibration the estimated parameter ranges are quite narrower than the wide feasible parameter ranges often defined in classical uncertainty analysis studies e g freer et al 1996 huang and liang 2006 which are often chosen arbitrarily or on a basis of physical argument to be wider than those expected for the catchment under study available and simultaneous rainfall and water level measurements are analysed to extract past storm events of reliable information it is preferable to select storm events of variable intensity and duration and occurring in different time of the year daily rainfall measurements were discretized uniformly into hourly measurements however this mostly applicable for floods of long duration and not flash floods indeed several other possible rainfall distributions can be applied and analyzed and may yield more accurate estimates of hourly rainfall depths in this study we choose the simplest approach uniform rainfall as a preliminary analysis in some cases additional information was obtained from social media reports and newspapers on the time period of occurrence of the maximum rainfall which is mainly a portion of the day in these cases recorded rainfall measurements at that day are discretized into hourly measurements uniformly over the period of occurrence of the maximum rainfall e g if we found information that the storm event was localized within the first quarter of the day daily rainfall is discretized over the first six hours of the day only this is mainly because there might not be any rain at all for several hours of the day and discretizing over the whole day may show values even for non rainy hours the calibration involves a combination of both manual and automated calibrations the manual calibration precedes the optimization to ensure that a physically meaningful set of initial parameters is used in the model based on initial conditions and on expert knowledge of the basin s physical properties the automated optimization is then applied to optimize the model parameters the resulting minimum and maximum values of each optimized parameter define an interval of narrow parameter ranges perhaps the more past events evaluated the better results are expected however there should be a certain number of events that ensures convergence in the calibration the convergence in calibration is obtained when calibrating on additional past events do not considerably change the estimated parameter ranges two main categories of evaluation indices were applied for model calibration the first category of indices is used to evaluate the model for the entire rainfall event 1 p e a k f l o w e r r o r p f e q obs peak q sim peak q obs peak 100 2 p h a s e e r r o r h p e τ obs τ sim 3 v o l u m e e r r o r v e v obs v sim v obs 100 where q obs peak and q sim peak are the peak observed and simulated flow values for each rainfall runoff event τ obs and τ sim are the peak times for the observed and simulated event v obs and v sim are the total runoff volume for the observed and simulated event respectively the second category is related to the evaluation of the time series of the rainfall runoff simulation most research projects involving watershed modelling utilize some type of predefined model evaluation techniques to compare simulated output with observed data a combination of graphical techniques dimensionless and error index statistics is used for model evaluation moriasi et al 2007 coefficient of correlation standard regression 4 r i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 5 n s e 1 i 1 n

hydrological modelling the uncertainty propagation in this approach can be understood by analysing the uncertainty on the hydrological model parameters based on two approaches the first approach involves a sensitivity analysis for the hydrological model to select the key parameters mainly controlling and forcing the model results the second approach involves a fuzzy combination based on monte carlo simulation for the selected parameters robert and casella 2004 the selected parameters of minimized ranges in the previous step 1 are statistically sampled based on a uniformly distributed probability density function uniform distributions are considered to avoid any prior assumption on the parameters distribution other than their feasible ranges as discussed by freer et al 1996 random numbers are generated using the well19937c generator within hec hms panneton et al 2006 3 3 3 hydraulic model validation hydraulic models have been typically validated using water level or discharge values obtained from the hydrometric network available on the river however this is a major challenge when hydrometric measurements are lacking and when remote sensing products are not able to capture the flood event in this approach we choose to validate the model with the post event measurements of high water marks this step is preceded by a terrain analysis to extract the inundation area using the high resolution terrain model the simulated maximum water level bounds are matched with the observed water levels the root mean square error rmse objective function is used to evaluate the fit between the simulated uncertainty bounds of the water levels and the observed ones at the post event measurement locations 8 r m s e i 1 n h max obs h max sim 2 n h max obs and h max sim are the maximum observed and simulated water levels respectively and n is the number of post event maximum water level measurement points the rmse is zero if the observed and simulated water levels fit perfectly higher rmse error reflects more divergent values 4 results 4 1 step 1 hydrological model calibration and evaluation by past storm events 4 1 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the model was first assessed based on the 14 19 february 2012 storm event event 11 the event was selected because it is the closest to the jan2013 flood event the sensitivity analysis was performed at the river stage saida 475 and was based on the variation of the curve number parameter initial abstraction parameter percent impervious parameter and the lag time the reference parameter values are 50 4 for the cn 12 7 mm for the ia 7 7 hr for the lag time and 0 75 for the percent impervious the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 6 based on evaluating the total runoff volume the peak flow and the time of peak discharge at saida 475 gauge the curve number parameter was found to be the parameter that could mostly affect the calculation results the initial abstraction affects the runoff volume and peak flow whereas the impervious percent mainly affects the runoff volume the lag time mainly affects the time of peak runoff 4 1 2 calibration by past storm events to estimate parameter ranges following the sensitivity analysis the selected key parameters for calibration are the curve number the initial abstraction the lag time and the manning s coefficient model calibration and evaluation were carried out at two points corresponding to the positions of the gauge stations saida 475 and marj bisri 473 model calibration was performed on three steps the number of events is increased in each step and the parameter ranges are compared to the preceding ones allowing to search for the suitable number of events that ensures a convergence in the calibration the first step involves calibrating the model with 3 events arbitrarily chosen events 2 4 and 12 the second step involves calibrating with 6 events events 2 4 5 6 8 and 12 and the last step involves calibrating with the whole 12 events the parameter ranges for the different sub basin are taken equal to those obtained by the calibration in each step calibration with 3 events resulted in parameter ranges quite narrower than those obtained by calibrating with 6 events whereas calibrating with 6 and 12 events resulted in similar parameter ranges which means that our approach works well with 12 events calibrating with 3 events was not sufficient because analysing additional storm events further increases the parameter ranges this is because the additional events are more variable in terms of intensity allowing to obtain a wider parameter range in our case the similar parameter ranges obtained by 6 and 12 events indicates a convergence in calibration and allows us to say that we are stabilized with 12 events indeed this approach should be should be further assessed in additional applications because the selected number of past storm events impacts the resulting parameter ranges the different sub basin characteristics their arbitrarily estimated wide parameter ranges and the estimated ranges by calibrating with 12 events are presented in table 7 the calibration with 12 events resulted in the estimation of narrow ranges of the characteristic parameters of the different sub basins these ranges are narrower than the arbitrarily chosen wide parameter ranges the model was relatively more sensitive to the characteristic parameters of sub basin b1 and b2 which form around 60 of the total area and together contribute to over 31 of the total runoff for the selected storm events the cn of sub basin b1 found to vary from 50 to 62 the lag time varies from 232 to 248 min and the initial abstraction varies from 7 to 21 mm table 8 summarizes the model performance for the selected storm events in terms of the parameters described in eqs 1 7 the simulation of the 12 events resulted in an average volume error of 10 7 average peak flow error of 26 3 and an average phase error of 3 6 h the performance of the model was highly variable among the storm events the evaluation analysis resulted in an nse ranging between 0 84 and 0 06 r ranging between 0 93 and 0 58 rmse ranging between 1 46 and 19 7 m3 s and mae ranging between 0 62 and 8 7 m3 s the low nse values for events 2 3 9 and 10 are mainly because the observed water levels at saida gauge 475 presented large fluctuations that may not be related to the runoff generated by rainfall events but may be related to the sensitivity of the river stage gauge to any perturbation in the water flow that for example may be resulting from the floating objects carried by the river the low nse value for event 3 and 11 at marj bisri gauge 473 is mainly because the observed hydrograph presented a relatively high peak discharge which might be overestimated by the rating curve the good nse value for event 6 is related to discretising rainfall over the storm period of occurrence first quarter of the day which reduced the error in the time series and gave better peak flow value 4 2 step 2 uncertainty propagation flood event of 07 january 2013 the jan2013 storm event rainfall amounts recorded at the time of flood by the daily rainfall stations p1 p3 p11 p12 and p15 and the hourly rainfall station p10 are analogous with slightly lower values along the coastal area indicating no major spatial variation in rainfall the little difference in rainfall among stations is considered by assigning its relative weight preserving the same hyetograph distribution the uncertainty analysis involved the hydrological model parameters cn ia lag time and the manning s roughness based on the criteria illustrated by dimitriadis et al 2016 testing several parameter samples ranging from 100 to 5000 showed that the convergence in the resulting mean discharge and volume was achieved for sample size starting from 1000 parameters and that increasing the number of samples does not result in a noticeable change in the computed mean discharge and volume we choose to perform 2000 simulations which is equivalent to more than twelve values per model parameters for an adequate quantitative analysis of acceptable computational cost the parameters are statistically sampled following a uniformly distributed probability density function within their estimated ranges in step 1 to study the implication of the estimated parameter ranges on the model results four model simulations were performed these correspond to the wide parameter ranges defined in table 7 and the estimated parameter ranges by calibrating on 3 6 and 12 events the model simulated hydrographs at all sub catchments outlets the results of the four model simulations are presented in fig 5 at saida g 475 gauge the simulation based on the wide parameter ranges resulted in numerous possible model realisations of peak flow value ranging between 100 m3 s and 550 m3 s with a mean value of 260 m3 s in this case the results of the hydrological modelling are no more representative and may be replaced by empirical or lumped modelling approaches the simulation based on the estimated parameter ranges by 3 events resulted in few model realisations of peak flow value ranging between 276 m3 s and 364 m3 s with a mean value of 339 m3 s as expected this simulation 3 events is thought to be underestimating the possible peak flow values because it was based on unstable calibration simulations based on estimated parameter ranges by 6 and 12 events resulted in similar model realizations of peak flow values ranging between 324 m3 s and 429 m3 s with a mean value of 377 m3 s observed at 05 00 of 07 january 2013 given that the maximum rainfall intensity of 17 3 mm hr was observed at 20 00 the day before for these two simulations 6 events and 12 events the simulated total water volume ranges between 67 44 mm3 and 75 05 mm3 with a mean value of 71 49 mm3 the last two simulations reduce uncertainty in the peak flow values and seem to be satisfactory because of the stable model calibration 4 3 step 3 hydraulic modelling and flood map validation by post event measurements the hec ras model was applied to the low coastal area that corresponds to the channel running in sub basins b8 and b9 the channel is bounded upstream by joun hydropower plant and downstream by the gauge station g 475 and the sea mouth the resulting hydrographs of the hydrological model corresponding to the 12 events simulation were then assigned as upstream and downstream boundary conditions and input lateral inflows at junctions for the hydraulic model the propagation of uncertainty through the hydraulic model was examined using the previously established bounds maximum mean and minimum flow hydrographs providing three realizations of the flood extent the hydraulic model results are presented in fig 6 the resultant flood map is presented in fig 7 93 of the observed water levels fell within the simulated uncertainty bounds and found to be closer to the mean with rmse error of 0 26 m the rmse error was found to be 0 7 m and 0 6 m for the maximum and minimum uncertainty bounds respectively with an rmse error in the range of the dem resolution 10 cm the results of the hydraulic modelling are found to be very promising 5 discussion 5 1 opportunities in the model coupling approach a wide range of hydrological and hydraulic models is nowadays available out of which many are open software and easy to use by the scientific community the coupling between these models has been also widely discussed in literature the hec hms and the hec ras models are among these models these open software have been successfully used in many case studies examples include the hec hms model on the llobregat river in catalonia amengual et al 2007 the misai and wan an catchments in china oleyiblo and li 2010 sixteen sub catchments in johor malaysia shamsudin et al 2011 and the balijore nala watershed in india choudhari et al 2014 examples on the hec ras model include the severn river in uk horritt and bates 2002 the eno river strouds creek in north carolina and brazos river in texas cook and merwade 2009 the po river in italy di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and the xerias river in greece papaioannou et al 2017 the hec hms and the hec ras models have been successfully coupled in different study cases examples include the san antonio river basin in texas knebl et al 2005 and the giofiros basin in greece koutroulis and tsanis 2010 sufficient discussions have been presented in literature to assess the use of many of these models and evaluate their coupling performance these models have been tested against classical data in well gauged basins and found to be successful in this project we do not aim to assess the performance of the model structure the performance of the model structure can be tested with classical data to be valid for application with sparse data based on what we have mentioned before that most of the river basins are data sparse basins we aim to discuss the opportunity of applying these hydrological hydraulic models using sparse data unlike classical approaches that involve calibrating the model with one past storm event the robustness of the applied approach is related to the evaluation of the model with several past storm events of variable intensities the proper number of past events is selected when calibration based on additional past events do not considerably change the estimated parameter ranges however this is not straightforward this number may vary from one application to another depending on the variability of the events in terms of intensity period of occurrence of the events how close are the events to the particular event under study and whether there was evolution in the landuse or modification to the river channel and number of parameters to evaluate perhaps the proper number of past events necessary for the hydrological hydraulic modelling has always been an open question in hydrology koutroulis and tsanis 2010 calibrated their model based on 8 events garambois et al 2013 evaluated their study based on 10 events and massari et al 2014 calibrated and validated their model based on 16 events given the scarcity of data about floods in the area 12 events of variable intensity is an acceptable number in hydrology and was found to be sufficient to ensure convergence in the calibration this is clear from the results of calibration of the model by 6 and 12 events where the parameter ranges do not change considerably and the model is quite stable around this parameter range the selected events are of variable intensities involving low flow as well as high flow events allowing to obtain sufficient ranges of variation of the hydrological parameters out of the 12 events 5 are considered low flow events events 2 3 4 7 and 8 peak flow ranging between 17 and 29 m3 s 4 are moderate flow events events 5 9 10 and 12 peak flow ranging between 68 and 86 m3 s and 3 are high flow events events 1 6 and 11 peak flow ranging between 119 and 163 m3 s the events were selected for the period between january 2000 and march 2012 for the studied period no major changes to the landuse and the river network were observed and the same hydrometeorological network was operating moreover the study is limited to evaluating only 4 parameters that are thought to mostly impact the results of modelling the parameter ranges obtained after evaluating the model with the past events can define narrower parameter ranges for uncertainty evaluation perhaps the more past events evaluated the better results are expected the approach is not suitable for evaluating a big number of parameters because it is economically unfeasible to evaluate a large number of past events that might not be available in data sparse regions the approach might not be suitable when considerable changes in the flow regime or in the basin s characteristics are noticed with an nse ranging from 0 06 to 0 84 the model performance is highly variable low nse values are obtained for minor as well as major events therefore model performance cannot be clearly related to the event type however low nse when modelling flood events doesn t mean necessary a bad simulation it can be due to a simple translation of the hyetograph moussa 2010 or data quality issues for high magnitude events events 1 and 12 the model tends to underestimate the peak flow mainly because the discretisation of the daily rainfall measurements into hourly rainfall measurements does not reflect the actual rainfall intensity which is expected to be higher moreover the low reliability of the estimated rating curves might produce higher observed peak flow values for events exceeding the maximum stage by the rating curve see for example event 11 the peak flow estimated by the upstream gauge g 473 by 246 5 m3 s far exceeds the peak flow estimated by the downstream gauge g 475 by 118 7 m3 s in some cases events 2 3 9 and 10 the flow hydrographs exhibited large fluctuations that affected the performance of the model these fluctuations are not linked to precipitation patterns because the majority are observed when no rainfall is recorded the mismatch between the precipitations and observed water levels can be linked to either an error in rainfall measurementor to a malfunctioning of the river stage gauge that is highly sensitive to any disturbance induced into the river flow at this stage and considering the low reliability of the rating curves and the lack of hourly rainfall estimates these should be considered satisfactory results 5 2 uncertainty propagation the uncertainty in the model results is a propagation of several uncertainties inherent mainly in the input data model parameters and model structure in data sparse regions the uncertainty inherent in the hydrological model input and model parameters may be the major sources of uncertainty compared to the hydrological model structure this is because the selected hydrological model structure is widely accepted and have been verified before on several properly gauged basins worldwide and the uncertainties inherent in its structure are negligible compared to the poor uncertain data available this might be a difference between hydrological and hydraulic models in which the uncertainty inherent in the hydraulic model structure might outperform the one emerged from the hydraulic model parameters as demonstrated by dimitriadis et al 2016 however additional hydrological model structures through other software should be tested in future research to further test this statement the lack of sufficient observational data necessary to parameterize the model is the major source of uncertainty in the model parameters which is propagated to the output variables classical hydrological modelling techniques in well gauged basins involve calibrating the model with a set of past observation data the result is a defined set of parameters capable to a certain extent of well reproducing the hydrological rainfall runoff transformations within the basins in a deterministic way on the other side if no model calibration is performed analysing the uncertainty propagation through modelling based on a wide range of feasible parameter ranges will result in numerous possible model realisations sometimes when the uncertainty bounds are too wide the results of the modelling are no more representative and can be substituted by other empirical or simplified methods based on what have been discussed the calibration approach applied in this study aims to define the hydrological model parameters ranges to reduce uncertainty in the output flows the 12 events model simulation resulted in a peak flow difference of around 105 m3 s between the maximum and minimum uncertainty bounds this is much better than solely performing the uncertainty analysis based on the arbitrarily chosen wide parameter ranges that resulted in a peak flow difference of around 450 m3 s the future work involves testing this approach on other study sites to assess the effect of variable number of past storm events chosen for calibration rainfall is the major input data to the model of major uncertainty inherent in the time step of measurement especially in regions characterized by flash floods of response times in the order of hours discretizing the daily rainfall measurements into hourly measurements over the period of occurrence of maximum rainfall was found to be encouraging this interprets the relatively good nse value obtained for event 6 for which rainfall was discretised over the first quarter of the day only the time period of occurrence of maximum rainfall further analysis is to be performed to compare different rainfall discretization methods to analyse the uncertainty induced by the time step of measurement especially when no information on the time of occurrence of the rain event is available other sources of rainfall data uncertainties are inherent in its spatial variability and measurement method such uncertainties can be ignored compared to the uncertainties inherent in the time step of measurement because the jan2013 storm event was widely spread over the whole country with no major spatial variation in the rainfall intensity observed over the relatively small basin s area the analogous records of six daily rainfall stations well distributed over the area also support our observation and reduces the uncertainty inherent in the spatial variability of rainfall and in its measured values 5 3 opportunities in post event measurements the spatial water level measurements based on high water marks such as fragments in trees traces left by water along the river section and floodplain and water lines on building walls were acknowledged by several scientists in literature e g horritt and bates 2002 borga et al 2008 fuentes andino et al 2017 indeed these measurements are biased by river modification over time and a greater uncertainty is associated with rapid flow conditions despite this uncertainty those measurements may represent the best available evidence for flood events the uncertainty in measurements can be assessed by the field surveyors themselves considering the conditions that formed the high water marks in rapid flow conditions and if good care was taken when measuring the water peaks uncertainty in measurements may not exceed the 0 15 m as suggested by the usgs koenig et al 2016 in this study no major modification to the river channel was observed maximum water level measurements were carefully chosen with proper awareness unreliable or confusing points with variable or unclear high water marks were avoided allowing to keep only the clear and best quality points this evaluation criteria limited the number of post event measurements to 27 measurements in some cases an average of two or three water marks was estimated to improve confidence in the measurement sometimes viewing the complete set of points of a water line on one side of the bank and comparing it to the opposite bank allows estimating the best water line moreover information on water levels obtained from local witnesses was considered reliable because the field survey was performed in two months after the flood event and the local witnesses memory about the event was still fresh in this study and based on our observation the uncertainty in the post event measurements may not exceed the 0 5 m despite this uncertainty most of the observed water levels fall within the uncertainty bounds and are very close to the mean simulation of the hydraulic model in the lack of hydrometric measurements the results indicate the robustness of the applied approach in modelling flood levels and the capability of validating the results on different locations scattered in space the resolution of the topographic data is a key element in the accuracy of the hydraulic model casas et al 2006 cook and merwade 2009 several studies in literature have pointed out to the sensitivity of the hydraulic models to the resolution of digital elevation models tsubaki and fujita 2010 papaioannou et al 2016 savage et al 2016 many have acknowledged the use of high resolution dem s for hydraulic modelling and flood mapping specially with basins of rapidly varied topography and steep river slopes schumann et al 2009 bates 2012 brandt 2016 in this approach validation of the hydraulic model with post event measurements in space is encouraging when based on a fine resolution dem a prior simulation for the hydraulic model was performed based on the available 10 m resolution dem the hydraulic model experienced a lot of numerical instabilities the resulting water levels were far beyond the real observed water levels and in some locations were more than triple the observed ones this is primarily because the geometry and slopes of the river channel and the floodplain are not well represented in the coarse dem i e a river channel of width in the order of 5 10 m and a flood plain in the order of 30 50 m are unrealistically presented by 3 5 cells only in the coarse dem in hydraulic models errors induced by poor terrain and slopes representation are much higher than those induced by poor estimation of the manning s coefficient see for example jaber and mohtar 2003 with the advancement of the remote sensing and drone photography techniques fine resolution dem s are expected to be widely spread in the future these techniques mainly the drone photography are being favourable because of their ease of use high accuracy and wide applicability mccabe et al 2017 leitão and de sousa 2018 accordingly the availability of the fine resolutions dem s should not be an issue in data sparse regions in the coming years 5 4 what if sparse spatial data are better than classical temporal data calibration and evaluation of the hydrological model with several past storm events increased the results robustness unlike classical uncertainty analysis techniques in ungauged basins involving wide parameter ranges the results robustness is obtained by evaluating the model with several storm events of variable intensities that allowed the estimation of possible parameter ranges of the hydrological model that are narrow enough to reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions moreover the presented results have to be compared with the classical calibration approach that results in a set of deterministic model parameters and do not allow easily for the uncertainty propagation through the model classically hydraulic models are calibrated and validated based on classical temporal data at one point these are measured water levels or flow values at the gauge stations however several potential errors arise when using this type of observational data related to the accuracy of measurement and its spatial resolution for large flood events and when river stage gauges are not damaged by the flood water level measurements may exceed the maximum gauge measurement levels or exceed the maximum value used in the derivation of the rating curves that are unable to reflect the hydraulic behaviour of the rated section horritt et al 2010 even though the river stage accurately measures the water levels that are within the range of the rating curves it is still required to obtain information on other cross sections based on field investigation of flood marks those levels often exceed the range of stage discharge relationships that may exist on site gaume and borga 2008 despite the narrow temporal sampling of the water levels at the river stage there is lack of spatial data that do not allow the verification of the distributed model predictions whereas the use of finer resolution dem increases the confidence in the distributed model predictions moussa and cheviron 2015 the use of sparse spatial data at one date in the form of post event measurements of water levels scattered in space alone supports the spatial validation of the flood inundation model such spatial sparse information of non binary nature may be used in the lack of short time step temporal hydrograph on a given point especially in time periods of approximately steady flow conditions whereas the classical temporal data at one point of too sparse spatial resolution should always be accompanied with other diverse sources such as the aerial photos remote sensing or post event measurements of flood marks to allow the spatial validation of the model predictions on the other hand the broader distribution and the greater number of post event measurements the better validation is achieved because this type of data is subjected to several limitations hunter et al 2005 for example in the case of unsteady flow conditions the flood inundation could behave differently in the upstream and downstream areas and the post event measurements might not reflect the flood dynamics 5 5 model complexity vs performance for a given condition of data availability the more complex the flood model is the greater is the risk of the uncertainty inherent in the required input data model parameters and in the model structure applying complex models in a data sparse basin cannot be easy verified several studies on dem based geomorphic approaches have been performed in literature to delineate flood prone areas these simplified methods that rely on basin geomorphologic feature characterization revealed to be an efficient low cost strategy e g moussa 1997 noman et al 2001 manfreda et al 2014 samela et al 2017 the geomorphic approaches allow highlighting preliminarily the locations of flooded areas and give rough estimation on the extent and depth of flood inundation such approaches proved to be efficient in large scale applications samela et al 2017 and the outcomes are relatively sufficient to inform decision makers on the range of variability of the flood hazard for general planning purposes however general geomorphic approaches may not be very efficient when detailed information on the inundation levels and extent is required especially in small scale applications and therefore cannot easily replace the hydrological hydraulic approaches manfreda et al 2014 moreover most geomorphic approaches require probabilistic information on rainfall e g design rainfalls of 50 years 100 years etc obtained from statistical analysis of rainfall series and make use of the hydraulic scaling functions based on contributing areas to estimate water levels these estimations based on probabilistic input do not always allow the detailed understanding of particular events of unknown severity level such as the jan2013 flood event working with particular event is not like working with statistical approaches although complex models require an increasing number of data to reach adequate reliability and it is preferable to be avoided but for practical problems the use of complex distributed models is inevitable grayson and blöschl 2001 it is of a challenge to better use the available information and to seek additional information to increase the confidence in model simulations model complexity depends on how we define it on the site of application and on the time of application what was considered complex several years ago is now simpler with the rapid evolution of computational power development of very high resolution dem s and the widespread of geographic information systems gis the presented application is not much complicated but rather an intermediate position between complex and simple approaches indeed several simplifications of the processes representation were applied to reduce model requirements and number of parameters this can be illustrated for example by using the scs curve number approach for runoff computation which is empirical in origin along with the scs unit hydrograph routing method 1d hec ras model can be considered as simple by comparison to 2d or 3d hydraulic models added value information from social media post event surveys and past storm events helped constrain the model and improve the quality of results the availability of a high resolution dem encouraged the application of the 1d hydraulic model hec ras which proved to give reasonably promising results the error in the simulated water levels is in the order of 20 30 cm which might not be achieved when applying simplified geomorphic approaches however this doesn t prove our approach will be efficient in all circumstances but at least it strengthens our confidence in its value 6 conclusions the objective of this paper was to assess whether there is opportunity to constrain hydrological hydraulic models with sparse data to simulate extreme floods and establish water levels that can be useful for flood maps adapted for basin scale applications for this purpose we develop a framework based on a coupled hydrological hydraulic model constrained by past storm events and post event measurements the approach is applied to the awali river basin 301 km2 in lebanon particularly to simulate the investigated early january 2013 extreme flood event the hydrological model was calibrated with 12 past storm events aiming at defining narrow hydrological parameter ranges the uncertainty in the model parameters was assessed by performing monte carlo simulation for the estimated parameter ranges the uncertainty simulation gave satisfactory results it was found that the uncertainty in the resulting outflow values is reduced when compared with running simulations based on arbitrarily chosen wide parameter ranges social media information on the event characteristics especially on the duration of maximum rainfall was an added value to constrain the hydrological model simulations post event measurements of high water marks were promising in validating the flood map in space the results show the potentials and the limitations of applying hydrological hydraulic models using sparse data and the challenge of producing flood maps that can replace the coarse resolution regional maps the clear advantage of the proposed method is that it is a tailor made approach adapted for basin scale applications in data sparse regions using the maximum data available and aiming at producing inundation maps that can perform better than regional maps the method allows modelling with reduced uncertainty particular flood events in terms of estimation of the flood hydrographs flood water levels and mapping the inundated area it has the potential to enable crowdsourcing of information for flood events in the form of spatial post event measurements social media information local witnesses along with pictures and videos such crowdsourced information are now gaining favor in data sparse regions as a way to compensate the weaknesses in the traditional measurement networks moreover the method has the potential to include high resolution digital elevation models that are now evolving at an unprecedented pace the coupled hydrologic hydraulic model is constrained by past storm events and post events measurements and the results are estimations of the flood water levels along the floodplain with accuracy less than 1 m the interesting results reveal that good spatial measurements of one event even of very short time series are significant in supporting the hydrological hydraulic modeling these sparse spatial data at one date may be used in the lack of classical temporal data at the gauge stations the approach can serve as a tool for damage assessment of flood events it supports urban planning and structural design of flood protection measures on a local scale the approach when combined with organized real time crowdsourcing can serve as a part of a flood forecasting system finally when classical data are lacking the use of sparse data in a classical modelling approach is encouraging and the proposed framework can be applied to other data sparse regions facing the same problems acknowledgements this research is part of a phd thesis of the first author funded by the

6995,flood modelling in data sparse regions have been always limited to empirical statistical or geomorphic approaches that are suitable to produce regional hazard maps such coarse resolution maps are not adapted for basin scale applications small to medium sized basins 1000 km2 especially when detailed estimates of flows and water levels of a particular event is required and hence cannot replace the hydrological hydraulic modelling the latter is a challenging task in data sparse regions characterized by floods of typical duration times of a few hours which offer little opportunity for real time recording by traditional rain gauge networks remote sensing or satellite imaging such data sparseness is not always compatible with the resolution in both space and time of the hydrological and hydraulic models we propose a framework for flood modelling using sparse data from a coupled hydrological hydraulic model constrained by past storm events and post event measurements in space the approach is applied to the awali river basin 301 km2 in lebanon particularly to simulate the investigated early january 2013 extreme flood event which is considered one of the largest events in the last three decades the hydrological model was calibrated and evaluated with 12 past storm events aiming at defining narrow parameter ranges and uncertainty was performed with monte carlo simulations for these parameter ranges the hydraulic model based on a fine resolution dem was simulated using hydrological outflows and validated with 27 post event measurements in space of high water marks the resulting outflow values were satisfactory and uncertainty was reduced when compared with arbitrarily wide parameter ranges the hydrological model performance was highly variable but for the hydraulic model 93 of the observed water levels fall within the simulated uncertainty bounds with an rmse error of 0 26 m the proposed framework allows mapping the possible inundation and can be compared to other approaches dealing with model complexity and associated performances keywords sparse data flood maps post event measurements uncertainty lebanon mediterranean nomenclature cn curve number d

other natural disasters unisdr cred 2015 with the climate change who 2002 jonkman 2005 urbanization growth and land use change especially in flood prone areas the frequency and severity of floods is increasing at an alarming rate unisdr 2002 hence developing more accurate flood modelling tools to better understand and mitigate floods has become a global endeavour flood modelling applications in data sparse regions were always limited to uncertain probabilistic estimates of rainfall flood flows and water levels based on empirical e g koutroulis and tsanis 2010 statistical e g castellarin 2007 castellarin et al 2009 or geomorphic approaches e g manfreda et al 2014 such applications are useful for regional flood analysis such as national hazard maps that are mainly of coarse resolution and are not adapted for small to medium size basins 1000 km2 generally for basin scale applications and when more detailed understanding of a particular flood event is required and when the study area is relatively small such regional maps cannot do the favour especially when detailed estimates of flows and water levels are required and hence cannot replace the hydrological hydraulic modelling reliable information on the flood peak discharge gaume et al 2009 water levels saleh et al 2013 domeneghetti 2016 and the flood inundation extent merwade et al 2008 are among the major parameters required in any flood problem and flood modelling represents a way to obtain such information bates 2004 moussa and bocquillon 2009 it classically requires a coupling between a hydrologic model to simulate the rainfall runoff transformation along hill shades and estimate peak flood flows and a hydraulic model to simulate the propagation of flood wave along the river channel and establish the corresponding water levels along with terrain analysis to extract the flood inundation area dimitriadis et al 2016 model coupling has been applied by several authors in literature on relatively well gauged basins see for example knebl et al 2005 montanari et al 2009 lerat et al 2012 however when data are uncertain and too sparse to meet model requirements and when model coupling is required the question arises as to whether there is an opportunity to constrain the hydrological hydraulic model to simulate extreme floods and establish water levels that can be useful for flood assessment and mitigation worldwide the majority of river basins are either ungauged or poorly gauged and in some cases facing deterioration of the available measurement networks sivapalan et al 2003 efstratiadis et al 2014 in a broader classification most of the basins in the world and especially in developing countries are denoted as data sparse basins where reliable information on the characteristics and on the spatial and temporal coverage of extreme flood events are rare or inexistent see for example wilby and yu 2013 jarihani et al 2015 komi et al 2017 classical and sparse data are differentiated in table 1 data sparseness is often referred to measurements of limited spatiotemporal resolution point measurements of coarse time step and series with gaps or parameters that have not been collected during simultaneous periods samaniego et al 2011 mascaro et al 2013 some also add that such data may not be available in the period of interest or are of poor quality or unknown accuracy and the hydro meteorological network is of very low density that makes interpolation procedures or filling methods impossible satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 switzman et al 2015 in addition others point out to when detailed channel bed and topography information are coarse or unavailable neal et al 2012 in the mediterranean region data requirement is particularly acute because most floods occur on a short duration typically a portion of the day and are mainly generated by high intensity short duration localized rainfall events moussa and chahinian 2009 these floods characterized by response times often less than 2 h and typically occurring in catchments of drainage area not exceeding 1000 km2 borga et al 2008 can difficultly be captured even by the traditional rain gauge networks norbiato et al 2007 lumbroso and gaume 2012 in addition impossible direct current meter measurements of the flood peak discharge fukami et al 2008 coarse time step of measurements often skipping the peak conditions common failure of river stage gauge flood water exceeding the gauge measurement level resulting in underestimation of the peak discharge koutroulis and tsanis 2010 are common weaknesses that lead to poorly defined rating curves during floods maybe more than in other regions the specific rainfall and discharge data requirements result in classifying the mediterranean region as data sparse region when information on the flood event characteristics catchment hydrological characteristics and river channel characteristics are sparse or lacking interesting information can be inferred from recorded past storm events post event field investigations newspapers and social media reports and from crowdsourcing of information from local citizens on flood events characteristics whenever available from the hydrological modelling perspective past storm events can be extracted from the available simultaneous rainfall and flow data measurements these are often used in literature to estimate and calibrate the unknown model parameters see for example sangati et al 2009 massari et al 2014 however when past storm events data used for calibration are uncertain or does not meet model requirements bias and uncertainty arise in model predictions pappenberger et al 2008 additionally the calibration procedure may induce equifinality when input data and calibration equally fit the sparse validation data the latter can be raised through analysing the uncertainty propagation aronica et al 2002 a good understanding of the uncertainty associated with various parameters inherent in modelling is a critical requirement merwade et al 2008 accordingly when all relevant uncertainties are taken into consideration optimal decisions are to be expected apel et al 2008 domeneghetti et al 2013 from the hydraulic modelling perspective detailed post event surveys in space based on traces left by water and sediments provide a good opportunity when systematic water level and flow measurements are lacking horritt and bates 2002 borga et al 2008 surveyed channel cross sections and flood marks can be used in estimating the peak flood discharge gaume 2006 pictures and videos taken by witnesses during the flood event are interesting in highlighting affected areas and in understanding the events characteristics such as the flood duration flow type and velocity at the time of capturing le boursicaud et al 2016 fuentes andino et al 2017 field surveys and witnesses interviews can provide additional information such as the time of peak water levels and flood extent gaume and borga 2008 post event measurements have been used to validate the results of the hydraulic models several times in literature see for example hervouet 2000 romanowicz and beven 2003 horritt et al 2010 newspaper and social media information on storm events and floods is an interesting well available data source providing an opportunity to understand some of the events characteristics such information has been used several times in literature to search for historical flood events barredo 2007 develop a flood database and inventories barnolas and llasat 2007 llasat et al 2009 understand the flood regime changes hall et al 2014 support the hydrologic and hydraulic modelling of the flood events papaioannou et al 2016 evaluate flood risk llasat et al 2010 abdallah and hdeib 2015 and understand the socio economic impacts of floods lastoria et al 2006 moreover crowdsourced information from local citizens on flood events is now gaining favour and is facilitated by the wide spread of low cost monitoring technology and communication systems lowry and fienen 2013 montanari et al 2013 mazzoleni et al 2017 all these data sources can give information on the flood characteristics such as the affected areas the rainfall event characteristics depth intensity and duration timing of the flood event duration and time of peak possible flood depth and inundation area extent severity and recorded damages in this article we hypothesise that there is an opportunity to model flood events based on constraining a hydrological hydraulic model with sparse data discontinuous in space and time the focal point is the proposed modelling framework that involves the hydrologic model hec hms usace 2000 combined with the 1 d hydraulic model hec ras usace 2016 along with models calibration and evaluation with past storm events and flood post event measurements including uncertainty calculation based on monte carlo simulation the framework is tested and discussed through its application on a challenging study

along with the sparse collected datasets the second section presents the proposed modelling framework with the hydrologic the hydraulic models outlines the parameterization strategy and the corresponding evaluation procedures finally the major results of the models processing and calibration are given and discussed through several challenges including the model coupling approach the reliability of the observational data and uncertainty propagation the post event measurements and their use in constraining the model 2 study site 2 1 geographical dataset the awali river basin is one of the coastal eastern mediterranean catchments located in southern lebanon covering an area of 301 km2 the river is one of the major lebanese perennial rivers witnessing floods every other year abdallah et al 2013 it is 48 km long originating from the barouk mountain at an altitude reaching 1 492 m and eventually flowing through the western face of mount lebanon and into the mediterranean sea the study area of the hydrological model was the whole catchment area divided into nine sub catchments whereas it was the lower main course of the river approximately 5 km of river length for the hydraulic model which is experiencing flooding after heavy rainfall events fig 1 the catchment has a rapidly varied topography ranging from elevated areas of mount lebanon 1950 m asl running parallel to the coast and characterized by a continuous snow cover during winter to flat plains along the low coastal area primarily utilized for agricultural purposes it is characterized by steep slopes which converge towards a valley where the awali river flows the lithology of the catchment covers a sequence from the middle jurassic rocks to the recent quaternary deposits the surface is mainly composed of the cenomanian sannine limestone formation c4 which consists of well stratified fractured interbedded limestones dolomites and marls dubertret 1945 the watershed underlies several aquifer formations including the high central lebanon cretaceous the kesrouan jurassic and the batroun jounieh cretaceous these aquifers are separated by unproductive formations leptosols is the dominant soil class in the catchment covering almost 64 of the total area the recent soil map of lebanon classified per the fao unesco legend world reference base for soil resources and the american soil taxonomy darwish et al 2006 was used to generate the hydrological soil groups hsg abdallah et al 2013 the catchment has a varied land use wooded lands and grasslands are dominant covering 46 5 and 26 8 of the total area respectively whereas agricultural areas and artificial urban areas cover 18 2 and 7 2 respectively lncsr lmoa 2010 the average basin slope in the b1 b2 b3 and b4 sub catchments is 33 6 33 3 29 9 29 3 respectively fig 2 detailed river and floodplain geometry was extracted from a fine resolution digital elevation model of 10 cm resolution generated for the purpose of this work several drone photography surveys covering the whole floodplain were performed to capture around 5000 raw images acquired in strips with adjacent photographs having an overlap of 80 in the flight direction and 70 between parallel flight tracks these images were then processed using the pix4dmapper software to generate the high resolution dem based on the criteria described by the american society of photogrammetry and remote sensing asprs 2004 the criteria involved identifying and filtering all above ground features to remove false blockages to flow such as bridges critical features influencing the flow of water such as walls and building were retained additionally the topography of the entire basin was available from a 10 m digital elevation model dem developed by the lebanese national center for remote sensing cnrs rs the latter was used to delineate the boundaries of the awali basin extract the corresponding stream network and estimate the basin s hydrological characteristics for the hydrological modelling part 2 2 hydrological dataset 2 2 1 rainfall the catchment has a mediterranean climate it receives its majority of mean annual rainfall of 1067 mm during the wet fall winter period extending from november to april with little or no rain between june and august the mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 and 700 mm along the coast and 1300 1400 mm over the mountains plassard 1972 daily rainfall measurements were obtained from seven meteorological stations operated by the lebanese national meteorological services lnms table 2 fig 1 these stations were recently established after the lebanese civil war 1975 1990 during which most of the stations ceased their operation and have however started recording since 1996 the number and distribution of rainfall stations of density around 130 km2 per rain gauge is considered satisfactory for the basin area following the wmo requirements of recommended minimum densities of stations early january 2013 a harsh winter storm lashed the eastern mediterranean coast with snow high winds and heavy rains flooding caused by torrential rains was recorded in several parts of the region including turkey syria lebanon and jordan noaa 2013 in lebanon the storm lasted for 6 days 5th 10th january and 277 mm total rainfall of 50 years return period was recorded leaving behind one of the largest floods in the last 25 years hourly rainfall records for the jan2013 storm are available from baysour meteo station p10 2 2 2 discharge two permanent limnigraphic gauge stations operated by the lebanese litani river authority lra take continuous hourly or 15 min measurements of surface water levels the marj bisri gauge station g 473 monitors the flow upstream along the bisri river and the saida gauge g 475 monitors the flow at 800 m upstream of the catchment s outlet on the mediterranean sea see fig 2 the average annual yield for the basin at g 475 is approximately 347 mm3 out of which 85 occurring during the winter stream flow is normally highest in february and lowest in september with an average daily flow of 11 m3 s table 3 flow data are also obtained through periodical field point flow measurements that are used to obtain a rough estimate of the monthly river flow volumes and calibrate the river rating curves due to the limited resources of the lra the shortage in the frequency of the direct field measurement leads to mis calibration of the rating curves 2 2 3 past storm events twelve past storm events occurring before the jan2013 flood event of simultaneous daily rainfall measurements and hourly water levels are used for model calibration hourly or 15 min water level records were transferred into flow hydrographs for the selected storm events based on the established rating curves among the selected events three have information on both gauges in saida and marj bisri and the rest nine events have only information on downstream saida gauge these events were derived from the period extending from 2000 till 2012 in which we consider no major changes on the characteristic of the river have occurred and the hydrometeorological network is the same one operating at the time of the flood these events vary in intensity of daily rainfall varying between 24 and 199 mm peak flow varying between 15 and 247 m3 s and duration varying between 1 and 7 days the selected events are the only clearly gauged and consistent for simulation events table 4 2 3 the january 2013 flood dataset the event of 07 january 2013 is one of the largest floods occurring in the last 25 years the post event measurements pictures videos and local witnesses makes this event interesting to assess the robustness of the proposed framework in reproducing flood events of no hydrometric measurements the presence of both hourly and daily rainfall measurements in addition to social media information on the duration of the storm event is also an added value 2 3 1 the flood magnitude on 6th of january 2013 at around 13 00 the intensity of light precipitation that lasted for several hours on the previous day started to increase reaching a maximum of 17 3 mm h at around 20 00 on the second day 7th of january at around 05 00 06 00 the awali river level rose and flooded in several locations along the coastal plains and in the middle marj bisri plain the downstream river gauge g 475 was subjected to failure by flood waters the flood left behind great damages to agricultural lands and green houses several cars and roadside walls were damaged causing massive traffic jams schools were obliged to close for three days 8th 10th january abdallah et al 2013 2 3 2 post event measurements field investigations of the jan2013 flood marks were performed two months after the flood event after which newspaper information local witnesses declarations and social media reports were analyzed at the time of the flood the post event field surveys were carried out to collect ground control and survey river cross sections measure water level traces that were still identified and estimate the peak discharge values identify hotspots and measure extent of floodplains interview locals who have witnessed the flood event and could support the authors not only by information but in many instances by photos and recorded videos collected photos and videos enabled to highlight some flood prone areas that were further investigated through field surveys to measure water levels a total of 57 post event points scattered in space were surveyed out of which 27 are measurements of high water marks fig 3 2 4 the sparse dataset in conclusion our data sparse region is a region characterised by data summarized in table 5 in the following form 1 past recorded storm events of daily rainfall measurements from ground rainfall gauges incapable of reflecting the rainfall intensity and spatial variability during the storm event hourly or 15 min water level measurements by two traditional river stage gauges mostly non functional during flood events and hourly or 15 min flow hydrographs extracted based on poorly defined rating curves 2 descriptive social media information on the past storm events related to the duration and spatial variability of the rainfall during the storm 3 a recent extreme flood event but destructed river stage gauge with daily and hourly rainfall measurements in one nearby rainfall station and post event measurements of peak flood discharge and high water marks 4 descriptive information from newspapers social media and field investigations on the extreme flood event related to the inundated areas time of flood peak duration of the storm and its spatial variability 3 the modelling framework 3 1 hydrological model hydrological rainfall runoff models vary in their complexity from simple lumped models to semi distributed and fully distributed models regardless that fully distributed models are capable of better representing the hydrological processes several difficulties arise when applying them in data sparse regions because of their complexity data requirements and parameter identifiability which may limit their efficiency and adequacy lerat et al 2012 however when sparse data is available semi distributed rainfall runoff models are still efficient alternatives thereof a semi distributed model based on the scs cn method for computing losses along with muskingum cunge and scs unit hydrograph methods for routing flow along channels and hillslopes were respectively selected the model was integrated within the hec hms software the modelling time step was equal to 30 min smaller than the sub basins estimated time of concentration to ensure that the flood peak is well captured by the model evapotranspiration losses were neglected based on the assumption that the evapotranspiration volume generated during a winter storm event is negligible compared to the runoff volume generated as demonstrated by knebl et al 2005 the baseflow in the model was estimated from the available water level records the induced flow by the hydropower production plants was estimated based on collected schedules of average monthly water flow in the facilities 1994 2015 rainfall runoff simulation of several events was then conducted for the whole catchment 301 km2 in a semi distributed approach over sub catchment units the simple scs curve number loss model scs 1972 was applied because it allows the estimation of direct surface runoff volume for given rainstorms based on a single parameter curve number which represents the basin s infiltration storage d asaro and grillone 2010 initial rough cn ranges are assigned for each sub catchment based on the knowledge of the land use and hsg combinations extracted from available information rainfall amounts calculated 5 days before each storm event reflect moderate soil moisture conditions of typical winter days in lebanon accordingly cn values fall within the average soil moisture conditions amcii 3 2 hydraulic model the 1d hec ras model was used to establish the water surface profiles this model was selected because it is a well known open software widely applied for hydraulic modelling it is usually combined with the hec hms and known for its low computational costs the hydraulic model is applied to the low main part of the river approximately 5 km of river length mostly subjected to flooding cross sections are performed at the gauge locations at locations of considerable changes in flow morphology slope geometry and roughness and at representative locations such as sub basins outlet of the hydrological model that serve as boundary conditions for the hydraulic model the centreline was traced together with the river banks based on the captured high resolution drone images the geometry of the river and floodplain is extracted from the fine resolution dem the results of the hydrological model are imported into the hydraulic model roughness values are initially estimated based on expert knowledge of channel properties these values are later manually calibrated by a trial and error approach to maximize the fit between the simulated water levels and the observed ones at arbitrarily selected post event locations on the river channel 3 3 modelling framework the modelling framework is divided into three major steps fig 4 step 1 involves performing the rainfall runoff modelling through hec hms software for selected past storm events parameters to be calibrated are selected based on the model sensitivity analysis model calibration and evaluation is performed aiming at defining a narrow range of model parameters which is taken equal to the estimated range from the calibration step 2 involves an uncertainty analysis based on the monte carlo sampling of model parameters within the narrow ranges estimated in step 1 the hydrological model is then run to simulate the hydrograph set of the jan2013 extreme event step 3 involves the hydraulic model simulation hec ras for the jan2013 flood event based on the hydrograph set obtained in step 2 to generate the respective water surface profiles post processing and terrain analysis to interpolate the water levels and extract the inundation area and flood map validation by the post event measurements a preliminary analysis was performed this includes the catchment and sub catchment delineation extraction of their characteristics and parameters and defining rough initial values of model parameters based on our knowledge of the basin s characteristics 3 3 1 hydrological model calibration and evaluation unlike classical calibration approaches that end up in a deterministic set of model parameters the calibration procedure herein is applied aiming at defining a narrow range of model parameters for uncertainty sampling this range is taken equal to the estimated range from the calibration the estimated parameter ranges are quite narrower than the wide feasible parameter ranges often defined in classical uncertainty analysis studies e g freer et al 1996 huang and liang 2006 which are often chosen arbitrarily or on a basis of physical argument to be wider than those expected for the catchment under study available and simultaneous rainfall and water level measurements are analysed to extract past storm events of reliable information it is preferable to select storm events of variable intensity and duration and occurring in different time of the year daily rainfall measurements were discretized uniformly into hourly measurements however this mostly applicable for floods of long duration and not flash floods indeed several other possible rainfall distributions can be applied and analyzed and may yield more accurate estimates of hourly rainfall depths in this study we choose the simplest approach uniform rainfall as a preliminary analysis in some cases additional information was obtained from social media reports and newspapers on the time period of occurrence of the maximum rainfall which is mainly a portion of the day in these cases recorded rainfall measurements at that day are discretized into hourly measurements uniformly over the period of occurrence of the maximum rainfall e g if we found information that the storm event was localized within the first quarter of the day daily rainfall is discretized over the first six hours of the day only this is mainly because there might not be any rain at all for several hours of the day and discretizing over the whole day may show values even for non rainy hours the calibration involves a combination of both manual and automated calibrations the manual calibration precedes the optimization to ensure that a physically meaningful set of initial parameters is used in the model based on initial conditions and on expert knowledge of the basin s physical properties the automated optimization is then applied to optimize the model parameters the resulting minimum and maximum values of each optimized parameter define an interval of narrow parameter ranges perhaps the more past events evaluated the better results are expected however there should be a certain number of events that ensures convergence in the calibration the convergence in calibration is obtained when calibrating on additional past events do not considerably change the estimated parameter ranges two main categories of evaluation indices were applied for model calibration the first category of indices is used to evaluate the model for the entire rainfall event 1 p e a k f l o w e r r o r p f e q obs peak q sim peak q obs peak 100 2 p h a s e e r r o r h p e τ obs τ sim 3 v o l u m e e r r o r v e v obs v sim v obs 100 where q obs peak and q sim peak are the peak observed and simulated flow values for each rainfall runoff event τ obs and τ sim are the peak times for the observed and simulated event v obs and v sim are the total runoff volume for the observed and simulated event respectively the second category is related to the evaluation of the time series of the rainfall runoff simulation most research projects involving watershed modelling utilize some type of predefined model evaluation techniques to compare simulated output with observed data a combination of graphical techniques dimensionless and error index statistics is used for model evaluation moriasi et al 2007 coefficient of correlation standard regression 4 r i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 5 n s e 1 i 1 n

i are the observed and simulated flow values for time step i q obs and q sim are the mean observed and simulated flow values for each event and n is the number of observations 3 3 2 uncertainty in the hydrological modelling the uncertainty propagation in this approach can be understood by analysing the uncertainty on the hydrological model parameters based on two approaches the first approach involves a sensitivity analysis for the hydrological model to select the key parameters mainly controlling and forcing the model results the second approach involves a fuzzy combination based on monte carlo simulation for the selected parameters robert and casella 2004 the selected parameters of minimized ranges in the previous step 1 are statistically sampled based on a uniformly distributed probability density function uniform distributions are considered to avoid any prior assumption on the parameters distribution other than their feasible ranges as discussed by freer et al 1996 random numbers are generated using the well19937c generator within hec hms panneton et al 2006 3 3 3 hydraulic model validation hydraulic models have been typically validated using water level or discharge values obtained from the hydrometric network available on the river however this is a major challenge when hydrometric measurements are lacking and when remote sensing products are not able to capture the flood event in this approach we choose to validate the model with the post event measurements of high water marks this step is preceded by a terrain analysis to extract the inundation area using the high resolution terrain model the simulated maximum water level bounds are matched with the observed water levels the root mean square error rmse objective function is used to evaluate the fit between the simulated uncertainty bounds of the water levels and the observed ones at the post event measurement locations 8 r m s e i 1 n h max obs h max sim 2 n h max obs and h max sim are the maximum observed and simulated water levels respectively and n is the number of post event maximum water level measurement points the rmse is zero if the observed and simulated water levels fit perfectly higher rmse error reflects more divergent values 4 results 4 1 step 1 hydrological model calibration and evaluation by past storm events 4 1 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the model was first assessed based on the 14 19 february 2012 storm event event 11 the event was selected because it is the closest to the jan2013 flood event the sensitivity analysis was performed at the river stage saida 475 and was based on the variation of the curve number parameter initial abstraction parameter percent impervious parameter and the lag time the reference parameter values are 50 4 for the cn 12 7 mm for the ia 7 7 hr for the lag time and 0 75 for the percent impervious the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 6 based on evaluating the total runoff volume the peak flow and the time of peak discharge at saida 475 gauge the curve number parameter was found to be the parameter that could mostly affect the calculation results the initial abstraction affects the runoff volume and peak flow whereas the impervious percent mainly affects the runoff volume the lag time mainly affects the time of peak runoff 4 1 2 calibration by past storm events to estimate parameter ranges following the sensitivity analysis the selected key parameters for calibration are the curve number the initial abstraction the lag time and the manning s coefficient model calibration and evaluation were carried out at two points corresponding to the positions of the gauge stations saida 475 and marj bisri 473 model calibration was performed on three steps the number of events is increased in each step and the parameter ranges are compared to the preceding ones allowing to search for the suitable number of events that ensures a convergence in the calibration the first step involves calibrating the model with 3 events arbitrarily chosen events 2 4 and 12 the second step involves calibrating with 6 events events 2 4 5 6 8 and 12 and the last step involves calibrating with the whole 12 events the parameter ranges for the different sub basin are taken equal to those obtained by the calibration in each step calibration with 3 events resulted in parameter ranges quite narrower than those obtained by calibrating with 6 events whereas calibrating with 6 and 12 events resulted in similar parameter ranges which means that our approach works well with 12 events calibrating with 3 events was not sufficient because analysing additional storm events further increases the parameter ranges this is because the additional events are more variable in terms of intensity allowing to obtain a wider parameter range in our case the similar parameter ranges obtained by 6 and 12 events indicates a convergence in calibration and allows us to say that we are stabilized with 12 events indeed this approach should be should be further assessed in additional applications because the selected number of past storm events impacts the resulting parameter ranges the different sub basin characteristics their arbitrarily estimated wide parameter ranges and the estimated ranges by calibrating with 12 events are presented in table 7 the calibration with 12 events resulted in the estimation of narrow ranges of the characteristic parameters of the different sub basins these ranges are narrower than the arbitrarily chosen wide parameter ranges the model was relatively more sensitive to the characteristic parameters of sub basin b1 and b2 which form around 60 of the total area and together contribute to over 31 of the total runoff for the selected storm events the cn of sub basin b1 found to vary from 50 to 62 the lag time varies from 232 to 248 min and the initial abstraction varies from 7 to 21 mm table 8 summarizes the model performance for the selected storm events in terms of the parameters described in eqs 1 7 the simulation of the 12 events resulted in an average volume error of 10 7 average peak flow error of 26 3 and an average phase error of 3 6 h the performance of the model was highly variable among the storm events the evaluation analysis resulted in an nse ranging between 0 84 and 0 06 r ranging between 0 93 and 0 58 rmse ranging between 1 46 and 19 7 m3 s and mae ranging between 0 62 and 8 7 m3 s the low nse values for events 2 3 9 and 10 are mainly because the observed water levels at saida gauge 475 presented large fluctuations that may not be related to the runoff generated by rainfall events but may be related to the sensitivity of the river stage gauge to any perturbation in the water flow that for example may be resulting from the floating objects carried by the river the low nse value for event 3 and 11 at marj bisri gauge 473 is mainly because the observed hydrograph presented a relatively high peak discharge which might be overestimated by the rating curve the good nse value for event 6 is related to discretising rainfall over the storm period of occurrence first quarter of the day which reduced the error in the time series and gave better peak flow value 4 2 step 2 uncertainty propagation flood event of 07 january 2013 the jan2013 storm event rainfall amounts recorded at the time of flood by the daily rainfall stations p1 p3 p11 p12 and p15 and the hourly rainfall station p10 are analogous with slightly lower values along the coastal area indicating no major spatial variation in rainfall the little difference in rainfall among stations is considered by assigning its relative weight preserving the same hyetograph distribution the uncertainty analysis involved the hydrological model parameters cn ia lag time and the manning s roughness based on the criteria illustrated by dimitriadis et al 2016 testing several parameter samples ranging from 100 to 5000 showed that the convergence in the resulting mean discharge and volume was achieved for sample size starting from 1000 parameters and that increasing the number of samples does not result in a noticeable change in the computed mean discharge and volume we choose to perform 2000 simulations which is equivalent to more than twelve values per model parameters for an adequate quantitative analysis of acceptable computational cost the parameters are statistically sampled following a uniformly distributed probability density function within their estimated ranges in step 1 to study the implication of the estimated parameter ranges on the model results four model simulations were performed these correspond to the wide parameter ranges defined in table 7 and the estimated parameter ranges by calibrating on 3 6 and 12 events the model simulated hydrographs at all sub catchments outlets the results of the four model simulations are presented in fig 5 at saida g 475 gauge the simulation based on the wide parameter ranges resulted in numerous possible model realisations of peak flow value ranging between 100 m3 s and 550 m3 s with a mean value of 260 m3 s in this case the results of the hydrological modelling are no more representative and may be replaced by empirical or lumped modelling approaches the simulation based on the estimated parameter ranges by 3 events resulted in few model realisations of peak flow value ranging between 276 m3 s and 364 m3 s with a mean value of 339 m3 s as expected this simulation 3 events is thought to be underestimating the possible peak flow values because it was based on unstable calibration simulations based on estimated parameter ranges by 6 and 12 events resulted in similar model realizations of peak flow values ranging between 324 m3 s and 429 m3 s with a mean value of 377 m3 s observed at 05 00 of 07 january 2013 given that the maximum rainfall intensity of 17 3 mm hr was observed at 20 00 the day before for these two simulations 6 events and 12 events the simulated total water volume ranges between 67 44 mm3 and 75 05 mm3 with a mean value of 71 49 mm3 the last two simulations reduce uncertainty in the peak flow values and seem to be satisfactory because of the stable model calibration 4 3 step 3 hydraulic modelling and flood map validation by post event measurements the hec ras model was applied to the low coastal area that corresponds to the channel running in sub basins b8 and b9 the channel is bounded upstream by joun hydropower plant and downstream by the gauge station g 475 and the sea mouth the resulting hydrographs of the hydrological model corresponding to the 12 events simulation were then assigned as upstream and downstream boundary conditions and input lateral inflows at junctions for the hydraulic model the propagation of uncertainty through the hydraulic model was examined using the previously established bounds maximum mean and minimum flow hydrographs providing three realizations of the flood extent the hydraulic model results are presented in fig 6 the resultant flood map is presented in fig 7 93 of the observed water levels fell within the simulated uncertainty bounds and found to be closer to the mean with rmse error of 0 26 m the rmse error was found to be 0 7 m and 0 6 m for the maximum and minimum uncertainty bounds respectively with an rmse error in the range of the dem resolution 10 cm the results of the hydraulic modelling are found to be very promising 5 discussion 5 1 opportunities in the model coupling approach a wide range of hydrological and hydraulic models is nowadays available out of which many are open software and easy to use by the scientific community the coupling between these models has been also widely discussed in literature the hec hms and the hec ras models are among these models these open software have been successfully used in many case studies examples include the hec hms model on the llobregat river in catalonia amengual et al 2007 the misai and wan an catchments in china oleyiblo and li 2010 sixteen sub catchments in johor malaysia shamsudin et al 2011 and the balijore nala watershed in india choudhari et al 2014 examples on the hec ras model include the severn river in uk horritt and bates 2002 the eno river strouds creek in north carolina and brazos river in texas cook and merwade 2009 the po river in italy di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and the xerias river in greece papaioannou et al 2017 the hec hms and the hec ras models have been successfully coupled in different study cases examples include the san antonio river basin in texas knebl et al 2005 and the giofiros basin in greece koutroulis and tsanis 2010 sufficient discussions have been presented in literature to assess the use of many of these models and evaluate their coupling performance these models have been tested against classical data in well gauged basins and found to be successful in this project we do not aim to assess the performance of the model structure the performance of the model structure can be tested with classical data to be valid for application with sparse data based on what we have mentioned before that most of the river basins are data sparse basins we aim to discuss the opportunity of applying these hydrological hydraulic models using sparse data unlike classical approaches that involve calibrating the model with one past storm event the robustness of the applied approach is related to the evaluation of the model with several past storm events of variable intensities the proper number of past events is selected when calibration based on additional past events do not considerably change the estimated parameter ranges however this is not straightforward this number may vary from one application to another depending on the variability of the events in terms of intensity period of occurrence of the events how close are the events to the particular event under study and whether there was evolution in the landuse or modification to the river channel and number of parameters to evaluate perhaps the proper number of past events necessary for the hydrological hydraulic modelling has always been an open question in hydrology koutroulis and tsanis 2010 calibrated their model based on 8 events garambois et al 2013 evaluated their study based on 10 events and massari et al 2014 calibrated and validated their model based on 16 events given the scarcity of data about floods in the area 12 events of variable intensity is an acceptable number in hydrology and was found to be sufficient to ensure convergence in the calibration this is clear from the results of calibration of the model by 6 and 12 events where the parameter ranges do not change considerably and the model is quite stable around this parameter range the selected events are of variable intensities involving low flow as well as high flow events allowing to obtain sufficient ranges of variation of the hydrological parameters out of the 12 events 5 are considered low flow events events 2 3 4 7 and 8 peak flow ranging between 17 and 29 m3 s 4 are moderate flow events events 5 9 10 and 12 peak flow ranging between 68 and 86 m3 s and 3 are high flow events events 1 6 and 11 peak flow ranging between 119 and 163 m3 s the events were selected for the period between january 2000 and march 2012 for the studied period no major changes to the landuse and the river network were observed and the same hydrometeorological network was operating moreover the study is limited to evaluating only 4 parameters that are thought to mostly impact the results of modelling the parameter ranges obtained after evaluating the model with the past events can define narrower parameter ranges for uncertainty evaluation perhaps the more past events evaluated the better results are expected the approach is not suitable for evaluating a big number of parameters because it is economically unfeasible to evaluate a large number of past events that might not be available in data sparse regions the approach might not be suitable when considerable changes in the flow regime or in the basin s characteristics are noticed with an nse ranging from 0 06 to 0 84 the model performance is highly variable low nse values are obtained for minor as well as major events therefore model performance cannot be clearly related to the event type however low nse when modelling flood events doesn t mean necessary a bad simulation it can be due to a simple translation of the hyetograph moussa 2010 or data quality issues for high magnitude events events 1 and 12 the model tends to underestimate the peak flow mainly because the discretisation of the daily rainfall measurements into hourly rainfall measurements does not reflect the actual rainfall intensity which is expected to be higher moreover the low reliability of the estimated rating curves might produce higher observed peak flow values for events exceeding the maximum stage by the rating curve see for example event 11 the peak flow estimated by the upstream gauge g 473 by 246 5 m3 s far exceeds the peak flow estimated by the downstream gauge g 475 by 118 7 m3 s in some cases events 2 3 9 and 10 the flow hydrographs exhibited large fluctuations that affected the performance of the model these fluctuations are not linked to precipitation patterns because the majority are observed when no rainfall is recorded the mismatch between the precipitations and observed water levels can be linked to either an error in rainfall measurementor to a malfunctioning of the river stage gauge that is highly sensitive to any disturbance induced into the river flow at this stage and considering the low reliability of the rating curves and the lack of hourly rainfall estimates these should be considered satisfactory results 5 2 uncertainty propagation the uncertainty in the model results is a propagation of several uncertainties inherent mainly in the input data model parameters and model structure in data sparse regions the uncertainty inherent in the hydrological model input and model parameters may be the major sources of uncertainty compared to the hydrological model structure this is because the selected hydrological model structure is widely accepted and have been verified before on several properly gauged basins worldwide and the uncertainties inherent in its structure are negligible compared to the poor uncertain data available this might be a difference between hydrological and hydraulic models in which the uncertainty inherent in the hydraulic model structure might outperform the one emerged from the hydraulic model parameters as demonstrated by dimitriadis et al 2016 however additional hydrological model structures through other software should be tested in future research to further test this statement the lack of sufficient observational data necessary to parameterize the model is the major source of uncertainty in the model parameters which is propagated to the output variables classical hydrological modelling techniques in well gauged basins involve calibrating the model with a set of past observation data the result is a defined set of parameters capable to a certain extent of well reproducing the hydrological rainfall runoff transformations within the basins in a deterministic way on the other side if no model calibration is performed analysing the uncertainty propagation through modelling based on a wide range of feasible parameter ranges will result in numerous possible model realisations sometimes when the uncertainty bounds are too wide the results of the modelling are no more representative and can be substituted by other empirical or simplified methods based on what have been discussed the calibration approach applied in this study aims to define the hydrological model parameters ranges to reduce uncertainty in the output flows the 12 events model simulation resulted in a peak flow difference of around 105 m3 s between the maximum and minimum uncertainty bounds this is much better than solely performing the uncertainty analysis based on the arbitrarily chosen wide parameter ranges that resulted in a peak flow difference of around 450 m3 s the future work involves testing this approach on other study sites to assess the effect of variable number of past storm events chosen for calibration rainfall is the major input data to the model of major uncertainty inherent in the time step of measurement especially in regions characterized by flash floods of response times in the order of hours discretizing the daily rainfall measurements into hourly measurements over the period of occurrence of maximum rainfall was found to be encouraging this interprets the relatively good nse value obtained for event 6 for which rainfall was discretised over the first quarter of the day only the time period of occurrence of maximum rainfall further analysis is to be performed to compare different rainfall discretization methods to analyse the uncertainty induced by the time step of measurement especially when no information on the time of occurrence of the rain event is available other sources of rainfall data uncertainties are inherent in its spatial variability and measurement method such uncertainties can be ignored compared to the uncertainties inherent in the time step of measurement because the jan2013 storm event was widely spread over the whole country with no major spatial variation in the rainfall intensity observed over the relatively small basin s area the analogous records of six daily rainfall stations well distributed over the area also support our observation and reduces the uncertainty inherent in the spatial variability of rainfall and in its measured values 5 3 opportunities in post event measurements the spatial water level measurements based on high water marks such as fragments in trees traces left by water along the river section and floodplain and water lines on building walls were acknowledged by several scientists in literature e g horritt and bates 2002 borga et al 2008 fuentes andino et al 2017 indeed these measurements are biased by river modification over time and a greater uncertainty is associated with rapid flow conditions despite this uncertainty those measurements may represent the best available evidence for flood events the uncertainty in measurements can be assessed by the field surveyors themselves considering the conditions that formed the high water marks in rapid flow conditions and if good care was taken when measuring the water peaks uncertainty in measurements may not exceed the 0 15 m as suggested by the usgs koenig et al 2016 in this study no major modification to the river channel was observed maximum water level measurements were carefully chosen with proper awareness unreliable or confusing points with variable or unclear high water marks were avoided allowing to keep only the clear and best quality points this evaluation criteria limited the number of post event measurements to 27 measurements in some cases an average of two or three water marks was estimated to improve confidence in the measurement sometimes viewing the complete set of points of a water line on one side of the bank and comparing it to the opposite bank allows estimating the best water line moreover information on water levels obtained from local witnesses was considered reliable because the field survey was performed in two months after the flood event and the local witnesses memory about the event was still fresh in this study and based on our observation the uncertainty in the post event measurements may not exceed the 0 5 m despite this uncertainty most of the observed water levels fall within the uncertainty bounds and are very close to the mean simulation of the hydraulic model in the lack of hydrometric measurements the results indicate the robustness of the applied approach in modelling flood levels and the capability of validating the results on different locations scattered in space the resolution of the topographic data is a key element in the accuracy of the hydraulic model casas et al 2006 cook and merwade 2009 several studies in literature have pointed out to the sensitivity of the hydraulic models to the resolution of digital elevation models tsubaki and fujita 2010 papaioannou et al 2016 savage et al 2016 many have acknowledged the use of high resolution dem s for hydraulic modelling and flood mapping specially with basins of rapidly varied topography and steep river slopes schumann et al 2009 bates 2012 brandt 2016 in this approach validation of the hydraulic model with post event measurements in space is encouraging when based on a fine resolution dem a prior simulation for the hydraulic model was performed based on the available 10 m resolution dem the hydraulic model experienced a lot of numerical instabilities the resulting water levels were far beyond the real observed water levels and in some locations were more than triple the observed ones this is primarily because the geometry and slopes of the river channel and the floodplain are not well represented in the coarse dem i e a river channel of width in the order of 5 10 m and a flood plain in the order of 30 50 m are unrealistically presented by 3 5 cells only in the coarse dem in hydraulic models errors induced by poor terrain and slopes representation are much higher than those induced by poor estimation of the manning s coefficient see for example jaber and mohtar 2003 with the advancement of the remote sensing and drone photography techniques fine resolution dem s are expected to be widely spread in the future these techniques mainly the drone photography are being favourable because of their ease of use high accuracy and wide applicability mccabe et al 2017 leitão and de sousa 2018 accordingly the availability of the fine resolutions dem s should not be an issue in data sparse regions in the coming years 5 4 what if sparse spatial data are better than classical temporal data calibration and evaluation of the hydrological model with several past storm events increased the results robustness unlike classical uncertainty analysis techniques in ungauged basins involving wide parameter ranges the results robustness is obtained by evaluating the model with several storm events of variable intensities that allowed the estimation of possible parameter ranges of the hydrological model that are narrow enough to reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions moreover the presented results have to be compared with the classical calibration approach that results in a set of deterministic model parameters and do not allow easily for the uncertainty propagation through the model classically hydraulic models are calibrated and validated based on classical temporal data at one point these are measured water levels or flow values at the gauge stations however several potential errors arise when using this type of observational data related to the accuracy of measurement and its spatial resolution for large flood events and when river stage gauges are not damaged by the flood water level measurements may exceed the maximum gauge measurement levels or exceed the maximum value used in the derivation of the rating curves that are unable to reflect the hydraulic behaviour of the rated section horritt et al 2010 even though the river stage accurately measures the water levels that are within the range of the rating curves it is still required to obtain information on other cross sections based on field investigation of flood marks those levels often exceed the range of stage discharge relationships that may exist on site gaume and borga 2008 despite the narrow temporal sampling of the water levels at the river stage there is lack of spatial data that do not allow the verification of the distributed model predictions whereas the use of finer resolution dem increases the confidence in the distributed model predictions moussa and cheviron 2015 the use of sparse spatial data at one date in the form of post event measurements of water levels scattered in space alone supports the spatial validation of the flood inundation model such spatial sparse information of non binary nature may be used in the lack of short time step temporal hydrograph on a given point especially in time periods of approximately steady flow conditions whereas the classical temporal data at one point of too sparse spatial resolution should always be accompanied with other diverse sources such as the aerial photos remote sensing or post event measurements of flood marks to allow the spatial validation of the model predictions on the other hand the broader distribution and the greater number of post event measurements the better validation is achieved because this type of data is subjected to several limitations hunter et al 2005 for example in the case of unsteady flow conditions the flood inundation could behave differently in the upstream and downstream areas and the post event measurements might not reflect the flood dynamics 5 5 model complexity vs performance for a given condition of data availability the more complex the flood model is the greater is the risk of the uncertainty inherent in the required input data model parameters and in the model structure applying complex models in a data sparse basin cannot be easy verified several studies on dem based geomorphic approaches have been performed in literature to delineate flood prone areas these simplified methods that rely on basin geomorphologic feature characterization revealed to be an efficient low cost strategy e g moussa 1997 noman et al 2001 manfreda et al 2014 samela et al 2017 the geomorphic approaches allow highlighting preliminarily the locations of flooded areas and give rough estimation on the extent and depth of flood inundation such approaches proved to be efficient in large scale applications samela et al 2017 and the outcomes are relatively sufficient to inform decision makers on the range of variability of the flood hazard for general planning purposes however general geomorphic approaches may not be very efficient when detailed information on the inundation levels and extent is required especially in small scale applications and therefore cannot easily replace the hydrological hydraulic approaches manfreda et al 2014 moreover most geomorphic approaches require probabilistic information on rainfall e g design rainfalls of 50 years 100 years etc obtained from statistical analysis of rainfall series and make use of the hydraulic scaling functions based on contributing areas to estimate water levels these estimations based on probabilistic input do not always allow the detailed understanding of particular events of unknown severity level such as the jan2013 flood event working with particular event is not like working with statistical approaches although complex models require an increasing number of data to reach adequate reliability and it is preferable to be avoided but for practical problems the use of complex distributed models is inevitable grayson and blöschl 2001 it is of a challenge to better use the available information and to seek additional information to increase the confidence in model simulations model complexity depends on how we define it on the site of application and on the time of application what was considered complex several years ago is now simpler with the rapid evolution of computational power development of very high resolution dem s and the widespread of geographic information systems gis the presented application is not much complicated but rather an intermediate position between complex and simple approaches indeed several simplifications of the processes representation were applied to reduce model requirements and number of parameters this can be illustrated for example by using the scs curve number approach for runoff computation which is empirical in origin along with the scs unit hydrograph routing method 1d hec ras model can be considered as simple by comparison to 2d or 3d hydraulic models added value information from social media post event surveys and past storm events helped constrain the model and improve the quality of results the availability of a high resolution dem encouraged the application of the 1d hydraulic model hec ras which proved to give reasonably promising results the error in the simulated water levels is in the order of 20 30 cm which might not be achieved when applying simplified geomorphic approaches however this doesn t prove our approach will be efficient in all circumstances but at least it strengthens our confidence in its value 6 conclusions the objective of this paper was to assess whether there is opportunity to constrain hydrological hydraulic models with sparse data to simulate extreme floods and establish water levels that can be useful for flood maps adapted for basin scale applications for this purpose we develop a framework based on a coupled hydrological hydraulic model constrained by past storm events and post event measurements the approach is applied to the awali river basin 301 km2 in lebanon particularly to simulate the investigated early january 2013 extreme flood event the hydrological model was calibrated with 12 past storm events aiming at defining narrow hydrological parameter ranges the uncertainty in the model parameters was assessed by performing monte carlo simulation for the estimated parameter ranges the uncertainty simulation gave satisfactory results it was found that the uncertainty in the resulting outflow values is reduced when compared with running simulations based on arbitrarily chosen wide parameter ranges social media information on the event characteristics especially on the duration of maximum rainfall was an added value to constrain the hydrological model simulations post event measurements of high water marks were promising in validating the flood map in space the results show the potentials and the limitations of applying hydrological hydraulic models using sparse data and the challenge of producing flood maps that can replace the coarse resolution regional maps the clear advantage of the proposed method is that it is a tailor made approach adapted for basin scale applications in data sparse regions using the maximum data available and aiming at producing inundation maps that can perform better than regional maps the method allows modelling with reduced uncertainty particular flood events in terms of estimation of the flood hydrographs flood water levels and mapping the inundated area it has the potential to enable crowdsourcing of information for flood events in the form of spatial post event measurements social media information local witnesses along with pictures and videos such crowdsourced information are now gaining favor in data sparse regions as a way to compensate the weaknesses in the traditional measurement networks moreover the method has the potential to include high resolution digital elevation models that are now evolving at an unprecedented pace the coupled hydrologic hydraulic model is constrained by past storm events and post events measurements and the results are estimations of the flood water levels along the floodplain with accuracy less than 1 m the interesting results reveal that good spatial measurements of one event even of very short time series are significant in supporting the hydrological hydraulic modeling these sparse spatial data at one date may be used in the lack of classical temporal data at the gauge stations the approach can serve as a tool for damage assessment of flood events it supports urban planning and structural design of flood protection measures on a local scale the approach when combined with organized real time crowdsourcing can serve as a part of a flood forecasting system finally when classical data are lacking the use of sparse data in a classical modelling approach is encouraging and the proposed framework can be applied to other data sparse regions facing the same problems acknowledgements this research is part of a phd thesis of the first author funded by the

6996,hydrological hydrodynamic modelling of basins rivers and large bodies of water such as lakes and lagoons is usually performed by external coupling of hydrological hydraulic models and 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models therefore the river discharges into the lake are calculated by using the hydrologic model the data is used then as an input to the hydrodynamic model this approach allows for a detailed simulation of lake or lagoon hydrodynamics and circulation however when the objective is solely to simulate water levels and flooded areas this approach may become too costly making it difficult to establish operational systems such as those for flood forecasting therefore in the present study we propose a first integrated approach using one single hydrologic hydraulic model the mgb iph model to simulate complex systems such as wind shear influence this model was applied to simulate the patos lagoon pl basin located in brazil and uruguay countries results showed that it was possible to use the single model to simulate hydrographs flooded areas and water levels in the pl basin results of performance indicators in the lakes and lagoons were within the range of results available in the literature improvements of model performance metrics were verified with the inclusion of wind effect in the flow routing algorithm thus encouraging the use of the proposed model for the establishment of flood forecasting systems or for the simulation of other similar hydrological systems keywords hydrological hydrodynamic modelling large scale modelling integrated modelling river lagoon systems 1 introduction large scale hydrological models have been useful for many applications including studies focusing on the assessment of climate change eum et al 2017 sorribas et al 2016 xu et al 2005 and land use changes kundu et al 2017 matheussen et al 2000 impacts on water resources flood hazards and flood risk assessments komi et al 2017 dottori et al 2016 falter et al 2016 hydrological forecasting kauffeldtet al 2016 fan et al 2015a b c d thielen et al 2009 water quality fan et al 2015b and hydro biogeochemical processes zhang et al 2002 large scale hydrological modelling has been constantly improved in recent decades for example due to growing computational capacity and new remote sensing data availability schmugge et al 2002 many large scale hydrological models are mere conceptual models as a physically based approach usually requires a large amount of data which is normally not available for large basins ma et al 2016 todini 2007 additionally these models mostly use simple flow routing methods saleh et al 2013 hodges 2013 such as a sequence of linear reservoirs lindström et al 2010 the kinematic wave approximations de roo et al 2000 the muskingum method neitsch et al 2002 hattermann et al 2005 or the muskingum cunge method collischonn et al 2007 while having the advantage of being more robust and requiring less computational effort and data the use of a simple flow routing method does not allow for the simulation of backwater and floodplain storage effects to overcome these problems some authors have coupled large scale hydrological models with hydrodynamic models in order to simulate complex river systems lian et al 2007 paz et al 2010 falter et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2011 2013 inoue et al 2008 biancamaria et al 2009 in these approaches simple flow routing methods are used to generate the output river discharges which are used as an input into the complex hydrodynamic systems that are modelled on more detailed hydrodynamic methods fully integrated modelling of large scale river basins and complex hydrodynamic systems also have been developed in recent decades if we consider an integrated approach the use of a single hydrological hydrodynamic model which allows for the use of one detailed flow routing method for the entire catchment and riverine system in an integrated approach only one model would be necessary to simulate large scale basins and complex hydrodynamic systems as an example paiva et al 2011 proposed a modified version of the mgb iph model first introduced by collischonn et al 2007 by adding a new flow routing algorithm based on the full saint venant equations although it was possible to use only this model for the entire system to increase computational efficiency full saint venant more than twenty times slower the authors chose to use the muskingum cunge flow routing method for headwater regions of the river network and a hydrodynamic method for plain areas the model was applied for the purus river basin achieving good results later paiva et al 2013 used the same approach to model the entire amazon river basin pontes et al 2015 2017 also modified the mgb iph model by replacing the muskingum cunge flow routing method for the local inertial method developed by bates et al 2010 in the applications the muskingum cunge and the local inertial flow routing methods were compared for the entire araguaia river basin in south america although being approximately ten times slower than the muskingum cunge method the authors proved that the local inertial approach allowed for a better representation of the system which incorporates extensive floodplains and wetland areas a particularly challenging situation occurs when relatively large lakes or lagoons are connected to or are part of the drainage network considering the strong interaction between these systems and their watershed counterpart ji 2008 modelling their hydrodynamic behavior is considerably difficult especially when trying to assess the effect of land use changes and climate changes in addition important backwater effects can occur with situations in which the reversing of flows is possible many natural system configurations can also occur such as connections between lakes through channels or lateral connections between the groundwater and between streams and lakes li et al 2017 peters and buttle 2010 skafel 2000 large lakes and lagoons in drainage networks also add complexity due to the effects of wind on hydrodynamics ji 2008 möller et al 2001 schoen et al 2014 when a large scale basin to be simulated contains large water bodies such as lakes and lagoons the standard approach is to couple a hydrologic model externally with a 2d or 3d hydrodynamic model where the outputs of the hydrologic model are used as inputs in the hydrodynamic lagoon or lake model offline coupling or loose coupling it is possible to find examples of this kind of study in the recent literature dargahi and setegn 2011 coupled the hydrologic semi distributed conceptual model swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2002 with the 3d hydrodynamic model gemss generalized environmental modeling system for surface waters erm 2006 to simulate lake tana in ethiopia and successfully validated their approach for the year 2006 using observed data li et al 2014 used the outputs of a distributed physically based hydrologic model based on the watlac code zhang and werner 2009 zhang and li 2009 as inputs in a 2d hydrodynamic model based on the mike 21 model developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi 2009 to simulate the large scale basin of lake poyang located in the middle reach of the river yangtze basin in china results showed that the model appropriately simulated the lake hydrodynamics regarding water fluxes and inundated area changes due to seasonality and zhang et al 2017 studied the same system the poyang lake basin using the swat model for the river basin simulation and the delft3d model roelvink and van banning 1995 deltares 2014 for the poyang lake simulation the offline coupling approach and the use of 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models for simulating lakes and watersheds have the advantage of allowing for the simulation of the water circulation within the lake area with detail additionally many hydrodynamic models used for simulating these systems have water quality modules that can be used to get insights of temporal and spatial variations of water quality and ecological parameters e g fragoso et al 2009 deltares 2014 dhi 2011 for lakes studies 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models have been often coupled with water quality models to simulate water quality and ecological proprieties of the lake such as concentration of nutrients oxygen algae and cyanobacteria wang et al 2017 bocaniov et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 despite the detailed hydrodynamic information provided by coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic models for large water bodies simulation this approach has some drawbacks 1 the most obvious is the time and work required to build two different models and adapt the inputs and outputs between them 2 the processing time of detailed hydrodynamic models is often considerably larger wicks et al 2004 lin et al 2006 hodges 2013 3 backwater effects in the connection between rivers simulated with the hydrologic model and lakes simulated with the hydrodynamic model cannot be accounted for as the offline coupling happens in one direction and therefore the hydrodynamic model can t influence the hydrological model li et al 2014 verified problems related to this disadvantage when they ran a simulation for lake poyang in order to consider backwater effects in the connection between the lake and its tributaries the authors expanded the area to be simulated by the hydrodynamic model to also comprehend a part of the tributaries however they comment that the backwater effects would propagate even further than included in the hydrodynamic model and therefore they would have to change the model configuration to enable the analysis of these effects 4 the drainage area and the groundwater that contribute directly to the lake or lagoon can have an important influence in the systems hydrodynamics and modifications have to be made to account for these areas li et al 2014 4 real time operational systems and data assimilation routines for the establishment of hydrological forecasting systems are more difficult to be implemented for this approach as processing routines must be prepared for both models and also be compatible in all time steps liu et al 2012 when the objective is not to provide detailed insight of lake and lagoon hydrodynamics but to estimate inundated areas and water levels in the lakes and establish large scale or even develop global or continental hydrological forecasting systems for all water bodies this approach becomes costly therefore considering the interest to overcome the disadvantages of the coupling of hydrological and hydrodynamic models for forecasting purposes on rivers and large water bodies and the recent improvements in hydrological models to use more detailed flow routing approaches in the present study we test the possibility of using one single integrated hydrological hydrodynamic model to simulate basins and lagoons in a single unified manner to do this we chose the most recent version of the conceptual and semi distributed mgb iph model pontes et al 2017 and as the test case the patos lagoon pl basin in south america 180 000 km2 to do so it is important to consider however that wind has a relevant effect on flow of large water bodies such as lakes and lagoons ji 2008 due to the importance of the wind influence when simulating large water bodies many 2d and 3d hydraulic models include this effect such as the princeton ocean model pom mike3 and mike21 dhi 2011 iph a borche 1996 iph eco model fragoso et al 2009 telemac mascaret lhf 1997 and the delft3d model deltares 2014 furthermore including wind effect on hydrological hydrodynamic models would be advantageous not only for lakes but also for the simulation of floodplains or large rivers especially if located in coastal areas for example mashriqui et al 2014 stated that only using the hec ras model usace 2010 without inclusion of wind effect would not be enough to properly simulate water levels on the potomac river in the united states which is a wide river located near the coast additionally the authors also recognize that including the wind effect in the hec ras model would improve the flood forecasting systems for at least 14 different coastal rivers in the united states indeed due to the effect that wind can exert over riverine systems some 1d hydrodynamic models such as isisflow sobek deltares 2017 and mike11 dhi 2009 already included wind influence in their formulations considering the gains of introducing wind effect in flow routing modules of hydrological hydrodynamic models and the instant limitation that ignoring this variable would impose on large water bodies simulation in this study we also propose and test a modified version of the mgb iph model by including the wind effect on the flow routing formulation thus we aim to answer three main questions 1 is it possible to simulate rivers lakes and lagoons with one integrated hydrological hydrodynamic model and coherently estimate water levels and inundated areas 2 will the inclusion of wind effect improve water level simulations 3 to what extent can the input data and parameters be used to improve the representation to answer these questions we first tested the possibility of simulating the lp basin with the hydrological model without the inclusion of wind effect in the flow routing module experiment 1 then we simulated the patos lagoon basin with the modified mgb iph model considering wind effect experiment 2 other simulations were carried out to further understand the modelled wind influence in the system as well as to experiment with the usage of different input datasets experiment 3 the tests of experiment 3 include i sensitivity analysis of included model parameters through wind influence simulation ii analysis of an alternative wind data source with different spatial and temporal availability and iii verification of the inclusion of a tide by modifying the downstream boundary condition 2 study area our case study is the patos lagoon pl watershed with approximately 180 000 km2 located in both uruguay and brazil in the southernmost state of rio grande do sul the basin location and main rivers and lagoons are shown in fig 1 the pl is a water body of major importance for southern brazil described by kjerfve 1986 as the world s largest choked lagoon therefore representing an ideal location for testing the proposed approach the pl has its main inflows from rivers gravataí 2020 km2 sinos 3747 km2 caí 5057 km2 taquari 26492 km2 jacuí 71600 km2 camaquã 21259 km2 piratini 6917 km2 and jaguarão 5780 km2 in the brazilian territory and rivers tacuari 3600 km2 and cebollati 30000 km2 in the uruguayan territory the rivers piratini jaguarão tacuari e cebollati flow into the mirim lagoon 62250 km2 basin area which flows into the pl estuary through são gonçalo channel the gravataí sinos caí and jacuí rivers form the guaíba lake 496 km2 surface area next to the city of porto alegre which flows directly into the top north of pl most of the pl basin area is located within the rio grande do sul rs state including the state s capital city porto alegre as well as nine of the ten cities with the greater economic development index in the state an international harbour at the city of rio grande south is located near the patos lagoon outflow to the sea and is a commercially strategic place for mercosul countries the lagoon connects the harbour to porto alegre through its navigable path of 258 km therefore playing a fundamental role in the state s importation and exportation rates besides being vital for the state s economy the basin exerts a strong influence on environmental and social aspects the pl basin area filled with wetlands includes several conservation units two of which are considered biosphere reserves by unesco united nations educational scientific and cultural organization indeed the pl estuary and its environmental richness have been recognized and studied by many authors capitoli et al 1977 1978 hartmann and schettini 1991 tagliani et al 2003 water resource problems in pl basin are related to both water quality and quantity and have social and environmental effects flood events routinely take place in the system and frequently affect many people living near the tributaries the guaíba lake and pl dry periods can cause an increase in salinity levels in the lagoon and impact agriculture additionally during dry summer periods algae growth in the guaiba lake usually hinders water treatment water quality issues affect for example more than 50 000 people involved with artisanal fisheries schafer and reis 2008 an activity sensitive to pollution sources in the basin tagliani et al 2003 and to hydrological and wind regimes the pl is approximately 250 km in length in the nne ssw direction 40 km in width and it can be classified as a shallow lagoon because of its average depth of 5 m pl reaches the sea by a narrow 1 2 km wide and 20 km long channel as with most of the world s choked lagoons the effects of tides to upstream regions are softened by the long narrow outlet channel therefore having less impact on the lagoon s internal water circulation which is mostly controlled by wind and river flow möller et al 1996 möller et al 2001 studied the lagoon s hydrodynamic behavior and stated that most of the time when the inflows are relatively low the internal circulation is controlled mainly by the wind while during late winter the large river flows are the main factor controlling circulation in the lagoon furthermore in a longer timescale seasonal the river flow influence is marked by the establishment of an average water level which is modulated in shorter timescales mostly correspondent to the passage of frontal systems 6 18 days by local wind these short period water level variations are addressed in the present study as high frequency oscillations to simplify further reference several studies were carried out with the aim to understand the hydrodynamic behavior of the lagoon möller et al 1996 möller et al 2001 garcia et al 2001 garcia et al 2004 marques and möller 2008 barros et al 2014 cavalcante and mendes 2014 however an integrated model of the basin was never proposed and the river inflows to the lagoon were frequently assumed to be a combination of the flow from the three main tributaries jacuí taquari and camaquã rivers not accounting for all the other contributions to the lagoon the present study therefore also contributes to the literature to fill this gap as the integrated developed model does not simplify the lagoon inflows 3 methodology the methodology used in the present research consisted mainly in the development of a version of the mgb iph model for the pl basin and the subsequent model application and validation without wind effects the inclusion of wind shear stress in the flood routing algorithm and the model application and validation using wind effect the full model was further tested with different input datasets parameter values and downstream boundary conditions in summary three experiments were conducted i experiment 1 hydrological modelling and flow routing without wind effect ii experiment 2 hydrological modelling and flow routing with wind effect iii experiment 3 additional tests to assess input data impacts in the following sub sections we present 3 1 a description of the hydrological model focusing on the routing scheme 3 2 the input data used 3 3 experiment 1 procedures 3 4 experiment 2 procedures and additional data and 3 5 experiment 3 tests and additional data 3 1 mgb iph model the mgb iph modelo de grandes bacias instituto de pesquisas hidráulicas model first described internationally by collischonn et al 2007 is a large scale hydrological model that calculates streamflow from precipitation data and other climatic variables temperature wind velocity radiation atmospheric pressure and relative humidity this model has been widely used for large scale simulation in south america for example for climate change evaluations land use change studies real time hydrological forecasting watershed management propositions decision support systems among others collischonn et al 2005 nóbrega et al 2011 bravo et al 2012 buarque et al 2012 paiva et al 2011 2012 2013 pereira et al 2012 bayer and collischonn 2013 fan et al 2014 2015a b c 2016 2017 the hydrological model ordinarily runs with a daily time step and is open source see https www ufrgs br lsh the mgb iph is a conceptual semi distributed model in which the basin is sub divided into smaller unit catchments and further into hydrological response units hrus categorized by combinations of land use and soil types the mgb iph simulates vertical energy and water budget at each hru while the runoff generated within each unit catchment is routed to the stream network using linear reservoirs in addition a flow routing method is used to propagate flows downstream along river networks further details about model equations and assumptions can be found in collischonn et al 2007 and pontes et al

f 0 to solve the momentum equation we used the explicit local inertial method developed by bates et al 2010 which was successfully tested in recent applications to mgb iph pontes et al 2017

curve that relates water surface elevation flooded volume and flooded area in this case a floodplain profile is constructed for each unit catchment through inundation of the sub grid topography the latter given by a high resolution digital elevation model dem finally flow depth is computed by subtracting water surface elevation from channel bottom elevation according to eq 6 6 h i t 1 y i t 1 z

using hydraulic geometry relationships hgs i e that relate such parameters with drainage area or mean annual discharge this approach is very common in large scale modelling since detailed channel geometry is usually not available e g coe et al 2008 decharme et al 2011 yamazaki et al 2011 mejia and reed 2011 paiva et al 2013 fan et al 2015b fig 2 a shows the spatial discretization of variables the depth h is calculated in the center of unit catchments and the flow is calculated at interfaces between unit catchments fig 2 b show an example of discretization of a basin into several unit catchments in addition the quasi 2d scheme pontes et al 2017 fleischmann et al 2018 was adopted herein to route the flow into multiple downstream directions within the lagoon system this means that a given unit catchment can transfer water to another unit catchment not only through a river channel but also from lateral connections when the flow depth gets higher than the channel bankfull depth in order to represent these connections in a simplified fashion we consider that all unit catchments adjacent to a given one are connected by a rectangular channel whose length can be computed by approximating the shape of each connected unit catchment to the shape of a circle 7 l a 1 π a 2 π where l is the channel length between two connected unit catchments km a 1 and a 2 are their respective singular not upstream accumulated drainage areas km2 note that the channel length is depicted as the sum of the radius of adjacent circles i e the euclidian distance between their centers it is worth mentioning that only unit catchments inside the lagoon were laterally connected and allowed to route flow in multiple downstream directions i e the quasi 2d scheme while flow routing in rivers outside this region was computed only with the 1d local inertial method the width of lateral connections was globally set as 50 m as a standard value in order to avoid model instability the courant friedrichs levy cfl condition must be satisfied during simulations which used an adaptive time step from eq 8 8 δ t α δ x g h α 1 where δ t is the model time step s δ x is the flow distance km g is the gravity acceleration m s 2 h is the maximum flow depth among all unit catchments m and α is a constant lower than 1 with advisable values below 0 9 almeida et al 2012 further details regarding the quasi 2d scheme floodplain profiles and flow routing computations can be found in pontes et al 2017 the experiments with the proposed model were run using a desktop computer with a 2 4 ghz intel i7 processor and 16 gb of ram resulting in a total processing time of approximately 2 h for ten years of simulation 3 2 input data the mgb iph model input data can be divided into two sets of information one representing physical and one representing hydrological characteristics of the basin the physical characteristics are usually obtained from maps while the hydrological information is obtained from rainfall and weather time series from gauging stations river flow and lagoon level information is also necessary not to be used as an input but to calibrate and validate the model in the following sub sections we describe the data used 3 2 1 physical characteristics of the basin topographic data were obtained from srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem which has a spatial resolution of 90 m and vertical resolution of 1 m farr et al 2007 the pl bathymetry was digitized from nautical charts and added to the dem allowing for the representation of the lagoon area within the dem the dem bathymetry coupled map is represented in fig 3 the discretization of the system into 2627 unit catchments and 31 sub basins in represented in fig 4 unit catchments were defined with the iph hydro tools algorithm siqueira et al 2016 using a fixed 10 km river length for each unit catchment the same as used in fleischmann et al 2018 the sub basins were defined as areas with similar geological characteristics the hydrological soil and land use characteristics of the basin were obtained using a hydrological response classes map built by fan et al 2015d using the soil and vegetation map data available for south america https www ufrgs br lsh products simplified hydrological response units map for south america 3 2 2 hydrological data daily hydrological data in the brazilian territory were obtained from 656 rainfall gauges and 66 streamflow gauges maintained by the national water agency ana agência nacional de águas http www ana gov br for the uruguayan territory 30 rainfall gauges and 13 streamflow gauges with daily data were made available by local water authorities the number of gauges totaled 686 rainfall gauges and 79 streamflow gauges meteorological data temperature air humidity atmospheric pressure and insolation were obtained directly from the mgb iph internal database fan and collischonn 2014 this data are used in the calculation of evapotranspiration in each hydrological response unit at each unit catchment to validate pl simulated water levels data from eight water level gauging stations from ana database were used locations and names of water levels gauges are presented by fig 5 the downstream boundary condition was computed as a constant water level downstream equivalent to sea level as tide data were not available in the outlet portion of the watershed 3 3 experiment 1 hydrological modelling without considering wind stress the model calibration of the river discharge procedure was carried out using streamflow gauge data from 1 january 1990 to 31december 2010 totalising 21 years of streamflow data three objective functions were used in the process the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the nash sutcliffe coefficient of the logarithms of the flows logns and the absolute bias also called volume error δv from the 78 flow gauges available 33 were used in calibration due to data availability data quality and location the model validation period was from 1 january 1970 to 31 december 1989 totalizing 20 years of flow data in this case 30 flow gauges were used due to data availability in the validation period the calibration period was set to the more recent period in order to guarantee that the model s parameters would be adjusted to the current situation of land cover cross sections and climate variability as the model is intended to be used for forecasting purposes in the near future besides calibrating and validating river discharge we performed an evaluation of inundated submerged areas by visually comparing model results to satellite images and a validation of lp levels by comparing observed water levels to modeled water levels the assessment of water level estimation is a key point of this research since we want to use the model for forecasting purposes in the future the assessment was performed using three performance metrics the observed and simulated water levels anomalies regarding the full period average water level were compared by calculating the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the root mean squared error rmse and the correlation coefficient r these comparisons were used to verify if the proposed techniques enable a coherent representation of the system additionally we calculated the nash sutcliffe of observed and simulated water level anomalies regarding a moving average of 31 days nsm this metric allows for the verification of model performance regarding the prediction of high frequency water level oscillations calibration and validation procedures of water levels considered the same periods as used for river discharge 3 4 experiment 2 hydrological modelling and flow routing considering wind stress in this experiment two simulations were performed one in the calibration period and another in the validation period for these simulations only the water levels performance metrics were assessed and compared to the performances of experiment 1 additional input data consisted of the wind velocities and directions datasets fig 5 shows the meteorological stations referred to as daily wind stations from which the wind data used in experiment 2 were obtained the measurements were available at the bdmep page of the inmet brazilian national institute of meteorology www inmet gov br the dataset is composed of 3 daily measurements at 00 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc and is available from 1970 with some gaps the longer continuous gaps are from 1990 to 1992 in the stations of rio grande and pelotas and from 1985 to 1988 regarding all stations the data were interpolated from the meteorological stations to the model unit catchments centroids locations using a nearest neighbor algorithm regarding the model implementation the wind stress is a tangential force that acts on the water surface and can be written as ji 2008 9 τ ρ air c d u 2 where ρair is the air density kg m3 cd is the wind stress coefficient dimensionless and u is the wind velocity in the direction of the flow m s by including the wind stress force in the momentum equation of the inertial method we obtained the formula given as eq 10 10 q i t δ t q i t g b δ t hflow i sflow i δ t b c d u 2 c o s azv i azm i 1 g δ t hflow i q i t n 2 b hflow i 10 3 in which the parameter cd dimensionless here called wind friction coefficient represents the combination of the relative density of air with the wind stress coefficient the term c o s azv i azm i represents the decomposition of wind velocity in the direction of flow azv i is the wind direction towards where wind originates hence the negative sign equivalent azimuth in unit catchment i and azm i is the flow direction azimuth in unit catchment i this azimuth represents the imaginary line that connects centroids of unit catchment i and i 1 as can be seen in fig 6 in our experiment the cd value of 4 10 6 was chosen which is within the range used in the literature for the same region cavalcante and mendes 2014 paz et al 2005 moreover the wind influence was only turned on to the sub basins which contain pl and guaíba lake in other sub basins therefore the value of cd was considered to be zero 3 5 experiment 3 additional tests on parameters and data sources experiment 3 was composed of tree tests 1 the first test corresponds to a sensitivity analysis of parameter cd in model performance to simulate water levels 2 the second test is a comparison of model performance with the use of daily data in comparison to hourly wind data 3 the third test compares boundary conditions the use of constant water level and a measured water level near the outlet of the basin 3 5 1 test 1 sensitivity analysis of cd in this test the model was run in the same period as the calibration period 1990 2010 with different values for the parameters cd of 2 10 6 4 10 6 8 10 6 1 10 5 1 5 10 5 2 10 5 2 5 10 5 3 10 5 and 4 10 5 the effect of the coefficient value was verified by comparing performance metrics a bestter value of cd was defined based on this comparison 3 5 2 test 2 comparison of wind datasets in this test the daily wind velocity and direction data used in experiment 2 were substituted by the hourly wind data acquired from automatic meteorological stations through inmet the hourly dataset has less availability in terms of time screen and a restricted access data must be asked for personally thus one is not motivated to build and evaluate an operational model using this database however evaluating how the investment and real time distribution of this information can improve results is relevant and that was the aim of this test the meteorological stations are shown in fig 6 the comparison was performed through the analysis of performance metrics with the different input datasets daily vs hourly simulations were performed in the period from 01 01 2008 to 31 12 2010 according to data availability from both datasets 3 5 3 test 3 comparison of boundary conditions with this test we aimed to compare results using different downstream boundary conditions i a condition of constant sea level used in previous experiments and ii daily measurements of water level in rio grande regatas gauge rgr simulations were performed covering the calibration period with the cd value defined in test 1 and daily wind datasets the use of rgr water level data as boundary condition can insert some distortions since the gauging station is located 20 km upstream of the outlet it also contains information of not only tides but of local wind and flow however this dataset was chosen due to the low importance of astronomic tides in the region this hinders the usage of tide predictions and the unavailability of sea level data measured on the seashore in addition several authors also have been using this boundary condition in hydrodynamic studies of the lagoon e g möller et al 2001 cavalcante and mendes 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 experiment 1 model results in this section are going to be presented in three main sub sections i rivers discharge calibration results using metrics maps and hydrographs ii river discharge validation results using metrics maps and hydrographs iii validation of inundated areas using maps by showing a comparison of simulated inundated areas with observed inundated areas from satellite images of the same day and iv calibration and validation of water levels using water level graphs and performance metrics 4 1 1 rivers discharge calibration results fig 7 a shows the performance of model calibration in the 33 streamflow gauging stations regarding the ns value the model performance was considered coherent especially in the north region of the basin comprehending the brazilian portion of the basin as most gauges presented ns values above 0 6 in the uruguayan portion of the basin however performance was between 0 20 and 0 60 these results could have been affected by lower availability and quality of flow and rainfall data in uruguay and the lower resolution of the used hru map in the uruguayan region the best ns metric results are seen especially downstream at the main tributaries jacuí taquari e camaquã rivers gauges 11 22 and 30 with ns values above 0 76 for 22 and 30 and a ns value of 0 84 for the main tributary the jacuí river 11 the taquari river presents good results over all its length presenting ns values greater than 0 8 at several locations the lowest ns result corresponded to gauge 6 in the upper jacuí river and may be due to dams located upstream which the model cannot account for this effect however is dampened throughout the length of the river fig 7b presents the calibration results regarding logns values the logns results are very similar to ns results performing coherently overall especially in the brazilian portion of the basin with poorer performance in the uruguayan region fig 7c shows the results regarding the absolute bias the performance of the model regarding this metric was considered adequate as δv was lower than 10 in most gauging stations the poorer results with δv between 20 and 30 happened in only 2 gauging stations in the basin fig 8 shows the hydrograph correspondent to gauging station 30 at the camaquã river although in some points the peek flows are overestimated by the model in most days the simulated and observed hydrographs agree the hydrological overall regime is represented well considering both flow peeks and base flow fig 9 shows the observed and simulated hydrographs for the taquari river at gauge 22 the observed and simulated hydrographs visually match in terms of representation of the hydrological regime for both peek flows and base flow fig 10 shows the observed and simulated hydrographs for the jacuí river at gauge station 11 the jacuí river is located in a plain area therefore its hydrograph is smoother than the hydrographs of other rivers in the region the coherent performance as can be seen in the hydrographs shows the model s capability to simulate floodplains 4 1 2 rivers discharge validation results fig 11 shows the performance of the model during the validation period the performance of the model during validation was very similar to the calibration performance all metrics achieved relatively adequate values at most gauging stations with better results on the brazilian portion of the basin gauges located further downstream of the main tributaries still presented coherent results the validation results suggest that the calibration is relatively well physically grounded and is feasible to be used for further applications such as flood forecasting figs 12 14 show the observed and simulated hydrographs of gauging stations 30 22 and 11 for the camaquã taquari and jacuí rivers respectively it can be seen in the validation hydrographs that the hydrological regime is coherently represented by the model especially for the jacuí river which can be considered the main tributary of the lagoon regarding river discharge 4 1 3 validation of inundated areas and water levels until this point results showed that we were able to satisfactorily simulate the riverine portions of the pl basin following we present the results regarding inundated areas and lagoon levels which show the potential of the model to represent the pl and guaíba lake 4 1 3 1 inundated areas visual results the inundated areas simulated by the model were compared with landsat 5 satellite images from the same day of the simulation dates were chosen based on the images availability and hydrological period searching for both very wet and very dry periods figures shown in this sub section are composed of 3 images the image on the center represents the simulated inundated area painted red on top of the satellite image which is represented alone in the left the image on the right shows the location of the landsat image regarding the watershed area fig 15 shows the inundated area in the region of patos lagoon on 3 february 2007 a dry period from fig 15 it is possible to observe that the model captured the whole submerged lagoon area during a dry period validating the proposed quasi 2d representation using a lagoon discretization in unit catchments and effective channels in terms of spatial extension fig 16 shows the simulated and observed inundated area for a flood period in 1 october 2007 representing upstream of pl the guaíba lake and its tributaries fig 17 show a zoom in the jacuí river floodplain in the same date a good compatibility between flooded areas extensions can be seen especially in the jacuí river but also in the pl the guaíba lake and downstream of rivers taquari sinos and caí the performance of the model regarding flooded area was worse upstream of the eastern tributaries but in this region there were no flow gauges and therefore this can be due to a less representative hydrological calibration for this area 4 1 3 2 calibration period water level results table 1 presents the results of performance metrics of water levels anomalies simulated in experiment 1 regarding the calibration period for all gauging stations upstream of rio grande regatas rgr ns values are in the order of 0 7 results were considered satisfactory for level gauges upstream of rgr as ns values presented a more similar range than the ones obtained by another study which used a 2d hydrodynamic model for the pl cavalcante and mendes 2014 used the model iph a borche 1996 to simulate pl hydrodynamics using observed flow data from camaquã river and water level data from ilha da pintada and rgr gauging stations as boundary conditions the authors obtained a range of ns values of 0 58 0 89 for the 6 water level gauges upstream of rgr without ilha da pintada similar to our range for the same locations 0 66 0 73 the unsatisfactory results obtained in the rgr gauging station can be linked to the use of a constant water level as a downstream boundary condition which does not allow for the consideration of non local wind effects and tides rmse values ranged between 12 8 cm laranjal gauge and 22 6 cm cristal gauge rmse results are in the order of 10 of observed water level anomalies variability considering the 7 gauging stations upstream of rgr nsm values are lower than ns values which suggests the inability of the model to simulate high frequency oscillations of water levels the main reason why high frequencies are not correctly modelled is the lack of wind data in the simulation figs 18 to 20 show observed and simulated water level at gauges ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively it is possible to see from figs 18 to 20 an overall coherent representation of water levels especially regarding higher water level periods high frequency oscillations of water levels are not represented well and the simulated and observed water levels agree in seasonal mean values this result agrees with the pl behaviour described by möller et al 2001 that the river discharges are often responsible for level variation in the longer time period as high frequency oscillations are mainly due to wind influence in low flow periods however the representation is not as adequate as the water levels are often overestimated especially at the arambaré gauge location 4 1 3 3 validation period water level results table 2 shows the results of performance metrics of water levels anomalies simulated in experiment 1 regarding the validation period values obtained are very similar to the results obtained in the calibration period ns values from gauges upstream of rgr are in the range of 0 63 0 77 rmse values ranged from 13 2 cm to 23 7 cm figs 21 to 23 shows the observed and simulated water level anomalies for gauging stations ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively regarding the validation period figs 21 to 23 shows similar results in comparison to the ones obtained in the calibration period good overall representations especially for high water level periods it is possible to notice some issues within observed data for the ilha da pintada gauging station between 1984 and 1985 which influenced ns rmse and r values data issues did not affect nsm because the anomalies are calculated from a moving average of 31 days the same problem was verified in rgr gauge data what is probably related to the worse values of ns rmse and r in the validation period in rgr 4 2 experiment 2 results of experiment 2 are composed of metrics and graphs showing water level estimation performance for the calibration and validation periods considering wind effect in the simulations 4 2 1 calibration period water level results table 3 shows the performance metrics of water level anomalies for the calibration period with the consideration of wind shear stress comparing these metrics to the results obtained in experiment 1 we could confirm that all gauging stations upstream of rgr had their performance improved by the consideration of wind shear stress the average improvement for ns nsm rmse and r for these 7 gauges locations was of 4 34 5 and 2 respectively the larger improvement of nsm is related to the consideration of local wind effect over the system the worse performance at rgr gauge location with the inclusion of wind effect can be due to the non representation of the interaction between local wind and coastal water levels this is also supported by möller et al 1996 2001 who found low coherence between local wind effects and water levels in rgs figs 24 to 26 show the observed and simulated water level for gauges ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively for experiments 1 and 2 regarding the calibration period through analysing observing figs 24 to 26 a better representation of high frequency water level oscillations due to wind influence inclusion can be verified however the amplitude of these oscillations was not exactly properly represented given that cd is not necessarily a constant but can depend on other environmental characteristics francis 1954 this result motivated the realisation of the first test of experiment 3 to verify the influence of the cd value in the representation of these oscillations 4 2 2 validation period water level results table 4 shows the performance metrics of water level anomalies for the validation period with the consideration of wind shear stress results are consistent over all 7 gauges upstream of rgr for all performance metrics which indicates that wind inclusion contributed to the conception of a better model 4 3 experiment 3 this experiment is composed of three tests using the same model used in experiment 2 the results for each test are as follows 4 3 1 test 1 sensitivity analysis of cd tables 5 and 6 represent ns and nsm results obtained with simulations using different cd values the best ns and nsm values for each gauge are in bold in addition for all gauging stations upstream of rgr more desirable better values are met for greater cd values although the best cd value for each gauging station varies e g 10 10 6 for ilha da pintada and 15 10 6 for ipanema the value of 10 10 6 was the optimal because on average considering gauges upstream of rgr this cd was the more desirable figs 27 and 28 plots observed and simulated anomalies considering cd values of 4 10 6 10 10 6 20 10 6 and 40 10 6 for level gauges ilha da pintada and arambaré respectively the greater the value of cd the higher the amplitude of high frequency water level variations agreeing with other studies e g cavalcante and mendes 2014 fig 29 shows the anomalies related to the moving average of 31 days for ilha da pintada gauging station this figure aids the visualisation of wind effect on water levels and allows for a clearer verification of improvements in high frequency water level simulation the curve related to a cd value of zero experiment 1 represents the establishment of a seasonal average water level while the curves with cd from 4 10 6 to 10 10 6 progressively are able to simulate high frequency water level oscillations in this figure it is also clearer that the use of cd of 10 10 6 regarding ilha da pintada gauge results in a better representation of water level behavior 4 3 2 test 2 comparison of wind datasets tables 7 to 10 display results of performance metrics regarding simulations with daily wind data and hourly wind data for two values of cd the value used in experiment 2 and the value defined in experiment 3 test 1 the best values of performance metrics for each level gauge are displayed in bold generally the use of the hourly wind data set allowed for the achievement of better metrics results especially in the guaíba lake area results of ns in the order of 0 8 were found in the stations of ilha da pintada and ponta dos coatis for the three level gauges downstream of arambaré the use of hourly data did not result in benefits regarding most performance metrics nsm values presented considerable increases with the use of hourly datasets especially in ponta dos coatis and ipanema gauging stations the use of cd equal to 10 10 6 resulted in a better option for both wind datasets in most gauges however the best value of cd varied depending on the gauge for both daily and hourly wind data this can motivate future studies to verify the response of the system to the use of different cd values in different parts of the water body figs 30 31 and 32 show the comparison between water level anomalies simulated using hourly and daily wind datasets for gauging stations ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively the visual analysis of figures demonstrates that the use of hourly data helped to better simulate the amplitude of high frequency oscillations this can be related not only to more temporal detail but to more spatial availability of data e g hourly data comprehends data from stations in the east side of lp while daily data does not 4 3 3 test 3 comparison of downstream boundary conditions table 11 shows performance metrics results for the calibration period considering water levels measured at rgr as downstream boundary condition daily wind data and a cd value of 10 10 6 it is possible to compare these results to the performance metrics obtained in test 1 for the same value of cd and with constant sea level as a boundary condition from this comparison a better performance was perceived in all gauging stations for ns rmse and r only são lourenço gauge regarding nsm presented a poorer performance further studies should take place to understand why laranjal gauge presented the greatest increase of nsm of about 37 which might be related to the greater influence of tide oscillations in water level variations on this location due to its proximity to the outlet of the basin figs 33 34 and 35 show the anomalies of water levels considering the previous boundary condition of constant see level previous bc and the new boundary condition of measured water levels in rgr new bc both curves were simulated with a cd value of 10 10 6 and compared to observed data for gauging stations ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal these visual analyses of the figures allow us to state that the change of boundary condition enabled a better representation of water levels regarding mainly the lower water level periods this result also suggests that if the aim is to simulate higher water level periods the use of constant sea level as boundary condition may be sufficient however if there is an interest in low flow periods it may be required to consider more detailed downstream boundary conditions 5 conclusion summarizing the obtained results the study allowed us to answer the three proposed questions 1 is it possible to simulate a basin rivers lakes and lagoons with one integrated hydrological hydrodynamic model and coherently estimate water levels and inundated areas yes it was possible to use only the mgb iph model to simulate a complex lagoon riverine basin and obtain coherent results of both flooded areas and water levels water level performance metrics results were in the range of results obtained in the literature with the use of a 2d hydrodynamic model 2 will the inclusion of wind effect improve water level simulations yes the inclusion of wind shear aided the achievement of better results and suggest the potential of the model to be used in regions that are affected by wind influence 3 to what extent can the input data and parameters be used to improve the representation the use of a larger cd value of 10 10 6 improved performance metrics as well as the use of hourly wind especially for the gauges located in the guaíba lake the change of downstream boundary condition to observed water levels instead of constant sea level was also beneficial and improved the representation of water level anomalies in low flow periods from authors knowledge this research was the first time in which a single hydrological hydrodynamic model was used to simulate an integrated lagoon riverine large scale system furthermore it was the first known implementation of wind shear effects on local inertial equations for one dimensional and quasi 2d large scale simulation from the developed model we believe that the next step in relation to social aids would be designing the operational forecasting system of discharges and water levels for the region the results showed that an adequate representation of the region for forecasting purposes will not demand only rainfall data as commonly used in tropical hydrological forecasting systems fan et al 2015c 2017 but also wind speed and direction information regarding the forecasting system tests also indicate that the usage of a constant sea level as boundary condition for the forecasting window is sufficient during high water level periods additionally future studies must take place to further understand why optimal cd values differ in different stations or to include cd variation according to environmental variables such as wind velocity francis 1954 as it is done for example in the telemac mascaret system lhf 1997 other methods for defining flow direction for wind shear calculation should be tested as well acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge brazilian agencies cnpq for funding the

6996,hydrological hydrodynamic modelling of basins rivers and large bodies of water such as lakes and lagoons is usually performed by external coupling of hydrological hydraulic models and 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models therefore the river discharges into the lake are calculated by using the hydrologic model the data is used then as an input to the hydrodynamic model this approach allows for a detailed simulation of lake or lagoon hydrodynamics and circulation however when the objective is solely to simulate water levels and flooded areas this approach may become too costly making it difficult to establish operational systems such as those for flood forecasting therefore in the present study we propose a first integrated approach using one single hydrologic hydraulic model the mgb iph model to simulate complex systems such as wind shear influence this model was applied to simulate the patos lagoon pl basin located in brazil and uruguay countries results showed that it was possible to use the single model to simulate hydrographs flooded areas and water levels in the pl basin results of performance indicators in the lakes and lagoons were within the range of results available in the literature improvements of model performance metrics were verified with the inclusion of wind effect in the flow routing algorithm thus encouraging the use of the proposed model for the establishment of flood forecasting systems or for the simulation of other similar hydrological systems keywords hydrological hydrodynamic modelling large scale modelling integrated modelling river

models mostly use simple flow routing methods saleh et al 2013 hodges 2013 such as a sequence of linear reservoirs lindström et al 2010 the kinematic wave approximations de roo et al 2000 the muskingum method neitsch et al 2002 hattermann et al 2005 or the muskingum cunge method collischonn et al 2007 while having the advantage of being more robust and requiring less computational effort and data the use of a simple flow routing method does not allow for the simulation of backwater and floodplain storage effects to overcome these problems some authors have coupled large scale hydrological models with hydrodynamic models in order to simulate complex river systems lian et al 2007 paz et al 2010 falter et al 2016 yamazaki et al 2011 2013 inoue et al 2008 biancamaria et al 2009 in these approaches simple flow routing methods are used to generate the output river discharges which are used as an input into the complex hydrodynamic systems that are modelled on more detailed hydrodynamic methods fully integrated modelling of large scale river basins and complex hydrodynamic systems also have been developed in recent decades if we consider an integrated approach the use of a single hydrological hydrodynamic model which allows for the use of one detailed flow routing method for the entire catchment and riverine system in an integrated approach only one model would be necessary to simulate large scale basins and complex hydrodynamic systems as an example paiva et al 2011 proposed a modified version of the mgb iph model first introduced by collischonn et al 2007 by adding a new flow routing algorithm based on the full saint venant equations although it was possible to use only this model for the entire system to increase computational efficiency full saint venant more than twenty times slower the authors chose to use the muskingum cunge flow routing method for headwater regions of the river network and a hydrodynamic method for plain areas the model was applied for the purus river basin achieving good results later paiva et al 2013 used the same approach to model the entire amazon river basin pontes et al 2015 2017 also modified the mgb iph model by replacing the muskingum cunge flow routing method for the local inertial method developed by bates et al 2010 in the applications the muskingum cunge and the local inertial flow routing methods were compared for the entire araguaia river basin in south america although being approximately ten times slower than the muskingum cunge method the authors proved that the local inertial approach allowed for a better representation of the system which incorporates extensive floodplains and wetland areas a particularly challenging situation occurs when relatively large lakes or lagoons are connected to or are part of the drainage network considering the strong interaction between these systems and their watershed counterpart ji 2008 modelling their hydrodynamic behavior is considerably difficult especially when trying to assess the effect of land use changes and climate changes in addition important backwater effects can occur with situations in which the reversing of flows is possible many natural system configurations can also occur such as connections between lakes through channels or lateral connections between the groundwater and between streams and lakes li et al 2017 peters and buttle 2010 skafel 2000 large lakes and lagoons in drainage networks also add complexity due to the effects of wind on hydrodynamics ji 2008 möller et al 2001 schoen et al 2014 when a large scale basin to be simulated contains large water bodies such as lakes and lagoons the standard approach is to couple a hydrologic model externally with a 2d or 3d hydrodynamic model where the outputs of the hydrologic model are used as inputs in the hydrodynamic lagoon or lake model offline coupling or loose coupling it is possible to find examples of this kind of study in the recent literature dargahi and setegn 2011 coupled the hydrologic semi distributed conceptual model swat soil and water assessment tool neitsch et al 2002 with the 3d hydrodynamic model gemss generalized environmental modeling system for surface waters erm 2006 to simulate lake tana in ethiopia and successfully validated their approach for the year 2006 using observed data li et al 2014 used the outputs of a distributed physically based hydrologic model based on the watlac code zhang and werner 2009 zhang and li 2009 as inputs in a 2d hydrodynamic model based on the mike 21 model developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi 2009 to simulate the large scale basin of lake poyang located in the middle reach of the river yangtze basin in china results showed that the model appropriately simulated the lake hydrodynamics regarding water fluxes and inundated area changes due to seasonality and zhang et al 2017 studied the same system the poyang lake basin using the swat model for the river basin simulation and the delft3d model roelvink and van banning 1995 deltares 2014 for the poyang lake simulation the offline coupling approach and the use of 2d or 3d hydrodynamic models for simulating lakes and watersheds have the advantage of allowing for the simulation of the water circulation within the lake area with detail additionally many hydrodynamic models used for simulating these systems have water quality modules that can be used to get insights of temporal and spatial variations of water quality and ecological parameters e g fragoso et al 2009 deltares 2014 dhi 2011 for lakes studies 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models have been often coupled with water quality models to simulate water quality and ecological proprieties of the lake such as concentration of nutrients oxygen algae and cyanobacteria wang et al 2017 bocaniov et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 despite the detailed hydrodynamic information provided by coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic models for large water bodies simulation this approach has some drawbacks 1 the most obvious is the time and work required to build two different models and adapt the inputs and outputs between them 2 the processing time of detailed hydrodynamic models is often considerably larger wicks et al 2004 lin et al 2006 hodges 2013 3 backwater effects in the connection between rivers simulated with the hydrologic model and lakes simulated with the hydrodynamic model cannot be accounted for as the offline coupling happens in one direction and therefore the hydrodynamic model can t influence the hydrological model li et al 2014 verified problems related to this disadvantage when they ran a simulation for lake poyang in order to consider backwater effects in the connection between the lake and its tributaries the authors expanded the area to be simulated by the hydrodynamic model to also comprehend a part of the tributaries however they comment that the backwater effects would propagate even further than included in the hydrodynamic model and therefore they would have to change the model configuration to enable the analysis of these effects 4 the drainage area and the groundwater that contribute directly to the lake or lagoon can have an important influence in the systems hydrodynamics and modifications have to be made to account for these areas li et al 2014 4 real time operational systems and data assimilation routines for the establishment of hydrological forecasting systems are more difficult to be implemented for this approach as processing routines must be prepared for both models and also be compatible in all time steps liu et al 2012 when the objective is not to provide detailed insight of lake and lagoon hydrodynamics but to estimate inundated areas and water levels in the lakes and establish large scale or even develop global or continental hydrological forecasting systems for all water bodies this approach becomes costly therefore considering the interest to overcome the disadvantages of the coupling of hydrological and hydrodynamic models for forecasting purposes on rivers and large water bodies and the recent improvements in hydrological models to use more detailed flow routing approaches in the present study we test the possibility of using one single integrated hydrological hydrodynamic model to simulate basins and lagoons in a single unified manner to do this we chose the most recent version of the conceptual and semi distributed mgb iph model pontes et al 2017 and as the test case the patos lagoon pl basin in south america 180 000 km2 to do so it is important to consider however that wind has a relevant effect on flow of large water bodies such as lakes and lagoons ji 2008 due to the importance of the wind influence when simulating large water bodies many 2d and 3d hydraulic models include this effect such as the princeton ocean model pom mike3 and mike21 dhi 2011 iph a borche 1996 iph eco model fragoso et al 2009 telemac mascaret lhf 1997 and the delft3d model deltares 2014 furthermore including wind effect on hydrological hydrodynamic models would be advantageous not only for lakes but also for the simulation of floodplains or large rivers especially if located in coastal areas for example mashriqui et al 2014 stated that only using the hec ras model usace 2010 without inclusion of wind effect would not be enough to properly simulate water levels on the potomac river in the united states which is a wide river located near the coast additionally the authors also recognize that including the wind effect in the hec ras model would improve the flood forecasting systems for at least 14 different coastal rivers in the united states indeed due to the effect that wind can exert over riverine systems some 1d hydrodynamic models such as isisflow sobek deltares 2017 and mike11 dhi 2009 already included wind influence in their formulations considering the gains of introducing wind effect in flow routing modules of hydrological hydrodynamic models and the instant limitation that ignoring this variable would impose on large water bodies simulation in this study we also propose and test a modified version of the mgb iph model by including the wind effect on the flow routing formulation thus we aim to answer three main questions 1 is it possible to simulate rivers lakes and lagoons with one integrated hydrological hydrodynamic model and coherently estimate water levels and inundated areas 2 will the inclusion of wind effect improve water level simulations 3 to what extent can the input data and parameters be used to improve the representation to answer these questions we first tested the possibility of simulating the lp basin with the hydrological model without the inclusion of wind effect in the flow routing module experiment 1 then we simulated the patos lagoon basin with the modified mgb iph model considering wind effect experiment 2 other simulations were carried out to further understand the modelled wind influence in the system as well as to experiment with the usage of different input datasets experiment 3 the tests of experiment 3 include i sensitivity analysis of included model parameters through wind influence simulation ii analysis of an alternative wind data source with different spatial and temporal availability and iii verification of the inclusion of a tide by modifying the downstream boundary condition 2 study area our case study is the patos lagoon pl watershed with approximately 180 000 km2 located in both uruguay and brazil in the southernmost state of rio grande do sul the basin location and main rivers and lagoons are shown in fig 1 the pl is a water body of major importance for southern brazil described by kjerfve 1986 as the world s largest choked lagoon therefore representing an ideal location for testing the proposed approach the pl has its main inflows from rivers gravataí 2020 km2 sinos 3747 km2 caí 5057 km2 taquari 26492 km2 jacuí 71600 km2 camaquã 21259 km2 piratini 6917 km2 and jaguarão 5780 km2 in the brazilian territory and rivers tacuari 3600 km2 and cebollati 30000 km2 in the uruguayan territory the rivers piratini jaguarão tacuari e cebollati flow into the mirim lagoon 62250 km2 basin area which flows into the pl estuary through são gonçalo channel the gravataí sinos caí and jacuí rivers form the guaíba lake 496 km2 surface area next to the city of porto alegre which flows directly into the top north of pl most of the pl basin area is located within the rio grande do sul rs state including the state s capital city porto alegre as well as nine of the ten cities with the greater economic development index in the state an international harbour at the city of rio grande south is located near the patos lagoon outflow to the sea and is a commercially strategic place for mercosul countries the lagoon connects the harbour to porto alegre through its navigable path of 258 km therefore playing a fundamental role in the state s importation and exportation rates besides being vital for the state s economy the basin exerts a strong influence on environmental and social aspects the pl basin area filled with wetlands includes several conservation units two of which are considered biosphere reserves by unesco united nations educational scientific and cultural organization indeed the pl estuary and its environmental richness have been recognized and studied by many authors capitoli et al 1977 1978 hartmann and schettini 1991 tagliani et al 2003 water resource problems in pl basin are related to both water quality and quantity and have social and environmental effects flood events routinely take place in the system and frequently affect many people living near the tributaries the guaíba lake and pl dry periods can cause an increase in salinity levels in the lagoon and impact agriculture additionally during dry summer periods algae growth in the guaiba lake usually hinders water treatment water quality issues affect for example more than 50 000 people involved with artisanal fisheries schafer and reis 2008 an activity sensitive to pollution sources in the basin tagliani et al 2003 and to hydrological and wind regimes the pl is approximately 250 km in length in the nne ssw direction 40 km in width and it can be classified as a shallow lagoon because of its average depth of 5 m pl reaches the sea by a narrow 1 2 km wide and 20 km long channel as with most of the world s choked lagoons the effects of tides to upstream regions are softened by the long narrow outlet channel therefore having less impact on the lagoon s internal water circulation which is mostly controlled by wind and river flow möller et al 1996 möller et al 2001 studied the lagoon s hydrodynamic behavior and stated that most of the time when the inflows are relatively low the internal circulation is controlled mainly by the wind while during late winter the large river flows are the main factor controlling circulation in the lagoon furthermore in a longer timescale seasonal the river flow influence is marked by the establishment of an average water level which is modulated in shorter timescales mostly correspondent to the passage of frontal systems 6 18 days by local wind these short period water level variations are addressed in the present study as high frequency oscillations to simplify further reference several studies were carried out with the aim to understand the hydrodynamic behavior of the lagoon möller et al 1996 möller et al 2001 garcia et al 2001 garcia et al 2004 marques and möller 2008 barros et al 2014 cavalcante and mendes 2014 however an integrated model of the basin was never proposed and the river inflows to the lagoon were frequently assumed to be a combination of the flow from the three main tributaries jacuí taquari and camaquã rivers not accounting for all the other contributions to the lagoon the present study therefore also contributes to the literature to fill this gap as the integrated developed model does not simplify the lagoon inflows 3 methodology the methodology used in the present research consisted mainly in the development of a version of the mgb iph model for the pl basin and the subsequent model application and validation without wind effects the inclusion of wind shear stress in the flood routing algorithm and the model application and validation using wind effect the full model was further tested with different input datasets parameter values and downstream boundary conditions in summary three experiments were conducted i experiment 1 hydrological modelling and flow routing without wind effect ii experiment 2 hydrological modelling and flow routing with wind effect iii experiment 3 additional tests to assess input data impacts in the following sub sections we present 3 1 a description of the hydrological model focusing on the routing scheme 3 2 the input data used 3 3 experiment 1 procedures 3 4 experiment 2 procedures and additional data and 3 5 experiment 3 tests and additional data 3 1 mgb iph model the mgb iph modelo de grandes bacias instituto de pesquisas hidráulicas model first described internationally by collischonn et al 2007 is a large scale hydrological model that calculates streamflow from precipitation data and other climatic variables temperature wind velocity radiation atmospheric pressure and relative humidity this model has been widely used for large scale simulation in south america for example for climate change evaluations land use change studies real time hydrological forecasting watershed management propositions decision support systems among others collischonn et al 2005 nóbrega et al 2011 bravo et al 2012 buarque et al 2012 paiva et al 2011 2012 2013 pereira et al 2012 bayer and collischonn 2013 fan et al 2014 2015a b c 2016 2017 the hydrological model ordinarily runs with a daily time step and is open source see https www ufrgs br lsh the mgb iph is a conceptual semi distributed model in which the basin is sub divided into smaller unit catchments and further into hydrological response units hrus categorized by combinations of land use and soil types the mgb iph simulates vertical energy and water budget at each hru while the runoff generated within each unit catchment is routed to the stream network using linear reservoirs in addition a flow routing method is used to propagate flows downstream along river networks further details about model equations and assumptions can be found in collischonn et al 2007 and pontes et al 2017 in regard to flow routing it can be simulated by the one dimensional 1d saint venant equations expressed by continuity eq 1 and momentum conservation eq 2 1 a t q x q 2 q t x q 2 a g a y x g a s f 0 to solve the momentum equation we used the explicit local inertial method developed by bates et al 2010 which was successfully tested in recent applications to mgb iph pontes et al 2017 fleischmann et al 2018 assuming a rectangular channel and neglecting only the advection second term of the momentum equation eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 q i t δ t q i t g b δ t hflow i sflow i 1 g δ t hflow i q i t n 2 b hflow i 10 3 where q i t and q i t δ t are the discharges at current and next time interval for unit catchment i m3s 1 δ t is the model time step s n is the manning coefficient m 1 3s g is the gravity acceleration ms 2 hflowi is the effective flow depth between unit catchment i and unit catchment i 1 m b is the channel bankfull width m sflow i is the water surface slope between unit catchment i and i 1 calculated with eq 4 in which y is the water surface elevation m m 1 and δ x i is the distance between unit catchment i and i 1 4 sflow i y i 1 t y i t δ x i the continuity equation eq 1 is approximated by using eq 5 where v stands for volume of water channel floodplain at unit catchment i q in t δ t and q out t δ t refers to inflow and outflow at the next time interval respectively evq i is the evaporation from flooded areas at unit catchment i mm and q viz t δ t refers to the net flow between adjacent unit catchments which are not connected in the river network i e quasi 2d scheme 5 v i t δ t v i t δ t q in t δ t q out t δ t q viz t δ t evq i a f l i 1000 water volume computed by eq 5 is used to obtain the flow depth from a floodplain profile i e a hypsometric curve that relates water surface elevation flooded volume and flooded area in this case a floodplain profile is constructed for each unit catchment through inundation of the sub grid topography the latter given by a high resolution digital elevation model dem finally flow depth is computed by subtracting water surface elevation from channel bottom elevation according to eq 6 6 h i t 1 y i t 1 z i 1 where h i t 1 is the flow depth at unit catchment y i t 1 is the water surface elevation derived by interpolating the floodplain profile and z i 1 is the channel bottom elevation at unit catchment i the latter one is obtained by subtracting channel bankfull depth from channel bankfull elevation which is derived directly from the underlying dem both channel bankfull depth and width are computed using hydraulic geometry relationships hgs i e that relate such parameters with drainage area or mean annual discharge this approach is very common in large scale modelling since detailed channel geometry is usually not available e g coe et al 2008 decharme et al 2011 yamazaki et al 2011 mejia and reed 2011 paiva et al 2013 fan et al 2015b fig 2 a shows the spatial discretization of variables the depth h is calculated in the center of unit catchments and the flow is calculated at interfaces between unit catchments fig 2 b show an example of discretization of a basin into several unit catchments in addition the quasi 2d scheme pontes et al 2017 fleischmann et al 2018 was adopted herein to route the flow into multiple downstream directions within the lagoon system this means that a given unit catchment can transfer water to another unit catchment not only through a river channel but also from lateral connections when the flow depth gets higher than the channel bankfull depth in order to represent these connections in a simplified fashion we consider that all unit catchments adjacent to a given one are connected by a rectangular channel whose length can be computed by approximating the shape of each connected unit catchment to the shape of a circle 7 l a 1 π a 2 π where l is the channel length between two connected unit catchments km a 1 and a 2 are their respective singular not upstream accumulated drainage areas km2 note that the channel length is depicted as the sum of the radius of adjacent circles i e the euclidian distance between their centers it is worth mentioning that only unit catchments inside the lagoon were laterally connected and allowed to route flow in multiple downstream directions i e the quasi 2d scheme while flow routing in rivers outside this region was computed only with the 1d local inertial method the width of lateral connections was globally set as 50 m as a standard value in order to avoid model instability the courant friedrichs levy cfl condition must be satisfied during simulations which used an adaptive time step from eq 8 8 δ t α δ x g h α 1 where δ t is the model time step s δ x is the flow distance km g is the gravity acceleration m s 2 h is the maximum flow depth among all unit catchments m and α is a constant lower than 1 with advisable values below 0 9 almeida et al 2012 further details regarding the quasi 2d scheme floodplain profiles and flow routing computations can be found in pontes et al 2017 the experiments with the proposed model were run using a desktop computer with a 2 4 ghz intel i7 processor and 16 gb of ram resulting in a total processing time of approximately 2 h for ten years of simulation 3 2 input data the mgb iph model input data can be divided into two sets of information one representing physical and one representing hydrological characteristics of the basin the physical characteristics are usually obtained from maps while the hydrological information is obtained from rainfall and weather time series from gauging stations river flow and lagoon level information is also necessary not to be used as an input but to calibrate and validate the model in the following sub sections we describe the data used 3 2 1 physical characteristics of the basin topographic data were obtained from srtm shuttle radar topography mission dem which has a spatial resolution of 90 m and vertical resolution of 1 m farr et al 2007 the pl bathymetry was digitized from nautical charts and added to the dem allowing for the representation of the lagoon area within the dem the dem bathymetry coupled map is represented in fig 3 the discretization of the system into 2627 unit catchments and 31 sub basins in represented in fig 4 unit catchments were defined with the iph hydro tools algorithm siqueira et al 2016 using a fixed 10 km river length for each unit catchment the same as used in fleischmann et al 2018 the sub basins were defined as areas with similar geological characteristics the hydrological soil and land use characteristics of the basin were obtained using a hydrological response classes map built by fan et al 2015d using the soil and vegetation map data available for south america https www ufrgs br lsh products simplified hydrological response units map for south america 3 2 2 hydrological data daily hydrological data in the brazilian territory were obtained from 656 rainfall gauges and 66 streamflow gauges maintained by the national water agency ana agência nacional de águas http www ana gov br for the uruguayan territory 30 rainfall gauges and 13 streamflow gauges with daily data were made available by local water authorities the number of gauges totaled 686 rainfall gauges and 79 streamflow gauges meteorological data temperature air humidity atmospheric pressure and insolation were obtained directly from the mgb iph internal database fan and collischonn 2014 this data are used in the calculation of evapotranspiration in each hydrological response unit at each unit catchment to validate pl simulated water levels data from eight water level gauging stations from ana database were used locations and names of water levels gauges are presented by fig 5 the downstream boundary condition was computed as a constant water level downstream equivalent to sea level as tide data were not available in the outlet portion of the watershed 3 3 experiment 1 hydrological modelling without considering wind stress the model calibration of the river discharge procedure was carried out using streamflow gauge data from 1 january 1990 to 31december 2010 totalising 21 years of streamflow data three objective functions were used in the process the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the nash sutcliffe coefficient of the logarithms of the flows logns and the absolute bias also called volume error δv from the 78 flow gauges available 33 were used in calibration due to data availability data quality and location the model validation period was from 1 january 1970 to 31 december 1989 totalizing 20 years of flow data in this case 30 flow gauges were used due to data availability in the validation period the calibration period was set to the more recent period in order to guarantee that the model s parameters would be adjusted to the current situation of land cover cross sections and climate variability as the model is intended to be used for forecasting purposes in the near future besides calibrating and validating river discharge we performed an evaluation of inundated submerged areas by visually comparing model results to satellite images and a validation of lp levels by comparing observed water levels to modeled water levels the assessment of water level estimation is a key point of this research since we want to use the model for forecasting purposes in the future the assessment was performed using three performance metrics the observed and simulated water levels anomalies regarding the full period average water level were compared by calculating the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns the root mean squared error rmse and the correlation coefficient r these comparisons were used to verify if the proposed techniques enable a coherent representation of the system additionally we calculated the nash sutcliffe of observed and simulated water level anomalies regarding a moving average of 31 days nsm this metric allows for the verification of model performance regarding the prediction of high frequency water level oscillations calibration and validation procedures of water levels considered the same periods as used for river discharge 3 4 experiment 2 hydrological modelling and flow routing considering wind stress in this experiment two simulations were performed one in the calibration period and another in the validation period for these simulations only the water levels performance metrics were assessed and compared to the performances of experiment 1 additional input data consisted of the wind velocities and directions datasets fig 5 shows the meteorological stations referred to as daily wind stations from which the wind data used in experiment 2 were obtained the measurements were available at the bdmep page of the inmet brazilian national institute of meteorology www inmet gov br the dataset is composed of 3 daily measurements at 00 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc and is available from 1970 with some gaps the longer continuous gaps are from 1990 to 1992 in the stations of rio grande and pelotas and from 1985 to 1988 regarding all stations the data were interpolated from the meteorological stations to the model unit catchments centroids locations using a nearest neighbor algorithm regarding the model implementation the wind stress is a tangential force that acts on the water surface and can be written as ji 2008 9 τ ρ air c d u 2 where ρair is the air density kg m3 cd is the wind stress coefficient dimensionless and u is the wind velocity in the direction of the flow m s by including the wind stress force in the momentum equation of the inertial method we obtained the formula given as eq 10 10 q i t δ t q i t g b δ t hflow i sflow i δ t b c d u 2 c o s azv i azm i 1 g δ t hflow i q i t n 2 b hflow i 10 3 in which the parameter cd dimensionless here called wind friction coefficient represents the combination of the relative density of air with the wind stress coefficient the term c o s azv i azm i represents the decomposition of wind velocity in the direction of flow azv i is the wind direction towards where wind originates hence the negative sign equivalent azimuth in unit catchment i and azm i is the flow direction azimuth in unit catchment i this azimuth represents the imaginary line that connects centroids of unit catchment i and i 1 as can be seen in fig 6 in our experiment the cd value of 4 10 6 was chosen which is within the range used in the literature for the same region cavalcante and mendes 2014 paz et al 2005 moreover the wind influence was only turned on to the sub basins which contain pl and guaíba lake in other sub basins therefore the value of cd was considered to be zero 3 5 experiment 3 additional tests on parameters and data sources experiment 3 was composed of tree tests 1 the first test corresponds to a sensitivity analysis of parameter cd in model performance to simulate water levels 2 the second test is a comparison of model performance with the use of daily data in comparison to hourly wind data 3 the third test compares boundary conditions the use of constant water level and a measured water level near the outlet of the basin 3 5 1 test 1 sensitivity analysis of cd in this test the model was run in the same period as the calibration period 1990 2010 with different values for the parameters cd of 2 10 6 4 10 6 8 10 6 1 10 5 1 5 10 5 2 10 5 2 5 10 5 3 10 5 and 4 10 5 the effect of the coefficient value was verified by comparing performance metrics a bestter value of cd was defined based on this comparison 3 5 2 test 2 comparison of wind datasets in this test the daily wind velocity and direction data used in experiment 2 were substituted by the hourly wind data acquired from automatic meteorological stations through inmet the hourly dataset has less availability in terms of time screen and a restricted access data must be asked for personally thus one is not motivated to build and evaluate an operational model using this database however evaluating how the investment and real time distribution of this information can improve results is relevant and that was the aim of this test the meteorological stations are shown in fig 6 the comparison was performed through the analysis of performance metrics with the different input datasets daily vs hourly simulations were performed in the period from 01 01 2008 to 31 12 2010 according to data availability from both datasets 3 5 3 test 3 comparison of boundary conditions with this test we aimed to compare results using different downstream boundary conditions i a condition of constant sea level used in previous experiments and ii daily measurements of water level in rio grande regatas gauge rgr simulations were performed covering the calibration period with the cd value defined in test 1 and daily wind datasets the use of rgr water level data as boundary condition can insert some distortions since the gauging station is located 20 km upstream of the outlet it also contains information of not only tides but of local wind and flow however this dataset was chosen due to the low importance of astronomic tides in the region this hinders the usage of tide predictions and the unavailability of sea level data measured on the seashore in addition several authors also have been using this boundary condition in hydrodynamic studies of the lagoon e g möller et al 2001 cavalcante and mendes 2014 4 results and discussion 4 1 experiment 1 model results in this section are going to be presented in three main sub sections i rivers discharge calibration results using metrics maps and hydrographs ii river discharge validation results using metrics maps and hydrographs iii validation of inundated areas using maps by showing a comparison of simulated inundated areas with observed inundated areas from satellite images of the same day and iv calibration and validation of water levels using water level graphs and performance metrics 4 1 1 rivers discharge calibration results fig 7 a shows the performance of model calibration in the 33 streamflow gauging stations regarding the ns value the model performance was considered coherent especially in the north region of the basin comprehending the brazilian portion of the basin as most gauges presented ns values above 0 6 in the uruguayan portion of the basin however performance was between 0 20 and 0 60 these results could have been affected by lower availability and quality of flow and rainfall data in uruguay and the lower resolution of the used hru map in the uruguayan region the best ns metric results are seen especially downstream at the main tributaries jacuí taquari e camaquã rivers gauges 11 22 and 30 with ns values above 0 76 for 22 and 30 and a ns value of 0 84 for the main tributary the jacuí river 11 the taquari river presents good results over all its length presenting ns values greater than 0 8 at several locations the lowest ns result corresponded to gauge 6 in the upper jacuí river and may be due to dams located upstream which the model cannot account for this effect however is dampened throughout the length of the river fig 7b presents the calibration results regarding logns values the logns results are very similar to ns results performing coherently overall especially in the brazilian portion of the basin with poorer performance in the uruguayan region fig 7c shows the results regarding the absolute bias the performance of the model regarding this metric was considered adequate as δv was lower than 10 in most gauging stations the poorer results with δv between 20 and 30 happened in only 2 gauging stations in the basin fig 8 shows the hydrograph correspondent to gauging station 30 at the camaquã river although in some points the peek flows are overestimated by the model in most days the simulated and observed hydrographs agree the hydrological overall regime is represented well considering both flow peeks and base flow fig 9 shows the observed and simulated hydrographs for the taquari river at gauge 22 the observed and simulated hydrographs visually match in terms of representation of the hydrological regime for both peek flows and base flow fig 10 shows the observed and simulated hydrographs for the jacuí river at gauge station 11 the jacuí river is located in a plain area therefore its hydrograph is smoother than the hydrographs of other rivers in the region the coherent performance as can be seen in the hydrographs shows the model s capability to simulate floodplains 4 1 2 rivers discharge validation results fig 11 shows the performance of the model during the validation period the performance of the model during validation was very similar to the calibration performance all metrics achieved relatively adequate values at most gauging stations with better results on the brazilian portion of the basin gauges located further downstream of the main tributaries still presented coherent results the validation results suggest that the calibration is relatively well physically grounded and is feasible to be used for further applications such as flood forecasting figs 12 14 show the observed and simulated hydrographs of gauging stations 30 22 and 11 for the camaquã taquari and jacuí rivers respectively it can be seen in the validation hydrographs that the hydrological regime is coherently represented by the model especially for the jacuí river which can be considered the main tributary of the lagoon regarding river discharge 4 1 3 validation of inundated areas and water levels until this point results showed that we were able to satisfactorily simulate the riverine portions of the pl basin following we present the results regarding inundated areas and lagoon levels which show the potential of the model to represent the pl and guaíba lake 4 1 3 1 inundated areas visual results the inundated areas simulated by the model were compared with landsat 5 satellite images from the same day of the simulation dates were chosen based on the images availability and hydrological period searching for both very wet and very dry periods figures shown in this sub section are composed of 3 images the image on the center represents the simulated inundated area painted red on top of the satellite image which is represented alone in the left the image on the right shows the location of the landsat image regarding the watershed area fig 15 shows the inundated area in the region of patos lagoon on 3 february 2007 a dry period from fig 15 it is possible to observe that the model captured the whole submerged lagoon area during a dry period validating the proposed quasi 2d representation using a lagoon discretization in unit catchments and effective channels in terms of spatial extension fig 16 shows the simulated and observed inundated area for a flood period in 1 october 2007 representing upstream of pl the guaíba lake and its tributaries fig 17 show a zoom in the jacuí river floodplain in the same date a good compatibility between flooded areas extensions can be seen especially in the jacuí river but also in the pl the guaíba lake and downstream of rivers taquari sinos and caí the performance of the model regarding flooded area was worse upstream of the eastern tributaries but in this region there were no flow gauges and therefore this can be due to a less representative hydrological calibration for this area 4 1 3 2 calibration period water level results table 1 presents the results of performance metrics of water levels anomalies simulated in experiment 1 regarding the calibration period for all gauging stations upstream of rio grande regatas rgr ns values are in the order of 0 7 results were considered satisfactory for level gauges upstream of rgr as ns values presented a more similar range than the ones obtained by another study which used a 2d hydrodynamic model for the pl cavalcante and mendes 2014 used the model iph a borche 1996 to simulate pl hydrodynamics using observed flow data from camaquã river and water level data from ilha da pintada and rgr gauging stations as boundary conditions the authors obtained a range of ns values of 0 58 0 89 for the 6 water level gauges upstream of rgr without ilha da pintada similar to our range for the same locations 0 66 0 73 the unsatisfactory results obtained in the rgr gauging station can be linked to the use of a constant water level as a downstream boundary condition which does not allow for the consideration of non local wind effects and tides rmse values ranged between 12 8 cm laranjal gauge and 22 6 cm cristal gauge rmse results are in the order of 10 of observed water level anomalies variability considering the 7 gauging stations upstream of rgr nsm values are lower than ns values which suggests the inability of the model to simulate high frequency oscillations of water levels the main reason why high frequencies are not correctly modelled is the lack of wind data in the simulation figs 18 to 20 show observed and simulated water level at gauges ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively it is possible to see from figs 18 to 20 an overall coherent representation of water levels especially regarding higher water level periods high frequency oscillations of water levels are not represented well and the simulated and observed water levels agree in seasonal mean values this result agrees with the pl behaviour described by möller et al 2001 that the river discharges are often responsible for level variation in the longer time period as high frequency oscillations are mainly due to wind influence in low flow periods however the representation is not as adequate as the water levels are often overestimated especially at the arambaré gauge location 4 1 3 3 validation period water level results table 2 shows the results of performance metrics of water levels anomalies simulated in experiment 1 regarding the validation period values obtained are very similar to the results obtained in the calibration period ns values from gauges upstream of rgr are in the range of 0 63 0 77 rmse values ranged from 13 2 cm to 23 7 cm figs 21 to 23 shows the observed and simulated water level anomalies for gauging stations ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively regarding the validation period figs 21 to 23 shows similar results in comparison to the ones obtained in the calibration period good overall representations especially for high water level periods it is possible to notice some issues within observed data for the ilha da pintada gauging station between 1984 and 1985 which influenced ns rmse and r values data issues did not affect nsm because the anomalies are calculated from a moving average of 31 days the same problem was verified in rgr gauge data what is probably related to the worse values of ns rmse and r in the validation period in rgr 4 2 experiment 2 results of experiment 2 are composed of metrics and graphs showing water level estimation performance for the calibration and validation periods considering wind effect in the simulations 4 2 1 calibration period water level results table 3 shows the performance metrics of water level anomalies for the calibration period with the consideration of wind shear stress comparing these metrics to the results obtained in experiment 1 we could confirm that all gauging stations upstream of rgr had their performance improved by the consideration of wind shear stress the average improvement for ns nsm rmse and r for these 7 gauges locations was of 4 34 5 and 2 respectively the larger improvement of nsm is related to the consideration of local wind effect over the system the worse performance at rgr gauge location with the inclusion of wind effect can be due to the non representation of the interaction between local wind and coastal water levels this is also supported by möller et al 1996 2001 who found low coherence between local wind effects and water levels in rgs figs 24 to 26 show the observed and simulated water level for gauges ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively for experiments 1 and 2 regarding the calibration period through analysing observing figs 24 to 26 a better representation of high frequency water level oscillations due to wind influence inclusion can be verified however the amplitude of these oscillations was not exactly properly represented given that cd is not necessarily a constant but can depend on other environmental characteristics francis 1954 this result motivated the realisation of the first test of experiment 3 to verify the influence of the cd value in the representation of these oscillations 4 2 2 validation period water level results table 4 shows the performance metrics of water level anomalies for the validation period with the consideration of wind shear stress results are consistent over all 7 gauges upstream of rgr for all performance metrics which indicates that wind inclusion contributed to the conception of a better model 4 3 experiment 3 this experiment is composed of three tests using the same model used in experiment 2 the results for each test are as follows 4 3 1 test 1 sensitivity analysis of cd tables 5 and 6 represent ns and nsm results obtained with simulations using different cd values the best ns and nsm values for each gauge are in bold in addition for all gauging stations upstream of rgr more desirable better values are met for greater cd values although the best cd value for each gauging station varies e g 10 10 6 for ilha da pintada and 15 10 6 for ipanema the value of 10 10 6 was the optimal because on average considering gauges upstream of rgr this cd was the more desirable figs 27 and 28 plots observed and simulated anomalies considering cd values of 4 10 6 10 10 6 20 10 6 and 40 10 6 for level gauges ilha da pintada and arambaré respectively the greater the value of cd the higher the amplitude of high frequency water level variations agreeing with other studies e g cavalcante and mendes 2014 fig 29 shows the anomalies related to the moving average of 31 days for ilha da pintada gauging station this figure aids the visualisation of wind effect on water levels and allows for a clearer verification of improvements in high frequency water level simulation the curve related to a cd value of zero experiment 1 represents the establishment of a seasonal average water level while the curves with cd from 4 10 6 to 10 10 6 progressively are able to simulate high frequency water level oscillations in this figure it is also clearer that the use of cd of 10 10 6 regarding ilha da pintada gauge results in a better representation of water level behavior 4 3 2 test 2 comparison of wind datasets tables 7 to 10 display results of performance metrics regarding simulations with daily wind data and hourly wind data for two values of cd the value used in experiment 2 and the value defined in experiment 3 test 1 the best values of performance metrics for each level gauge are displayed in bold generally the use of the hourly wind data set allowed for the achievement of better metrics results especially in the guaíba lake area results of ns in the order of 0 8 were found in the stations of ilha da pintada and ponta dos coatis for the three level gauges downstream of arambaré the use of hourly data did not result in benefits regarding most performance metrics nsm values presented considerable increases with the use of hourly datasets especially in ponta dos coatis and ipanema gauging stations the use of cd equal to 10 10 6 resulted in a better option for both wind datasets in most gauges however the best value of cd varied depending on the gauge for both daily and hourly wind data this can motivate future studies to verify the response of the system to the use of different cd values in different parts of the water body figs 30 31 and 32 show the comparison between water level anomalies simulated using hourly and daily wind datasets for gauging stations ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal respectively the visual analysis of figures demonstrates that the use of hourly data helped to better simulate the amplitude of high frequency oscillations this can be related not only to more temporal detail but to more spatial availability of data e g hourly data comprehends data from stations in the east side of lp while daily data does not 4 3 3 test 3 comparison of downstream boundary conditions table 11 shows performance metrics results for the calibration period considering water levels measured at rgr as downstream boundary condition daily wind data and a cd value of 10 10 6 it is possible to compare these results to the performance metrics obtained in test 1 for the same value of cd and with constant sea level as a boundary condition from this comparison a better performance was perceived in all gauging stations for ns rmse and r only são lourenço gauge regarding nsm presented a poorer performance further studies should take place to understand why laranjal gauge presented the greatest increase of nsm of about 37 which might be related to the greater influence of tide oscillations in water level variations on this location due to its proximity to the outlet of the basin figs 33 34 and 35 show the anomalies of water levels considering the previous boundary condition of constant see level previous bc and the new boundary condition of measured water levels in rgr new bc both curves were simulated with a cd value of 10 10 6 and compared to observed data for gauging stations ilha da pintada arambaré and laranjal these visual analyses of the figures allow us to state that the change of boundary condition enabled a better representation of water levels regarding mainly the lower water level periods this result also suggests that if the aim is to simulate higher water level periods the use of constant sea level as boundary condition may be sufficient however if there is an interest in low flow periods it may be required to consider more detailed downstream boundary conditions 5 conclusion summarizing the obtained results the study allowed us to answer the three proposed questions 1 is it possible to simulate a basin rivers lakes and lagoons with one integrated hydrological hydrodynamic model and coherently estimate water levels and inundated areas yes it was possible to use only the mgb iph model to simulate a complex lagoon riverine basin and obtain coherent results of both flooded areas and water levels water level performance metrics results were in the range of results obtained in the literature with the use of a 2d hydrodynamic model 2 will the inclusion of wind effect improve water level simulations yes the inclusion of wind shear aided the achievement of better results and suggest the potential of the model to be used in regions that are affected by wind influence 3 to what extent can the input data and parameters be used to improve the representation the use of a larger cd value of 10 10 6 improved performance metrics as well as the use of hourly wind especially for the gauges located in the guaíba lake the change of downstream boundary condition to observed water levels instead of constant sea level was also beneficial and improved the representation of water level anomalies in low flow periods from authors knowledge this research was the first time in which a single hydrological hydrodynamic model was used to simulate an integrated lagoon riverine large scale system furthermore it was the first known implementation of wind shear effects on local inertial equations for one dimensional and quasi 2d large scale simulation from the developed model we believe that the next step in relation to social aids would be designing the operational forecasting system of discharges and water levels for the region the results showed that an adequate representation of the region for forecasting purposes will not demand only rainfall data as commonly used in tropical hydrological forecasting systems fan et al 2015c 2017 but also wind speed and direction information regarding the forecasting system tests also indicate that the usage of a constant sea level as boundary condition for the forecasting window is sufficient during high water level periods additionally future studies must take place to further understand why optimal cd values differ in different stations or to include cd variation according to environmental variables such as wind velocity francis 1954 as it is done for example in the telemac mascaret system lhf 1997 other methods for defining flow direction for wind shear calculation should be tested as well acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge brazilian agencies cnpq for funding the

6997,the stage discharge relationship is one of the frequently used methods for continuous river flow measurement in the management of water resources and flood control the accuracy of the rating curve is a key priority various methods have been proposed for estimating the stage discharge curves in open channels including the model of ahmadi et al 2017 in which the rating curve was identified by utilizing the information of discharge at a referenced water level in the present study a novel approach was taken to improve that model by modifying its basic assumptions and employing multi objective optimization to this end multivariate relationships were presented to determine the actual mean velocity in the flow cross section the unknown exponents of the proposed relationships were obtained by using the second version of the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm spea2 and the appropriate equation was selected by applying the topsis technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution approach the validity of the proposed method was assessed across 6 artificial and 6 natural hydraulic cross sections results showed a close agreement between the estimated and

discharge measurement in natural rivers plays an important role in comprehensive planning for the utilization of water resources in river basins generally continuous discharge measurement of rivers is difficult in addition direct discharge measurement is a time consuming and costly approach birkhead and james 1998 conventionally discharge of an open channel is estimated by measuring the water level and converting the measurement to discharge by using the stage discharge relationship using reliable stage discharge curves can be useful in surface hydrology applications braca 2008 historically several methods have been presented for the determination of the stage discharge relationship the results of conventional methods such as the manning and chezy formula are acceptable in cross sections that lack geometrical complexities this method is named as a single channel method scm because flow in the cross section is considered to be unified however in channels with floodplain s the validity of the results is weakened and the estimated discharge over the floodplains is less than the actual value of discharge passing through these areas sahu et al 2011 in order to overcome this issue one dimensional methods have been proposed these include the divided channel method dcm sellin 1964 the coherence method coh ackers 1993 the weighted divided channel method wdcm lambert and myers 1998 and the exchange discharge method edm bousmar and zech 1999 however as these proposed methods are based on the dcm the specification of regions of the cross sections with complex geometry and the determination of the river bed slope are significant challenges furthermore most of these methods require calibrations the shiono and knight method skm is an efficient approach based on the depth mean velocity model in this method local bed friction lateral eddy viscosity and depth average secondary flow coefficients must be calibrated for each cross section shiono and knight 1991 abril and knight 2004 developed the skm by using the finite element method to estimate stage discharge in natural rivers after that knight et al 2009 presented the conveyance estimation system ces which is a user friendly model based on skm singh et al 2014 used the tsallis entropy for deriving the rating curves based on the total probability and the mean discharge constraints in their method the rating curve s parameters can be obtained from the lagrange multipliers by maximizing the tsallis entropy in addition the entropy index m corresponding to the closest agreement with the observations must be calibrated by using observational data singh et al 2014 proposed the modified rating curve approach using the m parameter which is a simpler method for the ungauged basin however the value of m depends on river morphology and maximum discharge thus also requiring calibration today technological advances empower us to rapidly solve complex issues with soft computing techniques there are different applications of soft computing techniques in rating curve modeling degagne et al 1996 presented a decision support system to fit rating curves develop the stage discharge relationships and quantify confidence limits in the use of these curves deka and chandramouli 2003 used a fuzzy neural network fnn model for deriving the stage discharge relationship at brahmaputra river india yoo and park 2010 utilized a mixture density network mdn based approach for finding rating curves at two stream gauge stations han and mokkye rivers korea azamathulla and zahiri 2012 derived a simple and dimensionless equation for the prediction of flow discharge in the straight laboratory and river compound open channels using a new branch of genetic programming gp called linear genetic programming lgp moreover the use of multi objective optimization methods have been considered in the derivation of the stage discharge curve for instance sharifi et al 2011 explored the possibility of applying a multi objective evolutionary algorithm to improve conveyance estimation and automate the calibration procedure of a quasi 2d numerical model in multi objective optimization a set of responses in the feasible space that are not dominated by any other responses is called a pareto optimal set sarker et al 2002 the simplest and most primitive method in the multi objective process is the weighted sum or scalarization technique this method cannot produce a pareto optimal set in a single run decision makers are not aware of the most proper weight values for arriving at the best response caramia and dell olmo 2008 based on the genetic algorithm ga zitzler and thiele 1999 introduced an algorithm called the spea strength pareto evolutionary algorithm in this approach the studied population and the external non dominated set are separately defined in each generation following the presentation of the spea zitzler et al 2001 proposed the spea2 by developing the previous model the spea2 improved the fitness assignment scheme and its use of a nearest neighbor density estimation technique and a new archive truncation method guaranteed the preservation of boundary solutions with respect to the convergence and diversity of responses results obtained from the spea2 were superior to those of spea in the present study the spea2 was used in the optimization process for obtaining the proposed relationship maghrebi and ahmadi 2017 and maghrebi et al 2017 proposed a dimensionless formula for predicting rating curves in natural rivers and straight channels based on the parameters of the single point velocity measurement named spm maghrebi 2006 the method which they proposed established the relationship between discharges at referenced and estimated water levels however the effect of bed roughness distribution was not considered in the aforementioned study kavousizadeh 2017 and ahmadi et al 2017 proposed a new relationship which considers the effect of bed roughness when predicting rating curves in compound channels and natural rivers the primary assumption of their method was that there is a high correlation between the mean value of the isovel contours u spm obtained from the spm and the actual mean velocity u of the cross sections therefore it was assumed that the u spm plays the role of the actual mean velocity in other words a unit value was considered for the exponent of u spm in the multivariate relationship in the current paper the proposed method has significant differences compared to the previous model firstly it was assumed that the mean value of the isovel contours u spm should be modified by using geometric parameters to estimate the actual mean velocity of the cross section whereas in the previous model this parameter was not modified and only had a role in estimating the stage discharge curve because the u spm parameter was considered to be a type of representation of the actual mean velocity it is more logical that the correction coefficient between these two parameters was determined in the presently proposed method after the actual mean velocity value was estimated the stage discharge curve could be estimated using the area parameter in accordance with the continuity equation secondly in the present method the multi objective optimization process was used for determining the proposed relationship instead of a method similar to the weighted sum approach that was used in the previous model to this end the unknown exponent values of the proposed relationship were determined using the spea2 as a multi objective algorithm and the best relationship was obtained by utilizing the topsis technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution method furthermore in the previous model the objective function in the optimization process was extracted from the discharge parameter while the new hypothesis of the present approach resulted in having objective functions that utilized the actual mean velocity parameter in fact not only the assumption was changed but also the methodology completely evolved for the verification of the proposed model hydrometric data of six artificial cross sections were used in addition results from the proposed method were compared with observed data obtained from colorado main nazli chay severn tomebamba and cuntan hydrometry stations 2 methodology in this section the basic principles of the single point velocity measurement spm method are firstly described the determination of the newly proposed relationship is then presented 2 1 the governing principles of the spm spm is an efficient method for the estimation of discharge in natural and artificial open channels and was proposed by maghrebi 2006 in this method the field of a current flowing inside a wire as an analogue to the flow of water in a section of an open channel is simulated by using the biot savart law in the first step the computational grid over the flow cross section had to be determined fig 1 shows a schematic view of a triangular mesh over a compound cross section in which the wetted perimeter is divided into infinitesimal elements d s d u spm is the effect of d s from the wetted perimeter on the velocity at an arbitrary point with coordinates of y z and can be calculated as follows 1 d u spm f r c 1 d s where r is a vector between the boundary element and the point intended c 1 is a constant related to the boundary roughness and f r is the dominant velocity function in terms of r entire boundary elements involve a point with horizontal y and vertical z coordinates at a cross section u spm y z could be computed by the integration of the effects of all boundary elements over each point with coordinates of y z 2 u spm y z boundary c 1 f r sin θ d s where θ is the angle between the positional vector r and the boundary element vector d s maghrebi 2006 used the power law to estimate the distribution of the velocity profile the velocity function in eq 2 is stated as follows 3 f r u c 2 r 1 m where c 2 is the coefficient related to turbulent intensity and wall shear stress and u is the boundary shear velocity by substituting eq 3 into eq 2 the value of u spm y z could be obtained at any arbitrary point with coordinates of y z 4 u spm y z boundary c 1 u c 2 r 1 m sin θ d s by considering c 3 c 1 c 2 u and m 7 eq 4 was rewritten as 5 u spm y z boundary c 3 r 1 7 sin θ d s when using the spm method determining the value of c 3 in cross sections with non uniform roughness distribution is quite complex and requires laboratory studies in recent research conducted by ahmadi et al 2017 solving eq 5 has become simpler by considering that c 3 1 it must be noted that the effective bed roughness is taken into account by employing the equivalent manning roughness parameter n in computations for the newly proposed relationship the mean value of u spm over the cross sectional area which is shown as u spm can be derived as follows 6 u spm a u spm y z d a a where da is the area of each computational mesh and a is total area of the transverse cross section of flow it must be noted that u spm is not the actual mean velocity of the flow but is rather a computational parameter which is dependent upon the geometrical shape of the cross section 2 2 determination of the proposed relationship making a connection among the actual mean velocity u the value of u spm and the geometrical parameters of the cross section was the most important aspect of this paper for this purpose the effective hydraulical and geometrical parameters in the wetted perimeter p the width of the water surface t the equivalent roughness n and the bed slope s 0 were propounded along with these parameters the influence of the geometrical parameter p t which is the result of the summation of the wetted perimeter and the free water surface p t p t was considered in this procedure after the determination of the effective variables including u spm and the determination of the geometric and hydraulic variables the actual mean velocity was expressed by the following function 7 u f p t p t u spm n s 0 as a result the variables affecting the amount of velocity were selected according to the following relationship 8 u p a 1 t a 2 p t a 3 u spm a 4 n a 5 s 0 a 6 overall the relationship between the mean velocities at two different water levels was presented as follows 9 u i u j p i p j a 1 t i t j a 2 p t i p t j a 3 u spm i u spm j a 4 n i n j a 5 s 0 i s 0 j a 6 where the subscripts i and j refer to the estimated and referenced values respectively the exponent a 6 was considered as zero because the effect of the bed slope of the channel which stays fixed at all water levels can be neglected from the computational procedure on the other hand considering the inverse relationship between the velocity value and the equivalent manning roughness the exponent was specified as a 5 1 thus the general form of the proposed relationship was expressed as follows 10 u i u j p i p j a 1 t i t j a 2 p t i p t j a 3 u spm i u spm j a 4 n i n j 1 from eq 10 the mean velocity in all water levels can be estimated only by using the value of mean velocity at the j th stage as the reference data in other words the mean velocity in each intended level as the reference level is a prerequisite for stage velocity estimation eq 10 shows a multivariate relationship in which the unknown parameters are a 1 a 2 a 3 and a 4 in order to recognize the best response several steps had to be taken at first some of the stage velocity data from various hydraulic cross sections were required the stage velocity values were calculated for the circular section at different water levels using the manning formula the assumed values for the geometry of the cross sections were as follows diameter of circular cross section is equal to 1 m a manning roughness of n 0 01 and a bed slope of s 0 0 001 the laboratory information of fcf s1 and fcf s2 flood channel facility series 1 and series 2 respectively knight 1992 was used as complementary cross sectional information to take into account the complexity of hydraulic flow in compound cross sections geometrical specification of fcf s1 and fcf s2 are presented in table 1 in table 1 the geometrical and hydraulical parameters n c n f s c s f b w c b w fl b w fr h and h f which are shown in fig 1 are the manning roughness in the main channel the floodplain the side slope of the main channel the side slope of the floodplain the width of the main channel the width of the floodplain on the left side the width of the floodplain on the right side the depth of the main channel and the depth of the floodplain respectively in order to facilitate the optimization procedure the values of a p t u spm and n had to be computed in three selected sections at all water levels fig 2 shows the dimensionless values of these parameters the maximum values of the aforementioned parameters are given in table 2 as a max p max t max u spm max and n max due to the multivariate relationship described in eq 10 multi objective optimization methods had to be applied in order to elicit the best response in the current paper the spea2 was implemented in the optimization procedure for the three objective functions the parameter of rmse root mean square error is different between the observed and estimated velocities when selecting different reference levels the objective function was therefore considered as the average rmse across all reference points rmse which was calculated as follows 11 rmse j 1 n i 1 i j n u o i u o j p i p j a 1 t i t j a 2 p t i p t j a 3 u s p m i u s p m j a 4 n i n j a 5 2 n 1 n in the above equation u o denotes observed velocities n is the number of observed levels the j index represents the counter of the observation level and the i index denotes the counter of the estimated level the three objective functions were defined with respect to the definition of rmse and by using three geometrical cross sections 12 objective functions ob j 1 rmse circular o b j 2 rmse fcf s 1 o b j 3 rmse fcf s 2 various scenarios were speculated for the representation of the proposed relationship concerning the presence or absence of geometrical parameters in other words the geometric parameters p t p t could participate in the proposed relationship in different scenarios depending on the presence or absence of each parameter in the proposed relationships eight 2 3 different cases existed by eliminating the case in which all geometric parameters were absent only seven relationships could be considered after the determination of objective functions and different computational scenarios the configuration of algorithm parameters was required parameters related to the spea2 are provided in table 3 pareto frontier related to objective functions ob j 1 ob j 2 and ob j 3 are shown in fig 3 generally by increasing the number of parameters in proposed relationships the pareto frontier leans towards responses with greater accuracy since one of the principal goals of this research was to provide a relationship for each of the mentioned scenarios multi criteria decision making was required for determining the proposed relationships yoon and hwang 1981 proposed a multi criteria decision making approach that is called topsis technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution the major idea came from the concept of the compromise solution in which one must select the nearest alternative to the positive ideal solution and farthest alternative from the negative ideal solution tzeng and huang 2011 in the topsis approach the set of studied responses is defined in a matrix where columns represent criteria objective values and rows represent responses each column is separately normalized and obtained values are multiplied by the relative weight coefficient related to the same criterion in the present calculations all criteria have equal relative weight coefficients next considering that the approach concerns the minimization or maximization of each criterion minimization approach was taken in the present calculations two vectors of positive ideal point pis and negative ideal point nis are computed in the present calculations with respect to the type of problem pis vector and nis vector consisted of the minimum and maximum values for each column respectively then euclidean norms of the differences between each of the pis and nis vectors with values of each row of the mentioned matrix are computed in the form of d k and d k respectively however it must be noted that the k index denotes the row counter in the computational matrix finally the similarities of the alternatives to the pis can be derived as follows tzeng and huang 2011 13 c k d k d k d k after computing c k for each row of the matrix the best response would be the one with a greater value of c k according to fig 3 the best responses for each assumed scenario are marked with circled numbers the results related to the selected relationships are reported in table 4 according to table 4 although objective functions ob j 2 and ob j 3 were slightly smaller in relationships 4 and 5 than in relationship 7 it must be noted that the value of the objective function ob j 1 was about 10 times greater in relationships 4 and 5 than in relationship 7 therefore eq 10 was introduced as the final form of the proposed equation 14 u i u j p i p j 1 t i t j 0 06 p t i p t j 0 54 u spm i u spm j 0

stage discharge curves of the aforementioned cross sections which were obtained at various water levels from eq 15 generally a close agreement between observed and estimated data could be observed in both figs 4 and 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation in artificial channels in this section the proposed method was validated by its application to six artificial hydraulic cross sections which were obtained from experimental work and the theoretical equation for this purpose the specifications of stage discharge curves were computed for the rectangular and trapezoidal sections at different water levels using the manning formula the adopted values for the geometry of the cross sections were as follows the width of the rectangular and trapezoidal cross sections were 1 m and 2 m respectively the walls of the trapezoidal channel had side slopes of 1 h 2 v for both cross sections the highest water level was h max 1 m the manning roughness was n 0 01 and the bed slope was s 0 0 001 the main property of these two cross sections is that they are inbank in the next step the specifications of two compound cross sections that were obtained from the fcf data set series knight 1992 were applied both fcf s3 and fcf s6 are compound cross sections with uniform bed roughness but the geometry of the fcf s6 cross section is in the form of an asymmetric compound channel in the final step the specifications of two laboratory cross sections p t s1 r3 and p t s2 r3 which were obtained in the study conducted by prinos and townsend 1984 were employed as two compound cross sections with heterogeneous roughness the specifications of these cross sections are given in table 1 the values of the a p t u spm and n parameters were calculated at observed levels and some extra water levels in order to setup smooth predicted curves for all six cross sections for instance in p t s1 r3 the value of the parameters engaged in eq 15 were calculated at 16 different water levels including 5 observational and 11 additional water levels fig 6 shows dimensionless variations from minimum to maximum water levels in these parameters values for h max a max p max t max u spm max and n max are presented in table 2 each of the observed discharges could be considered as reference data fig 7 shows estimated stage discharge curves based on different reference points in the studied cross sections the results show that if the reference data was selected at a lower stage then the accuracy of the estimated rating curve decreased it should be noted that this is not a general conclusion because the precision of the proposed method depends upon the exactness of the reference data in compound cross sections the results obtained from the proposed method were compared with those resulting from the wdcm method according to fig 7 c and d it was observed that when compared to the observational data the accuracy of the wdcm method was acceptable for fcf s3 and fcf s6 cross sections because the calibration of the model was based on experiments conducted in fcf channels the accuracy of the wdcm method decreased for the p t s1 r3 and p t s2 r3 cross sections in order to investigate the performance of the proposed method two statistical measures including mape mean absolute percentage error and nrmse normalized root mean square error were employed according to the following equations 16 mape 100 n i 1 n q o i q e i q o i 17 nrmse 1 n i 1 n q o i q e i 2 q o max q o min where q o and q e refer to observed and estimated discharge respectively in fig 8 the values of mape and nrmse are depicted for rectangular and trapezoidal cross sections for these cross sections the mape and nrmse values except for the two lower levels do not exceed 4 and 0 02 respectively for the compound channels based on the reference data over the floodplains statistical parameters were compared between estimated values obtained from the proposed method and those obtained from the wdcm model the average values of mape which can be computed based on all of the reference observational points were 6 7 and 7 96 for the fcf s3 and fcf s6 cross sections respectively furthermore the average values of nrmse which can be calculated based on all of the observational reference points were 0 054 and 0 063 for the fcf s3 and fcf s6 cross sections respectively in these cross sections the results conveyed that the values of error for the proposed method were in agreement with the values obtained from the wdcm model according to fig 8 e and f it could be observed that the accuracy of the proposed method was almost twice the accuracy of the wdcm model in the proposed method for the pt s1 r3 cross section the average values of nrmse and mape for different reference points were 0 085 and 7 05 respectively and the nrmse and mape values for these sections according to the wdcm method were 0 145 and 17 26 respectively also for the pt s2 r3 cross section the average mape value using the proposed method was 4 23 while a mape value of 12 35 was obtained using the wdcm method to sum up two flowcharts are shown in fig 9 in which one of them depicts the process of the derivation of the proposed relationship and the other illustrates the implementation of the proposed method for estimating stage discharge curves 3 2 validation in natural rivers the most interesting part of the present research was the verification of the proposed model in natural rivers because hydrometry has much greater difficulty in such cross sections compared to artificial cross sections for this matter 6 hydraulic cross sections in various rivers with different specifications were selected useful hydrometry data was available in knight s studies 2009 relating to the colorado and main rivers that are located in argentina and the uk respectively from fig 10 a and b roughness distribution is heterogeneous in these cross sections and the colorado river has large floodplains however the floodplains of the main river are not wide two other cross sections were the severn and tomebamba rivers in the uk and ecuador respectively their common property is their fairly uniform bed roughness distribution with the difference that the geometry of the severn river is in the form of a compound channel while the tomebamba river is inbank abril and knight 2004 fig 10 c shows the cross section of the nazli chay river located in the northwest of iran which has a heterogeneous roughness distribution amiri 2012 the determination of discharge in large rivers is accompanied with many difficulties fig 10 f shows the geometry of the cuntan hydrometry station in the yangtze river in china where the width of the cross section is almost 900 m and the discharge is huge xu et al 2004 fig 11 shows the variation of the relative values of a p t n and u spm for 6 selected cross sections and the maximums of these values are shown in table 5 in fig 12 the stage discharge curve is depicted for these cross sections through the proposed relationship in addition the stage discharge curve was obtained by using ces knight et al 2009 and or abril and knight s method 2004 for these cross sections except for cuntan station as observed the rating curves of the proposed method accurately predicted the amount of discharge at different water levels and its results were well matched with those of other methods in order to study the accuracy of the proposed method more closely the values of mape and nrmse for different reference levels were plotted and shown in fig 13 though other methods are shown as well according to fig 13 a in colorado river the maximum and minimum values of the mape parameter were 9 03 and 3 02 respectively in the main and severn rivers the highest value of the nrmse parameter did not exceed 0 08 in these two cross sections the average value of the mape parameter was within 7 52 and 5 55 respectively comparison between results obtained from abril and knight s method 2004 and the proposed method in the tomebamba river cross section signified that the results of the proposed model offer greater accuracy the results of both the proposed method and the ces method had close agreement with observational data in the colorado main severn and nazli chay rivers nevertheless it must be noted that in the method proposed by knight et al 2009 for each cross section parameters dependent upon the method must be calibrated while those of the presently proposed method do not require any calibration according to fig 13 f the mean value of mape and nrmse at the cuntan station were 5 92 and 0 058 respectively 3 3 comparison of the present method with previous model as previously mentioned ahmadi et al 2017 have conducted comprehensive studies in order to come up with a new method for the estimation of stage discharge curves eq 18 was the final form of their proposed relationship 18 q e q r a e a r 0 97 p e p r 1 27 p t e p t r 0 83 u spm e u spm r n e n r 1 the first significant difference between the new and old method is that in the previous one the exponent value of the u spm parameter was considered as the unit because the primary assumption of that method is that there is a high correlation between the value of u spm and the actual mean velocity u however considering figs 2 and 4 it could be seen that the variation of these values did not match with each other completely therefore it was unnecessary to consider the exponent values of u spm equal to one according to the continuity equation q a u in the present method it was assumed that the value of u spm should be modified by geometrical parameters in order to estimate the actual mean velocity subsequently the exponent value of parameter a should be considered as the unit in general it is noteworthy to mention that these assumptions have a remarkable effect on the optimization process because in the new and old methods the objective functions are related to the values of u and q respectively the other considerable difference between both models is that in the previous model an approach similar to the weighted sum optimization method was taken for the determination of the appropriate response however in the present method the unknown exponent values were obtained through the multi objective algorithm based on the spea2 approach in the following section the estimated stage discharges obtained from the previous and present methods were compared for six artificial and six natural hydraulic cross sections the average values of the mape and nrmse statistical parameters for selected cross sections obtained from the estimation of the stage discharge curve through both the method proposed by ahmadi et al 2017 and the presently proposed method are shown in fig 14 according to fig 14 a it can be seen that in the new method except for the colorado and tamebamba rivers the value of the mape statistical parameter was less than that of the previous method comparison of the nrmse statistical parameter in fig 14 b shows that the present relationship was superior to the previous one in 11 sections excluding the tamebamba river in actuality it was not possible to comprehensively compare the performance of both the new and old methods by statistical parameters such as mape and nrmse therefore the nonparametric mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 was used to determine the significance of differences between the present and previous methods the null hypothesis was that the median value of error between both models was the same the mann whitney test does not require the assumption of normal distributions of sample data yue and wang 2002 table 6 demonstrates the results of the mann whitney test for the selected sections column 2 illustrates the p value obtained for each cross section if this value was less than 0 05 then there was a significant difference between the two models at a 95 confidence level the mean values of error for new and old methods are presented in columns 3 and 4 respectively finally by comparing the absolute values of error that are shown in columns 3 and 4 the last column indicates which model is more efficient than the other overall no significant differences were identified between the results obtained from the application of the new and old methods for five cross sections however it should be noted that among these sections the absolute mean value of error obtained from the new model for fcf s6 p t s1 r3 p t s2 r3 and main cross sections was less than the corresponding values which were computed from the old model there were significant differences between the results obtained from each model for 7 cross sections the findings demonstrated that the new model overcame the old model across six cross sections 3 4 sensitivity analysis of roughness in general the uncertainty of roughness determination is inevitable therefore the sensitivity analysis of this parameter is one of the most important steps that should be taken given the relativity of the proposed relation if the roughness of the cross section is considered as homogeneous then the effect of the roughness parameter can be discarded due to the greater amount of uncertainties in river sections the effect of roughness variation in the colorado nazli chay and main rivers was investigated in the following section sampling based methods are among the most commonly used techniques in sensitivity analysis these methods are computed on the basis of the mapping between the input output relationship generated by the monte carlo mc simulation ekström and broed 2006 in this section using the monte carlo approach which is based on the random selection of data the roughness values for each region of the flow section were randomly considered in the range of 20 to 20 error from the roughness observed in the same region totally 10 000 different roughness distributions were considered for each cross section based on each roughness value the stage discharge curves were estimated using the proposed relationship fig 15 shows the variation of non dimensional equivalent manning roughness in the colorado nazli chay and main rivers according to fig 15 the roughness distribution set created a band of possible scenarios to investigate the effect of roughness uncertainty on the estimation of the rating curve in these sections the observational values of discharge at three levels according to fig 12 a c which are representative of the lower middle and upper water stages were used as reference levels fig 16 indicates the estimated stage discharge curves based on the different reference data with uncertainty in roughness distribution in selected cross sections according to fig 16 it can be observed that the water level of the reference data affects the propagation of the error s value from fig 16 a d g the selection of the reference point from the lower levels propagated the error to the upper stages in contrast if the reference data was selected from the upper levels then the error was propagated to the lower levels see fig 16 c f i obviously a reference point selected from the middle stages propagated the error to both sides for further investigation the statistical parameter of mean percentage error mpe was used as follows 19 mpe 1 n i 1 n q e i q o i q o i in each of the three studied sections the mpe parameter value was calculated for 10 000 different roughness distribution values next the values of the mpe parameter for roughness variations in each region of the mentioned cross sections for the reference point at the middle level are shown in fig 17 also the continuous line demonstrates the linear regression between these data according to fig 17 in some cases the absolute value of mpe was less than the corresponding value which was obtained from observed roughness distribution correlation provides a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two sets of data specifically the pearson correlation coefficient is utilized to determine the linear correlation between two variables 20 ρ ξ η σ ξ η σ ξ σ η where ρ ξ η is the population correlation coefficient between the ξ and η vectors and σ denotes the standard deviation the correlation coefficient has a value between 1 and 1 with a positive value indicating that ξ and η tend to increase and decrease together and a negative value indicating that ξ and η tend to move in opposite directions helton et al 2006 here the correlation coefficient expressed the degree of dependence of roughness values on corresponding mpes under different uncertainty conditions table 7 shows the obtained values of this parameter for scatterplots such as those in fig 17 when considering the different reference points as it can be seen in the colorado and main rivers the roughness of the middle regions had the most significant effect on the accuracy of discharge estimation however in the nazli chay river the roughness of the side walls had the highest impact on discharge prediction 4 conclusion in this paper a novel approach was introduced to enhance the method proposed by ahmadi et al 2017 in that method the stage discharge curve was estimated using discharge information from a referenced level which effectively reduced the time and cost of hydrometery in the present study by refining the basic assumptions of the previous model a new approach was introduced for estimating the stage velocity curve and then setting up the rating curve additionally with utilization of the spea2 algorithm the multi objective optimization approach was used to determine the proposed relationship this was a substantial improvement compared to the previous model where a method similar to the weighted sum approach was employed to this end several steps were taken in order to find the most appropriate relationship for validation the results obtained from the proposed method were compared with 6 artificial datasets and 6 natural observational datasets the results showed a close agreement between the observed and estimated data in addition the efficiencies of the proposed model and the previous model were compared for all selected cross sections using the mann whitney u test the results indicated that the new method had greater efficiency than the previous one in the final step for the proposed relationship roughness sensitivity was analyzed for the colorado main and nazli chay rivers it must be noted that the proposed relationship is universal applicable to all kinds of open channels and needless of any calibrations additionally this method can be utilized in hydrometry stations where bed slope information is not available furthermore another point worth noting is that the whole flow in the cross section is considered to be unified in the calculation of flow rate resulting in significant applicability for cross sections with complex geometry 
6997,the stage discharge relationship is one of the frequently used methods for continuous river flow measurement in the management of water resources and flood control the accuracy of the rating curve is a key priority various methods have been proposed for estimating the stage discharge curves in open channels including the model of ahmadi et al 2017 in which the rating curve was identified by utilizing the information of discharge at a referenced water level in the present study a novel approach was taken to improve that model by modifying its basic assumptions and employing multi objective optimization to this end multivariate relationships were presented to determine the actual mean velocity in the flow cross section the unknown exponents of the proposed relationships were obtained by using the second version of the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm spea2 and the appropriate equation was selected by applying the topsis technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution approach the validity of the proposed method was assessed across 6 artificial and 6 natural hydraulic cross sections results showed a close agreement between the estimated and

discharge measurement in natural rivers plays an important role in comprehensive planning for the utilization of water resources in river basins generally continuous discharge measurement of rivers is difficult in addition direct discharge measurement is a time consuming and costly approach birkhead and james 1998 conventionally discharge of an open channel is estimated by measuring the water level and converting the measurement to discharge by using the stage discharge relationship using reliable stage discharge curves can be useful in surface hydrology applications braca 2008 historically several methods have been presented for the determination of the stage discharge relationship the results of conventional methods such as the manning and chezy formula are acceptable in cross sections that lack geometrical complexities this method is named as a single channel method scm because flow in the cross section is considered to be unified however in channels with floodplain s the validity of the results is weakened and the estimated discharge over the floodplains is less than the actual value of discharge passing through these areas sahu et al 2011 in order to overcome this issue one dimensional methods have been proposed these include the divided channel method dcm sellin 1964 the coherence method coh ackers 1993 the weighted divided channel method wdcm lambert and myers 1998 and the exchange discharge method edm bousmar and zech 1999 however as these proposed methods are based on the dcm the specification of regions of the cross sections with complex geometry and the determination of the river bed slope are significant challenges furthermore most of these methods require calibrations the shiono and knight method skm is an efficient approach based on the depth mean velocity model in this method local bed friction lateral eddy viscosity and depth average secondary flow coefficients must be calibrated for each cross section shiono and knight 1991 abril and knight 2004 developed the skm by using the finite element method to estimate stage discharge in natural rivers after that knight et al 2009 presented the conveyance estimation system ces which is a user friendly model based on skm singh et al 2014 used the tsallis entropy for deriving the rating curves based on the total probability and the mean discharge constraints in their method the rating curve s parameters can be obtained from the lagrange multipliers by maximizing the tsallis entropy in addition the entropy index m corresponding to the closest agreement with the observations must be calibrated by using observational data singh et al 2014 proposed the modified rating curve approach using the m parameter which is a simpler method for the ungauged basin however the value of m depends on river morphology and maximum discharge thus also requiring calibration today technological advances empower us to rapidly solve complex issues with soft computing techniques there are different applications of soft computing techniques in rating curve modeling degagne et al 1996 presented a decision support system to fit rating curves develop the stage discharge relationships and quantify confidence limits in the use of these curves deka and chandramouli 2003 used a fuzzy neural network fnn model for deriving the stage discharge relationship at brahmaputra river india yoo and park 2010 utilized a mixture density network mdn based approach for finding rating curves at two stream gauge stations han and mokkye rivers korea azamathulla and zahiri 2012 derived a simple and dimensionless equation for the prediction of flow discharge in the straight laboratory and river compound open channels using a new branch of genetic programming gp called linear genetic programming lgp moreover the use of multi objective optimization methods have been considered in the derivation of the stage discharge curve for instance sharifi et al 2011 explored the possibility of applying a multi objective evolutionary algorithm to improve conveyance estimation and automate the calibration procedure of a quasi 2d numerical model in multi objective optimization a set of responses in the feasible space that are not dominated by any other responses is called a pareto optimal set sarker et al 2002 the simplest and most primitive method in the multi objective process is the weighted sum or scalarization technique this method cannot produce a pareto optimal set in a single run decision makers are not aware of the most proper weight values for arriving at the best response caramia and dell olmo 2008 based on the genetic algorithm ga zitzler and thiele 1999 introduced an algorithm called the spea strength pareto evolutionary algorithm in this approach the studied population and the external non dominated set are separately defined in each generation following the presentation of the spea zitzler et al 2001 proposed the spea2 by developing the previous model the spea2 improved the fitness assignment scheme and its use of a nearest neighbor density estimation technique and a new archive truncation method guaranteed the preservation of boundary solutions with respect to the convergence and diversity of responses results obtained from the spea2 were superior to those of spea in the present study the spea2 was used in the optimization process for obtaining the proposed relationship maghrebi and ahmadi 2017 and maghrebi et al 2017 proposed a dimensionless formula for predicting rating curves in natural rivers and straight channels based on the parameters of the single point velocity measurement named spm maghrebi 2006 the method which they proposed established the relationship between discharges at referenced and estimated water levels however the effect of bed roughness distribution was not considered in the aforementioned study kavousizadeh 2017 and ahmadi et al 2017 proposed a new relationship which considers the effect of bed roughness when predicting rating curves in compound channels and natural rivers the primary assumption of their method was that there is a high correlation between the mean value of the isovel contours u spm obtained from the spm and the actual mean velocity u of the cross sections therefore it was assumed that the u spm plays the role of the actual mean velocity in other words a unit value was considered for the exponent of u spm in the multivariate relationship in the current paper the proposed method has significant differences compared to the previous model firstly it was assumed that the mean value of the isovel contours u spm should be modified by using geometric parameters to estimate the actual mean velocity of the cross section whereas in the previous model this parameter was not modified and only had a role in estimating the stage discharge curve because the u spm parameter was considered to be a type of representation of the actual mean velocity it is more logical that the correction coefficient between these two parameters was determined in the presently proposed method after the actual mean velocity value was estimated the stage discharge curve could be estimated using the area parameter in accordance with the continuity equation secondly in the present method the multi objective optimization process was used for determining the proposed relationship instead of a method similar to the weighted sum approach that was used in the previous model to this end the unknown exponent values of the proposed relationship were determined using the spea2 as a multi objective algorithm and the best relationship was obtained by utilizing the topsis technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution method furthermore in the previous model the objective function in the optimization process was extracted from the discharge parameter while the new hypothesis of the present approach resulted in having objective functions that utilized the actual mean velocity parameter in fact not only the assumption was changed but also the methodology completely evolved for the verification of the proposed model hydrometric data of six artificial cross sections were used in addition results from the proposed method were compared with observed data obtained from colorado main nazli chay severn tomebamba and cuntan hydrometry stations 2 methodology in this section the basic principles of the single point velocity measurement spm method are firstly described the determination of the newly proposed relationship is then presented 2 1 the governing principles of the spm spm is an efficient method for the estimation of discharge in natural and artificial open channels and was proposed by maghrebi 2006 in this method the field of a current flowing inside a wire as an analogue to the flow of water in a section of an open channel is simulated by using the biot savart law in the first step the computational grid over the flow cross section had to be determined fig 1 shows a schematic view of a triangular mesh over a compound cross section in which the wetted perimeter is divided into infinitesimal elements d s d u spm is the effect of d s from the wetted perimeter on the velocity at an arbitrary point with coordinates of y z and can be calculated as follows 1 d u spm f r c 1 d s where r is a vector between the boundary element and the point intended c 1 is a constant related to the boundary roughness and f r is the dominant velocity function in terms of r entire boundary elements involve a point with horizontal y and vertical z coordinates at a cross section u spm y z could be computed by the integration of the effects of all boundary elements over each point with coordinates of y z 2 u spm y z boundary c 1 f r sin θ d s where θ is the angle between the positional vector r and the boundary element vector d s maghrebi 2006 used the power law to estimate the distribution of the velocity profile the velocity function in eq 2 is stated as follows 3 f r u c 2 r 1 m where c 2 is the coefficient related to turbulent intensity and wall shear stress and u is the boundary shear velocity by substituting eq 3 into eq 2 the value of u spm y z could be obtained at any arbitrary point with coordinates of y z 4 u spm y z boundary c 1 u c 2 r 1 m sin θ d s by considering c 3 c 1 c 2 u and m 7 eq 4 was rewritten as 5 u spm y z boundary c 3 r 1 7 sin θ d s when using the spm method determining the value of c 3 in cross sections with non uniform roughness distribution is quite complex and requires laboratory studies in recent research conducted by ahmadi et al 2017 solving eq 5 has become simpler by considering that c 3 1 it must be noted that the effective bed roughness is taken into account by employing the equivalent manning roughness parameter n in computations for the newly proposed relationship the mean value of u spm over the cross sectional area which is shown as u spm can be derived as follows 6 u spm a u spm y z d a a where da is the area of each computational mesh and a is total area of the transverse cross section of flow it must be noted that u spm is not the actual mean velocity of the flow but is rather a computational parameter which is dependent upon the geometrical shape of the cross section 2 2 determination of the proposed relationship making a connection among the actual mean velocity u the value of u spm and the geometrical parameters of the cross section was the most important aspect of this paper for this purpose the effective hydraulical and geometrical parameters in the wetted perimeter p the width of the water surface t the equivalent roughness n and the bed slope s 0 were propounded along with these parameters the influence of the geometrical parameter p t which is the result of the summation of the wetted perimeter and the free water surface p t p t was considered in this procedure after the determination of the effective variables including u spm and the determination of the geometric and hydraulic variables the actual mean velocity was expressed by the following function 7 u f p t p t u spm n s 0 as a result the variables affecting the amount of velocity were selected according to the following relationship 8 u p a 1 t a 2 p t a 3 u spm a 4 n a 5 s 0 a 6 overall the relationship between the mean velocities at two different water levels was presented as follows 9 u i u j p i p j a 1 t i t j a 2 p t i p t j a 3 u spm i u spm j a 4 n i n j a 5 s 0 i s 0 j a 6 where the subscripts i and j refer to the estimated and referenced values respectively the exponent a 6 was considered as zero because the effect of the bed slope of the channel which stays fixed at all water levels can be neglected from the computational procedure on the other hand considering the inverse relationship between the velocity value and the equivalent manning roughness the exponent was specified as a 5 1 thus the general form of the proposed relationship was expressed as follows 10 u i u j p i p j a 1 t i t j a 2 p t i p t j a 3 u spm i u spm j a 4 n i n j 1 from eq 10 the mean velocity in all water levels can be estimated only by using the value of mean velocity at the j th stage as the reference data in other words the mean velocity in each intended level as the reference level is a prerequisite for stage velocity estimation eq 10 shows a multivariate relationship in which the unknown parameters are a 1 a 2 a 3 and a 4 in order to recognize the best response several steps had to be taken at first some of the stage velocity data from various hydraulic cross sections were required the stage velocity values were calculated for the circular section at different water levels using the manning formula the assumed values for the geometry of the cross sections were as follows diameter of circular cross section is equal to 1 m a manning roughness of n 0 01 and a bed slope of s 0 0 001 the laboratory information of fcf s1 and fcf s2 flood channel facility series 1 and series 2 respectively knight 1992 was used as complementary cross sectional information to take into account the complexity of hydraulic flow in compound cross sections geometrical specification of fcf s1 and fcf s2 are presented in table 1 in table 1 the geometrical and hydraulical parameters n c n f s c s f b w c b w fl b w fr h and h f which are shown in fig 1 are the manning roughness in the main channel the floodplain the side slope of the main channel the side slope of the floodplain the width of the main channel the width of the floodplain on the left side the width of the floodplain on the right side the depth of the main channel and the depth of the floodplain respectively in order to facilitate the optimization procedure the values of a p t u spm and n had to be computed in three selected sections at all water levels fig 2 shows the dimensionless values of these parameters the maximum values of the aforementioned parameters are given in table 2 as a max p max t max u spm max and n max due to the multivariate relationship described in eq 10 multi objective optimization methods had to be applied in order to elicit the best response in the current paper the spea2 was implemented in the optimization procedure for the three objective functions the parameter of rmse root mean square error is different between the observed and estimated velocities when selecting different reference levels the objective function was therefore considered as the average rmse across all reference points rmse which was calculated as follows 11 rmse j 1 n i 1 i j n u o i u o j p i p j a 1 t i t j a 2 p t i p t j a 3 u s p m i u s p m j a 4 n i n j a 5 2 n 1 n in the above equation u o denotes observed velocities n is the number of observed levels the j index represents the counter of the observation level and the i index denotes the counter of the estimated level the three objective functions were defined with respect to the definition of rmse and by using three geometrical cross sections 12 objective functions ob j 1 rmse circular o b j 2 rmse fcf s 1 o b j 3 rmse fcf s 2 various scenarios were speculated for the representation of the proposed relationship concerning the presence or absence of geometrical parameters in other words the geometric parameters p t p t could participate in the proposed relationship in different scenarios depending on the presence or absence of each parameter in the proposed relationships eight 2 3 different cases existed by eliminating the case in which all geometric parameters were absent only seven relationships could be considered after the determination of objective functions and different computational scenarios the configuration of algorithm parameters was required parameters related to the spea2 are provided in table 3 pareto frontier related to objective functions ob j 1 ob j 2 and ob j 3 are shown in fig 3 generally by increasing the number of parameters in proposed relationships the pareto frontier leans towards responses with greater accuracy since one of the principal goals of this research was to provide a relationship for each of the mentioned scenarios multi criteria decision making was required for determining the proposed relationships yoon and hwang 1981 proposed a multi criteria decision making approach that is called topsis technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution the major idea came from the concept of the compromise solution in which one must select the nearest alternative to the positive ideal solution and farthest alternative from the negative ideal solution tzeng and huang 2011 in the topsis approach the set of studied responses is defined in a matrix where columns represent criteria objective values and rows represent responses each column is separately normalized and obtained values are multiplied by the relative weight coefficient related to the same criterion in the present calculations all criteria have equal relative weight coefficients next considering that the approach concerns the minimization or maximization of each criterion minimization approach was taken in the present calculations two vectors of positive ideal point pis and negative ideal point nis are computed in the present calculations with respect to the type of problem pis vector and nis vector consisted of the minimum and maximum values for each column respectively then euclidean norms of the differences between each of the pis and nis vectors with values of each row of the mentioned matrix are computed in the form of d k and d k respectively however it must be noted that the k index denotes the row counter in the computational matrix finally the similarities of the alternatives to the pis can be derived as follows tzeng and huang 2011 13 c k d k d k d k after computing c k for each row of the matrix the best response would be the one with a greater value of c k according to fig 3 the best responses for each assumed scenario are marked with circled numbers the results related to the selected relationships are reported in table 4 according to table 4 although objective functions ob j 2 and ob j 3 were slightly smaller in relationships 4 and 5 than in relationship 7 it must be noted that the value of the objective function ob j 1 was about 10 times greater in relationships 4 and 5 than in relationship 7 therefore eq 10 was introduced as the final form of the proposed equation 14 u i u j p i p j 1 t i t j 0 06 p t i p t j 0 54 u spm i u spm j 0 92 n i n j 1 with the multiplication of the cross sectional area in eq 14 the discharge value q of each stage was determined as 15 q i q j a i a j p i p j 1 t i t j 0 06 p t i p t j 0 54 u spm i u spm j 0 92 n i n j 1 fig 4 indicates the stage velocity curves in circular fcf s1 and fcf s2 cross sections which were estimated based on the proposed method at different referenced levels fig 5 shows the stage discharge curves of the aforementioned cross sections which were obtained at various water levels from eq 15 generally a close agreement between observed and estimated data could be observed in both figs 4 and 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation in artificial channels in this section the proposed method was validated by its application to six artificial hydraulic cross sections which were obtained from experimental work and the theoretical equation for this purpose the specifications of stage discharge curves were computed for the rectangular and trapezoidal sections at different water levels using the manning formula the adopted values for the geometry of the cross sections were as follows the width of the rectangular and trapezoidal cross sections were 1 m and 2 m respectively the walls of the trapezoidal channel had side slopes of 1 h 2 v for both cross sections the highest water level was h max 1 m the manning roughness was n 0 01 and the bed slope was s 0 0 001 the main property of these two cross sections is that they are inbank in the next step the specifications of two compound cross sections that were obtained from the fcf data set series knight 1992 were applied both fcf s3 and fcf s6 are compound cross sections with uniform bed roughness but the geometry of the fcf s6 cross section is in the form of an asymmetric compound channel in the final step the specifications of two laboratory cross sections p t s1 r3 and p t s2 r3 which were obtained in the study conducted by prinos and townsend 1984 were employed as two compound cross sections with heterogeneous roughness the specifications of these cross sections are given in table 1 the values of the a p t u spm and n parameters were calculated at observed levels and some extra water levels in order to setup smooth predicted curves for all six cross sections for instance in p t s1 r3 the value of the parameters engaged in eq 15 were calculated at 16 different water levels including 5 observational and 11 additional water levels fig 6 shows dimensionless variations from minimum to maximum water levels in these parameters values for h max a max p max t max u spm max and n max are presented in table 2 each of the observed discharges could be considered as reference data fig 7 shows estimated stage discharge curves based on different reference points in the studied cross sections the results show that if the reference data was selected at a lower stage then the accuracy of the estimated rating curve decreased it should be noted that this is not a general conclusion because the precision of the proposed method depends upon the exactness of the reference data in compound cross sections the results obtained from the proposed method were compared with those resulting from the wdcm method according to fig 7 c and d it was observed that when compared to the observational data the accuracy of the wdcm method was acceptable for fcf s3 and fcf s6 cross sections because the calibration of the model was based on experiments conducted in fcf channels the accuracy of the wdcm method decreased for the p t s1 r3 and p t s2 r3 cross sections in order to investigate the performance of the proposed method two statistical measures including mape mean absolute percentage error and nrmse normalized root mean square error were employed according to the following equations 16 mape 100 n i 1 n q o i q e i q o i 17 nrmse 1 n i 1 n q o i q e i 2 q o max q o min where q o and q e refer to observed and estimated discharge respectively in fig 8 the values of mape and nrmse are depicted for rectangular and trapezoidal cross sections for these cross sections the mape and nrmse values except for the two lower levels do not exceed 4 and 0 02 respectively for the compound channels based on the reference data over the floodplains statistical parameters were compared between estimated values obtained from the proposed method and those obtained from the wdcm model the average values of mape which can be computed based on all of the reference observational points were 6 7 and 7 96 for the fcf s3 and fcf s6 cross sections respectively furthermore the average values of nrmse which can be calculated based on all of the observational reference points were 0 054 and 0 063 for the fcf s3 and fcf s6 cross sections respectively in these cross sections the results conveyed that the values of error for the proposed method were in agreement with the values obtained from the wdcm model according to fig 8 e and f it could be observed that the accuracy of the proposed method was almost twice the accuracy of the wdcm model in the proposed method for the pt s1 r3 cross section the average values of nrmse and mape for different reference points were 0 085 and 7 05 respectively and the nrmse and mape values for these sections according to the wdcm method were 0 145 and 17 26 respectively also for the pt s2 r3 cross section the average mape value using the proposed method was 4 23 while a mape value of 12 35 was obtained using the wdcm method to sum up two flowcharts are shown in fig 9 in which one of them depicts the process of the derivation of the proposed relationship and the other illustrates the implementation of the proposed method for estimating stage discharge curves 3 2 validation in natural rivers the most interesting part of the present research was the verification of the proposed model in natural rivers because hydrometry has much greater difficulty in such cross sections compared to artificial cross sections for this matter 6 hydraulic cross sections in various rivers with different specifications were selected useful hydrometry data was available in knight s studies 2009 relating to the colorado and main rivers that are located in argentina and the uk respectively from fig 10 a and b roughness distribution is heterogeneous in these cross sections and the colorado river has large floodplains however the floodplains of the main river are not wide two other cross sections were the severn and tomebamba rivers in the uk and ecuador respectively their common property is their fairly uniform bed roughness distribution with the difference that the geometry of the severn river is in the form of a compound channel while the tomebamba river is inbank abril and knight 2004 fig 10 c shows the cross section of the nazli chay river located in the northwest of iran which has a heterogeneous roughness distribution amiri 2012 the determination of discharge in large rivers is accompanied with many difficulties fig 10 f shows the geometry of the cuntan hydrometry station in the yangtze river in china where the width of the cross section is almost 900 m and the discharge is huge xu et al 2004 fig 11 shows the variation of the relative values of a p t n and u spm for 6 selected cross sections and the maximums of these values are shown in table 5 in fig 12 the stage discharge curve is depicted for these cross sections through the proposed relationship in addition the stage discharge curve was obtained by using ces knight et al 2009 and or abril and knight s method 2004 for these cross sections except for cuntan station as observed the rating curves of the proposed method accurately predicted the amount of discharge at different water levels and its results were well matched with those of other methods in order to study the accuracy of the proposed method more closely the values of mape and nrmse for different reference levels were plotted and shown in fig 13 though other methods are shown as well according to fig 13 a in colorado river the maximum and minimum values of the mape parameter were 9 03 and 3 02 respectively in the main and severn rivers the highest value of the nrmse parameter did not exceed 0 08 in these two cross sections the average value of the mape parameter was within 7 52 and 5 55 respectively comparison between results obtained from abril and knight s method 2004 and the proposed method in the tomebamba river cross section signified that the results of the proposed model offer greater accuracy the results of both the proposed method and the ces method had close agreement with observational data in the colorado main severn and nazli chay rivers nevertheless it must be noted that in the method proposed by knight et al 2009 for each cross section parameters dependent upon the method must be calibrated while those of the presently proposed method do not require any calibration according to fig 13 f the mean value of mape and nrmse at the cuntan station were 5 92 and 0 058 respectively 3 3 comparison of the present method with previous model as previously mentioned ahmadi et al 2017 have conducted comprehensive studies in order to come up with a new method for the estimation of stage discharge curves eq 18 was the final form of their proposed relationship 18 q e q r a e a r 0 97 p e p r 1 27 p t e p t r 0 83 u spm e u spm r n e n r 1 the first significant difference between the new and old method is that in the previous one the exponent value of the u spm parameter was considered as the unit because the primary assumption of that method is that there is a high correlation between the value of u spm and the actual mean velocity u however considering figs 2 and 4 it could be seen that the variation of these values did not match with each other completely therefore it was unnecessary to consider the exponent values of u spm equal to one according to the continuity equation q a u in the present method it was assumed that the value of u spm should be modified by geometrical parameters in order to estimate the actual mean velocity subsequently the exponent value of parameter a should be considered as the unit in general it is noteworthy to mention that these assumptions have a remarkable effect on the optimization process because in the new and old methods the objective functions are related to the values of u and q respectively the other considerable difference between both models is that in the previous model an approach similar to the weighted sum optimization method was taken for the determination of the appropriate response however in the present method the unknown exponent values were obtained through the multi objective algorithm based on the spea2 approach in the following section the estimated stage discharges obtained from the previous and present methods were compared for six artificial and six natural hydraulic cross sections the average values of the mape and nrmse statistical parameters for selected cross sections obtained from the estimation of the stage discharge curve through both the method proposed by ahmadi et al 2017 and the presently proposed method are shown in fig 14 according to fig 14 a it can be seen that in the new method except for the colorado and tamebamba rivers the value of the mape statistical parameter was less than that of the previous method comparison of the nrmse statistical parameter in fig 14 b shows that the present relationship was superior to the previous one in 11 sections excluding the tamebamba river in actuality it was not possible to comprehensively compare the performance of both the new and old methods by statistical parameters such as mape and nrmse therefore the nonparametric mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 was used to determine the significance of differences between the present and previous methods the null hypothesis was that the median value of error between both models was the same the mann whitney test does not require the assumption of normal distributions of sample data yue and wang 2002 table 6 demonstrates the results of the mann whitney test for the selected sections column 2 illustrates the p value obtained for each cross section if this value was less than 0 05 then there was a significant difference between the two models at a 95 confidence level the mean values of error for new and old methods are presented in columns 3 and 4 respectively finally by comparing the absolute values of error that are shown in columns 3 and 4 the last column indicates which model is more efficient than the other overall no significant differences were identified between the results obtained from the application of the new and old methods for five cross sections however it should be noted that among these sections the absolute mean value of error obtained from the new model for fcf s6 p t s1 r3 p t s2 r3 and main cross sections was less than the corresponding values which were computed from the old model there were significant differences between the results obtained from each model for 7 cross sections the findings demonstrated that the new model overcame the old model across six cross sections 3 4 sensitivity analysis of roughness in general the uncertainty of roughness determination is inevitable therefore the sensitivity analysis of this parameter is one of the most important steps that should be taken given the relativity of the proposed relation if the roughness of the cross section is considered as homogeneous then the effect of the roughness parameter can be discarded due to the greater amount of uncertainties in river sections the effect of roughness variation in the colorado nazli chay and main rivers was investigated in the following section sampling based methods are among the most commonly used techniques in sensitivity analysis these methods are computed on the basis of the mapping between the input output relationship generated by the monte carlo mc simulation ekström and broed 2006 in this section using the monte carlo approach which is based on the random selection of data the roughness values for each region of the flow section were randomly considered in the range of 20 to 20 error from the roughness observed in the same region totally 10 000 different roughness distributions were considered for each cross section based on each roughness value the stage discharge curves were estimated using the proposed relationship fig 15 shows the variation of non dimensional equivalent manning roughness in the colorado nazli chay and main rivers according to fig 15 the roughness distribution set created a band of possible scenarios to investigate the effect of roughness uncertainty on the estimation of the rating curve in these sections the observational values of discharge at three levels according to fig 12 a c which are representative of the lower middle and upper water stages were used as reference levels fig 16 indicates the estimated stage discharge curves based on the different reference data with uncertainty in roughness distribution in selected cross sections according to fig 16 it can be observed that the water level of the reference data affects the propagation of the error s value from fig 16 a d g the selection of the reference point from the lower levels propagated the error to the upper stages in contrast if the reference data was selected from the upper levels then the error was propagated to the lower levels see fig 16 c f i obviously a reference point selected from the middle stages propagated the error to both sides for further investigation the statistical parameter of mean percentage error mpe was used as follows 19 mpe 1 n i 1 n q e i q o i q o i in each of the three studied sections the mpe parameter value was calculated for 10 000 different roughness distribution values next the values of the mpe parameter for roughness variations in each region of the mentioned cross sections for the reference point at the middle level are shown in fig 17 also the continuous line demonstrates the linear regression between these data according to fig 17 in some cases the absolute value of mpe was less than the corresponding value which was obtained from observed roughness distribution correlation provides a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two sets of data specifically the pearson correlation coefficient is utilized to determine the linear correlation between two variables 20 ρ ξ η σ ξ η σ ξ σ η where ρ ξ η is the population correlation coefficient between the ξ and η vectors and σ denotes the standard deviation the correlation coefficient has a value between 1 and 1 with a positive value indicating that ξ and η tend to increase and decrease together and a negative value indicating that ξ and η tend to move in opposite directions helton et al 2006 here the correlation coefficient expressed the degree of dependence of roughness values on corresponding mpes under different uncertainty conditions table 7 shows the obtained values of this parameter for scatterplots such as those in fig 17 when considering the different reference points as it can be seen in the colorado and main rivers the roughness of the middle regions had the most significant effect on the accuracy of discharge estimation however in the nazli chay river the roughness of the side walls had the highest impact on discharge prediction 4 conclusion in this paper a novel approach was introduced to enhance the method proposed by ahmadi et al 2017 in that method the stage discharge curve was estimated using discharge information from a referenced level which effectively reduced the time and cost of hydrometery in the present study by refining the basic assumptions of the previous model a new approach was introduced for estimating the stage velocity curve and then setting up the rating curve additionally with utilization of the spea2 algorithm the multi objective optimization approach was used to determine the proposed relationship this was a substantial improvement compared to the previous model where a method similar to the weighted sum approach was employed to this end several steps were taken in order to find the most appropriate relationship for validation the results obtained from the proposed method were compared with 6 artificial datasets and 6 natural observational datasets the results showed a close agreement between the observed and estimated data in addition the efficiencies of the proposed model and the previous model were compared for all selected cross sections using the mann whitney u test the results indicated that the new method had greater efficiency than the previous one in the final step for the proposed relationship roughness sensitivity was analyzed for the colorado main and nazli chay rivers it must be noted that the proposed relationship is universal applicable to all kinds of open channels and needless of any calibrations additionally this method can be utilized in hydrometry stations where bed slope information is not available furthermore another point worth noting is that the whole flow in the cross section is considered to be unified in the calculation of flow rate resulting in significant applicability for cross sections with complex geometry 
6998,understanding the velocity distribution of shallow water flow along hill slope is of great significance in soil erosion studies this study proposes a method to estimate the steady flow velocity and the distance when water flow reaches stability using hill slope flow velocity distribution data along a simulated rill measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method laboratory experiments were performed using a flume of 12 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 3 m height under five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 and four flow discharges 2 4 8 and 16 l min 1 the electrolyte tracer pulse method was employed to measure the flow velocities at locations of 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 and 12 m from the inlet of the flowing water the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method served as a control the results showed that the flow velocities measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method initially accelerated and then reached a steady value an equation for estimating flow velocity on the basis of the measurement distance was established the flow velocities calculated by the equation agreed well with those measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method the determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse were greater than 0 800 except for a few cases in addition the equation established in this study was shown to successfully predict flow velocities measured in other studies the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability under different slope gradients and flow discharges were determined by this equation when the differences between the measured flow velocity and the steady flow velocity were very small that is 5 and 10 the steady distances ranged from 2 239 m to 4 772 m and from 2 843 m to 6 059 m respectively by comparing the steady flow velocities with the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method the results indicated that the steady flow velocities were 0 702 0 735 times that of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at various slope gradients and flow discharges a linear function existed between the two and the regressed parameter k i e 0 718 could be used as the correction factor between the two in general the equation established in this study can facilitate the prediction of the steady flow velocity keywords shallow water flow flow velocity overland flow electrolyte method pulse model steady flow velocity 1 introduction the velocity of shallow water flow on hill slope is an important hydraulic parameter for soil erosion and overland flow studies zhang et al 2009 guo et al 2013 qian et al 2016 zhang and wang 2017 the flow velocity is not only the driving force of soil water erosion lei et al 2005 but also the basis for establishing the process based soil erosion models since it is directly related to sediment transport soil detachment and deposition zhang et al 2008 rahma et al 2013 yang et al 2018 accurate measurement of hill slope shallow water flow velocity remains an important issue to be solved because the depth of shallow water flow is very shallow usually in mm or cm and influenced by the slope gradient flow discharge topography and surface conditions zhang et al 2003 lei et al 2010 dong et al 2014 huang et al 2018 the traditional velocity meter suitable for channel flow measurement is too large to be used for shallow overland flow moreover several other meters used in flow velocity measurements for soil erosion studies are based on optics and automated measurement technologies including acoustic doppler velocimeters hot film anemometers and particle imaging velocimeters rice et al 1988 lu et al 1998 raffel et al 1998 gimenez et al 2004 hyun et al 2003 robinson and cook 1998 sidorchuk et al 2008 however most of the meters have certain limitations particularly in sophisticated field conditions at present the measurement of shallow water flow velocity on hill slope often includes the tracer method luk and merz 1992 li et al 1996 nearing et al 1999 zhang et al 2003 2010 commonly used tracers include different materials such as dyes of various colours abrahams et al 1986 zhang et al 2010 electrolytes lei et al 2005 lei et al 2010 planchon et al 2005 heat pulses angermann et al 2012 radioactive isotopes gardner and dunn 1964 natural water isotopes berman et al 2009 floating objects tauro et al 2010 2012 and magnetic materials ventura et al 2001 the flow velocity is determined by measuring the time interval for the tracers to travel a given distance however the flow velocities measured by the tracer method must be corrected or recalibrated to obtain the average flow velocity using the dye tracer method as an example the flow velocity measured by this method is regarded as the surface velocity of the flow due to dye diffusion luk and merz 1992 planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 to make the correction a correction factor is then used to convert surface velocity to average flow velocity the commonly used correction factor α is the ratio of mean flow velocity to surface velocity many scholars have obtained different correction factors in their respective experiments researchers found that the correction factor α was not a constant luk and merz 1992 emmett 1970 zhang et al 2010 the factor was affected by different factors such as bed roughness slope gradient flow discharge and flow velocity phelps 1975 king and norton 1992 therefore the tracer method has certain limitations in determining the average flow velocity lei et al 2005 described an electrolyte tracer pulse method to determine shallow water flow velocity this method is based on the mathematical solution of solute transportation in steady water flow under a pulse boundary condition the method accurately determines shallow water flow velocity by detecting the transport process of electrolyte in the flow as it passes a sensor at a known distance from the input signal and using the analytical solution to analyse the partial differential equation of solute transportation in shallow water flow this method can directly measure the shallow water flow velocity without correcting or calibrating the empirical parameters and shows high stability and accuracy at present this method has been widely used on gravel layer slope lei et al 2013 rill slope dong et al 2014 zhuang et al 2018 and frozen and thawed slopes ban et al 2016 2017a 2017b and the measurements have achieved desired results therefore the electrolyte tracer pulse method is a satisfactory method for measuring shallow water flow velocity on hill slope early studies mainly focused on the average flow velocity models on hill slope these studies indicated that flow discharge and slope gradient were better predictors of average flow velocity govers 1992 abrahams et al 1996 nearing et al 1997 1999 foster et al 1984 she et al 2014 however very few studies have been designed to investigate the relationship between shallow water flow velocity on hill slope and measurement distance in the process of water running down slope flow velocity gradually increases because potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy the hydraulic features of water flow are directly related to the processes of soil detachment sediment transport and deposition the flow velocity determines how many soil particles are separated and transported and how much sediment is delivered and deposited down the hillside and through the stream system in the process of water running down slope water flow will experience a period of acceleration in previous studies this acceleration process was ignored in the measurement of shallow water flow velocity on hill slope or the length of the reserved accelerating section was so short that the flow velocity could not reach the stable value during measurement this situation resulted in a lower accuracy in the measured velocity therefore additional work is necessary to determine the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reaches stability it is a better guidance and reference for further research and application of the electrolyte tracer pulse method and the dye tracer method to measure the velocity of shallow water flow on hill slope when the electrolyte tracer pulse method and the dye tracer method are used to measure the velocity of shallow water flow the instrument should be placed after the steady distance the objectives of this study were to measure the velocities of shallow water flow on hill slope by the electrolyte tracer pulse method to determine the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability and to develop a flow velocity equation based on the measurement distance 2 materials and methods 2 1 solute transport model a solute such as a salt solution is transported in water flow through convection and dispersion mechanisms the transportation process is affected by many factors such as flow velocity sediment concentration flow discharge and water quality to effectively quantify the transportation process the following assumptions were made a the flow is a one dimensional 1d and steady flow and it is not influenced by infiltration or raindrops b the time for injection of solute is short and can be treated as an electrolyte pulse input the transportation of a solute in a steady state water flow is well quantified and defined by a partial differential equation pde according to the fick s law mass conservation law and assumptions outlined above the convectional and dispersion processes of salt chemical in a steady and uniform water flow can be given by partial differential equation for the one d solute transport as 1 c t u c x x d h c x where c is the electrolyte concentration kg m 3 a function of distance x and time t proportional to the electrical conductivity u is the flow velocity m s 1 x is the coordinate along the slope m dh is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 and t is the time s when the upper boundary condition is assumed to be a pulse the lower boundary condition and initial condition for eq 1 are given as 2 c x t c 0 δ t x 0 0 x 0 t 0 the solution to eq 1 is a time dependent function and is given by lei et al 2005 as 3 c x t c 0 x 2 t π d h t exp x u t 2 4 d h t eq 3 is used to fit the experimentally obtained data of the solute transport process based on the least square method lei et al 2005 to determine the parameters in eq 3 including the initial concentration c0 flow velocity u and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dh 2 2 the measurement system the experimental equipment system included a water supply system a flow velocity measurement system a bucket a buffering pit and an experimental flume with adjustable slope gradients from 0 to 35 fig 1 the water supply system consisted of a water pump and a water supply pipe which was used to supply steady water flow into the buffering pit to ensure the water flow evenly distributed within the flume cross section the experimental flume was 12 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 3 m height to maintain the water level and to drain the water flow a shutter was located at the lower end of the flume the flow velocity measurement system included a data logger sensors a solute injector and a computer specially designed software was used to control the measurement process compute flow velocity and manage the data a data logger was used as an interface unit to interpret computer information to control the solution injection unit the digitalization of the measured continuous signals from the sensors data logging locally and data transfer to the computer the sensors were ion sensitive electrodes that detect the electric conductivity of the water flow the solute injector was a mariotte bottle controlled by a solenoid valve with a capability of 250 ml which was used to inject the electrolyte solution instantaneously into the water flow as a velocity measurement tracer the injection of electrolyte solute into the water flow was synchronized with the beginning of the data acquisition and the duration of electrolyte solute injection could be determined by the operator the solute injector was set at the water inlet of the upper end of the flume the eight electrolyte sensors were located at 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 6 m 8 m 10 m and 12 m from the solute injector to measure flow velocities at each of these positions the method of gluing soil particles and sands on the sand papers to study shallow water flow velocity on hill slope has been applied in previous studies dong et al 2014 dunkerley 2001 lei et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 this study also used this method to simulate the roughness of the underlying surface on hill slope sand papers with a mean particle diameter of 0 425 mm were stuck onto the bottom of the flume then soil particles were glued onto the sand papers after compaction with heavy weights for 24 h the soil particles that were not glued onto the sand papers were cleaned up soil samples were taken from the ansai research station of soil and water conservation 109 19 e 36 51 n located in the centre of the loess plateau china to remove grass roots and stones the experimental soil samples were air dried and passed through a 10 mm sieve the soil was characterized as loess soil the particle fractions of the soil samples are listed in table 1 2 3 the experimental design the experimental treatments involved a combination of four flow discharges 2 4 8 and 16 l min 1 and five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 with three replicates to simulate the process of rill erosion on hill slope from gentle slope gradients to steeper slope gradients flow discharge was controlled by a set of valves installed on a flow diversion bin and measured by a calibrated flow meter a total of 60 experiments were conducted 2 4 the experimental procedures water flow from a cylindrical tank was introduced into the flume at a given flow discharge from the upper end of the flume the highly concentrated kcl solution of approximately 6 ml prepared before use was injected into the water flow for a period of less than 600 ms a funnel was placed beneath the salt injection outlet in order to empty the solute into the water flow immediately after the injection when a set of experiments started the data logger started to record the solute transport processes by detecting the signals of the sensors at a rate of 50 points per second the values of electrical conductivity measured at eight locations were logged into the computer through the data logger which was controlled by the specially developed software another funnel was placed adjacent to the solute injector to inject dyes into the water flow for the manual measurement of the average flow velocity for comparison purpose by the dye tracer method for

experimental data dotted curves under different experimental conditions the curves under various flow discharges and slope gradients were fitted with the analytical solution function smooth curves as given by eq 3 s1 symbolizes the first sensor located nearest to the injector and s8 symbolizes the last sensor at the end of the flume s1 to s8 are normalized electrolyte concentration data sets measured by the experiment which are measured at locations of 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 and 12 m from the inlet of the flowing water as shown in fig 2 the analytical solution satisfactorily followed the peak and decreases and increases of the experimentally obtained curves indicating that the pulse model achieved good measurements of the solute transport process at eight positions table 2 shows the coefficients of determination under different distances flow discharges and slope gradients the coefficients of determination were almost all well above 0 850 no significant differences were found in the r2 values at the same measurement position under different slope gradients and flow discharges indicating that the predicted values showed good agreement with the measured values the r2 values at longer distance locations from the solute injection point were higher than those at nearer locations indicating that the predictive efficiency of the pulse model increased with the distance from the solute injector lei et al 2010 shi et al 2012 dong et al 2014 3 2 the velocities of shallow water flow on hill slope at different locations comparing the flow velocities measured by the sensors s1 to s7 with those measured by the sensor s8 12 m the relative errors in measured flow velocities at different locations were estimated table 3 as shown in table 3 the relative errors varied from 39 278 to 67 009 at the location 1 m from the water inlet the errors were reduced to less than 10 005 at 10 m a longer measurement distance is required to make the relative errors less than 15 when the slope gradient and flow discharge are higher when the measurement distance increased to 6 m the relative errors were substantially less than 12 under various flow discharges and slope gradients when the measurement distance was greater than 6 m almost all of the relative errors were less than 10 this result demonstrates that the variation of flow velocity becomes less significant with increasing measurement distances the flow velocities obtained at different measurement positions under different flow discharges and slope gradients were further fitted by the exponential function the fitted curves and the measured flow velocities are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the fitting curves were very close to the measured velocities the increments of flow velocity decreased with increasing measurement distances the fitting curves approached a steady value when the distance was sufficiently long this result demonstrates that the water flow will eventually become steady with increasing measurement distances 3 3 an equation for estimating flow velocity on the basis of measurement distance fig 4 presents the velocities of shallow water flow on hill slope measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method under different slope gradients and flow discharges at different locations as shown in fig 4 the measured flow velocities increased with increasing the distances from the solute injector but the trend became weaker and then became steady after reaching a certain distance to calculate the distance when water flow reached stability and the corresponding steady flow velocity the regression analysis was performed to study the relationship between flow velocity and measurement distance an equation for estimating flow velocity on the basis of measurement distance was established 7 u a 1 e β x where u is the velocity of shallow water flow on hill slope measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method m s 1 a is the regression coefficient that represents the steady flow velocity m s 1 x is the measurement distance m and β is the decay coefficient that represents the increasing speed of flow velocity with measurement distance 1 m 1 when the β values were greater than 0 the increase rate of the flow velocity measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method decreased with increasing measurement distances table 4 presents the steady flow velocities a and the decay coefficients β calculated with eq 7 under different slope gradients and flow discharges as shown in table 4 the steady flow velocities increased with increasing slope gradients and flow discharges all β values were greater than 0 for different flow discharges and slope gradients indicating that the increase rate of flow velocity decreased as the measurement distances increased under a given slope gradient β decreased with increasing flow discharges indicating that the increase rate of flow velocity decreased with increasing measurement distances when the flow discharges increased from 2 l min 1 to 16 l min 1 this result means that a sufficiently long slope is necessary to approach the steady flow velocity at higher flow discharges under a given flow discharge β decreased with increasing slope gradients but the trend became weaker to determine the distance when water flow reaches stability we recommend the following procedures when at a certain slope length the measured flow velocity becomes very close to the steady flow velocity i e the difference between these two is very small such as at 5 and 10 this slope length is approximated as the distance when water flow reaches stability the corresponding flow velocity can be considered as the steady flow velocity therefore we have the criteria as 8 a lim u lim x u 5 0 05 a lim u lim x u 10 0 1 thus we have the following formula to determine the steady distance based on eqs 7 and 8 9 d 0 05 3 0445 β d 0 1 2 3979 β where d0 05 is the steady distance for an error of 5 m and d0 1 is the steady distance for an error of 10 m the distances when water flow reached stability were estimated with eq 9 and listed in table 4 as shown in table 4 the steady flow velocities increased with increasing flow discharges and slope gradients however the steady flow velocity was more sensitive to flow discharge than to slope gradient for example the steady flow velocities did not significantly increase with slope gradients under low flow discharges of 2 l min 1 or 4 l min 1 when the error range between the measured flow velocity and the steady flow velocity was less than 10 the steady distances varied from 2 239 m to 4 772 m when the error range between the measured flow velocity and the steady flow velocity was less than 5 the steady distances varied from 2 843 m to 6 059 m this result means that the steady distance 5 933 m at the high flow discharge of 16 l min 1 and steep slope gradient of 25 was more than twice the steady distance 2 843 m at the low flow discharge of 2 l min 1 and gentle slope gradient of 5 if the error range between the measured flow velocity and the steady flow velocity is less than 10 a distance of at least 4 5 m is required to approach the steady flow velocity the results indicated that when the electrolyte tracer pulse method is used to measure the steady flow velocity the instrument should be placed after the steady distance the steady distance for an error of 5 is approximately 1 m longer than that for an error of 10 so a longer distance for steady velocity measurement is recommended for a high measurement precision in the process of water running down slope water flow will experience a period of acceleration when the distances between the location of each sensor and the upper end of the flume are less than the steady distance it is impossible to accurately obtain the steady flow velocity when measuring flow velocity after the steady distance regardless of the errors of the measurement method only a few sensors are required to obtain the steady flow velocity the steady flow velocity a calculated by eq 7 provides a reference for us to measure steady flow velocity and provides a method for estimating steady flow velocity 3 4 method validation to clearly evaluate the performance of eq 7 in predicting flow velocity the assessment indices including re nse and mre were used table 5 presents the results of the assessment when eq 7 is used to predict flow velocity as shown in table 5 except for a few cases the nse was greater than 0 800 with an average of 0 924 the re and mre were also small although the re was various at the low flow discharge of 2 l min 1 under slope gradients of 5 and 15 but overall the data points were close to the 1 1 line fig 5 indicating that the predicted flow velocities showed good agreement with the measured values consequently eq 7 could be used to express the process of variation of flow velocity with the measurement distance to further evaluate the suitability of the equation established in this study the experimental data sets from previous studies lei 2005 2013 were used table 6 the experimental design has been described by lei 2005 2013 the assessment indices including re nse and mre were used to evaluate the performance of eq 7 in predicting flow velocity table 7 as shown in table 7 the re and mre were relatively high and the estimation errors of flow velocity calculated by eq 7 were large under a slope gradient of 12 lei 2005 the nse was greater than 0 850 and the re and mre were also small in all the other cases therefore eq 7 was shown to successfully predict flow velocities measured in other studies lei 2005 2013 indicating that the eq 7 established in this study can facilitate the prediction of flow velocity 3 5 the relationships between the steady flow velocities and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method in this study the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method were used as a comparison of the steady flow velocities calculated by eq 7 the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method are regarded as the surface velocities of the flow which are usually larger than the actual average flow velocity a correction factor is then applied to convert surface velocity to mean flow velocity however there are no universally applicable and acceptable correction factors thus the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method were directly used as a comparison in this study the comparison between the steady flow velocities calculated by eq 7 and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method under different slope gradients and flow discharges are presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method were much greater than the steady flow velocities calculated by eq 7 due to the dispersion of the dye in the water flow the steady flow velocities under different slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted with a linear model to the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method 10 v s k v d where vs are the steady flow velocities m s 1 vd are the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method m s 1 and k is the regressed parameter the k r2 and nse are listed in table 8 as shown in table 8 the steady flow velocities were 70 2 73 5 times of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at various slope gradients and flow discharges a linear function existed between the two r2 0 990 nse 0 880 the relationship between the steady flow velocities and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at all combinations of slope gradient and flow discharge can be fitted with a linear equation the resulting equation was 11 v s 0 718 v d r 2 0 999 n s e 0 982 eq 11 shows that the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method showed good agreement with the steady flow velocities the regressed parameter k i e 0 718 could be used as the correction factor between the two this correction factor corresponded to the range of the correction factor between the average flow velocity and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method proposed by horton et al 1934 indicating that eq 7 could be used to predict steady flow velocities well 4 conclusions in this study the relationship of flow velocity with measurement distance was investigated the results of this study showed that flow velocities increased with the distance from the water inlet but became steady after a relatively long distance from the water inlet the equation established in this study could well describe the variation in flow velocity in the process of water running down slope furthermore using this equation to simulate the measured flow velocities of other studies it was found that the equation was of higher adaptability and accuracy the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability under various experimental conditions were determined by this equation the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method was compared with the steady flow velocities to validate the rationality of the equation in general the equation established in this study can facilitate the prediction of hill slope shallow water flow velocity and determine the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reaches stability this work provides useful information for measuring the velocity of shallow water flow on hill slope and for the position selection of velocity measurement of water flow however the equation should be used judiciously the potential effects of factors such as plant cover and obstacles on shallow water flow velocity should be considered in hydrological and soil erosion equations consequently more studies are necessary to further increase the simulation accuracy of the equation and to further improve

6998,understanding the velocity distribution of shallow water flow along hill slope is of great significance in soil erosion studies this study proposes a method to estimate the steady flow velocity and the distance when water flow reaches stability using hill slope flow velocity distribution data along a simulated rill measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method laboratory experiments were performed using a flume of 12 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 3 m height under five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 and four flow discharges 2 4 8 and 16 l min 1 the electrolyte tracer pulse method was employed to measure the flow velocities at locations of 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 and 12 m from the inlet of the flowing water the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method served as a control the results showed that the flow velocities measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method initially accelerated and then reached a steady value an equation for estimating flow velocity on the basis of the measurement distance was established the flow velocities calculated by the equation agreed well with those measured by the electrolyte tracer pulse method the determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse were greater than 0 800 except for a few cases in addition the equation established in this study was shown to successfully predict flow velocities measured in other studies the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability under different slope gradients and flow discharges were determined by this equation when the differences between the measured flow velocity and the steady flow velocity were very small that is 5 and 10 the steady distances ranged from 2 239 m to 4 772 m and from 2 843 m to 6 059 m respectively by comparing the steady flow velocities with the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method the results indicated that the steady flow velocities were 0 702 0 735 times that of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at various slope gradients and flow discharges a linear function existed between the two and the regressed parameter k i e 0 718 could be used as the correction factor between the two in general the equation established in this study can facilitate the prediction of the steady flow velocity keywords shallow water flow flow velocity overland flow electrolyte method pulse model steady flow velocity 1 introduction the velocity of shallow water flow on hill slope is an important hydraulic parameter for soil erosion and overland flow studies zhang et al 2009 guo et al 2013 qian et al 2016 zhang and wang 2017 the flow velocity is not only the driving force of soil water erosion lei et al 2005 but also the basis for establishing the process based soil erosion models since it is directly related to sediment transport soil detachment and deposition zhang et al 2008 rahma et al 2013 yang et al 2018 accurate measurement of hill slope shallow water flow velocity remains an important issue to be solved because the depth of shallow water flow is very shallow usually in mm or cm and influenced by the slope gradient flow discharge topography and surface conditions zhang et al 2003 lei et al 2010 dong et al 2014 huang et al 2018 the traditional velocity meter suitable for channel flow measurement is too large to be used for shallow overland flow moreover several other meters used in flow velocity measurements for soil erosion studies are based on optics and automated measurement technologies including acoustic doppler velocimeters hot film anemometers and particle imaging velocimeters rice et al 1988 lu et al 1998 raffel et al 1998 gimenez et al 2004 hyun et al 2003 robinson and cook 1998 sidorchuk et al 2008 however most of the meters have certain limitations particularly in sophisticated field conditions at present the measurement of shallow water flow velocity on hill slope often includes the tracer method luk and merz 1992 li et al 1996 nearing et al 1999 zhang et al 2003 2010 commonly used tracers include different materials such as dyes of various colours abrahams et al 1986 zhang et al 2010 electrolytes lei et al 2005 lei et al 2010 planchon et al 2005 heat pulses angermann et al 2012 radioactive isotopes gardner and dunn 1964 natural water isotopes berman et al 2009 floating objects tauro et al 2010 2012 and magnetic materials ventura et al 2001 the flow velocity is determined by measuring the time interval for the tracers to travel a given distance however the flow velocities measured by the tracer method must be corrected or recalibrated to obtain the average flow velocity using the dye tracer method as an example the flow velocity measured by this method is regarded as the surface velocity of the flow due to dye diffusion luk and merz 1992 planchon et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 to make the correction a correction factor is then used to convert surface velocity to average flow velocity the commonly used correction factor α is the ratio of mean flow velocity to surface velocity many scholars have obtained different correction factors in their respective experiments researchers found that the correction factor α was not a constant luk and merz 1992 emmett 1970 zhang et al 2010 the factor was affected by different factors such as bed roughness slope gradient flow discharge and flow velocity phelps 1975 king and norton 1992 therefore the tracer method has certain limitations in determining the average flow velocity lei et al 2005 described an electrolyte tracer pulse method to determine shallow water flow velocity this method is based on the mathematical solution of solute transportation in steady water flow under a pulse boundary condition the method accurately determines shallow water flow velocity by detecting the transport process of electrolyte in the flow as it passes a sensor at a known distance from the input signal and using the analytical solution to analyse the partial differential equation of solute transportation in shallow water flow this method can directly measure the shallow water flow velocity without correcting or calibrating the empirical parameters and shows high stability and accuracy at present this method has been widely used on gravel layer slope lei et al 2013 rill slope dong et al 2014 zhuang et al 2018 and frozen and thawed slopes ban et al 2016 2017a 2017b and the measurements have achieved desired results therefore the electrolyte tracer pulse method is a satisfactory method for measuring shallow water flow velocity on hill slope early studies mainly focused on the average flow velocity models on hill slope these studies indicated that flow discharge and slope gradient were better predictors of average flow velocity govers 1992 abrahams et al 1996 nearing et al 1997 1999 foster et al 1984 she et al 2014 however very few studies have been designed to investigate the relationship between shallow water flow velocity on hill slope and measurement distance in the process of water running down slope flow velocity gradually increases because potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy the hydraulic features of water flow are directly related to the processes of soil detachment sediment transport and deposition the flow velocity determines how many soil particles are separated and transported and how much sediment is delivered and deposited down the hillside and through the stream system in the process of water running down slope water flow will experience a period of acceleration in previous studies this acceleration process was ignored in the measurement of shallow water flow velocity on hill slope or the length of the reserved accelerating section was so short that the flow velocity could not reach the stable value during measurement this situation resulted in a lower accuracy in the measured velocity therefore additional work is necessary to determine the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reaches stability it is a better guidance and reference for further research and application of the electrolyte tracer pulse method and the dye tracer method to measure the velocity of shallow water flow on hill slope when the electrolyte tracer pulse method and the dye tracer method are used to measure the velocity of shallow water flow the instrument should be placed after the steady distance the objectives of this study were to measure the velocities of shallow water flow on hill slope by the electrolyte tracer pulse method to determine the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability and to develop a flow velocity equation based on the measurement distance 2 materials and methods 2 1 solute transport model a solute such as a salt solution is transported in water flow through convection and dispersion mechanisms the transportation process is affected by many factors such as flow velocity sediment concentration flow discharge and water quality to effectively quantify the transportation process the following assumptions were made a the flow is a one dimensional 1d and steady flow and it is not influenced by infiltration or raindrops b the time for injection of solute is short and can be treated as an electrolyte pulse input the transportation of a solute in a steady state water flow is well quantified and defined by a partial differential equation pde according to the fick s law mass conservation law and assumptions outlined above the convectional and dispersion processes of salt chemical in a steady and uniform water flow can be given by partial differential equation for the one d solute transport as 1 c t u c x x d h c x where c is the electrolyte concentration kg m 3 a function of distance x and time t proportional to the electrical conductivity u is the flow velocity m s 1 x is the coordinate along the slope m dh is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 and t is the time s when the upper boundary condition is assumed to be a pulse the lower boundary condition and initial condition for eq 1 are given as 2 c x t c 0 δ t x 0 0 x 0 t 0 the solution to eq 1 is a time dependent function and is given by lei et al 2005 as 3 c x t c 0 x 2 t π d h t exp x u t 2 4 d h t eq 3 is used to fit the experimentally obtained data of the solute transport process based on the least square method lei et al 2005 to determine the parameters in eq 3 including the initial concentration c0 flow velocity u and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dh 2 2 the measurement system the experimental equipment system included a water supply system a flow velocity measurement system a bucket a buffering pit and an experimental flume with adjustable slope gradients from 0 to 35 fig 1 the water supply system consisted of a water pump and a water supply pipe which was used to supply steady water flow into the buffering pit to ensure the water flow evenly distributed within the flume cross section the experimental flume was 12 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 3 m height to maintain the water level and to drain the water flow a shutter was located at the lower end of the flume the flow velocity measurement system included a data logger sensors a solute injector and a computer specially designed software was used to control the measurement process compute flow velocity and manage the data a data logger was used as an interface unit to interpret computer information to control the solution injection unit the digitalization of the measured continuous signals from the sensors data logging locally and data transfer to the computer the sensors were ion sensitive electrodes that detect the electric conductivity of the water flow the solute injector was a mariotte bottle controlled by a solenoid valve with a capability of 250 ml which was used to inject the electrolyte solution instantaneously into the water flow as a velocity measurement tracer the injection of electrolyte solute into the water flow was synchronized with the beginning of the data acquisition and the duration of electrolyte solute injection could be determined by the operator the solute injector was set at the water inlet of the upper end of the flume the eight electrolyte sensors were located at 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 6 m 8 m 10 m and 12 m from the solute injector to measure flow velocities at each of these positions the method of gluing soil particles and sands on the sand papers to study shallow water flow velocity on hill slope has been applied in previous studies dong et al 2014 dunkerley 2001 lei et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 this study also used this method to simulate the roughness of the underlying surface on hill slope sand papers with a mean particle diameter of 0 425 mm were stuck onto the bottom of the flume then soil particles were glued onto the sand papers after compaction with heavy weights for 24 h the soil particles that were not glued onto the sand papers were cleaned up soil samples were taken from the ansai research station of soil and water conservation 109 19 e 36 51 n located in the centre of the loess plateau china to remove grass roots and stones the experimental soil samples were air dried and passed through a 10 mm sieve the soil was characterized as loess soil the particle fractions of the soil samples are listed in table 1 2 3 the experimental design the experimental treatments involved a combination of four flow discharges 2 4 8 and 16 l min 1 and five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 with three replicates to simulate the process of rill erosion on hill slope from gentle slope gradients to steeper slope gradients flow discharge was controlled by a set of valves installed on a flow diversion bin and measured by a calibrated flow meter a total of 60 experiments were conducted 2 4 the experimental procedures water flow from a cylindrical tank was introduced into the flume at a given flow discharge from the upper end of the flume the highly concentrated kcl solution of approximately 6 ml prepared before use was injected into the water flow for a period of less than 600 ms a funnel was placed beneath the salt injection outlet in order to empty the solute into the water flow immediately after the injection when a set of experiments started the data logger started to record the solute transport processes by detecting the signals of the sensors at a rate of 50 points per second the values of electrical conductivity measured at eight locations were logged into the computer through the data logger which was controlled by the specially developed software another funnel was placed adjacent to the solute injector to inject dyes into the water flow for the manual measurement of the average flow velocity for comparison purpose by the dye tracer method for each combination of slope gradient and flow discharge the dye was injected at the water inlet of the upper end of the flume the time interval for the tracer to move from the water inlet to the end of the flume was recorded using a stop watch 2 5 statistical analysis the following three statistical parameters were used to evaluate the simulated results of the model 4 re o i p i o i 100 where re is

experience a period of acceleration when the distances between the location of each sensor and the upper end of the flume are less than the steady distance it is impossible to accurately obtain the steady flow velocity when measuring flow velocity after the steady distance regardless of the errors of the measurement method only a few sensors are required to obtain the steady flow velocity the steady flow velocity a calculated by eq 7 provides a reference for us to measure steady flow velocity and provides a method for estimating steady flow velocity 3 4 method validation to clearly evaluate the performance of eq 7 in predicting flow velocity the assessment indices including re nse and mre were used table 5 presents the results of the assessment when eq 7 is used to predict flow velocity as shown in table 5 except for a few cases the nse was greater than 0 800 with an average of 0 924 the re and mre were also small although the re was various at the low flow discharge of 2 l min 1 under slope gradients of 5 and 15 but overall the data points were close to the 1 1 line fig 5 indicating that the predicted flow velocities showed good agreement with the measured values consequently eq 7 could be used to express the process of variation of flow velocity with the measurement distance to further evaluate the suitability of the equation established in this study the experimental data sets from previous studies lei 2005 2013 were used table 6 the experimental design has been described by lei 2005 2013 the assessment indices including re nse and mre were used to evaluate the performance of eq 7 in predicting flow velocity table 7 as shown in table 7 the re and mre were relatively high and the estimation errors of flow velocity calculated by eq 7 were large under a slope gradient of 12 lei 2005 the nse was greater than 0 850 and the re and mre were also small in all the other cases therefore eq 7 was shown to successfully predict flow velocities measured in other studies lei 2005 2013 indicating that the eq 7 established in this study can facilitate the prediction of flow velocity 3 5 the relationships between the steady flow velocities and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method in this study the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method were used as a comparison of the steady flow velocities calculated by eq 7 the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method are regarded as the surface velocities of the flow which are usually larger than the actual average flow velocity a correction factor is then applied to convert surface velocity to mean flow velocity however there are no universally applicable and acceptable correction factors thus the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method were directly used as a comparison in this study the comparison between the steady flow velocities calculated by eq 7 and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method under different slope gradients and flow discharges are presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method were much greater than the steady flow velocities calculated by eq 7 due to the dispersion of the dye in the water flow the steady flow velocities under different slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted with a linear model to the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method 10 v s k v d where vs are the steady flow velocities m s 1 vd are the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method m s 1 and k is the regressed parameter the k r2 and nse are listed in table 8 as shown in table 8 the steady flow velocities were 70 2 73 5 times of the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at various slope gradients and flow discharges a linear function existed between the two r2 0 990 nse 0 880 the relationship between the steady flow velocities and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method at all combinations of slope gradient and flow discharge can be fitted with a linear equation the resulting equation was 11 v s 0 718 v d r 2 0 999 n s e 0 982 eq 11 shows that the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method showed good agreement with the steady flow velocities the regressed parameter k i e 0 718 could be used as the correction factor between the two this correction factor corresponded to the range of the correction factor between the average flow velocity and the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method proposed by horton et al 1934 indicating that eq 7 could be used to predict steady flow velocities well 4 conclusions in this study the relationship of flow velocity with measurement distance was investigated the results of this study showed that flow velocities increased with the distance from the water inlet but became steady after a relatively long distance from the water inlet the equation established in this study could well describe the variation in flow velocity in the process of water running down slope furthermore using this equation to simulate the measured flow velocities of other studies it was found that the equation was of higher adaptability and accuracy the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reached stability under various experimental conditions were determined by this equation the flow velocities measured by the dye tracer method was compared with the steady flow velocities to validate the rationality of the equation in general the equation established in this study can facilitate the prediction of hill slope shallow water flow velocity and determine the steady flow velocities and the distances when water flow reaches stability this work provides useful information for measuring the velocity of shallow water flow on hill slope and for the position selection of velocity measurement of water flow however the equation should be used judiciously the potential effects of factors such as plant cover and obstacles on shallow water flow velocity should be considered in hydrological and soil erosion equations consequently more studies are necessary to further increase the simulation accuracy of the equation and to further improve

6999,predicting the evolution of concentration distribution of environmental transport in wetland flows has a broad range of applications in ecological engineering practice by extending a previous study the spatial concentration distribution of solute transport due to an instantaneous environmental emission in a wetland channel with rectangular cross section is presented in this work by means of chatwin s long time asymptotic technique to account for the effect of high order moment skewness of the transverse mean concentration distribution is analyzed two important parameters i e aspect ratio depth to width and damping factor on the dispersion process are discussed four studied cases illustrated that the transverse concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time and the aspect ratio can affect the transverse concentration distribution greatly the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is asymmetrical in the initial stage and shows an asymptotic gaussian distribution at large time the dispersion process in a thick width equals depth wetland channel is quicker than that in a thin wetland channel the spatial concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral sidewall effect on a large time scale for environmental transport in a thin wetland channel keywords spatial concentration distribution environmental dispersivity environmental transport wetland flow taylor dispersion 1 introduction wetlands have received increasing attention due to their essential ecosystem services such as pollutants filtration flood prevention biodiversity maintenance and groundwater recharge etc costanza et al 1989 1997 mitsch and gosselink 2015 with the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization large amount of industrial and domestic sewage is discharged into the wetland ouyang and guo 2018 zhang et al 2009 oberholster et al 2008 zann 2000 excess emission of pollutants pose a threat to the ecological carrying capacity of the wetland houser and richardson 2010 for ecological risk assessment and wastewater treatment engineering associated with the wetlands concentration distribution of the contaminant transport process is essential for predicting the influenced region where pollutant concentration is beyond some given standard levels fischer et al 1979 zeng et al 2011 zeng and chen 2009 to describe the solute transport process in wetland flows taylor dispersion taylor 1953 1954a is a fundamental concept which refers to a stage of transport process when the cross sectional mean concentration forms a gaussian distribution after the initial injection of the solute since taylor s pioneering research extended efforts have been made to study the solute dispersion in environmental flows open channels rivers and estuaries i

effect in one main dimension of the cross section of the wetland much endeavors have been made to investigate the longitudinal dispersion coefficients for example lightbody and nepf 2006a b studied the dispersion process arising from stem scale and depth scale velocity heterogeneity in an emergent canopy murphy et al 2007 investigated the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the depth dimension in a two zoned model with submerged plants huai et al 2017 estimated the longitudinal dispersion coefficient under the lateral distribution of depth averaged longitudinal velocity in a symmetric compound channel with emergent vegetation moreover numerical simulation and laboratory measurement have been conducted to estimate the dispersion process in a vegetated channel or with porous media katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2018 yan et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2017 ghisalberti and nepf 2005 for mathematical modelling zeng and chen 2009 followed a basic approach to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and solid in the wetland by the phase average method rajagopal and tao 1995 liu and masliyah 2005 based on the phase average model a great deal of analytical studies on solute transport in wetland flows have been carried out focusing on the solute transport in the free water surface effect dominated wetland flows the vertical concentration distribution and depth averaged concentration have been investigated wu et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2017b wang and huai 2018 moreover the environmental dispersion in multi layer i e two layer or three layer wetlands with free water surface effect were also analyzed chen et al 2012 luo et al 2017 wang et al 2013 2014 for environmental dispersion in the lateral sidewall effect dominated wetland flows zeng et al 2011 2014 studied the width averaged mean concentration distribution additionally the environmental dispersion in two zone wu et al 2011 chen 2013 and three zone wang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 wetlands were also investigated above analytical studies concentrated on the solute dispersion in a free water surface effect dominated or lateral sidewall effect dominated wetland flow however the impact of vertical and lateral variations of the superficial velocity distribution on the dispersion process should be both taken into account when the vertical and lateral scales of the cross section are comparable in fact for solute transport in three dimensional channel flows doshi et al 1978 first found that the longitudinal dispersivity in a rectangular conduit with vanishing aspect ratio is about eight times larger than that in the corresponding two dimensional case without side wall effect chatwin and sullivan 1982 and dutta et al 2006 studied the longitudinal diffusivity in rectangular channels with different values of the aspect ratio in addition pagitsas et al 1986 analyzed the taylor dispersion of solute in poiseuille type solvent flow occuring within a rectangular duct of small aspect ratio in terms of the environmental dispersion in wetland channel with rectangular cross section chen et al 2010 have established a basic model and studied the cross sectional superficial velocity distribution and the environmental dispersivity afterwards the velocity profile and environmental dispersivity in a tidal wetland channel of rectangular cross section were also analyzed zeng et al 2012 however previous researches associated with three dimensional wetland flows mainly studied the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and the cross sectional mean concentration distribution as to the spatial concentration distribution little endeavor has been made actually the transverse concentration distribution is far from uniform in the initial stage and even for a long time which has been verified in the two dimensional wetland flows wang and chen 2017b jiang et al 2017 for some environmental and industrial applications such as ecological risk assessment wu et al 2015 what of primary interest is the influenced region where the concentration is beyond some given standard levels apparently the influenced region is sensitive to the detailed concentration distribution and just giving the transverse mean concentration might not be sufficient moreover previous studies gave the cross sectional mean concentration distribution by neglecting the effect of high order moments the asymmetry of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in the initial time has not been concerned although the skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in rectangular microfluidic flows has been investigated aminian et al 2016 2015 there is still a need to study the skewness of the transverse mean concentration distribution in three dimensional wetland flows due to the presence of vegetation therefore by extending the previous study chen et al 2010 this paper analytically studies the complete concentration distribution for environmental transport in a steady wetland channel with rectangular cross section in consideration of the effect of high order moment by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion the specific objectives of the present work are i to illustrate the environmental dispersivity and skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution ii to present the evolution of the transverse mean concentration distribution and iii to depict the spatial concentration distribution of the environmental transport process for practical applications the impact of the aspect ratio depth to width of the cross section and effect of the vegetation in flow on the dispersion process will be characterized 2 formulation for solute transport in wetland flow by the phase average

lateral y axis vertical z axis and origin set as the lower left corner of the cross section as presented in fig 1 in the cartesian coordinate system k can be expressed as k k x x e x e x k y y e y e y

dirac delta function due to the lateral symmetry of the flow and solute transport in the wetland channel we choose the left half part of the wetland flow 0 y w as the object of study for concision and in the following sections the cross section refers to the left half part of the whole cross section with the depth h and width w i e the 1 4 of the closed rectangular cross section the aspect ratio

to solve above mass transport equation the technique of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion with respect to large time is applied which can obtain the spatial concentration distribution as well as the cross sectional mean concentration distribution to obtain the coefficients of edgeworth expansion we solve the equations of spatial concentration moments at first 3 1 concentration moments the method of concentration moment has been widely used in previous studies aris 1956 maier et al 2002 the p th concentration moment is defined as 19 m p y z t c x y z t x p d x p 0 1 2 moreover the p th cross sectional mean concentration moment is 20 m p t c x t x p d x p 0 1 2 characteristic of an exponential decay in space distribution of the concentration is subjected to the auxiliary relations aris 1956 fischer et al 1979 barton 1983 as 21 c y z t x p c y z t 0 p 1 2 3 22 c x y z t x x x p c x y z t x x 0 p 1 2 3 applying the operator x p d x to each term of eqs 13 15 and eq 17 with the aid of eqs 21 and 22 we have 23 m p t r r kz 2 m p y 2 r kz r 2 m p z 2 upm p 1 r kx p p 1 pe 2 m p 2 24 m 1 m 2 0 p 0 1 2 m p y z t z z 0 m p y z t z z 1 0 p 0 1 2 25 m p y z t y y 0 m p y z t y y 1 0 p 0 1 2 26 m 0 y z 0 1 m p y z 0 0 p 1 2 we use the integral transform technique to solve above eqs 23 26 the eigenvalue problems with respect to the variables y

eigenvalues the solutions of the eigenvalue problems are y y cos β l y and z z cos χ j z in which the eigenvalues are β l l π l 0 1 2 and χ j j π j 0 1 2 using the integral transform technique the solution of m p y z t can be represented by the expansion 29 m p y z t l 0 j 0 b p β l χ j t cos β l y cos χ j z p 0 1 2 detailed solutions of the coefficients b p β l χ j t can refer to barton 1983 s work immediately we can obtain moments of cross sectional mean concentration by mean operation to characterize the cross sectional mean concentration distribution the p th order normalized central moment of mean concentration wang and chen 2017b is introduced as 30 ν p t x x g p c d x c d x where 31 x g t x c d x c d x m 1 m 0 is the centroid position of the cross sectional mean concentration the cross sectional mean concentration central moments at higher orders are expressed as 32 ν 2 t m 2 m 0 x g 2 33 ν 3 t m 3 m 0 3 x g ν 2 x g 3 the zeroth order mean concentration moment reflects the total mass of the solute in the channel m 0 1 means the mass conservation chen et al 2010 the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the solute cloud environmental dispersivity associated with the second order mean concentration moment wang and chen 2017a is quantified as 34 d t 1 2 d ν 2 d t furthermore to characterize the spatial concentration distribution of the environmental transport process in flows the p th order central concentration moment is introduced as yasuda 1984 35 ν p t y z x x g p c d x c d x where 36 x g t y z xc d x c d x m 1 m 0 is the longitudinal centroid of the concentration at height z the central moments at higher orders are expressed as 37 ν 2 t y z m 2 m 0 x g 2 38 ν 3 t y z m 3 m 0 3 x g ν 2 x g 3 3 2 cumulants and skewness the coefficients of edgeworth expansion can be obtained through the cumulants of concentration distribution which are basic quantities of probability theory alternative to the moments cumulants can be expressed in terms of moments based on the p order central concentration moments defined in the above section the cumulants are given as 39 k 1 x g k 2 ν 2 k 3 ν 3 in addition we denote σ k 2 which is the standard deviation to capture the non gaussian concentration distribution in the initial stage the concept of skewness is introduced skewness γ 1 a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution to its mean can be defined as 40 γ 1 k 3 k 2 3 2 the skewness of gaussian distribution is zero since all its cumulants of order 3 and higher are zero therefore the quantity is often used to measure the deviation from gaussian distribution 3 3 edgeworth expansion now we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution for concentration distribution chatwin 1970 s technique is actually an edgeworth expansion the edgeworth s series give 41 c x y z t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where he n are the hermite polynomials 42 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n e x 2 2 d x n n 0 1 2 x is the standardized variable x x x g σ notice that above asymptotic solution for concentration distribution contains the first three order cumulants therefore such solution can reflect the non gaussian effects like skewness chatwin 1972 similarly we can also apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution for cross sectional mean concentration distribution directly i e 43 c x t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where x is the standardized variable of cross sectional distribution 44 x x x g σ 4 results and discussion for a pulsed solute emission into a steady wetland flow the solute is dispersed under the combined actions of cross sectional variation of superficial flow mass diffusivity and the difference between superficial mass dispersivity in the vertical and lateral directions zeng et al 2012 to illustrate the impact of different aspect ratio of the cross section and effect of vegetation in the wetland channel on the process of environmental dispersion which are essential for some environmental practice we focus on discussing the two parameters r and α through four typical cases case 1 r 0 1 α 1 case 2 r 1 α 1 case 3 r 0 1 α 10 and case 4 r 1 α 10 note that other parameters are typically chosen as r l 1 r kx 1 r kz 1 and pe 1000 respectively the ratio of depth to width of the cross section r 0 1 means that the wetland channel is shallow or thin h w while r 1 means that solute transport in a thick wetland channel h w we remark that one can choose the shorter side of the cross section as the z axis then for the case of h w such as r 10 the velocity profile and concentration distribution are the same as the case h w corresponding to r 0 1 because boundary conditions 14 15 in the y and z directions are the same and r l r kz 1 therefore we only discuss the case of r 1 the damping factor α reflects the density of vegetation in flow chen et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 α 10 means that the wetland is densely vegetaged while α 1 reflects the vegetation in the wetland channel is sparse the cross sectional velocity profiles u in these four cases are presented in fig 2 when r 0 1 the cross sectional velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect while r 1 both the free water surface effect and lateral sidewall effect dominate the flow with a large α the velocity profiles become more flat both in the vertical and lateral directions as shown in fig 2 c d in the following sections we will illustrate the evolutions of the environmental dispersivity skewness cross sectional mean concentration distribution and spatial concentration distribution in these four cases respectively 4 1 environmental dispersivity and skewness the environmental dispersivity is obtained based on the second order mean concentration moment eq 34 the environmental dispersivity increases gradually and approaches a constant value at large time as presented in fig 3 a with a large parameter α the environmental dispersivity is reduced the result can be explained by the velocity profile shown in fig 2 when the wetland is densely vegetaged the velocity profile becomes flat both in the vertical and lateral directions namely the velocity gradient is globally decreased in terms of the impact of the parameter r it is interesting to find that the environmental dispersivity in case 2 is much larger than that in other three cases 1 3 and 4 in fact previous work chen et al 2010 has revealed that the variation of the environmental dispersivity is not monotonous with r when other parameters are constant similar results can be found in single phase flows dutta et al 2006 have found that taylor aris dispersivity obtains the maximum when the aspect ratio equals 1 for a fixed cross sectional area of the channel in other words the dispersivity is up to the maximum when the depth of the channel equals the width in addition the time to reach the constant environmental dispersivity in these four cases is different which decreases with increasing r as above mentioned the environmental dispersivity is maximum when r 1 namely the solute is dispersed more quickly with larger r therefore the environmental dispersivity up to the constant value is more quickly with increasing r considering the effect of high order moment skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in these four cases is shown in fig 3 b which evaluates the degree of symmetry of the longitudinal concentration distribution wang and chen 2017a both the r and α can affect the skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in the early stages of dispersion the transverse concentration distributions are negatively skewed in cases 1 3 and 4 while it is positively skewed γ 1 0 in case 2 as depicted in fig 3 b the asymmetry of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is induced by the advection chatwin 1970 for solute dispersion in single phase microfluidics with rectangular cross section aminian et al 2016 have revealed that thin channels deliver solutes arriving with sharp fronts and tapering tails negative skewness whereas thick channels produce the opposite effect in addition the negative skewness in thin channels keeps all the time when α 1 the vegetation in flow can be negligible the results here are consistent with their study whereas with a large α the skewness can be transformed from a positive value to a negative value for solute dispersion in a thick wetland channel in the initial stage as shown in fig 3 b cases 2 and 4 4 2 cross sectional mean concentration distribution to account for the dispersion characteristics and skewness the evolution of the transverse mean concentration distributions in these four cases is illustrated in fig 4 the large damping factor α causes the mean concentration distribution to be concentrated along the longitudinal direction the environmental dispersivity is reduced with a large α when r is constant as mentioned above therefore the shape of the transverse mean concentration distribution with large α is thin and high with the same r the dispersion process of solute transport in a thick wetland channel is quicker than that in a thin channel α is constant as depicted in fig 4 the transverse mean concentration distributions are more concentrated in cases 1 and 3 compared with that in cases 2 and 4 respectively on a small time scale the transverse mean concentration distribution is deviated from the gaussian distribution in case 2 the mean concentration distribution is positively skewed with tapering front and sharp tail while in other cases 1 3 and 4 the mean concentration distributions are negatively skewed at large time t 5 the deviations from gaussian distribution are almost disappeared in cases 2 and 4 while the mean concentration distributions keep negatively skewed in cases 1 and 3 in addition to check the reliability of results obtained by chantwin s asymptotic expansion the comparisons of analytical solutions with the numerical results in case 2 are illustrated in appendix b 4 3 spatial concentration distribution to further characterize the environmental transport process in a three dimensional wetland flow the spatial concentration distribution from three directions transverse vertical and lateral will be presented respectively 4 3 1 transverse concentration distribution we choose three cross sections to analyze the transverse concentration distribution i e x 0 x 0 1 x 0 1 on a small time scale i e t 0 5 the concentration distributions on the centroid surface x 0 are greatly non uniform and have two low concentration zones near the sidewall and the free water surface when r 0 1 as illustrated in fig 5 b h for solute transport in a shallow wetland channel r 0 1 the superficial velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect and the velocity profile in the lateral direction is flat except near the side wall therefore the concentration on the upper layer near the free water surface is decreased by advection to the downstream while the concentration near the side wall is weakened by advection to the upstream note that here we adopt the moving coordinate system with the longitudinal speed of u ϕ nevertheless for solute dispersion in a thick wetland channel with r 1 due to the large environmental dispersivity the concentration on the centroid surface is low and tends to uniform distribution as shown in fig 5 e k moreover the contours of transverse concentration distribution are circular due to the symmetry in the lateral and vertical directions in cases 2 and 4 with a large α the dispersion process is weakened and the cross sectional concentration is globally high as seen in fig 5 h k the transverse concentration distributions in the upstream x 0 1 and downstream x 0 1 can well verify above analyses as presented in fig 5 column 1 and 3 respectively the concentration has large values near the side wall in the upstream while it has large values near the free water surface in the downstream as shown in fig 5 a g and c i in cases 2 and 4 the large concentration zones are in the lower left corner in the upstream and upper right corner in the downstream as illustrated in fig 5 d j and f l previous studies have verified that the vertical concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2017b we present the transverse concentration distributions in terms of these three cross sections on a large time scale t 5 in fig 6 the concentration distribution on the centroid surface x 0 approaches uniformity at large time because of the mass diffusivity and superficial mass dispersivity on the transverse direction as seen in fig 6 b e h and k similar results can be found in previous studies that the concentration difference on the centroid surface tends to zero at large time for solute dispersion in two dimensional wetland flows wu et al 2015 wang and chen 2017b whereas the transverse concentration distributions in the upstream and downstream are nonuniform even at large time for cases 1 and 3 as seen in fig 6 a c and g i the cross sectional concentration approaches uniformity in cases 2 and 4 due to the dispersivity as depicted in fig 6 d f and j l therefore for some practical applications such as environmental risk assessment only considering the transverse mean concentration is not sufficient especially when the wetland is densely vegetaged and the wetland channel is shallow it is worth noting that the concentration distribution in the vertical direction of the cross section tends to be uniform at large time for solute dispersion in a shallow wetland channel as shown in fig 6 a c and g i actually there are multiple time scales in the dispersion process to consider i e time scale for longitudinal advection time scale for vertical diffusion and time scale for lateral diffusion the longitudinal diffusion can be negligible taylor 1954b aris 1956 the advection causes the solute dispersion along the longitudinal direction while the effect of the vertical or lateral diffusion causes the distribution of concentration in the vertical or lateral direction of the cross section to be uniform for solute transport in a shallow wetland channel r 0 1 the time scale for vertical diffusion is much smaller than that for lateral diffusion in fact the effective diffusion coefficient in the vertical direction is ten times more than that in the lateral direction referring to eq 13 therefore the vertical concentration distribution tends to uniformity at large time in cases 1 and 3 4 3 2 width averaged mean concentration distribution in above section we have discussed the transverse concentration distribution to analyze the evolution of the longitudinal concentration distribution the width averaged mean concentration distribution is presented which can reflect the concentration distribution on the oxz plane at time t 0 5 in cases 2 and 4 the width averaged concentration distribution along the vertical direction approaches uniformity due to the large vertical diffusion including the effect of mass dispersivity and mass diffusivity as shown in fig 7 a c while in cases 2 and 4 the width averaged concentration distribution is shaped by the vertical velocity profile note that there is a large concentration zone near the bed in fig 7 b d reason is that the non penetration condition on the bed confines the mass diffusivity in one direction jiang et al 2017 on a large time scale t 5 the width averaged concentration distribution along the vertical direction tends to be uniform in cases 2 and 4 as shown in fig 8 b d with a large damping factor α the environmental dispersivity is reduced therefore the concentration distributions along the longitudinal direction are more concentrated as shown in figs 7 c d and 8 c d 4 3 3 depth averaged mean concentration distribution analogous to the width averaged mean concentration distribution the depth averaged mean concentration distribution is presented in this section which can reflect the concentration distribution on the oxy plane the depth averaged concentration distribution is identical with the width averaged concentration distribution for cases 2 and 4 due to the symmetry of concentration in the vertical and lateral directions of the cross section however the depth averaged concentration distribution is greatly different from the width averaged concentration distribution for cases 1 and 3 as depicted in fig 9 a c the depth averaged concentration distribution is characterized by the lateral velocity profile there is a large concentration zone near the y 1 due to the small velocity gradient note that the depth averaged concentration distribution along the lateral direction is still nonuniform even at large time t 5 shown in fig 10 a c which demonstrates that the time scale for lateral diffusion is much larger than that for vertical diffusion for solute dispersion in a shallow wetland channel the results obtained indicate that for solute dispersion in a shallow wetland channel on a large time scale over time scale for vertical diffusion the spatial concentration distribution can be roughly simplified as the lateral two dimensional concentration distribution dominated by the lateral sidewall effect because of the uniform distribution of the concentration in the vertical direction although the cross sectional velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect in addition comparing cases 1 and 3 with cases 2 and 4 we can find that the solute disperses more quickly in a thick channel than that in a thin channel when other parameters are constant 5 conclusions by extending a previous study chen et al 2010 the complete dispersion process of environmental transport in a steady wetland channel with rectangular cross section has been analytically investigated by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion the impact of two important parameters i e aspect ratio r and damping factor α on the dispersion process is illustrated through four typical cases the aspect ratio can affect the environmental dispersivity skewness and the mean concentration distribution greatly with a large α the environmental dispersivity is reduced the transverse mean concentration distribution is positively skewed in a thick wetland channel with sparse vegetation for the spatial concentration distribution multiple time scales should be considered the transverse concentration distribution is non uniform even at large time the width averaged depth averaged mean concentration distribution in the vertical lateral direction tends to uniformity on a large time scale due to mass diffusivity and the superficial mass dispersivity the solute is dispersed more quickly in a thicker channel for a fixed cross sectional section in a shallow wetland channel the spatial concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral sidewall effect on a large time scale due to the uniformity distribution of concentration along the vertical direction although the cross sectional velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect above results are illuminated for some environmental and industrial applications such as environmental risk assessment and wastewater treatment engineering acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51579004 and the iwhr research

6999,predicting the evolution of concentration distribution of environmental transport in wetland flows has a broad range of applications in ecological engineering practice by extending a previous study the spatial concentration distribution of solute transport due to an instantaneous environmental emission in a wetland channel with rectangular cross section is presented in this work by means of chatwin s long time asymptotic technique to account for the effect of high order moment skewness of the transverse mean concentration distribution is analyzed two important parameters i e aspect ratio depth to width and damping factor on the dispersion process are discussed four studied cases illustrated that the transverse concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time and the aspect ratio can affect the transverse concentration distribution greatly the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is asymmetrical in the initial stage and shows an asymptotic gaussian distribution at large time the dispersion process in a thick width equals depth wetland channel is quicker than that in a thin wetland channel the spatial concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral sidewall effect on a large time scale for environmental transport in a thin wetland channel keywords spatial concentration distribution environmental dispersivity environmental transport

in wetland flows taylor dispersion taylor 1953 1954a is a fundamental concept which refers to a stage of transport process when the cross sectional mean concentration forms a gaussian distribution after the initial injection of the solute since taylor s pioneering research extended efforts have been made to study the solute dispersion in environmental flows open channels rivers and estuaries i

the dispersion process arising from stem scale and depth scale velocity heterogeneity in an emergent canopy murphy et al 2007 investigated the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the depth dimension in a two zoned model with submerged plants huai et al 2017 estimated the longitudinal dispersion coefficient under the lateral distribution of depth averaged longitudinal velocity in a symmetric compound channel with emergent vegetation moreover numerical simulation and laboratory measurement have been conducted to estimate the dispersion process in a vegetated channel or with porous media katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2018 yan et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2017 ghisalberti and nepf 2005 for mathematical modelling zeng and chen 2009 followed a basic approach to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and solid in the wetland by the phase average method rajagopal and tao 1995 liu and masliyah 2005 based on the phase average model a great deal of analytical studies on solute transport in wetland flows have been carried out focusing on the solute transport in the free water surface effect dominated wetland flows the vertical concentration distribution and depth averaged concentration have been investigated wu et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2017b wang and huai 2018 moreover the environmental dispersion in multi layer i e two layer or three layer wetlands with free water surface effect were also analyzed chen et al 2012 luo et al 2017 wang et al 2013 2014 for environmental dispersion in the lateral sidewall effect dominated wetland flows zeng et al 2011 2014 studied the width averaged mean concentration distribution additionally the environmental dispersion in two zone wu et al 2011 chen 2013 and three zone wang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 wetlands were also investigated above analytical studies concentrated on the solute dispersion in a free water surface effect dominated or lateral sidewall effect dominated wetland flow however the impact of vertical and lateral variations of the superficial velocity distribution on the dispersion process should be both taken into account when the vertical and lateral scales of the cross section are comparable in fact for solute transport in three dimensional channel flows doshi et al 1978 first found that the longitudinal dispersivity in a rectangular conduit with vanishing aspect ratio is about eight times larger than that in the corresponding two dimensional case without side wall effect chatwin and sullivan 1982 and dutta et al 2006 studied the longitudinal diffusivity in rectangular channels with different values of the aspect ratio in addition pagitsas et al 1986 analyzed the taylor dispersion of solute in poiseuille type solvent flow occuring within a rectangular duct of small aspect ratio in terms of the environmental dispersion in wetland channel with rectangular cross section chen et al 2010 have established a basic model and studied the cross sectional superficial velocity distribution and the environmental dispersivity afterwards the velocity profile and environmental dispersivity in a tidal wetland channel of rectangular cross section were also analyzed zeng et al 2012 however previous researches associated with three dimensional wetland flows mainly studied the longitudinal dispersion coefficient and the cross sectional mean concentration distribution as to the spatial concentration distribution little endeavor has been made actually the transverse concentration distribution is far from uniform in the initial stage and even for a long time which has been verified in the two dimensional wetland flows wang and chen 2017b jiang et al 2017 for some environmental and industrial applications such as ecological risk assessment wu et al 2015 what of primary interest is the influenced region where the concentration is beyond some given standard levels apparently the influenced region is sensitive to the detailed concentration distribution and just giving the transverse mean concentration might not be sufficient moreover previous studies gave the cross sectional mean concentration distribution by neglecting the effect of high order moments the asymmetry of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in the initial time has not been concerned although the skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in rectangular microfluidic flows has been investigated aminian et al 2016 2015 there is still a need to study the skewness of the transverse mean concentration distribution in three dimensional wetland flows due to the presence of vegetation therefore by extending the previous study chen et al 2010 this paper analytically studies the complete concentration distribution for environmental transport in a steady wetland channel with rectangular cross section in consideration of the effect of high order moment by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion the specific objectives of the present work are i to illustrate the environmental dispersivity and skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution ii to present the evolution of the transverse mean concentration distribution and iii to depict the spatial concentration distribution of the environmental transport process for practical applications the impact of the aspect ratio depth to width of the cross section and effect of the vegetation in flow on the dispersion process will be characterized 2 formulation for solute transport in wetland flow by the phase average

dirac delta function due to the lateral symmetry of the flow and solute transport in the wetland channel we choose the left half part of the wetland flow 0 y w as the object of study for concision and in the following sections the cross section refers to the left half part of the whole cross section with the depth h and width w i e the 1 4 of the closed rectangular cross section the aspect ratio

to solve above mass transport equation the technique of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion with respect to large time is applied which can obtain the spatial concentration distribution as well as the cross sectional mean concentration distribution to obtain the coefficients of edgeworth expansion we solve the equations of spatial concentration moments at first 3 1 concentration moments the method of concentration moment has been widely used in previous studies aris 1956 maier et al 2002 the p th concentration moment is defined as 19 m p y z t c x y z t x p d x p 0 1 2 moreover the p th cross sectional mean concentration moment is 20 m p t c x t x p d x p 0 1 2 characteristic of an exponential decay in space distribution of the concentration is subjected to the auxiliary relations aris 1956 fischer et al 1979 barton 1983 as 21 c y z t x p c y z t 0 p 1 2 3 22 c x y z t x x x p c x y z t x x 0 p 1 2 3 applying the operator x p d x to each term of eqs 13 15 and eq 17 with the aid of eqs 21 and 22 we have 23 m p t r r kz 2 m p y 2 r kz r 2 m p z 2 upm p 1 r kx p p 1 pe 2 m p 2 24 m 1 m 2 0 p 0 1 2 m p y z t z z 0 m p y z t z z 1 0 p 0 1 2 25 m p y z t y y 0 m p y z t y y 1 0 p 0 1 2 26 m 0 y z 0 1 m p y z 0 0 p 1 2 we use the integral transform technique to solve above eqs 23 26 the eigenvalue problems with respect to the variables y

eigenvalues the solutions of the eigenvalue problems are y y cos β l y and z z cos χ j z in which the eigenvalues are β l l π l 0 1 2 and χ j j π j 0 1 2 using the integral transform technique the solution of m p y z t can be represented by the expansion 29 m p y z t l 0 j 0 b p β l χ j t cos β l y cos χ j z p 0 1 2 detailed solutions of the coefficients b p β l χ j t can refer to barton 1983 s work immediately we can obtain moments of cross sectional mean concentration by mean operation to characterize the cross sectional mean concentration distribution the p th order normalized central moment of mean concentration wang and chen 2017b is introduced as 30 ν p t x x g p c d x c d x where 31 x g t x c d x c d x m 1 m 0 is the centroid position of the cross sectional mean concentration the cross sectional mean concentration central moments at higher orders are expressed as 32 ν 2 t m 2 m 0 x g 2 33 ν 3 t m 3 m 0 3 x g ν 2 x g 3 the zeroth order mean concentration moment reflects the total mass of the solute in the channel m 0 1 means the mass conservation chen et al 2010 the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the solute cloud environmental dispersivity associated with the second order mean concentration moment wang and chen 2017a is quantified as 34 d t 1 2 d ν 2 d t furthermore to characterize the spatial concentration distribution of the environmental transport process in flows the p th order central concentration moment is introduced as yasuda 1984 35 ν p t y z x x g p c d x c d x where 36 x g t y z xc d x c d x m 1 m 0 is the longitudinal centroid of the concentration at height z the central moments at higher orders are expressed as 37 ν 2 t y z m 2 m 0 x g 2 38 ν 3 t y z m 3 m 0 3 x g ν 2 x g 3 3 2 cumulants and skewness the coefficients of edgeworth expansion can be obtained through the cumulants of concentration distribution which are basic quantities of probability theory alternative to the moments cumulants can be expressed in terms of moments based on the p order central concentration moments defined in the above section the cumulants are given as 39 k 1 x g k 2 ν 2 k 3 ν 3 in addition we denote σ k 2 which is the standard deviation to capture the non gaussian concentration distribution in the initial stage the concept of skewness is introduced skewness γ 1 a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution to its mean can be defined as 40 γ 1 k 3 k 2 3 2 the skewness of gaussian distribution is zero since all its cumulants of order 3 and higher are zero therefore the quantity is often used to measure the deviation from gaussian distribution 3 3 edgeworth expansion now we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution for concentration distribution chatwin 1970 s technique is actually an edgeworth expansion the edgeworth s series give 41 c x y z t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where he n are the hermite polynomials 42 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n e x 2 2 d x n n 0 1 2 x is the standardized variable x x x g σ notice that above asymptotic solution for concentration distribution contains the first three order cumulants therefore such solution can reflect the non gaussian effects like skewness chatwin 1972 similarly we can also apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution for cross sectional mean concentration distribution directly i e 43 c x t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where x is the standardized variable of cross sectional distribution 44 x x x g σ 4 results and discussion for a pulsed solute emission into a steady wetland flow the solute is dispersed under the combined actions of cross sectional variation of superficial flow mass diffusivity and the difference between superficial mass dispersivity in the vertical and lateral directions zeng et al 2012 to illustrate the impact of different aspect ratio of the cross section and effect of vegetation in the wetland channel on the process of environmental dispersion which are essential for some environmental practice we focus on discussing the two parameters r and α through four typical cases case 1 r 0 1 α 1 case 2 r 1 α 1 case 3 r 0 1 α 10 and case 4 r 1 α 10 note that other parameters are typically chosen as r l 1 r kx 1 r kz 1 and pe 1000 respectively the ratio of depth to width of the cross section r 0 1 means that the wetland channel is shallow or thin h w while r 1 means that solute transport in a thick wetland channel h w we remark that one can choose the shorter side of the cross section as the z axis then for the case of h w such as r 10 the velocity profile and concentration distribution are the same as the case h w corresponding to r 0 1 because boundary conditions 14 15 in the y and z directions are the same and r l r kz 1 therefore we only discuss the case of r 1 the damping factor α reflects the density of vegetation in flow chen et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 α 10 means that the wetland is densely vegetaged while α 1 reflects the vegetation in the wetland channel is sparse the cross sectional velocity profiles u in these four cases are presented in fig 2 when r 0 1 the cross sectional velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect while r 1 both the free water surface effect and lateral sidewall effect dominate the flow with a large α the velocity profiles become more flat both in the vertical and lateral directions as shown in fig 2 c d in the following sections we will illustrate the evolutions of the environmental dispersivity skewness cross sectional mean concentration distribution and spatial concentration distribution in these four cases respectively 4 1 environmental dispersivity and skewness the environmental dispersivity is obtained based on the second order mean concentration moment eq 34 the environmental dispersivity increases gradually and approaches a constant value at large time as presented in fig 3 a with a large parameter α the environmental dispersivity is reduced the result can be explained by the velocity profile shown in fig 2 when the wetland is densely vegetaged the velocity profile becomes flat both in the vertical and lateral directions namely the velocity gradient is globally decreased in terms of the impact of the parameter r it is interesting to find that the environmental dispersivity in case 2 is much larger than that in other three cases 1 3 and 4 in fact previous work chen et al 2010 has revealed that the variation of the environmental dispersivity is not monotonous with r when other parameters are constant similar results can be found in single phase flows dutta et al 2006 have found that taylor aris dispersivity obtains the maximum when the aspect ratio equals 1 for a fixed cross sectional area of the channel in other words the dispersivity is up to the maximum when the depth of the channel equals the width in addition the time to reach the constant environmental dispersivity in these four cases is different which decreases with increasing r as above mentioned the environmental dispersivity is maximum when r 1 namely the solute is dispersed more quickly with larger r therefore the environmental dispersivity up to the constant value is more quickly with increasing r considering the effect of high order moment skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in these four cases is shown in fig 3 b which evaluates the degree of symmetry of the longitudinal concentration distribution wang and chen 2017a both the r and α can affect the skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution in the early stages of dispersion the transverse concentration distributions are negatively skewed in cases 1 3 and 4 while it is positively skewed γ 1 0 in case 2 as depicted in fig 3 b the asymmetry of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is induced by the advection chatwin 1970 for solute dispersion in single phase microfluidics with rectangular cross section aminian et al 2016 have revealed that thin channels deliver solutes arriving with sharp fronts and tapering tails negative skewness whereas thick channels produce the opposite effect in addition the negative skewness in thin channels keeps all the time when α 1 the vegetation in flow can be negligible the results here are consistent with their study whereas with a large α the skewness can be transformed from a positive value to a negative value for solute dispersion in a thick wetland channel in the initial stage as shown in fig 3 b cases 2 and 4 4 2 cross sectional mean concentration distribution to account for the dispersion characteristics and skewness the evolution of the transverse mean concentration distributions in these four cases is illustrated in fig 4 the large damping factor α causes the mean concentration distribution to be concentrated along the longitudinal direction the environmental dispersivity is reduced with a large α when r is constant as mentioned above therefore the shape of the transverse mean concentration distribution with large α is thin and high with the same r the dispersion process of solute transport in a thick wetland channel is quicker than that in a thin channel α is constant as depicted in fig 4 the transverse mean concentration distributions are more concentrated in cases 1 and 3 compared with that in cases 2 and 4 respectively on a small time scale the transverse mean concentration distribution is deviated from the gaussian distribution in case 2 the mean concentration distribution is positively skewed with tapering front and sharp tail while in other cases 1 3 and 4 the mean concentration distributions are negatively skewed at large time t 5 the deviations from gaussian distribution are almost disappeared in cases 2 and 4 while the mean concentration distributions keep negatively skewed in cases 1 and 3 in addition to check the reliability of results obtained by chantwin s asymptotic expansion the comparisons of analytical solutions with the numerical results in case 2 are illustrated in appendix b 4 3 spatial concentration distribution to further characterize the environmental transport process in a three dimensional wetland flow the spatial concentration distribution from three directions transverse vertical and lateral will be presented respectively 4 3 1 transverse concentration distribution we choose three cross sections to analyze the transverse concentration distribution i e x 0 x 0 1 x 0 1 on a small time scale i e t 0 5 the concentration distributions on the centroid surface x 0 are greatly non uniform and have two low concentration zones near the sidewall and the free water surface when r 0 1 as illustrated in fig 5 b h for solute transport in a shallow wetland channel r 0 1 the superficial velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect and the velocity profile in the lateral direction is flat except near the side wall therefore the concentration on the upper layer near the free water surface is decreased by advection to the downstream while the concentration near the side wall is weakened by advection to the upstream note that here we adopt the moving coordinate system with the longitudinal speed of u ϕ nevertheless for solute dispersion in a thick wetland channel with r 1 due to the large environmental dispersivity the concentration on the centroid surface is low and tends to uniform distribution as shown in fig 5 e k moreover the contours of transverse concentration distribution are circular due to the symmetry in the lateral and vertical directions in cases 2 and 4 with a large α the dispersion process is weakened and the cross sectional concentration is globally high as seen in fig 5 h k the transverse concentration distributions in the upstream x 0 1 and downstream x 0 1 can well verify above analyses as presented in fig 5 column 1 and 3 respectively the concentration has large values near the side wall in the upstream while it has large values near the free water surface in the downstream as shown in fig 5 a g and c i in cases 2 and 4 the large concentration zones are in the lower left corner in the upstream and upper right corner in the downstream as illustrated in fig 5 d j and f l previous studies have verified that the vertical concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time jiang et al 2017 wang and chen 2017b we present the transverse concentration distributions in terms of these three cross sections on a large time scale t 5 in fig 6 the concentration distribution on the centroid surface x 0 approaches uniformity at large time because of the mass diffusivity and superficial mass dispersivity on the transverse direction as seen in fig 6 b e h and k similar results can be found in previous studies that the concentration difference on the centroid surface tends to zero at large time for solute dispersion in two dimensional wetland flows wu et al 2015 wang and chen 2017b whereas the transverse concentration distributions in the upstream and downstream are nonuniform even at large time for cases 1 and 3 as seen in fig 6 a c and g i the cross sectional concentration approaches uniformity in cases 2 and 4 due to the dispersivity as depicted in fig 6 d f and j l therefore for some practical applications such as environmental risk assessment only considering the transverse mean concentration is not sufficient especially when the wetland is densely vegetaged and the wetland channel is shallow it is worth noting that the concentration distribution in the vertical direction of the cross section tends to be uniform at large time for solute dispersion in a shallow wetland channel as shown in fig 6 a c and g i actually there are multiple time scales in the dispersion process to consider i e time scale for longitudinal advection time scale for vertical diffusion and time scale for lateral diffusion the longitudinal diffusion can be negligible taylor 1954b aris 1956 the advection causes the solute dispersion along the longitudinal direction while the effect of the vertical or lateral diffusion causes the distribution of concentration in the vertical or lateral direction of the cross section to be uniform for solute transport in a shallow wetland channel r 0 1 the time scale for vertical diffusion is much smaller than that for lateral diffusion in fact the effective diffusion coefficient in the vertical direction is ten times more than that in the lateral direction referring to eq 13 therefore the vertical concentration distribution tends to uniformity at large time in cases 1 and 3 4 3 2 width averaged mean concentration distribution in above section we have discussed the transverse concentration distribution to analyze the evolution of the longitudinal concentration distribution the width averaged mean concentration distribution is presented which can reflect the concentration distribution on the oxz plane at time t 0 5 in cases 2 and 4 the width averaged concentration distribution along the vertical direction approaches uniformity due to the large vertical diffusion including the effect of mass dispersivity and mass diffusivity as shown in fig 7 a c while in cases 2 and 4 the width averaged concentration distribution is shaped by the vertical velocity profile note that there is a large concentration zone near the bed in fig 7 b d reason is that the non penetration condition on the bed confines the mass diffusivity in one direction jiang et al 2017 on a large time scale t 5 the width averaged concentration distribution along the vertical direction tends to be uniform in cases 2 and 4 as shown in fig 8 b d with a large damping factor α the environmental dispersivity is reduced therefore the concentration distributions along the longitudinal direction are more concentrated as shown in figs 7 c d and 8 c d 4 3 3 depth averaged mean concentration distribution analogous to the width averaged mean concentration distribution the depth averaged mean concentration distribution is presented in this section which can reflect the concentration distribution on the oxy plane the depth averaged concentration distribution is identical with the width averaged concentration distribution for cases 2 and 4 due to the symmetry of concentration in the vertical and lateral directions of the cross section however the depth averaged concentration distribution is greatly different from the width averaged concentration distribution for cases 1 and 3 as depicted in fig 9 a c the depth averaged concentration distribution is characterized by the lateral velocity profile there is a large concentration zone near the y 1 due to the small velocity gradient note that the depth averaged concentration distribution along the lateral direction is still nonuniform even at large time t 5 shown in fig 10 a c which demonstrates that the time scale for lateral diffusion is much larger than that for vertical diffusion for solute dispersion in a shallow wetland channel the results obtained indicate that for solute dispersion in a shallow wetland channel on a large time scale over time scale for vertical diffusion the spatial concentration distribution can be roughly simplified as the lateral two dimensional concentration distribution dominated by the lateral sidewall effect because of the uniform distribution of the concentration in the vertical direction although the cross sectional velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect in addition comparing cases 1 and 3 with cases 2 and 4 we can find that the solute disperses more quickly in a thick channel than that in a thin channel when other parameters are constant 5 conclusions by extending a previous study chen et al 2010 the complete dispersion process of environmental transport in a steady wetland channel with rectangular cross section has been analytically investigated by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion the impact of two important parameters i e aspect ratio r and damping factor α on the dispersion process is illustrated through four typical cases the aspect ratio can affect the environmental dispersivity skewness and the mean concentration distribution greatly with a large α the environmental dispersivity is reduced the transverse mean concentration distribution is positively skewed in a thick wetland channel with sparse vegetation for the spatial concentration distribution multiple time scales should be considered the transverse concentration distribution is non uniform even at large time the width averaged depth averaged mean concentration distribution in the vertical lateral direction tends to uniformity on a large time scale due to mass diffusivity and the superficial mass dispersivity the solute is dispersed more quickly in a thicker channel for a fixed cross sectional section in a shallow wetland channel the spatial concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral sidewall effect on a large time scale due to the uniformity distribution of concentration along the vertical direction although the cross sectional velocity profile is dominated by the free water surface effect above results are illuminated for some environmental and industrial applications such as environmental risk assessment and wastewater treatment engineering acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51579004 and the iwhr research
