19485,biochar has been reported to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer diet in co cultures between geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens a model defined co culture system in this study the biochar derived from the activated sludge with different pyrolysis temperature was added to the co cultures the ethanol metabolism rates re and succinate production rates rs of co culture with biochar 800 were 1 05 and 1 42 fold higher than that without addition the results suggested that the conductivity of the biochar did not correlate with the facilitating effect of the biochar on the co culture metabolism furthermore the surface functional group and surface charge of biochar may also influence the facilitating effect on the interspecies electron transfer between the two geobacter cells based on these results it supported that the electron transfer depending on the charging and discharging process of the surface functional groups might play a major role in facilitating the direct electron transfer process by the biochar derived from activated sludge here this study could shed light on the better understanding of the bacteria biochar electron transfer system and the potential utilization of the biochar in the environmental wastewater treatments graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar geobacter surface functional group conductivity surface charge 1 introduction electrons can be transferred from electrochemically active bacteria to extracellular electron acceptors with the oxidation of organic matters which plays important roles in areas of energy production environmental remediation and geochemical cycle systems logan and rabaey 2013 wang et al 2009 the extracted electron can be transferred to extracellular electron acceptors including electrode liu et al 2014a metal oxides byrne et al 2015 and other bacteria nielsen et al 2010 the manner of electron transfer from one kind of bacteria to another is known as the interspecies electron transfer iet which can be achieved through both direct and indirect pathways under anaerobic conditions direct interspecies electron transfer diet may be a more effective process than the mediated interspecies electron transfer miet via molecules such as hydrogen or formate that rely on the diffusion of substrates liu et al 2012 lovley 2011 2012 the co culture of geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens was first discovered to form electrically conductive cell aggregates in which the two geobacter species can transfer electrons to metabolize ethanol as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor summers et al 2010 some conductive minerals and carbon materials can accelerate the rate of anaerobic metabolism by facilitating the diet process chen et al 2014a karn et al 2009 kato et al 2012a c liu et al 2014b the metabolism process was accelerated when granular activated carbon was added to the co culture of g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens requiring diet liu et al 2012 another study reported that the conductive magnetite can facilitate iet from g sulfurreducens to thiobacillus denitrificans accomplishing acetate oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction kato et al 2012c biochar was reported to be able to accelerate the iet rate with cells separately attached to the surface of biochar suggesting that electrons were likely conducted through the biochar chen et al 2014b many studies demonstrated that the methanogenesis process was significantly accelerated in the presence of iron oxide by promoting the diet process cruz viggi et al 2014 kato et al 2012b li et al 2015a ma et al 2015 beside iron oxide carbon nanotubes cnts in the methanogenic sludge of anaerobic wastewater treatment systems induced much faster methane production and substrate utilization rates li et al 2015b in a recent work multiwalled cnts mwcnts was added in the anaerobic digestion reactor of beet sugar industrial wastewater ambuchi et al 2017 which showed an obvious increase in the methane production where mwcnts act as electron transfer conduit for diet as a primary method in wastewater treatment the microorganism is used to degrade organic pollutants in wastewater and produces lots of surplus sludge as byproducts phuengprasop et al 2011 which is composed of organic compounds macro and micronutrients trace elements microorganisms and micropollutants hossain et al 2011 however the post processing of the surplus sludge is a difficult issue in environmental area xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 compared with the traditional methods of landfill and direct agriculture utilization hwang et al 2007 conversion of wastewater sludge to biochar through pyrolysis process can potentially be a method of choice for this process can reduce the volume of the solid residue and eliminate pathogens present in the sludge caballero et al 1997 koch and kaminsky 1993 singh et al 2010 however less attention has been given to the effect of biochar derived from surplus sludge on the iet process it is thought that further understanding of the biochar s facilitating effect on the iet process will provide a basis for the development of better strategies for activated sludge biochar landfill and a better understanding of the biochar influence on biological systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge biochar synthesis the surplus sludge was collected from a local wastewater treatment plant majiagou wastewater treatment plant harbin china which was rich in microbial cells and inorganic minerals but no heavy metal ions the activated sludge was dried in the ambient temperature to form dry granules after that it was heated in a tubular furnace at specific pyrolysis temperatures for 1 h in n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 and the gases produced during the heating process were filtered by a koh aqueous solution before it was released into the atmosphere the pyrolysis temperatures were set at 700 800 900 1000 and 1100 c respectively the carbonized granules were ground to a state of powder in a mortar these powders were washed with deionized water until the ph reached at 7 finally the carbon powder samples were dried in an oven at 90 c for 24 h the biochars were named after the corresponding pyrolysis temperature biochar 700 biochar 800 biochar 900 biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 2 2

ftir spectra of powdered samples were recorded in ftir spectrometer spectrum one perkinelmer the spectra were obtained by 32 scans of the sample at a resolution of 4 cm 1 and an interval of 1 cm 1 the resulting spectra were normalized to the highest peak in the fingerprint region between 4000 and 700 cm 1 the particle size distributions were determined and reported as cumulative volumetric percentage data mastersizer 2000 malvern england the ph of the biochar was measured by adding biochar to deionized water in a biochar concentration of 2 g l the solution was then hand shaken and allowed to stand for 5 min before measuring the ph with a ph meter inolab ph 7110 china to determine the zeta potential of the biochar 0 020 g of the biochar sample was placed in a 10 ml deionized

suzhou jingge china zhang et al 2015 the electron accepting capacities eac and electron donating capacities edc of the biochars were quantified mediated electrochemical reduction mer and oxidation meo method kluepfel et al 2014 yu et al 2015 mer and meo experiments were performed using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua co ltd shanghai china with a conventional three electrode cell at ambient temperatures a graphite plate 1 2 cm a platinum sheet and a saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively chronoamperometry ca measurements were performed in a buffer solution 0 1 m kcl 0 1 m phosphate ph 7 under constant stirring and n2 flow the mer and meo were conducted at an applied potential of 0 49 v and 0 61 v vs she respectively a synthesized compound diquat dibromide monohydrate dq and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts 98 purchased from sigma aldrich were used as an electron shuttle for mer and meo respectively viggi et al 2017 the total electron exchange capacities eecs of biochars were obtained from the sum of the eacs and edcs 2 3 microorganisms media and growth conditions co cultures of g metallireducens gs 15 and g sulfurreducens pca were established in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with a gas phase of n2 co2 80 20 v v coppi et al 2001 with ethanol 10 mm as the electron donor and fumarate 40 mm as the electron acceptor before the establishment of the co cultures g metallireducens for inocula was grown in ferric citrate fc medium with 20 mm ethanol as the sole electron donor and 55 mm ferric citrate as the electron acceptor g sulfurreducens for inocula was grown in nbf medium with 20 mm acetate as the sole electron donor and 40 mm fumarate as the electron acceptor after three transfers of g metallireducens or g sulfurreducens the co cultures were dosed with biochar materials as referenced by the previous experiments liu et al 2012 each of these sets of experiments was performed in triplicate pure cultures of g metallireducens gs 15 were established in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with ethanol 10 mm as the electron donor and biochars as electron acceptor pure cultures of g sulfurreducens pca were established in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with fumarate 40 mm as the electron acceptor and biochars as electron donator metabolism of ethanol and reduction of fumarate were monitored over time by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis as previously described zheng et al 2015 the ethanol metabolism rates re and succinate production rates rs were calculated by the date during the linear phase of metabolism in the co cultures quantitative analysis of the cells was conducted based on the protein mass on the surface of biochar and in the solution zhu et al 2014 briefly after the co culture experiment the samples were soaked in 0 2 m koh solution and heated for half an hour at 90 c the concentrations of the protein were determined by bca method according to manufacturer s protocol solarbio china 2 4 morphology of the bacteria on the biochar the morphology of cells on the biochar surface was examined by a scanning electron microscope sem the pretreatment process of all the samples with microorganisms was as follows samples were firstly fixed overnight in the fixative containing 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c then washed with 0 1 m phosphate buffer solution for three times then the samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol solution 50 70 90 and 100 the samples were finally blown with nitrogen gas and dried with vacuum freeze drying method after that the samples were sputter coated with 10 nm of gold and imaged by a field emission sem fei xl30 sirion sem at an accelerating voltage of 5 kv 3 results 3 1 physical properties of the biochar sem images in fig 1 showed that biochars at higher temperatures exhibited more porous structure with rough surface morphology the tem images showed that the edge of the carbon sheets become rough with higher pyrolysis temperature fig 1 however the edge of the carbon sheet with the pyrolysis temperature of 1100 c became smooth which should be due to the collapse of the carbon structure these results confirmed that pyrolysis temperature could influence the particle morphology of the biochar the xrd patterns showed that biochar samples with various pyrolysis temperatures had similar diffraction peaks fig 2 a which indicated the presence of same crystalline phase by comparison biochar with higher pyrolysis temperatures had a higher peak at the 2θ values of around 23 indicating the development of atomic order in the increasingly carbonized material keiluweit et al 2010 this peak comes from the formation and successive ordering of aromatic carbon tushar et al 2012 the average size of the biochar decreased with pyrolysis temperature increasing fig 2b and fig s1 indicating that the pyrolysis reaction could weaken the tensile strength of the raw materials and the biochar is more fragile and likely to be broken abdullah and wu 2009 kim et al 2012 all the biochar samples with different pyrolysis temperatures exhibited type ⅳ nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms with a clear h2 type hysteresis loop fig 2c indicating the formation of a mesoporous network zhou et al 2014 the lowest bet surface area of biochar 700 sample was likely due to the insufficient carbonization process of the activated sludge table 1 and the surface area reached the maximum value for biochar 1000 and showed a slight decrease in higher pyrolysis temperature biochar 1100 which due to the porous structures collapse the conductivity of the biochar powders increased as the pressure increased fig 2d however under the same pressure the conductivity of biochar with different pyrolysis temperature showed a significant difference the conductivity of the biochar is greatly increased with the pyrolysis temperature increasing due to higher carbonization and the graphitization gabhi et al 2017 under the pressure of 28 5 mpa the conductivity of biochar 700 is just 0 41 s m 1 while the conductivity of biochar 800 biochar 900 biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 are 21 07 s m 1 86 51 s m 1 281 69 s m 1 and 582 92 s m 1 the conductivity of biochar 1100 is even 1433 times higher than the biochar 700 3 2 chemical properties of the biochar the survey scan spectrum of the biochar samples with characteristic spectra of c1s n1s and o1s fig 3 a indicated that the presence of carbon nitrogen and oxygen no metal elements were identified as shown in fig 3a the height of peaks belong to n around 400 ev and o around 532 ev decreased with pyrolysis temperature increasing indicating that the element contents of n and o in the biochar samples decreased as shown in table 2 from biochar 700 to biochar 1100 the carbon content increased from 72 90 to 81 98 whereas the nitrogen and oxygen content decreased from 4 26 to 22 86 1 14 and 16 88 respectively this result indicated that the increase of pyrolysis temperature increased the degree of the carbonization chen et al 2012 chun et al 2004 losses in nitrogen and oxygen content at higher pyrolysis temperature should be attributed to the cracking of corresponding weak bonds within the biochar structure demirbas 2004 kim et al 2012 the mean peak of the c1s spectra of all the biochar samples at the binding energy of 284 5 ev was due to graphitic carbon and the gradual increase of this peak with higher temperature indicated the content increase of the graphitic carbon structure fig s2 the broad peak around the binding energy of 290 ev may be derived from many structures including carbon present in quinone groups 287 4 ev nitrogen containing groups 288 7 ev the π π shake up satellite 290 4 ev lee et al 2001 swiatkowski et al 2004 the mean peak of the o1s spectra fig s3 with a binding energy of about 533 ev can be ascribed to o h c o c and c n o moieties in some surface oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups kapteijn et al 1999 pakula et al 2002 swiatkowski et al 2002 ftir spectra of the biochars fig 3b revealed their chemical bond structure on the surface of the biochar these spectra are similar to those reported of other carbons derived from a wide variety of sources burg et al 2002 gomezserrano et al 1994 moreno castilla et al 1998 moreover the band at 1032 cm 1 was also observed to gradually decrease with higher temperature indicating carboxylate groups on the surface were also gradually reduced aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds are also confirmed by c h wagging vibrations in the region between 800 and 600 cm 1 the intensity of these peaks decreases with higher treated temperatures which indicates stability of the aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds and possible cyclisation of the biochar were destroyed hossain et al 2011 the same reduction trend was also observed for c n c bending vibration at 1544 cm 1 and the c o stretching vibration located at 1620 cm 1 chun et al 2004 zeta potential variation with the pyrolysis temperature was shown in table 1 with the pyrolysis temperature increased from 700 c to 900 c the zeta potential increased from 17 4 10 55 mv however when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 1000 and 1100 the zeta potential decreased to 7 15 mv biochar 1000 and 3 09 mv biochar 1100 the zeta potential variation of the biochar may be influenced by many factors including particle size and surface functional groups the ph variation of the biochar with the pyrolysis temperature table 1 showed the corresponding trend with the zeta potential variation the biochar 900 showed the lowest ph of 4 83 3 3 metabolism facilitation of biochar on the geobacter co cultures as previously reported g metallireducens can directly transfer electrons to g sulfurreducens in a defined medium with ethanol as electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor summers et al 2010 biochar was reported to be able to accelerate the diet process between g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens chen et al 2014b however the feasibility of facilitating the diet by activated sludge derived biochar has not been investigated before thus firstly biochar 700 was chosen to test its possibility of promoting metabolism of the geobactor co culture as showed in fig 4 a and b the result showed that the biochar 700 addition accelerated the ethanol metabolism with a coincident accumulation of succinate without biochar addition the amounts of ethanol oxidation and succinate production were slightly low over the experiment period the facilitating effect of the biochar increased with more biochar 700 addition the corresponding ethanol metabolism rates re and succinate production rates rs during the linear phase of metabolism in the co cultures were listed in table 3 the re and rs gradually increased from 0 11 0 03 mm d 1 and 0 66 0 01 mm d 1 control to 0 23 0 05 mm d 1 and 2 37 0 18 mm d 1 2 g l 1 biochar 700 the results indicated that biochar can effectively facilitate the syntrophic growth of geobacter co cultures the total biomass concentration was gradually increased with higher biochar 700 dosage fig 4c the biomass of the co culture with biochar 700 dosage of 2 0 g l 1 was 22 36 mg l 1 which was 2 94 fold higher than without biochar 5 68 mg l 1 more biochar addition can induce the faster metabolism of the co cultures cells in the co cultures exist in one of two types planktonic freely existing in solution and sessile attached to the surface of the biochar garrett et al 2008 it was also observed that the ratio of the biomass on the biochar surface to the total biomass increased with the dosage increasing fig 4d for the co culture with biochar 700 dosage 71 54 of the cells were found on the surface of the biochar of 2 0 g l 1 dosage while only 56 11 of the cells attached on the biochar surface of 0 5 g l 1 therefore the majority of biomass in co cultures was attached to the surface of the biochar which facilitated iet in the two geobacter co cultures as showed in fig 5 the co culture metabolism with biochar of different pyrolysis temperature showed different metabolism rate it exhibited the lowest metabolism rate in co cultures without biochar addition and the rs was just 0 48 0 05 mm d 1 table 4 while the biochar addition greatly promoted the metabolism rate of the co cultures the addition of biochar 700 biochar 800 and biochar 900 showed the metabolism rates at the same level the re and rs analysis showed that the co culture with biochar 800 exhibited the highest metabolism rate with re and rs being 0 16 0 04 mm d 1 and 1 15 0 06 mm d 1 respectively the re and rs of co culture with biochar 800 were 1 05 and 1 42 times higher than without condition re 0 08 0 01 mm d 1 rs 0 48 0 05 mm d 1 however the facilitating effect of biochar reduced with higher pyrolysis temperature the re and rs of the co cultures with biochar 1000 were 0 11 0 03 mm d 1and 0 89 0 04 mm d 1 which were 0 35 and 0 87 times higher than without addition the re and rs of the co cultures with biochar 1100 were 0 09 0 01 mm d 1 and 0 69 0 05 mm d 1 which were just 0 10 and 0 44 time higher than without addition the protein concentration test showed that the biochar addition with different pyrolysis temperature all promoted the co culture growth fig 5c the total protein concentrations with the addition of biochar 700 biochar 800 biochar 900 biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 were 21 39 mg l 1 21 53 mg l 1 22 37 mg l 1 19 10 mg l 1 and 17 99 mg l 1 which were 1 07 1 08 1 16 0 84 and 0 73 times higher than without addition 10 34 mg l 1 however the cells in the solution were greatly reduced with the biochar addition which may be due to the adhesion of the cells on the biochar surface the cells in the co culture solution with biochar 700 biochar 800 and biochar 900 were 2 36 mg l 1 0 90 mg l 1 and 0 28 mg l 1 which were just 22 82 9 48 and 2 71 of the control one the ratio of the cells on the biochar surface to the total cells increased with the pyrolysis temperature increased from 700 to 900 c with the ratio increasing from 66 86 biochar 700 and 87 41 biochar 800 to 96 27 biochar 900 fig 5d however this ratio decreased with higher pyrolysis temperatures was applied the ratio with the addition of biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 slightly decreased to 96 07 and 92 40 the slight decrease of this ratio should be attributed to the more negative surface potential and less surface functional groups 4 discussion previous studies reported that the material s conductivity played an important role in its facilitating effect on the diet process in natural environments kato et al 2010 li et al 2015a biochar was reported to be able to accelerate the iet process between geobacter species with electrons likely transferred through the biochar in laboratory experiments chen et al 2014b another study suggests that biochar can influence soil biogeochemistry by directly mediating electron transfer processes i e by functioning as an electron shuttle between bacteria and fe ⅲ minerals kappler et al 2014 otherwise a non conductive material glass beads did not promote diet under similar conditions liu et al 2012 however in this study the facilitating effect of co culture metabolism did not increase with the conductivity the correlation is negative with the succinate production rate and biochar conductivity fig 6 a it is generally known that a higher pyrolysis temperature of the biochar would result in a greater degree of carbonization and higher conductivity gabhi et al 2017 as shown in fig 6b the conductivity of the biochar had a negative correlation with o content of the biochar r2 0 88 the co culture with biochar 700 biochar 800 and biochar 900 exhibited similar metabolism rates however the conductivity of biochar 800 and biochar 900 are 50 84 and 212 80 times higher than that of biochar 700 indicating that the conductivity of the biochar is not the critical factor for promoting the co culture metabolism in this study although the conductivity of the biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 were greatly higher than that of the others the metabolism facilitation effect of biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 were even lower than the other biochar is a complex material with properties other than conductivity chen et al 2014b thus besides the conductivity other properties of the biochar should also play important roles in the facilitating effect on the co culture metabolism in previous studies activated carbon van der zee et al 2003 and solid humic substances roden et al 2010 were reported to have the electron accepting function quinone moieties phenolic moieties and arene rings in biochar are the possible redox active moieties responsible for its electron accepting ability kluepfel et al 2014 peiris et al 2017 tong et al 2014 the biochar with lower pyrolysis temperature has a higher content of the redox active moieties which may participate in the electron transfer process the biochar in the reductive forms may further serve as an electron donor for other microorganisms the charging and discharging cycles of biochar surface functional groups have been shown to reversibly accept and donate electrons klupfel et al 2014 lovley et al 1996 the direct electron transfer across the interface of biochar matrices and external electron donors and acceptors is different from the established electron transfer through carbon matrices due to electrical conductivity xu et al 2013 in a recent study it was reported that besides the direct electron transfer through the biochar the electron transfer through the charging and discharging cycles of the surface functional groups had been proposed to play important roles in the electron transfer process of the biochar sun et al 2017 it has been demonstrated that the biochar with o c ratio of less than 0 09 can transfer electrons by the charging and discharging cycles of the surface functional groups about one third of the direct electron transfer by conductivity in this study the o c ratios of all the biochar were much higher than 0 09 table 2 indicating that the surface functional groups may play a major role in the electron transfer through the biochar and this analysis could explain the phenomenon that the great improvement of the biochar conductivity with higher pyrolysis temperature did not promote the accelerating effect of biochar on diet process the surface functional groups were decreased with higher pyrolysis temperature which can explain the phenomenon that the facilitating effect of biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 was lower there was a high positive correlation r2 0 90 between the succinate production rate and the o content of the biochar in fig 6c indicating that the oxygenic functional groups may deeply participate into the facilitating effect of biochar the previously reported redox moieties including quinone moieties and phenolic moieties are oxygenic functional groups however the weak relevance between the succinate production rate and the n content of the biochar fig 6d r2 0 40 implied low engagement of the nitrogen containing structures in the electron transfer accelerating process to demonstrate the potential of biochar to function as electron donor and acceptor the pure culture experiments were carried out pure culture of g metallireducens gs 15 was added in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with the biochars of different pyrolysis temperature obvious ethanol consumption was observed in the culture with biochars and the pure culture with biochar 700 exhibited the highest ethanol consumption rate fig 7 a similarly pure culture of g sulfurreducens pca was added in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with the biochars as shown in fig 7b the obvious succinate production was detected in the cultures with biochars in which the succinate concentration increased over time the succinate production rate with biochar 700 addition was much higher than that with other biochars table s1 the result of ethanol adsorption experiment showed that the ethanol concentration did not decreased over time fig s4 indicating that the biochar adsorption effect can be neglected these results proved that the biochars can accept electrons from g metallireducens gs 15 and transfer electrons to g sulfurreducens pca the meo results showed that the edcs decreased with the pyrolysis temperature fig s5 an obvious positive linear relationship r2 0 9558 between edcs and succinate production rates was observed in the experiment of pure cultures g sulfurreducens pca with biochars fig 7c this result further proved that the succinate production rates were mainly determined by the edcs of the biochars the mer results fig s6 also showed that the eacs decreased with the pyrolysis temperature there is a slightly positive linear relationship between eacs and the ethanol metabolism rates in the experiment of pure cultures g metallireducens gs 15 with biochars fig 8 d indicating that other properties of biochars may also influence the electron transfer process from g metallireducens gs 15 to biochars theoretically the eec should have a positive linear relationship with the oxygen containing redox moieties content in this experiment the eecs of the biochars increased with the o contents of the biochars however no obvious linear relationship was found fig s7a indicating that more complicated relationship between eecs and o content of the biochars should exist otherwise no obvious linear relationship was observed between rs co culture and the eec fig s7b thus it was believed that besides the electron transfer property of the biochar other properties may also influence the stimulatory effect on the co culture metabolism the adhesion of microorganisms on a surface was also an important process for the bacteria metabolism and can be divided into three stages 1 reversible adhesion on the surface due to long range forces 2 consolidation between microorganisms and the surface 3 colonization and growth of organisms on the surface and the surface physical and chemical properties including surface charge and chemical functionalities dominate the initial attachment of the cells garrett et al 2008 rattier et al 1997 the surface charge of the samples was determined by measuring the zeta potential ζ of the biochar the surface of charcoals biochar activated carbon is often negatively charged which makes them unlikely to adsorb negatively charged bacteria yao et al 2011 biochar 900 10 55 1 52 mv has the most positive surface charge which could benefit the initial attachment of cells on the biochar surface the surface charge of biochar 700 17 4 0 70 mv was negatively charged inhibiting the initial attachment of cells while the surface charge of biochar 800 6 39 2 07 mv was between biochar 700 and biochar 900 as shown in fig 8a there was a positive correlation r2 0 73 between the cell attachment ratio and the zeta potential of the biochar confirming that the surface charge could actually influence the bacteria adhesion on biochar surface however unlike the o element content there is no obvious linear relationship between rs and zeta potential fig 8b indicating that the surface charge may just partially influence the co culture metabolism combined with the content variation of the surface functional group the zeta potential variation from biochar 700 to biochar 900 may help to explain the observed facilitating effect on the co culture metabolism the zeta potentials of biochar 1000 7 15 0 88 mv and biochar 1100 3 09 1 19 mv decreased again with higher pyrolysis temperature which can also help to explain the lower facilitating effect otherwise the surface porosity gradually increased from biochar 700 to biochar 1000 which may also enhance the cell attachment on the surface and promote the electron exchange between biochar and cells 5 conclusion overall the result showed that the biochar derived from activated sludge promoted the metabolism process of the co cultures higher dosage of the biochar can induce much faster metabolism and the biochar with different pyrolysis temperatures all promoted the co culture metabolism however the conductivity did not play a decisive role in the facilitating effect which did not increase with the higher pyrolysis temperature beside conductivity the electron transfer depending on the charging and discharging cycles of the surface functional groups played a major role in the electron transfer process through the biochar otherwise the biochar surface charge and porosity may also influence the adhesion of cells on the biochar surface and the accelerating effect of biochar on diet process this study could provide a better understanding of the biochar effect on the diet process and promote the application of biochar in

19485,biochar has been reported to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer diet in co cultures between geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens a model defined co culture system in this study the biochar derived from the activated sludge with different pyrolysis temperature was added to the co cultures the ethanol metabolism rates re and succinate production rates rs of co culture with biochar 800 were 1 05 and 1 42 fold higher than that without addition the results suggested that the conductivity of the biochar did not correlate with the facilitating effect of the biochar on the co culture metabolism furthermore the surface functional group and surface charge of biochar may also influence the facilitating effect on the interspecies electron transfer between the two geobacter cells based on these results it supported that the electron transfer depending on the charging and discharging process of the surface functional groups might play a major role in

of energy production environmental remediation and geochemical cycle systems logan and rabaey 2013 wang et al 2009 the extracted electron can be transferred to extracellular electron acceptors including electrode liu et al 2014a metal oxides byrne et al 2015 and other bacteria nielsen et al 2010 the manner of electron transfer from one kind of bacteria to another is known as the interspecies electron transfer iet which can be achieved through both direct and indirect pathways under anaerobic conditions direct interspecies electron transfer diet may be a more effective process than the mediated interspecies electron transfer miet via molecules such as hydrogen or formate that rely on the diffusion of substrates liu et al 2012 lovley 2011 2012 the co culture of geobacter metallireducens and geobacter sulfurreducens was first discovered to form electrically conductive cell aggregates in which the two geobacter species can transfer electrons to metabolize ethanol as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor summers et al 2010 some conductive minerals and carbon materials can accelerate the rate of anaerobic metabolism by facilitating the diet process chen et al 2014a karn et al 2009 kato et al 2012a c liu et al 2014b the metabolism process was accelerated when granular activated carbon was added to the co culture of g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens requiring diet liu et al 2012 another study reported that the conductive magnetite can facilitate iet from g sulfurreducens to thiobacillus denitrificans accomplishing acetate oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction kato et al 2012c biochar was reported to be able to accelerate the iet rate with cells separately attached to the surface of biochar suggesting that electrons were likely conducted through the biochar chen et al 2014b many studies demonstrated that the methanogenesis process was significantly accelerated in the presence of iron oxide by promoting the diet process cruz viggi et al 2014 kato et al 2012b li et al 2015a ma et al 2015 beside iron oxide carbon nanotubes cnts in the methanogenic sludge of anaerobic wastewater treatment systems induced much faster methane production and substrate utilization rates li et al 2015b in a recent work multiwalled cnts mwcnts was added in the anaerobic digestion reactor of beet sugar industrial wastewater ambuchi et al 2017 which showed an obvious increase in the methane production where mwcnts act as electron transfer conduit for diet as a primary method in wastewater treatment the microorganism is used to degrade organic pollutants in wastewater and produces lots of surplus sludge as byproducts phuengprasop et al 2011 which is composed of organic compounds macro and micronutrients trace elements microorganisms and micropollutants hossain et al 2011 however the post processing of the surplus sludge is a difficult issue in environmental area xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 compared with the traditional methods of landfill and direct agriculture utilization hwang et al 2007 conversion of wastewater sludge to biochar through pyrolysis process can potentially be a method of choice for this process can reduce the volume of the solid residue and eliminate pathogens present in the sludge caballero et al 1997 koch and kaminsky 1993 singh et al 2010 however less attention has been given to the effect of biochar derived from surplus sludge on the iet process it is thought that further understanding of the biochar s facilitating effect on the iet process will provide a basis for the development of better strategies for activated sludge biochar landfill and a better understanding of the biochar influence on biological systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge biochar synthesis the surplus sludge was collected from a local wastewater treatment plant majiagou wastewater treatment plant harbin china which was rich in microbial cells and inorganic minerals but no heavy metal ions the activated sludge was dried in the ambient temperature to form dry granules after that it was heated in a tubular furnace at specific pyrolysis temperatures for 1 h in n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 and the gases produced during the heating process were filtered by a koh aqueous solution before it was released into the atmosphere the pyrolysis temperatures were set at 700 800 900 1000 and 1100 c respectively the carbonized granules were ground to a state of powder in a mortar these powders were washed with deionized water until the ph reached at 7 finally the carbon powder samples were dried in an oven at 90 c for 24 h the biochars were named after the corresponding pyrolysis temperature biochar 700 biochar 800 biochar 900 biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 2 2

ftir spectra of powdered samples were recorded in ftir spectrometer spectrum one perkinelmer the spectra were obtained by 32 scans of the sample at a resolution of 4 cm 1 and an interval of 1 cm 1 the resulting spectra were normalized to the highest peak in the fingerprint region between 4000 and 700 cm 1 the particle size distributions were determined and reported as cumulative volumetric percentage data mastersizer 2000 malvern england the ph of the biochar was measured by adding biochar to deionized water in a biochar concentration of 2 g l the solution was then hand shaken and allowed to stand for 5 min before measuring the ph with a ph meter inolab ph 7110 china to determine the zeta potential of the biochar 0 020 g of the biochar sample was placed in a 10 ml deionized water and tested with the zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano malvern the conductivity of the biochar particles was determined with the four probe method by a powder resistivity tester st2722 suzhou jingge china zhang et al 2015 the electron accepting capacities eac and electron donating capacities edc of the biochars were quantified mediated electrochemical reduction mer and oxidation meo method kluepfel et al 2014 yu et al 2015 mer and meo experiments were performed using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua co ltd shanghai china with a conventional three electrode cell at ambient temperatures a graphite plate 1 2 cm a platinum sheet and a saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively chronoamperometry ca measurements were performed in a buffer solution 0 1 m kcl 0 1 m phosphate ph 7 under constant stirring and n2 flow the mer and meo were conducted at an applied potential of 0 49 v and 0 61 v vs she respectively a synthesized compound diquat dibromide monohydrate dq and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium salt abts 98 purchased from sigma aldrich were used as an electron shuttle for mer and meo respectively viggi et al 2017 the total electron exchange capacities eecs of biochars were obtained from the sum of the eacs and edcs 2 3 microorganisms media and growth conditions co cultures of g metallireducens gs 15 and g sulfurreducens pca were established in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with a gas phase of n2 co2 80 20 v v coppi et al 2001 with ethanol 10 mm as the electron donor and fumarate 40 mm as the electron acceptor before the establishment of the co cultures g metallireducens for inocula was grown in ferric citrate fc medium with 20 mm ethanol as the sole electron donor and 55 mm ferric citrate as the electron acceptor g sulfurreducens for inocula was grown in nbf medium with 20 mm acetate as the sole electron donor and 40 mm fumarate as the electron acceptor after three transfers of g metallireducens or g sulfurreducens the co cultures were dosed with biochar materials as referenced by the previous experiments liu et al 2012 each of these sets of experiments was performed in triplicate pure cultures of g metallireducens gs 15 were established in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with ethanol 10 mm as the electron donor and biochars as electron acceptor pure cultures of g sulfurreducens pca were established in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with fumarate 40 mm as the electron acceptor and biochars as electron donator metabolism of ethanol and reduction of fumarate were monitored over time by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis as previously described zheng et al 2015 the ethanol metabolism rates re and succinate production rates rs were calculated by the date during the linear phase of metabolism in the co cultures quantitative analysis of the cells was conducted based on the protein mass on the surface of biochar and in the solution zhu et al 2014 briefly after the co culture experiment the samples were soaked in 0 2 m koh solution and heated for half an hour at 90 c the concentrations of the protein were determined by bca method according to manufacturer s protocol solarbio china 2 4 morphology of the bacteria on the biochar the morphology of cells on the biochar surface was examined by a scanning electron microscope sem the pretreatment process of all the samples with microorganisms was as follows samples were firstly fixed overnight in the fixative containing 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c then washed with 0 1 m phosphate buffer solution for three times then the samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol solution 50 70 90 and 100 the samples were finally blown with nitrogen gas and dried with vacuum freeze drying method after that the samples were sputter coated with 10 nm of gold and imaged by a field emission sem fei xl30 sirion sem at an accelerating voltage of 5 kv 3 results 3 1 physical properties of the biochar sem images in fig 1 showed that biochars at higher temperatures exhibited more porous structure with rough surface morphology the tem images showed that the edge of the carbon sheets become rough with higher pyrolysis temperature fig 1 however the edge of the carbon sheet with the pyrolysis temperature of 1100 c became smooth which should be due to the collapse of the carbon structure these results confirmed that pyrolysis temperature could influence the particle morphology of the biochar the xrd patterns showed that biochar samples with various pyrolysis temperatures had similar diffraction peaks fig 2 a which indicated the presence of same crystalline phase by comparison biochar with higher pyrolysis temperatures had a higher peak at the 2θ values of around 23 indicating the development of atomic order in the increasingly carbonized material keiluweit et al 2010 this peak comes from the formation and successive ordering of aromatic carbon tushar et al 2012 the average size of the biochar decreased with pyrolysis temperature increasing fig 2b and fig s1 indicating that the pyrolysis reaction could weaken the tensile strength of the raw materials and the biochar is more fragile and likely to be broken abdullah and wu 2009 kim et al 2012 all the biochar samples with different pyrolysis temperatures exhibited type ⅳ nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms with a clear h2 type hysteresis loop fig 2c indicating the formation of a mesoporous network zhou et al 2014 the lowest bet surface area of biochar 700 sample was likely due to the insufficient carbonization process of the activated sludge table 1 and the surface area reached the maximum value for biochar 1000 and showed a slight decrease in higher pyrolysis temperature biochar 1100 which due to the porous structures collapse the conductivity of the biochar powders increased as the pressure increased fig 2d however under the same pressure the conductivity of biochar with different pyrolysis temperature showed a significant difference the conductivity of the biochar is greatly increased with the pyrolysis temperature increasing due to higher carbonization and the graphitization gabhi et al 2017 under the pressure of 28 5 mpa the conductivity of biochar 700 is just 0 41 s m 1 while the conductivity of biochar 800 biochar 900 biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 are 21 07 s m 1 86 51 s m 1 281 69 s m 1 and 582 92 s m 1 the conductivity of biochar 1100 is even 1433 times higher than the biochar 700 3 2 chemical properties of the biochar the survey scan spectrum of the biochar samples with characteristic spectra of c1s n1s and o1s fig 3 a indicated that the presence of carbon nitrogen and oxygen no metal elements were identified as shown in fig 3a the height of peaks belong to n around 400 ev and o around 532 ev decreased with pyrolysis temperature increasing indicating that the element contents of n and o in the biochar samples decreased as shown in table 2 from biochar 700 to biochar 1100 the carbon content increased from 72 90 to 81 98 whereas the nitrogen and oxygen content decreased from 4 26 to 22 86 1 14 and 16 88 respectively this result indicated that the increase of pyrolysis temperature increased the degree of the carbonization chen et al 2012 chun et al 2004 losses in nitrogen and oxygen content at higher pyrolysis temperature should be attributed to the cracking of corresponding weak bonds within the biochar structure demirbas 2004 kim et al 2012 the mean peak of the c1s spectra of all the biochar samples at the binding energy of 284 5 ev was due to graphitic carbon and the gradual increase of this peak with higher temperature indicated the content increase of the graphitic carbon structure fig s2 the broad peak around the binding energy of 290 ev may be derived from many structures including carbon present in quinone groups 287 4 ev nitrogen containing groups 288 7 ev the π π shake up satellite 290 4 ev lee et al 2001 swiatkowski et al 2004 the mean peak of the o1s spectra fig s3 with a binding energy of about 533 ev can be ascribed to o h c o c and c n o moieties in some surface oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups kapteijn et al 1999 pakula et al 2002 swiatkowski et al 2002 ftir spectra of the biochars fig 3b revealed their chemical bond structure on the surface of the biochar these spectra are similar to those reported of other carbons derived from a wide variety of sources burg et al 2002 gomezserrano et al 1994 moreno castilla et al 1998 moreover the band at 1032 cm 1 was also observed to gradually decrease with higher temperature indicating carboxylate groups on the surface were also gradually reduced aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds are also confirmed by c h wagging vibrations in the region between 800 and 600 cm 1 the intensity of these peaks decreases with higher treated temperatures which indicates stability of the aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds and possible cyclisation of the biochar were destroyed hossain et al 2011 the same reduction trend was also observed for c n c bending vibration at 1544 cm 1 and the c o stretching vibration located at 1620 cm 1 chun et al 2004 zeta potential variation with the pyrolysis temperature was shown in table 1 with the pyrolysis temperature increased from 700 c to 900 c the zeta potential increased from 17 4 10 55 mv however when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 1000 and 1100 the zeta potential decreased to 7 15 mv biochar 1000 and 3 09 mv biochar 1100 the zeta potential variation of the biochar may be influenced by many factors including particle size and surface functional groups the ph variation of the biochar with the pyrolysis temperature table 1 showed the corresponding trend with the zeta potential variation the biochar 900 showed the lowest ph of 4 83 3 3 metabolism facilitation of biochar on the geobacter co cultures as previously reported g metallireducens can directly transfer electrons to g sulfurreducens in a defined medium with ethanol as electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor summers et al 2010 biochar was reported to be able to accelerate the diet process between g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens chen et al 2014b however the feasibility of facilitating the diet by activated sludge derived biochar has not been investigated before thus firstly biochar 700 was chosen to test its possibility of promoting metabolism of the geobactor co culture as showed in fig 4 a and b the result showed that the biochar 700 addition accelerated the ethanol metabolism with a coincident accumulation of succinate without biochar addition the amounts of ethanol oxidation and succinate production were slightly low over the experiment period the facilitating effect of the biochar increased with more biochar 700 addition the corresponding ethanol metabolism rates re and succinate production rates rs during the linear phase of metabolism in the co cultures were listed in table 3 the re and rs gradually increased from 0 11 0 03 mm d 1 and 0 66 0 01 mm d 1 control to 0 23 0 05 mm d 1 and 2 37 0 18 mm d 1 2 g l 1 biochar 700 the results indicated that biochar can effectively facilitate the syntrophic growth of geobacter co cultures the total biomass concentration was gradually increased with higher biochar 700 dosage fig 4c the biomass of the co culture with biochar 700 dosage of 2 0 g l 1 was 22 36 mg l 1 which was 2 94 fold higher than without biochar 5 68 mg l 1 more biochar addition can induce the faster metabolism of the co cultures cells in the co cultures exist in one of two types planktonic freely existing in solution and sessile attached to the surface of the biochar garrett et al 2008 it was also observed that the ratio of the biomass on the biochar surface to the total biomass increased with the dosage increasing fig 4d for the co culture with biochar 700 dosage 71 54 of the cells were found on the surface of the biochar of 2 0 g l 1 dosage while only 56 11 of the cells attached on the biochar surface of 0 5 g l 1 therefore the majority of biomass in co cultures was attached to the surface of the biochar which facilitated iet in the two geobacter co cultures as showed in fig 5 the co culture metabolism with biochar of different pyrolysis temperature showed different metabolism rate it exhibited the lowest metabolism rate in co cultures without biochar addition and the rs was just 0 48 0 05 mm d 1 table 4 while the biochar addition greatly promoted the metabolism rate of the co cultures the addition of biochar 700 biochar 800 and biochar 900 showed the metabolism rates at the same level the re and rs analysis showed that the co culture with biochar 800 exhibited the highest metabolism rate with re and rs being 0 16 0 04 mm d 1 and 1 15 0 06 mm d 1 respectively the re and rs of co culture with biochar 800 were 1 05 and 1 42 times higher than without condition re 0 08 0 01 mm d 1 rs 0 48 0 05 mm d 1 however the facilitating effect of biochar reduced with higher pyrolysis temperature the re and rs of the co cultures with biochar 1000 were 0 11 0 03 mm d 1and 0 89 0 04 mm d 1 which were 0 35 and 0 87 times higher than without addition the re and rs of the co cultures with biochar 1100 were 0 09 0 01 mm d 1 and 0 69 0 05 mm d 1 which were just 0 10 and 0 44 time higher than without addition the protein concentration test showed that the biochar addition with different pyrolysis temperature all promoted the co culture growth fig 5c the total protein concentrations with the addition of biochar 700 biochar 800 biochar 900 biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 were 21 39 mg l 1 21 53 mg l 1 22 37 mg l 1 19 10 mg l 1 and 17 99 mg l 1 which were 1 07 1 08 1 16 0 84 and 0 73 times higher than without addition 10 34 mg l 1 however the cells in the solution were greatly reduced with the biochar addition which may be due to the adhesion of the cells on the biochar surface the cells in the co culture solution with biochar 700 biochar 800 and biochar 900 were 2 36 mg l 1 0 90 mg l 1 and 0 28 mg l 1 which were just 22 82 9 48 and 2 71 of the control one the ratio of the cells on the biochar surface to the total cells increased with the pyrolysis temperature increased from 700 to 900 c with the ratio increasing from 66 86 biochar 700 and 87 41 biochar 800 to 96 27 biochar 900 fig 5d however this ratio decreased with higher pyrolysis temperatures was applied the ratio with the addition of biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 slightly decreased to 96 07 and 92 40 the slight decrease of this ratio should be attributed to the more negative surface potential and less surface functional groups 4 discussion previous studies reported that the material s conductivity played an important role in its facilitating effect on the diet process in natural environments kato et al 2010 li et al 2015a biochar was reported to be able to accelerate the iet process between geobacter species with electrons likely transferred through the biochar in laboratory experiments chen et al 2014b another study suggests that biochar can influence soil biogeochemistry by directly mediating electron transfer processes i e by functioning as an electron shuttle between bacteria and fe ⅲ minerals kappler et al 2014 otherwise a non conductive material glass beads did not promote diet under similar conditions liu et al 2012 however in this study the facilitating effect of co culture metabolism did not increase with the conductivity the correlation is negative with the succinate production rate and biochar conductivity fig 6 a it is generally known that a higher pyrolysis temperature of the biochar would result in a greater degree of carbonization and higher conductivity gabhi et al 2017 as shown in fig 6b the conductivity of the biochar had a negative correlation with o content of the biochar r2 0 88 the co culture with biochar 700 biochar 800 and biochar 900 exhibited similar metabolism rates however the conductivity of biochar 800 and biochar 900 are 50 84 and 212 80 times higher than that of biochar 700 indicating that the conductivity of the biochar is not the critical factor for promoting the co culture metabolism in this study although the conductivity of the biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 were greatly higher than that of the others the metabolism facilitation effect of biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 were even lower than the other biochar is a complex material with properties other than conductivity chen et al 2014b thus besides the conductivity other properties of the biochar should also play important roles in the facilitating effect on the co culture metabolism in previous studies activated carbon van der zee et al 2003 and solid humic substances roden et al 2010 were reported to have the electron accepting function quinone moieties phenolic moieties and arene rings in biochar are the possible redox active moieties responsible for its electron accepting ability kluepfel et al 2014 peiris et al 2017 tong et al 2014 the biochar with lower pyrolysis temperature has a higher content of the redox active moieties which may participate in the electron transfer process the biochar in the reductive forms may further serve as an electron donor for other microorganisms the charging and discharging cycles of biochar surface functional groups have been shown to reversibly accept and donate electrons klupfel et al 2014 lovley et al 1996 the direct electron transfer across the interface of biochar matrices and external electron donors and acceptors is different from the established electron transfer through carbon matrices due to electrical conductivity xu et al 2013 in a recent study it was reported that besides the direct electron transfer through the biochar the electron transfer through the charging and discharging cycles of the surface functional groups had been proposed to play important roles in the electron transfer process of the biochar sun et al 2017 it has been demonstrated that the biochar with o c ratio of less than 0 09 can transfer electrons by the charging and discharging cycles of the surface functional groups about one third of the direct electron transfer by conductivity in this study the o c ratios of all the biochar were much higher than 0 09 table 2 indicating that the surface functional groups may play a major role in the electron transfer through the biochar and this analysis could explain the phenomenon that the great improvement of the biochar conductivity with higher pyrolysis temperature did not promote the accelerating effect of biochar on diet process the surface functional groups were decreased with higher pyrolysis temperature which can explain the phenomenon that the facilitating effect of biochar 1000 and biochar 1100 was lower there was a high positive correlation r2 0 90 between the succinate production rate and the o content of the biochar in fig 6c indicating that the oxygenic functional groups may deeply participate into the facilitating effect of biochar the previously reported redox moieties including quinone moieties and phenolic moieties are oxygenic functional groups however the weak relevance between the succinate production rate and the n content of the biochar fig 6d r2 0 40 implied low engagement of the nitrogen containing structures in the electron transfer accelerating process to demonstrate the potential of biochar to function as electron donor and acceptor the pure culture experiments were carried out pure culture of g metallireducens gs 15 was added in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with the biochars of different pyrolysis temperature obvious ethanol consumption was observed in the culture with biochars and the pure culture with biochar 700 exhibited the highest ethanol consumption rate fig 7 a similarly pure culture of g sulfurreducens pca was added in strictly anaerobic nbf medium with the biochars as shown in fig 7b the obvious succinate production was detected in the cultures with biochars in which the succinate concentration increased over time the succinate production rate with biochar 700 addition was much higher than that with other biochars table s1 the result of ethanol adsorption experiment showed that the ethanol concentration did not decreased over time fig s4 indicating that the biochar adsorption effect can be neglected these results proved that the biochars can accept electrons from g metallireducens gs 15 and transfer electrons to g sulfurreducens pca the meo results showed that the edcs decreased with the pyrolysis temperature fig s5 an obvious positive linear relationship r2 0 9558 between edcs and succinate production rates was observed in the experiment of pure cultures g sulfurreducens pca with biochars fig 7c this result further proved that the succinate production rates were mainly determined by the edcs of the biochars the mer results fig s6 also showed that the eacs decreased with the pyrolysis temperature there is a slightly positive linear relationship between eacs and the ethanol metabolism rates in the experiment of pure cultures g metallireducens gs 15 with biochars fig 8 d indicating that other properties of biochars may also influence the electron transfer process from g metallireducens gs 15 to biochars theoretically the eec should have a positive linear relationship with the oxygen containing redox moieties content in this experiment the eecs of the biochars increased with the o contents of the biochars however no obvious linear relationship was found fig s7a indicating that more complicated relationship between eecs and o content of the biochars should exist otherwise no obvious linear relationship was observed between rs co culture and the eec fig s7b thus it was believed that besides the electron transfer property of the biochar other properties may also influence the stimulatory effect on the co culture metabolism the adhesion of microorganisms on a surface was also an important process for the bacteria metabolism and can be divided into three stages 1 reversible adhesion on the surface due to long range forces 2 consolidation between microorganisms and the surface 3 colonization and growth of organisms on the surface and the surface physical and chemical properties including surface charge and chemical functionalities dominate the initial attachment of the cells garrett et al 2008 rattier et al 1997 the surface charge of the samples was determined by measuring the zeta potential ζ of the biochar the surface of charcoals biochar activated carbon is often negatively charged which makes them unlikely to adsorb negatively charged bacteria yao et al 2011 biochar 900 10 55 1 52 mv has the most positive surface charge which could benefit the initial attachment of cells on the biochar surface the surface charge of biochar 700 17 4 0 70 mv was negatively charged inhibiting the initial attachment of cells while the surface charge of biochar 800 6 39 2 07 mv was between biochar 700 and biochar 900 as shown in fig 8a there was a positive correlation r2 0 73 between the cell attachment ratio and the zeta potential of the biochar confirming that the surface charge could actually influence the bacteria adhesion on biochar surface however unlike the o element content there is no obvious linear relationship between rs and zeta potential fig 8b indicating that the surface charge may just partially influence the co culture metabolism combined with the content variation of the surface functional group the zeta potential variation from biochar 700 to biochar 900 may help to explain the observed facilitating effect on the co culture metabolism the zeta potentials of biochar 1000 7 15 0 88 mv and biochar 1100 3 09 1 19 mv decreased again with higher pyrolysis temperature which can also help to explain the lower facilitating effect otherwise the surface porosity gradually increased from biochar 700 to biochar 1000 which may also enhance the cell attachment on the surface and promote the electron exchange between biochar and cells 5 conclusion overall the result showed that the biochar derived from activated sludge promoted the metabolism process of the co cultures higher dosage of the biochar can induce much faster metabolism and the biochar with different pyrolysis temperatures all promoted the co culture metabolism however the conductivity did not play a decisive role in the facilitating effect which did not increase with the higher pyrolysis temperature beside conductivity the electron transfer depending on the charging and discharging cycles of the surface functional groups played a major role in the electron transfer process through the biochar otherwise the biochar surface charge and porosity may also influence the adhesion of cells on the biochar surface and the accelerating effect of biochar on diet process this study could provide a better understanding of the biochar effect on the diet process and promote the application of biochar in

of chlorine in a multiple barrier disinfection system is also important chlorine residuals from the pre oxidation process in the multiple barrier disinfection system will absorb uv light and decrease the uv disinfection efficiency by competing photons that are intended for inactivating chlorine resistant pathogens e g cryptosporidium and giardia kashinkunti et al 2004 örmeci et al 2005 forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 therefore the photo dechlorination can enhance the overall disinfection efficiency of a multiple barrier disinfection system kashinkunti et al 2004 a better understanding of the chlorine photodecay could prevent the swimmers or citizens from exposure to chlorine ordinated contaminants and help design and implement a better multiple barrier disinfection system uv c can also activate chemical oxidants including peroxide and chlorine to produce radical species for the destruction of organic contaminants the uv peroxide advanced oxidation process aop which produces hydroxyl radicals ho through photolysis of peroxide at 254 nm using conventional uv mercury lamps is a common strategy for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse rosenfeldt and linden 2007 however the process is often hindered by its high energy demand due to low absorbance and low quantum yields of peroxide at 254 nm as well as the presence of ho scavengers e g natural organic matter and bicarbonate in real water he et al 2012 wang et al 2000 the uv chlorine aop based on the photolysis of free chlorine using conventional uv mercury lamps low pressure and medium pressure uv lamps is an alternative to the uv peroxide aop for degrading micropollutants in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse jin et al 2011 remucal and manley 2016 deng et al 2014 dotson et al 2012 it produces a more diverse spectrum of reactive species including reactive oxygen species e g ozone and ho and reactive chlorine species rcs which complement each other in the contaminant degradation fang et al 2014 remucal and manley 2016 sun et al 2016 watts and linden 2007 yang et al 2016 it is also more energy efficient and gives higher ho yields than the uv peroxide aop at ph 6 7 due to the higher molar absorbance and quantum yields of hypochlorous acid hocl compared to hydrogen peroxide stefan 2017 fang et al 2014 yin et al 2018 one drawback of the uv based dechlorination and aops is the use of uv mercury lamps low pressure medium pressure and high pressure uv lamps conventional uv mercury lamps have short lifespans contain toxic mercury and are fragile and oversized song et al 2016 uv light emitting diodes uv leds which are mercury free robust compact and can turn on and off instantly are potential alternatives and regarded as promising uv light sources chen et al 2017 würtele et al 2011 by 2020 the wall plug efficiency and lifetimes of uv leds are predicted to increase to more than 75 and 20 000 h respectively with a price drop by 40 song et al 2016 more interestingly uv leds provide versatility in emitting light at any designated wavelength for example uv leds make it possible to provide uv c light at 200 300 nm muramoto et al 2014 and at this moment uvc leds at 255 265 and 285 nm are commonly available in the market chen et al 2017 muramoto et al 2014 we anticipate that such versatility facilitates easy matching of their emission spectra with the absorption and or quantum yield maxima of free chlorine to enhance its photo reaction however this hypothesis has not been verified and the fundamentals of this wavelength overlap phenomenon with respect to chlorine photo reaction have not yet been established hocl and ocl have wide absorption spectra that peak at 235 nm and 292 nm with molar absorption coefficients of 101 m 1 cm 1 and 365 m 1 cm 1 respectively feng et al 2007 however due to the limited availability of uv light sources the chlorine photolysis and their quantum yields have only been examined at the wavelengths of 254 nm uv c 303 313 nm uv b 355 365 nm uv a and 200 400 nm mpuv buxton et al 1988 remucal and manley 2016 stefan 2017 these wavelengths can hardly match the highest absorption spectra of free chlorine to unleash the highest rate of the chlorine photolysis none of these wavelengths matches the wavelengths of uvc leds which are more energy efficient with increasing wavelength from 255 to 285 nm in the present market moreover there has not been any protocol model established to predict the chlorine photolysis at different wavelengths not to mention to select appropriate wavelengths of uv light for chlorine photolysis the knowledge gap also exists in the wavelength dependency on the production of reactive species from chlorine photolysis and its relationship with the chlorine photodecay the chlorine photolysis produces ho and cl at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm but information on the ho yield is only available at 254 303 313 nm uv b and 200 400 nm mpuv remucal and manley 2016 stefan 2017 and the wavelength dependency on the formation of reactive chlorine species e g cl clo and cl2 remains unknown this study investigated the wavelength dependency on chlorine photolysis and the subsequent radical generation at four different wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm using uv leds as light sources the molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields of both hocl and ocl at the four wavelengths were obtained and used to establish an empirical model to predict the fluence based chlorine photodecay rates at wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm and phs from 5 to 10 the model was then validated against the experimental results at the four wavelengths and phs 6 and 7 the wavelength dependency on the formation of reactive radical species from chlorine photolysis at the four wavelengths and two phs i e phs 6 and 7 were also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials reagent grade chemicals including sodium hypochlorite solution 4 0

further purification their stock solutions were prepared using deionized water 18 2 mω cm prepared by a nanopure water system barnstead 2 2 uv exposure uv exposure was carried out using quasi collimated uv led devices pearlbeam aquisense technologies that allow selection of one monochromatic light from four wavelengths at 257 7 255 268 265 282 3 285 and 301 2 300 nm and their emission spectra are shown in fig 1 the values in the brackets are provided by the manufacture which are close to the real peak emission wavelengths figure s2 shows the schematic of the uv led setup where a rapid mixed batch glass reactor 5 ml containing reacting solution 1 0 cm in depth was placed below the led source and covered with a quartz sheet to prevent evaporation the distance of the uv leds to the solution surface was 7 05 cm the incident fluence rates e0 of the uv leds were measured at the surface of the reaction solution using a radiometer ilt 2400 with a detector sed 270 typically designed for uv leds with emission spectral range of 215 355 nm which was supplied by the international light technology and calibrated using a conventional potassium ferrioxalate actinometer the values measured by the radiometer represent the integrated fluence rates under the emission spectra of the uv leds and are shown in table s1 2 3 experimental procedures a testing solution of 5 ml was buffered at a particular ph 5 mm phosphate or borate buffer spiked with a naocl stock solution to give an initial chlorine concentration of 100 μm 7 1 mg l 1 as cl2 and then exposed to monochromatic uv led light at one of the four wavelengths each time the ph values remained the same before and after the reactions neither phosphate nor borate has significantly impacts on the ho or reactive chlorine species concentrations buxton and subhani 1972 wang et al 2016 carbonate bicarbonate did not affects the concentrations of ho clo or cl2 but it may react with cl to form carbonate radicals which will not contribute the degradation of probe compounds wu et al 2017 guo et al 2017 samples were collected at pre determined time intervals and subjected to the measurement of residual chlorine concentrations tests were also conducted in a similar manner with 10 μm cbz and nb coexisting as probing compounds to investigate the wavelength dependency on radical generation samples were collected quenched with freshly prepared sodium sulfite at a sulfite to chlorine molar ratio of 1 5 1 and subjected to the determination of remaining cbz and nb concentrations 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of free chlorine were determined by the dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 1998 the concentrations of nb and cbz were determined using an ultra performance liquid chromatograph uplc vp series shimadzu equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column and a uv vis detector eluents of water ph 3 adjusted using phosphoric acid and methanol 55 45 v v were used to separate the nb and cbz at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the uv vis absorption spectra of chlorine containing solutions at different phs were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer inc usa with a quartz

correlations between a chlorine photodecay rates and molar absorption coefficients and b chlorine photodecay rates and apparent quantum yields were evaluated by spearman equations on origin 8 0 software a spearman correlation coefficient p value of 1 or 1 represents that the selected two tested parameters are perfectly positive or negative monotonic functions to each other respectively a linear correlation function was used to examine the dependency of chlorine photodecay rates on molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields by spss version 19 0 spss inc usa and higher standardized coefficients β indicate a greater effect of the independent variables have on the dependent variable the mathematical model was constructed by matlab mathworks and the codes are shown in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorine photodecay rates and their dependency on molar absorption coefficients fig 2 shows the fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay at the four wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm and two phs i e 5 and 10 these two phs are used to obtain the dominant over 99 species of hocl and ocl respectively because hocl has an acid dissociation constant pka of 7 5 morris 1966 at ph 5 the fluence based rate constants at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm were 2 83 10 5 1 76 10 5 1 42 10 5 and 1 41 10 5 m2 j 1 respectively the fluence based rate constants of hocl photodecay k h o c l decrease by 49 8 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 282 3 nm and the value at 301 2 nm is comparable to that at 283 2 nm on the contrary at ph 10 the fluence based rate constants of ocl photodecay k o c l increase with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm 4 13 10 5 8 77 10 5 1 36 10 4 and 1 41 10 4 m2 j 1 at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm respectively and increase by 3 4 times with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm the longer wavelength is found to be more efficient for chlorine photodecay at ph 10 though the uv light at shorter wavelengths is considered to have higher energy according to the grotthuss draper law we anticipated that the observed wavelength dependent photodecay rates were partially attributed to the light absorption of the chlorine containing solution e g hocl and ocl turro 1965 wu et al 2017 table 1 shows the molar absorption coefficients ε λ of hocl and ocl which are obtained from the absorption spectra figure s3 with the increasing wavelength of uv led from 257 7 to 301 2 nm ε h o c l decreases from 48 35 1 22 to 25 21 0 90 m 1 cm 1 while ε o c l increases from 83 32 1 07 m 1 cm 1 to 316 35 1 12 ε h o c l and ε o c l are both positively correlated with the fluence based rate constants of hocl and ocl respectively p 1 p 2 1 figure s4 supporting that the wavelength dependency on the chlorine photodecay is partially attributed to the wavelength dependent ε h o c l and ε o c l 3 2 dependency of chlorine photodecay rates on apparent quantum yields table 2 shows the apparent quantum yields of chlorine photodecay at the four wavelengths and phs 5 and 10 calculated using eqs 1 3 at ph 5 the apparent quantum yields of hocl photodecay were 1 18 0 01 1 11 0 03 0 98 0 02 and 0 96 0 03 mol einstein 1 at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm respectively and decreased by 18 6 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at ph 10 the apparent quantum yields of ocl photodecay were 1 00 0 03 0 97 0 01 0 82 0 02 and 0 77 0 03 mol einstein 1 at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm respectively and decreased by 23 0 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm no apparent quantum yields of hocl and ocl at the tested four wavelengths have been reported in the literature while the decreasing tendency in quantum yields with increasing wavelengths is similar to that of the hocl ocl photodecay at 240 253 7 and 280 4 nm using xenon mercury lamps cooper et al 2007 the apparent quantum yields of hocl are positively correlated with the fluence based rate constants p 4 1 figure s5 suggesting that the wavelength dependency on the hocl photodecay was partially attributed to the wavelength dependent apparent quantum yields nevertheless the apparent quantum yields of ocl are negatively correlated with the fluence based rate constants p 5 1 figure s5 indicating that it was the molar absorption coefficient but not the apparent quantum yield resulted in the wavelength dependency on ocl photodecay a more quantitative analysis of the dependency of k λ p h on ε λ p h and φ λ p h at the four wavelengths and phs 5 and 10 was conducted using the linear correlation function in spss table s2 the standardized coefficient β between k λ and the ε λ β k λ ε λ 0 949 is 17 times higher than that between k λ and φ λ β k λ φ λ 0 055 considering all eight conditions at the four wavelengths and phs 5 and 10 further proving that the molar absorption coefficient instead of the apparent quantum yield is the major contributor to the wavelength dependent fluence based chlorine photodecay rate constants at the tested wavelengths and phs supplementary tests were conducted to determine the photodecay rates of hocl and ocl in the presence of acetate 5 mm whose concentration is 50 times as high as that of the free chlorine to differentiate the quantum yields of the chlorine photodecay by the direct uv photolysis or subsequent radical reactions results are shown in figure s3 acetate reacts rapidly with ho k 7 50 107 m 1 s 1 and cl k 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 without absorbing uv light at the tested wavelengths more importantly both acetate and its daughter radicals generated from the reactions between acetate and ho and cl react slowly with free chlorine hocl or ocl chuang et al 2017 in the presence of acetate the calculated quantum yields of the hocl and ocl photodecay decreased at all tested wavelengths table 2 but the decrease of the calculated quantum yields of the hocl photodecay is more significant than that of the ocl photodecay the calculated quantum yields of the hocl photodecay does not change significantly with increasing hocl concentrations 3 55 14 2 mg l 1 as cl2 figure s4a but that of the ocl photodecay decreases significantly with increasing ocl concentrations 3 55 14 2 mg l 1 as cl2 figure s4b the results indicate that the radical scavenging by acetate can isolate the innate quantum yields of the hocl photodecay but is not effective for the ocl photodecay probably due to the 25 fold lower reaction rate between ho and acetate 7 50 107 m 1 s 1 than that between ho and ocl 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 chuang et al 2017 the true quantum yields of hocl and ocl photodecay at 257 nm obtained in this study were 1 13 and 1 18 times as high as those reported by chuang et al 2017 which was probably due to the incomplete radical scavenging of ho by acetate because the second order rate constant between ho and acetate k 7 50 107 m 1 s 1 is lower than those between hocl k 5 108 m 1 s 1 and ocl k 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 resulting in the residual radicals contributing to the decomposition of hocl and ocl chuang et al 2017 moreover it is speculated that the acetate daughter radicals still partially contributed to the free chlorine decomposition especially for hocl and resulted in the overestimation of the quantum yields of chlorine photodecay compared to the values reported by chuang et al 2017 by mathematical modelling ϕhocl 0 62 and ϕocl 0 55 the differences between the apparent and true quantum yields indicated that the direct uv photolysis reactions with other reactive species contributed 72 0 28 0 68 5 31 5 66 3 33 7 and 62 5 37 5 respectively to hocl photodecay at 255 265 285 and 300 nm and for ocl direct uv photolysis contributed 91 0 9 0 89 7 10 3 93 9 6 1 and 93 5 6 5 respectively at 255 265 285 and 300 nm 3 3 modelling of the chlorine photodecay rates an empirical model that incorporated ε λ p h φ λ p h and u λ was then established to predict the k λ p h at wavelengths from 257 7 to 301 2 nm and phs from 5 to 10 using eq 4 and matlab 4 k λ p h l n 10 φ λ p h ε λ p h 10 u λ where uλ h c n a λ and h is the planck constant 6 6 260 690 10 34 j s c is the speed of light 2 9 972 458 108 m s 1

obtained from fig 1 the φ λ p h of hocl and ocl at wavelengths from 257 7 to 301 2 nm were modelled empirically by fitting the experimental data obtained from table 2 to two equations fig 3 cooper et al 2007 9 φ h o c l 5 2556 10 3 λ 2 5149 r 2 0 886 10 φ o c l 5 7346 10 3 λ 2 4802 r 2 0 928 the incorporated model was validated against the experimental results of chlorine photodecay at the four tested wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm and three environmentally relevant phs i e phs 6 7 and 8 as shown in fig 4 the predicted fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay shown by the lines are in reasonable good agreement with the experimental results shown by the dots at phs 6 7 and 8 the difference is within 10 fig 5 displays the modelling results of the wavelength and ph dependency on the chlorine photodecay rate the wavelength dependency is larger at alkaline ph than at acidic ph and the largest wavelength dependency occurs at the highest ph as for the ph dependency the chlorine photodecay rate constants increase with increasing phs at any wavelength and the ph dependency is the largest at the longest wavelength moreover the maximum fluence based rate constant 1 41 10 4 m2 j 1 obtained from the model is at 292 nm and ph 9 95 and the minimum 1 09 10 5 m2 j 1 is obtained at 291 nm and ph 5 the results verify our hypothesis that the maximum photolysis rate is obtained near the maximum absorption of the oxidant precursor ocl which has a maximum absorption at 292 nm feng et al 2007 3 4 wavelength and ph dependency on radical formation from chlorine photolysis nitrobenzene nb and carbamazepine cbz were used as probes to quantify the ho and reactive chlorine species rcs generated from the chlorine photolysis at the four tested wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm and three environmentally relevant phs i e phs 6 7 and 8 nb exhibits high reactivity towards ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but hardly reacts with rcs buxton and subhani 1972 fang et al 2014 cbz reacts rapidly with ho k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 cl k 5 6 1010 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2016 and clo 0 92 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 also it has been reported in the literature that the steady state concentrations of cl clo and cl2 are in the order of 10 14 10 10 and 10 14 m in the uv chlorine process under the environmentally relevant conditions similar to the current study guo et al 2017 based on the information on the rate constants and the concentrations of the radical species the contribution of clo to cbz degradation in the uv chlorine process is thus around 2 magnitudes higher than that of cl and much higher than that of cl2 therefore clo was selected as the representative rcs and its second order rate constant was used to calculate the steady state concentration of rcs in this study such assumption may cause the overestimation of the steady state concentrations of clo and it was only recommended to be used to compare the wavelength and ph dependency on radical formation in this study in addition it should be noted that both nb and cbz are inert to direct uv led photolysis and dark chlorination in the time scale of the current study less than 5 as shown figure s7 therefore the nb and cbz degradation can be expressed by eqs 11 and 12 11 d c n b d t k h o n b h o s s c n b k o n b c n b 12 d c c b z d t k h o c b z h o s s c c b z k c l o c b z c l o s s c c b z k o c b z c c b z where k h o n b and k h o c b z are the second order rate constants of ho towards nb k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 and cbz k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively and k c l o c b z is the second order rate constant of clo towards cbz k 0 92 108 m 1 s 1 k o n b and k o c b z are the apparent pseudo first order rate constants of the nb and cbz degradation shown in figures s8 and s9 respectively h o s s and clo s s are the steady state concentrations of ho and clo respectively the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and clo clo ss were thus obtained and normalized with the fluence rates and are shown in fig 6 un normalized data are shown in figure s10 at ph 6 the fluence based ho ss decreased from 1 8 10 14 to 1 2 10 14 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm which decreased by 32 03 clo ss decreased also by 57 95 from 9 6 10 13 to 4 0 10 13 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm compared to ho clo decreased more significantly with increasing the wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at ph 6 nonetheless at phs 7 the fluence based ho ss increased from 9 1 10 15 to 1 2 10 14 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm which increased by 30 43 and the clo ss also increased by 32 80 from 1 2 10 12 to 1 7 10 12 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at ph 8 the fluence based ho ss and clo ss increased by 57 02 and 58 39 respectively with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm compared to the fluence based ho ss that of clo increased more significantly with increasing wavelengths from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at phs 7 and 8 these findings indicate that the formation of clo is more wavelength dependent than that of ho and the impact of wavelength on the ho and clo formation was more significant at ph 6 compared to those at phs 7 and 8 fig 5 also shows that at any wavelength tested the fluence based ho ss decrease with increasing phs mainly due to the faster scavenging rate of ho by ocl k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 than that by hocl k 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 and the higher ocl concentration at higher phs fang et al 2014 in contrast the fluence based clo ss increase with increasing phs at any wavelength tested due to the weaker scavenging effect of ocl than hocl towards clo and the increasing formation of clo from the scavenging of ho by ocl at higher phs guo et al 2017 at higher phs the formation of higher clo ss offset the scavenging of ho for the cbz degradation in the process resulting in the higher apparent rate constants of the cbz degradation in addition the fluence based ho ss and clo ss show positive correlation p 6 p 7 p 8 p 9 1 with the fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay figure s11 indicating that the radical formation exhibited a similar wavelength dependency to the chlorine photodecay the wavelength and ph dependency on the formation of other rcs e g cl and cl2 and the relationship between the radical yield and the chlorine photodecay will be further investigated in the future 4 conclusions the photodecay rates of hocl and ocl were highly wavelength dependent mainly due to the wavelength dependent molar absorption coefficients instead of quantum yields as predicted by the empirical model the wavelength dependency is larger at alkaline ph than at acidic ph and the largest wavelength dependency occurs at the highest ph as for the ph dependency the chlorine photodecay rate constants all increase with increasing ph at any wavelength and the ph dependency is the largest at the longest wavelength the modelled results help us better select uv leds at different wavelengths for chlorine photodecay and micropollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop based on the ph condition of the target water uv light at longer wavelength is more suitable for photo dechlorination of chlorine in swimming pools and pollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop in water e g secondary effluents and surface water at neutral and alkaline ph the wall plug efficiency of uv led at high wavelength e g 301 2 nm is predicted to reach 75 by 2020 song et al 2016 which makes it a promising alternative to the conventional uv mercury lamps for chlorine photodecay and micro pollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop in the near future at neutral and alkaline ph on the other hand the uv light at shorter wavelength is more suitable for the chlorine photodecay and micropollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop in water at acidic ph e g 6 5 in these cases conventional uv mercury lamps still perform better than uv led at low wavelength e g 257 7 nm since the wall plug efficiency of uv led at 257 7 nm will unlikely be significantly improved enough to compete with the conventional lamps in the foreseeable future acknowledgements this work was

19486,uv leds are considered as the most promising uv light sources because it has the potential to replace conventional uv lamps in some water treatment applications in the foreseeable future in this study uv leds at four wavelengths in the uv c or near uv c range i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm were used to investigate the wavelength dependency on chlorine photolysis and its subsequent radical formation the fluence based photodecay rates of hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ocl were monotonically correlated to their molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields and the chlorine photodecay rates were much more significantly affected by molar absorption coefficients β 0 949 than quantum yields β 0 055 an empirical model that incorporated the chlorine photodecay rate constants quantum yields and molar absorption coefficients of hocl and ocl was established validated and then used to predict the chlorine photodecay rate at any wavelength 257 7 301 2 nm and ph 5 10 the modelling results suggested that the maximum fluence based rate constant 1 46 10 4 m2 j 1 was obtained at 289 7 nm and ph 9 95 the wavelength dependency was larger at alkaline ph than at acidic ph and the ph dependency was the largest at the longest wavelength the formation of hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs decreased with increasing wavelength at ph 6 and increased with increasing wavelength at ph 7 more ho was formed at ph 6 than ph 7 but rcs showed the opposite ph dependency the findings in this study provide the fundamental information in selecting uv leds with specific wavelength for enhancing optimizing chlorine photodecay and or its radical generation at different phs in real world applications keywords uv led wavelength dependency chlorine photodecay

also activate chemical oxidants including peroxide and chlorine to produce radical species for the destruction of organic contaminants the uv peroxide advanced oxidation process aop which produces hydroxyl radicals ho through photolysis of peroxide at 254 nm using conventional uv mercury lamps is a common strategy for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse rosenfeldt and linden 2007 however the process is often hindered by its high energy demand due to low absorbance and low quantum yields of peroxide at 254 nm as well as the presence of ho scavengers e g natural organic matter and bicarbonate in real water he et al 2012 wang et al 2000 the uv chlorine aop based on the photolysis of free chlorine using conventional uv mercury lamps low pressure and medium pressure uv lamps is an alternative to the uv peroxide aop for degrading micropollutants in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse jin et al 2011 remucal and manley 2016 deng et al 2014 dotson et al 2012 it produces a more diverse spectrum of reactive species including reactive oxygen species e g ozone and ho and reactive chlorine species rcs which complement each other in the contaminant degradation fang et al 2014 remucal and manley 2016 sun et al 2016 watts and linden 2007 yang et al 2016 it is also more energy efficient and gives higher ho yields than the uv peroxide aop at ph 6 7 due to the higher molar absorbance and quantum yields of hypochlorous acid hocl compared to hydrogen peroxide stefan 2017 fang et al 2014 yin et al 2018 one drawback of the uv based dechlorination and aops is the use of uv mercury lamps low pressure medium pressure and high pressure uv lamps conventional uv mercury lamps have short lifespans contain toxic mercury and are fragile and oversized song et al 2016 uv light emitting diodes uv leds which are mercury free robust compact and can turn on and off instantly are potential alternatives and regarded as promising uv light sources chen et al 2017 würtele et al 2011 by 2020 the wall plug efficiency and lifetimes of uv leds are predicted to increase to more than 75 and 20 000 h respectively with a price drop by 40 song et al 2016 more interestingly uv leds provide versatility in emitting light at any designated wavelength for example uv leds make it possible to provide uv c light at 200 300 nm muramoto et al 2014 and at this moment uvc leds at 255 265 and 285 nm are commonly available in the market chen et al 2017 muramoto et al 2014 we anticipate that such versatility facilitates easy matching of their emission spectra with the absorption and or quantum yield maxima of free chlorine to enhance its photo reaction however this hypothesis has not been verified and the fundamentals of this wavelength overlap phenomenon with respect to chlorine photo reaction have not yet been established hocl and ocl have wide absorption spectra that peak at 235 nm and 292 nm with molar absorption coefficients of 101 m 1 cm 1 and 365 m 1 cm 1 respectively feng et al 2007 however due to the limited availability of uv light sources the chlorine photolysis and their quantum yields have only been examined at the wavelengths of 254 nm uv c 303 313 nm uv b 355 365 nm uv a and 200 400 nm mpuv buxton et al 1988 remucal and manley 2016 stefan 2017 these wavelengths can hardly match the highest absorption spectra of free chlorine to unleash the highest rate of the chlorine photolysis none of these wavelengths matches the wavelengths of uvc leds which are more energy efficient with increasing wavelength from 255 to 285 nm in the present market moreover there has not been any protocol model established to predict the chlorine photolysis at different wavelengths not to mention to select appropriate wavelengths of uv light for chlorine photolysis the knowledge gap also exists in the wavelength dependency on the production of reactive species from chlorine photolysis and its relationship with the chlorine photodecay the chlorine photolysis produces ho and cl at wavelengths shorter than 300 nm but information on the ho yield is only available at 254 303 313 nm uv b and 200 400 nm mpuv remucal and manley 2016 stefan 2017 and the wavelength dependency on the formation of reactive chlorine species e g cl clo and cl2 remains unknown this study investigated the wavelength dependency on chlorine photolysis and the subsequent radical generation at four different wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm using uv leds as light sources the molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields of both hocl and ocl at the four wavelengths were obtained and used to establish an empirical model to predict the fluence based chlorine photodecay rates at wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm and phs from 5 to 10 the model was then validated against the experimental results at the four wavelengths and phs 6 and 7 the wavelength dependency on the formation of reactive radical species from chlorine photolysis at the four wavelengths and two phs i e phs 6 and 7 were also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials reagent grade chemicals including sodium hypochlorite solution 4 0

collimated uv led devices pearlbeam aquisense technologies that allow selection of one monochromatic light from four wavelengths at 257 7 255 268 265 282 3 285 and 301 2 300 nm and their emission spectra are shown in fig 1 the values in the brackets are provided by the manufacture which are close to the real peak emission wavelengths figure s2 shows the schematic of the uv led setup where a rapid mixed batch glass reactor 5 ml containing reacting solution 1 0 cm in depth was placed below the led source and covered with a quartz sheet to prevent evaporation the distance of the uv leds to the solution surface was 7 05 cm the incident fluence rates e0 of the uv leds were measured at the surface of the reaction solution using a radiometer ilt 2400 with a detector sed 270 typically designed for uv leds with emission spectral range of 215 355 nm which was supplied by the international light technology and calibrated using a conventional potassium ferrioxalate actinometer the values measured by the radiometer represent the integrated fluence rates under the emission spectra of the uv leds and are shown in table s1 2 3 experimental procedures a testing solution of 5 ml was buffered at a particular ph 5 mm phosphate or borate buffer spiked with a naocl stock solution to give an initial chlorine concentration of 100 μm 7 1 mg l 1 as cl2 and then exposed to monochromatic uv led light at one of the four wavelengths each time the ph values remained the same before and after the reactions neither phosphate nor borate has significantly impacts on the ho or reactive chlorine species concentrations buxton and subhani 1972 wang et al 2016 carbonate bicarbonate did not affects the concentrations of ho clo or cl2 but it may react with cl to form carbonate radicals which will not contribute the degradation of probe compounds wu et al 2017 guo et al 2017 samples were collected at pre determined time intervals and subjected to the measurement of residual chlorine concentrations tests were also conducted in a similar manner with 10 μm cbz and nb coexisting as probing compounds to investigate the wavelength dependency on radical generation samples were collected quenched with freshly prepared sodium sulfite at a sulfite to chlorine molar ratio of 1 5 1 and subjected to the determination of remaining cbz and nb concentrations 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of free chlorine were determined by the dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 1998 the concentrations of nb and cbz were determined using an ultra performance liquid chromatograph uplc vp series shimadzu equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column and a uv vis detector eluents of water ph 3 adjusted using phosphoric acid and methanol 55 45 v v were used to separate the nb and cbz at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the uv vis absorption spectra of chlorine containing solutions at different phs were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer inc usa with a quartz

software a spearman correlation coefficient p value of 1 or 1 represents that the selected two tested parameters are perfectly positive or negative monotonic functions to each other respectively a linear correlation function was used to examine the dependency of chlorine photodecay rates on molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields by spss version 19 0 spss inc usa and higher standardized coefficients β indicate a greater effect of the independent variables have on the dependent variable the mathematical model was constructed by matlab mathworks and the codes are shown in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorine photodecay rates and their dependency on molar absorption coefficients fig 2 shows the fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay at the four wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm and two phs i e 5 and 10 these two phs are used to obtain the dominant over 99 species of hocl and ocl respectively because hocl has an acid dissociation constant pka of 7 5 morris 1966 at ph 5 the fluence based rate constants at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm were 2 83 10 5 1 76 10 5 1 42 10 5 and 1 41 10 5 m2 j 1 respectively the fluence based rate constants of hocl photodecay k h o c l decrease by 49 8 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 282 3 nm and the value at 301 2 nm is comparable to that at 283 2 nm on the contrary at ph 10 the fluence based rate constants of ocl photodecay k o c l increase with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm 4 13 10 5 8 77 10 5 1 36 10 4 and 1 41 10 4 m2 j 1 at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm respectively and increase by 3 4 times with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm the longer wavelength is found to be more efficient for chlorine photodecay at ph 10 though the uv light at shorter wavelengths is considered to have higher energy according to the grotthuss draper law we anticipated that the observed wavelength dependent photodecay rates were partially attributed to the light absorption of the chlorine containing solution e g hocl and ocl turro 1965 wu et al 2017 table 1 shows the molar absorption coefficients ε λ of hocl and ocl which are obtained from the absorption spectra figure s3 with the increasing wavelength of uv led from 257 7 to 301 2 nm ε h o c l decreases from 48 35 1 22 to 25 21 0 90 m 1 cm 1 while ε o c l increases from 83 32 1 07 m 1 cm 1 to 316 35 1 12 ε h o c l and ε o c l are both positively correlated with the fluence based rate constants of hocl and ocl respectively p 1 p 2 1 figure s4 supporting that the wavelength dependency on the chlorine photodecay is partially attributed to the wavelength dependent ε h o c l and ε o c l 3 2 dependency of chlorine photodecay rates on apparent quantum yields table 2 shows the apparent quantum yields of chlorine photodecay at the four wavelengths and phs 5 and 10 calculated using eqs 1 3 at ph 5 the apparent quantum yields of hocl photodecay were 1 18 0 01 1 11 0 03 0 98 0 02 and 0 96 0 03 mol einstein 1 at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm respectively and decreased by 18 6 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at ph 10 the apparent quantum yields of ocl photodecay were 1 00 0 03 0 97 0 01 0 82 0 02 and 0 77 0 03 mol einstein 1 at 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm respectively and decreased by 23 0 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm no apparent quantum yields of hocl and ocl at the tested four wavelengths have been reported in the literature while the decreasing tendency in quantum yields with increasing wavelengths is similar to that of the hocl ocl photodecay at 240 253 7 and 280 4 nm using xenon mercury lamps cooper et al 2007 the apparent quantum yields of hocl are positively correlated with the fluence based rate constants p 4 1 figure s5 suggesting that the wavelength dependency on the hocl photodecay was partially attributed to the wavelength dependent apparent quantum yields nevertheless the apparent quantum yields of ocl are negatively correlated with the fluence based rate constants p 5 1 figure s5 indicating that it was the molar absorption coefficient but not the apparent quantum yield resulted in the wavelength dependency on ocl photodecay a more quantitative analysis of the dependency of k λ p h on ε λ p h and φ λ p h at the four wavelengths and phs 5 and 10 was conducted using the linear correlation function in spss table s2 the standardized coefficient β between k λ and the ε λ β k λ ε λ 0 949 is 17 times higher than that between k λ and φ λ β k λ φ λ 0 055 considering all eight conditions at the four wavelengths and phs 5 and 10 further proving that the molar absorption coefficient instead of the apparent quantum yield is the major contributor to the wavelength dependent fluence based chlorine photodecay rate constants at the tested wavelengths and phs supplementary tests were conducted to determine the photodecay rates of hocl and ocl in the presence of acetate 5 mm whose concentration is 50 times as high as that of the free chlorine to differentiate the quantum yields of the chlorine photodecay by the direct uv photolysis or subsequent radical reactions results are shown in figure s3 acetate reacts rapidly with ho k 7 50 107 m 1 s 1 and cl k 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 without absorbing uv light at the tested wavelengths more importantly both acetate and its daughter radicals generated from the reactions between acetate and ho and cl react slowly with free chlorine hocl or ocl chuang et al 2017 in the presence of acetate the calculated quantum yields of the hocl and ocl photodecay decreased at all tested wavelengths table 2 but the decrease of the calculated quantum yields of the hocl photodecay is more significant than that of the ocl photodecay the calculated quantum yields of the hocl photodecay does not change significantly with increasing hocl concentrations 3 55 14 2 mg l 1 as cl2 figure s4a but that of the ocl photodecay decreases significantly with increasing ocl concentrations 3 55 14 2 mg l 1 as cl2 figure s4b the results indicate that the radical scavenging by acetate can isolate the innate quantum yields of the hocl photodecay but is not effective for the ocl photodecay probably due to the 25 fold lower reaction rate between ho and acetate 7 50 107 m 1 s 1 than that between ho and ocl 1 85 109 m 1 s 1 chuang et al 2017 the true quantum yields of hocl and ocl photodecay at 257 nm obtained in this study were 1 13 and 1 18 times as high as those reported by chuang et al 2017 which was probably due to the incomplete radical scavenging of ho by acetate because the second order rate constant between ho and acetate k 7 50 107 m 1 s 1 is lower than those between hocl k 5 108 m 1 s 1 and ocl k 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 resulting in the residual radicals contributing to the decomposition of hocl and ocl chuang et al 2017 moreover it is speculated that the acetate daughter radicals still partially contributed to the free chlorine decomposition especially for hocl and resulted in the overestimation of the quantum yields of chlorine photodecay compared to the values reported by chuang et al 2017 by mathematical modelling ϕhocl 0 62 and ϕocl 0 55 the differences between the apparent and true quantum yields indicated that the direct uv photolysis reactions with other reactive species contributed 72 0 28 0 68 5 31 5 66 3 33 7 and 62 5 37 5 respectively to hocl photodecay at 255 265 285 and 300 nm and for ocl direct uv photolysis contributed 91 0 9 0 89 7 10 3 93 9 6 1 and 93 5 6 5 respectively at 255 265 285 and 300 nm 3 3 modelling of the chlorine photodecay rates an empirical model that incorporated ε λ p h φ λ p h and u λ was then established to predict the k λ p h at wavelengths from 257 7 to 301 2 nm and phs from 5 to 10 using eq 4 and matlab 4 k λ p h l n 10 φ λ p h ε λ p h 10 u λ where uλ h c n a λ and h is the planck constant 6 6 260 690 10 34 j s c is the speed of light 2 9 972 458 108 m s 1

obtained from fig 1 the φ λ p h of hocl and ocl at wavelengths from 257 7 to 301 2 nm were modelled empirically by fitting the experimental data obtained from table 2 to two equations fig 3 cooper et al 2007 9 φ h o c l 5 2556 10 3 λ 2 5149 r 2 0 886 10 φ o c l 5 7346 10 3 λ 2 4802 r 2 0 928 the incorporated model was validated against the experimental results of chlorine photodecay at the four tested wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm and three environmentally relevant phs i e phs 6 7 and 8 as shown in fig 4 the predicted fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay shown by the lines are in reasonable good agreement with the experimental results shown by the dots at phs 6 7 and 8 the difference is within 10 fig 5 displays the modelling results of the wavelength and ph dependency on the chlorine photodecay rate the wavelength dependency is larger at alkaline ph than at acidic ph and the largest wavelength dependency occurs at the highest ph as for the ph dependency the chlorine photodecay rate constants increase with increasing phs at any wavelength and the ph dependency is the largest at the longest wavelength moreover the maximum fluence based rate constant 1 41 10 4 m2 j 1 obtained from the model is at 292 nm and ph 9 95 and the minimum 1 09 10 5 m2 j 1 is obtained at 291 nm and ph 5 the results verify our hypothesis that the maximum photolysis rate is obtained near the maximum absorption of the oxidant precursor ocl which has a maximum absorption at 292 nm feng et al 2007 3 4 wavelength and ph dependency on radical formation from chlorine photolysis nitrobenzene nb and carbamazepine cbz were used as probes to quantify the ho and reactive chlorine species rcs generated from the chlorine photolysis at the four tested wavelengths i e 257 7 268 282 3 and 301 2 nm and three environmentally relevant phs i e phs 6 7 and 8 nb exhibits high reactivity towards ho k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 but hardly reacts with rcs buxton and subhani 1972 fang et al 2014 cbz reacts rapidly with ho k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 cl k 5 6 1010 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2016 and clo 0 92 108 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 also it has been reported in the literature that the steady state concentrations of cl clo and cl2 are in the order of 10 14 10 10 and 10 14 m in the uv chlorine process under the environmentally relevant conditions similar to the current study guo et al 2017 based on the information on the rate constants and the concentrations of the radical species the contribution of clo to cbz degradation in the uv chlorine process is thus around 2 magnitudes higher than that of cl and much higher than that of cl2 therefore clo was selected as the representative rcs and its second order rate constant was used to calculate the steady state concentration of rcs in this study such assumption may cause the overestimation of the steady state concentrations of clo and it was only recommended to be used to compare the wavelength and ph dependency on radical formation in this study in addition it should be noted that both nb and cbz are inert to direct uv led photolysis and dark chlorination in the time scale of the current study less than 5 as shown figure s7 therefore the nb and cbz degradation can be expressed by eqs 11 and 12 11 d c n b d t k h o n b h o s s c n b k o n b c n b 12 d c c b z d t k h o c b z h o s s c c b z k c l o c b z c l o s s c c b z k o c b z c c b z where k h o n b and k h o c b z are the second order rate constants of ho towards nb k 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 and cbz k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 respectively and k c l o c b z is the second order rate constant of clo towards cbz k 0 92 108 m 1 s 1 k o n b and k o c b z are the apparent pseudo first order rate constants of the nb and cbz degradation shown in figures s8 and s9 respectively h o s s and clo s s are the steady state concentrations of ho and clo respectively the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and clo clo ss were thus obtained and normalized with the fluence rates and are shown in fig 6 un normalized data are shown in figure s10 at ph 6 the fluence based ho ss decreased from 1 8 10 14 to 1 2 10 14 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm which decreased by 32 03 clo ss decreased also by 57 95 from 9 6 10 13 to 4 0 10 13 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm compared to ho clo decreased more significantly with increasing the wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at ph 6 nonetheless at phs 7 the fluence based ho ss increased from 9 1 10 15 to 1 2 10 14 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm which increased by 30 43 and the clo ss also increased by 32 80 from 1 2 10 12 to 1 7 10 12 w m2 1 m 1 with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at ph 8 the fluence based ho ss and clo ss increased by 57 02 and 58 39 respectively with increasing wavelength from 257 7 to 301 2 nm compared to the fluence based ho ss that of clo increased more significantly with increasing wavelengths from 257 7 to 301 2 nm at phs 7 and 8 these findings indicate that the formation of clo is more wavelength dependent than that of ho and the impact of wavelength on the ho and clo formation was more significant at ph 6 compared to those at phs 7 and 8 fig 5 also shows that at any wavelength tested the fluence based ho ss decrease with increasing phs mainly due to the faster scavenging rate of ho by ocl k 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 than that by hocl k 2 0 109 m 1 s 1 and the higher ocl concentration at higher phs fang et al 2014 in contrast the fluence based clo ss increase with increasing phs at any wavelength tested due to the weaker scavenging effect of ocl than hocl towards clo and the increasing formation of clo from the scavenging of ho by ocl at higher phs guo et al 2017 at higher phs the formation of higher clo ss offset the scavenging of ho for the cbz degradation in the process resulting in the higher apparent rate constants of the cbz degradation in addition the fluence based ho ss and clo ss show positive correlation p 6 p 7 p 8 p 9 1 with the fluence based rate constants of chlorine photodecay figure s11 indicating that the radical formation exhibited a similar wavelength dependency to the chlorine photodecay the wavelength and ph dependency on the formation of other rcs e g cl and cl2 and the relationship between the radical yield and the chlorine photodecay will be further investigated in the future 4 conclusions the photodecay rates of hocl and ocl were highly wavelength dependent mainly due to the wavelength dependent molar absorption coefficients instead of quantum yields as predicted by the empirical model the wavelength dependency is larger at alkaline ph than at acidic ph and the largest wavelength dependency occurs at the highest ph as for the ph dependency the chlorine photodecay rate constants all increase with increasing ph at any wavelength and the ph dependency is the largest at the longest wavelength the modelled results help us better select uv leds at different wavelengths for chlorine photodecay and micropollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop based on the ph condition of the target water uv light at longer wavelength is more suitable for photo dechlorination of chlorine in swimming pools and pollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop in water e g secondary effluents and surface water at neutral and alkaline ph the wall plug efficiency of uv led at high wavelength e g 301 2 nm is predicted to reach 75 by 2020 song et al 2016 which makes it a promising alternative to the conventional uv mercury lamps for chlorine photodecay and micro pollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop in the near future at neutral and alkaline ph on the other hand the uv light at shorter wavelength is more suitable for the chlorine photodecay and micropollutant degradation by the uv chlorine aop in water at acidic ph e g 6 5 in these cases conventional uv mercury lamps still perform better than uv led at low wavelength e g 257 7 nm since the wall plug efficiency of uv led at 257 7 nm will unlikely be significantly improved enough to compete with the conventional lamps in the foreseeable future acknowledgements this work was

19487,elevated nutrient inputs have led to increased eutrophication in coastal marine ecosystems worldwide an understanding of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources is imperative for effective water quality management stable isotope values of nitrate δ 15nno3 δ 18ono3 can complement conventional water quality monitoring programs to help differentiate natural sources of no3 from anthropogenic inputs and estimate the processes involved in n cycling within an ecosystem we measured nutrient concentrations δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 in 76 locations along a salinity gradient from the lower end of the pearl river estuary one of china s largest rivers discharging into the south china sea towards the open ocean no3 concentrations decreased with increasing salinity indicative of conservative mixing of eutrophic freshwater and oligotrophic seawater however our data did not follow conservative mixing patterns at salinities 20 psu samples exhibited decreasing no3 concentrations with almost unchanged no3 isotope values indicating simple dilution at salinities 20 psu no3 concentrations decreased while dual no3 isotopes increased suggesting mixing and or other transformation

atmospheric deposition and groundwater we concluded that there are three plausible interpretations for deviations from conservative mixing behaviour 1 no3 uptake by assimilation 2 in situ no3 production from fixation derived nitrogen and nitrification of sewage derived effluents and 3 input of groundwater nitrate carrying a denitrification signal through this study we propose a simple workflow that incorporates a synthesis of numerous isotope based studies to constrain sources and behaviour of no3 in urbanized marine environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate isotopes eutrophication mixing fractionation anthropogenic 1 introduction since the 1970s human population has contributed to an unprecedented increase in the creation of reactive nitrogen n galloway et al 2008 this imbalance has effectively doubled the amount of bioavailable n particularly in the form of nitrate no3 that enters aquatic ecosystems these ecosystems play a vital role in regulating the

known as eutrophication eutrophication refers to a condition characterized by elevated inputs of limiting nutrients often caused by direct or indirect external inputs such as sewage to the receiving environment this triggers multiple detrimental ecological and biogeochemical responses that affect primary productivity and oxygen balance reproduction growth and survival of organisms and has negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function baker et al 2013 wear and vega thurber 2015 korth et al 2014 reported that nutrient inputs in the baltic sea are 400 higher than what they were

no3 is an important component of the total n pool and is a major cause of concern owing to its role in coastal eutrophication measuring the concentration of no3 can help identify regions of no3 pollution necessitating follow up remedial action however no3 can originate from multiple sources such as sewage atmospheric deposition groundwater nitrification and river run off and recycling and dispersal processes such as assimilation denitrification nitrification and anammox therefore additional tools are required to identify putative sources of contamination and monitor their fate and natural attenuation processes for better management of water resources granger and wankel 2016 stable isotopes of nitrate δ 15nno3 have been used since the 1970s to characterize the source and fate of no3 in coastal marine environments mariotti et al 1981 more recently stable isotopes of oxygen in nitrate δ 18ono3 when used in combination with δ 15nno3 have provided further resolution to identify no3 source mixing and no3 removal production processes thibodeau et al 2013 wankel et al 2007 in fact studies have successfully used dual no3 isotopes to quantify sources and internal turnover processes of no3 in several estuaries worldwide some examples are werribee river estuary wong et al 2014 river beult goody et al 2016 elbe estuary dähnke et al 2008 elkhorn slough wankel et al 2009

consideration of several isotope fractionation processes for an accurate interpretation of nitrate sources and dynamics therefore this study proposes a simple workflow that synthesizes approaches from previous isotope based studies for improved investigation of the source and fate of no3 in hong kong a highly urbanized megacity with a long established eutrophication problem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hong kong is situated in the pearl river delta fig 1 the fastest developing region in southern china populated by 120 million people the region is also well known for the pearl river estuary pre 3 26 1011 m3 yr 1 through which one of china s largest river systems the pearl river drains into the northern south china sea scs the enormous volume of freshwater discharge from the pre creates a marked gradient in seawater characteristics in hong kong s marine environment that ranges from estuarine low salinity in the west and south to oceanic high salinity in the east the marine environment is naturally stratified due to the high discharge from the pre wilson 1994 that results in a natural stratification with cold and saline bottom water separated from the fresh and warm surface water the stratification is especially strong during the wet season when the pearl river discharge is high summer hong kong is one of the most urbanized environments with the second highest population density on earth the marine environment is 1050 km2 in area and is home to a diversity of habitats and marine life in the 1980s and 1990s rapid development in the form of reclamation increased the city s pollution footprint while investment in wastewater treatment technology trailed consequently eutrophication has contributed to the loss of foundational species like hard corals and thus reduced the complexity diversity and function of benthic ecosystems since at least 1975 giving rise to environmental economic losses today there is speculation that eutrophication in hong kong is driven by regional sources owing to inorganic nitrogen inputs in the pearl river ye et al 2015 and local sources e g wastewater discharge groundwater discharge and leaking sewers putative end members table 1 yet to our knowledge there is no study that has successfully quantified the sources of no3 pollution and no3 transformation dynamics in the surface waters 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 seawater sampling surface seawater samples were collected from 76 long term water quality monitoring stations in july 2016 samples were collected by the environmental protection department of the hong kong special administrative region epd using a computer controlled rosette water sampler and stored at 4 c before nutrient analysis 2 2 2 water quality and stable isotope measurements seawater data

nitrogen orthophosphate phosphorous total phosphorous were obtained from epd s water quality database refer to details of methods in epd 2016 stable isotopes of nitrate δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 were determined using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 after no2 removal with sulfamic acid granger and sigman 2009 the bacterial denitrifier method is based on the measurement of the isotopic composition of n2o after no3 gets converted to n2o by bacteria that lack n2o reductase the isotopic composition of nitrite δ 15nno2 was measured following the protocol of mcllvin and altabet 2005 this involved quantitatively converting no2 to n2o by a helium purged 1 1 v v solution of 2 moll 1 sodium azide and 20 acetic acid isotope measurements are reported in the delta notation in permil relative to atmospheric n2 air for δ 15n and vsmow for δ 18o variations in isotope ratios are expressed using the delta notation as follows δ 15n 15n 14nsample 15n 14nstandard

was 0 2 for δ 15n and 0 3 for δ 18o at an injection level of 20 nmol n 2 3 data analysis in this study we propose a simple workflow using dual no3 isotopes physicochemical characteristics and no3 isotope anomalies to constrain source and transformation dynamics see fig 2 2 3 1 limiting nutrients nutrient parameters no3 and po4 3 were used to calculate n no3 16 po4 3 2 9 in μmol kg 1 and deviations from the redfield ratio no3 po4 3 n p deutsch et al 2007 areas with positive n values suggest excess no3 by n fixation and nitrification or additional sources and areas with negative n suggest denitrification or assimilation no3 removal processes low n p ratios are known to favor n fixation mclaughlin et al 2017 2 3 2 influences of river water seawater mixing to determine the apportionment of no3 sources we determined the concentration and stable isotope values of a sample as if it were a simple physical mixture cmixture of pure seawater and pure freshwater we applied a classical mixing model with riverine and marine end members adapted from ye et al 2015 as follows 1 cmixture q x criver 1 q x cocean where criver and cocean are no3 concentrations of river 86 6 μmol l 1 and marine 5 0 μmol l 1 end members respectively and q represents the freshwater fraction in a given sample calculated from salinity as follows salinityocean 34 5 psu salinityriver 1 37 psu 2 q salinityocean salinitysample salinityocean salinityriver in a simple physical mixing model the dual isotope values of a mixed sample with pure seawater and pure freshwater are obtained as follows 3 δ mixture q x criver x δ river 1 q x cocean x δ ocean cmixture where δ river and δ ocean are dual no3 isotopes of river δ 15nno3 5 2 δ 18ono3 0 3 and marine δ 15nno3 4 0 δ 18ono3 2 5 end members respectively 2 3 3 biological transformations in a simple mixing scenario no3 concentrations and dual isotopes vary linearly with salinity and follow conservative mixing properties as illustrated by kendall et al 2007 mixing of two end members in this case freshwater and seawater can also be explained by a straight line when dual isotopes are plotted against 1 no3 and by a curve when dual isotopes are plotted against ln no3 respectively wankel et al 2009 kendall et al 2007 however most real life scenarios are not true mixing scenarios where the δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values directly reflect the pollutant source they are often accompanied by transformations such as no3 removal by assimilation or denitrification which actively removes lighter no3 from the seawater mixture while enriching the residual pool in heavy isotopes variations in isotope values can also be due to the addition of n from sources that have a distinct stable isotope value e g sewage fertilizer nitrification therefore to better visualize and understand the data we plotted δ 15nno3 against δ 18ono3 values linear trajectories with slopes approximating 1 indicate assimilation and or denitrification granger and wankel 2016 this is because no3 removal processes often occur with a 1 1 enrichment in δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values if assimilation is the main driver of no3 removal the isotope enrichment factor ε is expected to be 6 ε 13 kendall et al 2007 however several studies indicate slightly varying ranges of enrichment factors for assimilation based on laboratory culture and field studies such as 3 ε 10 wankel et al 2009 another no3 sink is denitrification which results in a high 10 ε 30 dähnke et al 2008 2 3 4 stoichiometric calculations for net denitrification we calculated net denitrification n2 fixation rate minus denitrification rate as per wong and cheung 2000 who successfully used this model to measure net denitrification in the pre and northeast hong kong waters 4 n2 fixation denitrification δdin δdip x n p where δdin and δdip refer to inorganic nitrogen flux and inorganic phosphorous flux respectively 2 3 5 quantifying the deviation between dual no3 isotopes slopes deviating from 1 imply simultaneous enrichment or depletion by one or more transformation processes or sources in fact studies have shown that when two or more transformation processes co occur it can also cause deviations in the expected 1 1 ratio ye et al 2015 for example wankel et al 2007 observed a slope of 1 5 during the co occurrence of assimilation a no3 removal process and nitrification a no3 addition process therefore we calculated the deviation of our measured samples from the expected simple physical mixing scenario as per sigman et al 2005 5 δ 15 18 δ15n δ15nmixture 15ε 18ε x δ 18o δ 18omixture where 15ε 18ε 1 a culture derived estimate granger and wankel 2016 the slope of 1 is normally observed for marine ecosystems terrestrial systems often show slopes in the dual isotope plot between 0 5 and 1 δ15n and δ 18o refer to the no3 isotopic composition of the seawater sample negative δ 15 18 values indicate the addition of low δ 15nno3 for example n2 fixation derived n and or the oxidation of no2 to no3 however a better understanding of the isotope dynamics of no2 is required to better explain this mechanism so we extended the dual isotope analysis by calculating the δ 15n difference between no3 and no2 for every sample δδ 15n casciotti 2016 6 δδ 15n δ15nno3 δ15nno2 δ15nno3 and δ15nno2 refer to the no3 and no2 isotopic composition of the seawater samples we also calculated the magnitude of transformation 15ε and 18ε of our measured samples from the expected simple physical mixing scenario as per mariotti et al 1981 7 ε δ mixture δ sample ln f where f csample cmixture 2 3 6 other putative sources after consideration of potential transformation processes that can cause variations in the no3 isotope values we also took putative end member values into account such as those listed in table 1 these sources are adapted from previous studies that have been undertaken in the pre and hong kong all statistical analyses were conducted in jmp 13 0 sas institute all gis maps were made using qgis 12 8 by implementing the inverse distance weighing method p 2 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characteristics spatial distributions of salinity no3 nh4 don do chl a δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 are shown in appendix a overall northwest hong kong recorded the highest nutrient concentrations which gradually decreased with increasing distance to the east salinity of the surface water ranged from 0 3 psu near freshwater to 33 8 psu near seawater the surface marine environment was oxic mean do 200 μmol l 1 do and chl a were relatively low in the west and gradually increased eastward mean seawater no3 concentration was 22 4 μmol l 1 28 5 with highest values in the west 80 3 μmol l 1 33 8 that gradually decreased eastward central 27 2 μmol l 1 7 4 south 16 4 μmol l 1 9 0 and reached 1 1 μmol l 1 in the east mean seawater nh4 concentration was 7 5 μmol l 1 22 2 and mean no2 concentration was modest in all sampling stations 1 8 μmol l 1 3 3 don made up 60 of the total n pool in most areas and 90 of the n pool in northeast hong kong this area is known to have secondary biological sewage treatment facilities which discharge don rich wastewater effluents into the ocean a plot of no3 concentration versus salinity fig 3 showed nearly conservative mixing behaviour for many samples while some other points fell outside the freshwater seawater mixing line n p ratio varied from 2 to 66 with an average of 15 while n was generally positive throughout mean n 4 2 μmol kg 1 it reached a minimum 15 2 in the west which had the lowest salinity owing to the influence of freshwater from the pearl river 3 2 composition of nitrate species along a salinity gradient measured mean values for surface seawater δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 were 10 3 3 1 and 12 1 9 0 respectively δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values were low in the west area of low salinity owing to freshwater discharge from the pearl river which gradually increased eastward unlike no3 concentrations when δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 were plotted against salinity there was no clear trend that could be attributed to physical mixing of freshwater and seawater fig 3 at salinities 20 psu dual isotopes remained nearly unchanged at δ 15nno3 7 and δ 18ono3 3 indicating simple dilution between freshwater and seawater however at salinities 20 psu instead of following a decreasing trend which is characteristic of simple physical mixing dual isotope values increased this suggests that there are other sources and sinks of no3 in the environment based on fig 4 we observed strong deviations from what is expected of conservative mixing in all plots therefore we concluded that simple mixing between freshwater and seawater does not explain the data distribution 3 3 n o isotope effects an isoplot of measured surface seawater δ 18ono3 and δ 15nno3 values was used to understand if mixing of other putative end members was responsible for the observed distribution fig 5 however data from our study show no clear trend only some samples lie on the conservative mixing line between river water and another end member sewage hence we concluded that although significant mixing is unlikely to explain all the variability in the data distribution owing to the presence of other non conservative processes we observed an n o ratio for isotope effects 18ε 15ε of 1 63 indicating that no3 addition processes n fixation nitrification and or other sources with low δ 15n relative to δ 18o are likely to be the cause ye et al 2015 however our analysis yielded average estimates of isotope enrichment factors 15ε 2 03 and 18ε 3 31 which point to a strong assimilation signal to resolve this uncertainty we calculated the average degree of deviation δ 15 18 5 49 no3 isotope anomaly sigman et al 2005 suggesting simultaneous no3 reduction therefore we concluded that fixation derived n nitrification and assimilation were driving no3 isotope variability to further understand the influence of n transformation processes we calculated the difference in n2 fixation rate and denitrification rate as per wong and cheung 2000 we observed that the system moved from being a net source rate of n2 fixation denitrification 0 59 mmol m 2 day 1 in the west and a balanced source sink n2 fixation n denitrification in central to a net sink 0 05 mmol m 2 day 1 in the east 4 discussion hong kong s marine environment has 31 4 109 m3 of seawater and receives nutrient inputs from a variety of point pearl river sewage and non point sources atmospheric deposition groundwater july 2016 recorded 1 04 109 m3 of rainfall in the region hko 2016 and the pearl river discharges 60 109 m3 of water per month in the wet season wong and cheung 2000 we also know that sewage treatment plants discharge 78 106 m3 of treated effluents into the ocean every month dsd 2016 and more recently submarine groundwater discharge sgd is known to account for 256 7 106 m3 of water discharged into the ocean luo et al 2014 therefore in addition to the known end members that have been considered river water and sea water atmospheric deposition sewage and groundwater can also play vital roles in n cycling and transformation dynamics given their contribution with reference to volume we expect the pearl river to have the most significant influence on the no3 isotope signal followed by sewage atmospheric deposition and groundwater however no3 biogeochemistry and isotopes unravel various sources and sinks making the story quite complex after consideration of all putative end members and transformation processes three plausible interpretations arise for deviations from conservative mixing behaviour we discuss these in detail in the section below 4 1 no3 removal processes our data suggests the presence of one or more transformation or fractionation processes linked to no3 removal which tend to enrich the residual nitrate pool in seawater samples during assimilation or denitrification of dissolved no3 microbes preferentially consume 14n and 16o resulting in a pool that is characterized by increased values of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 we excluded denitrification as a possible source of transformation as all seawater samples are surface samples and had do 2 mg l a scenario that does not favor microbial removal of no3 by denitrification kendall et al 2007 this is further validated by the calculation of the difference between n fixation rate and denitrification rate that showed near zero presence of denitrification in the surface samples while it is unlikely that denitrification is playing a major role there are several indicators of assimilation the pattern of decreasing no3 and nh4 concentrations from the west to the east was consistent with proportionally increasing chl a concentrations see appendix the presence of elevated chl a suggests the presence of phytoplankton that would be capable of assimilating n this is also consistent with the trend in δ 15nno3 values which generally increased with concurrently decreasing no3 concentrations especially in the south further upon examination of the relationship between no3 and δ 15nno3 and no3 and δ 18ono3 we observed a significant negative correlation r 0 8 and r 0 9 respectively p 0 0001 in southern hong kong supporting the presence of assimilation thibodeau et al 2013 however we obtained a significant positive correlation r 0 7 p 0 0002 and r 0 4 p 0 03 respectively in the east suggesting that the variability in isotopic compositions is not solely influenced by assimilation and includes the isotopic fingerprint of other processes e g nitrification ye et al 2015 therefore we concluded that n isotope discrimination during algal phytoplankton no3 assimilation is driving the no3 isotope variability and is likely to overprint strong signals from external inputs of no3 in the south in other areas assimilation cannot be eliminated yet if present all isotopic values appear to be dominated by other no3 addition processes and or sources 4 2 no3 production processes negative δ 15 18 values have been known to arise from the co occurrence of n fixation and or nitrification both of which are characterized by high δ 18ono3 and or low δ 15nno3 values in this study δ 15 18 values increased as no3 concentration increased casciotti 2016 further clarifies that if no2 reduction is negligible in the system the δ 15n of newly fixed n will be similar to δ 15nno2 in our study mean δ 15nno2 2 was close to the average value of δ 15n for n fixation 1 kendall et al 2007 however the δ 15n difference between no3 and no2 and estimated mean δδ 15n 12 29 was less than 25 which would be expected at steady state if all no2 consumption occurred through no2 reduction casciotti 2016 although there is some uncertainty regarding the isotope effect of no2 reduction oxidation based on the arguments above we interpret that both n fixation and nitrification are required to explain the stable isotope data in this system nitrification is the conversion of nh4 to no2 and then to no3 these processes often cause a deviation 1 in the 1 1 isotope effect that is characteristic of assimilation and denitrification when complete nitrification occurs the resulting pool will be relatively depleted in δ 15n no3 as opposed to being enriched in the no3 removal processes described in the previous section in our study the slope of δ 18ono3 vs δ 15nno3 1 63 fig 5 may reflect the impact of simultaneous assimilation and nitrification which cause a greater enrichment of δ 18ono3 than δ 15nno3 branching fractionation casciotti 2016 recent studies have shown that nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 can be a new source of no3 in an urbanized coastal marine environment mclaughlin et al 2017 nitrification results in an initially low δ 15n no3 value which when assimilated will leave behind an enriched δ 15nno3 pool near the sewage outfall this is consistent with our observations firstly high fraction of no3 40 versus nh4 10 in the total n pool points to nitrification as a main driver of the isotopic composition secondly hong kong is home to the 10th largest wastewater treatment facility in the world which processes and discharges 2 106 m3 of sewage into the ocean on a daily basis this treatment facility releases nh4 rich effluents archana et al 2016 which are likely to be nitrified to no3 moreover the pearl river discharges freshwater that is rich in fertilizer derived and sewage derived n a likely major source of nh4 ye et al 2015 thirdly treated sewage effluents are known to have relatively enriched δ 15nno3 values 12 archana et al 2016 isotope values of seawater samples collected near the wastewater outfalls recorded values close to these reported numbers and decreased with increasing distance from the sewage outfall location 4 3 other putative sources the pattern of sewage derived no3 was not consistent across the study system in northeast hong kong lowest no3 concentration of 1 2 μmol l 1 there is no major source of sewage discharge so the no3 still found in the seawater is unaccounted for therefore we considered the contribution from two putative end members table 1 wet atmospheric deposition and submarine groundwater discharge sgd findings from luo et al 2014 point to the presence of sgd in northeastern waters although the east is known to record the largest proportion of annual rainfall 3000 mm hko 2016 our measurements are significantly differently from the rainwater end member suggesting mixing of other pollutant sources such as groundwater and or microbial n cycling such as denitrification that leave behind an enriched δ 15nno3 pool further wong and cheung 2000 reported a net effect from denitrification in these waters 0 05 mmol m 2 day 1 therefore we conclude that atmospheric deposition is not driving the isotopic signature of no3 and hypothesize that in northeast hong kong microbial cycling controls the supply of no3 to seawater and that this microbially cycled no3 likely originated from groundwater but may have been stored for several months or years before being flushed and mixed with seawater 4 4 impact of seasonality and tidal dynamics on n cycling seasonality and tidal dynamics are two important variables that can influence the spatial variability of 18ε 15ε ye et al 2015 discusses the apparent influence of water residence times on n cycling between the west and east pre and between the dry and wet seasons as water residence times directly influence the growth of bacteria that nitrify ammonium this can significantly influence the contribution of nitrification to the isotopic value of no3 coupling the proposed workflow with seasonality and water body mixing dynamics will represent a great step toward the objective of resolving all sources and transformations of no3 5 conclusion uncertainties and future work by combining various dual isotope analysis models from literature we investigated the contribution of no3 sources sewage atmospheric deposition n fixation and groundwater and no3 transformation processes assimilation nitrification and denitrification along a salinity gradient in hong kong we invoked several possibilities to explain our observations a no3 removal by assimilation 2 no3 addition by n2 fixation and nitrification of treated wastewater effluents and 3 microbial denitrification of groundwater although we highlight dominant players and eliminate negligible contributors we could not quantify the exact proportion of every source process entering the marine environment throughout this study we have taken into consideration isotope systematics only in surface waters in the wet season rendering our estimates variable therefore in future work seasonality and depth profiles must be considered in order to allow for a more mechanistic representation of nitrogen cycling in this region despite these constraints the data resulting from this work has multiple impacts firstly it serves as an important baseline for marine isotope food web studies in the region making this of particular relevance to coastal cities characterized by intense human activity secondly it will inform environmental managers and policy makers of the most important sources of nitrogen pollution which may be considered targets for future mitigation strategies

19487,elevated nutrient inputs have led to increased eutrophication in coastal marine ecosystems worldwide an understanding of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources is imperative for effective water quality management stable isotope values of nitrate δ 15nno3 δ 18ono3 can complement conventional water quality monitoring programs to help differentiate natural sources of no3 from anthropogenic inputs and estimate the processes involved in n cycling within an ecosystem we measured nutrient concentrations δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 in 76 locations along a salinity gradient from the lower end of the pearl river estuary one of china s largest rivers discharging into the south china sea towards the open ocean no3 concentrations decreased with increasing salinity indicative of conservative mixing of eutrophic freshwater and oligotrophic seawater however our data did not follow conservative mixing patterns at salinities 20 psu samples exhibited decreasing no3 concentrations with almost unchanged no3 isotope values indicating simple dilution at salinities 20 psu no3 concentrations decreased while dual no3 isotopes increased suggesting mixing and or other transformation processes our analysis yielded mean estimates for isotope enrichment factors 15ε 2 02 and 18ε 3 37 δ 15 18 5 5 and δ 15nno3 δ 15nno2 12 3 after consideration of potential alternative sources sewage atmospheric deposition and groundwater we concluded that there are three plausible interpretations for deviations from conservative mixing behaviour 1 no3 uptake by assimilation 2 in situ no3 production from fixation derived nitrogen and nitrification of sewage derived effluents and 3 input of groundwater nitrate carrying a denitrification signal through this study we propose a simple workflow that incorporates a synthesis of numerous isotope based studies to constrain sources and behaviour of no3 in urbanized marine environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate isotopes eutrophication mixing fractionation anthropogenic 1 introduction since the 1970s human population has contributed to an unprecedented increase in the creation of reactive nitrogen n galloway et al 2008 this imbalance has effectively doubled the amount of bioavailable n particularly in the form of nitrate no3 that enters aquatic ecosystems these ecosystems play a vital role in regulating the fate of n cycling through various processes such as n2 fixation nitrification denitrification and phytoplankton assimilation however increased coastal urbanization has significantly altered the function of no3 removal in rivers estuaries and oceans dähnke et al 2008 wankel et al 2009 wong et al 2014 consequently cascading environmental impacts are now the largest threat to aquatic ecosystems known as eutrophication eutrophication refers to a condition characterized by elevated inputs of limiting nutrients often caused by direct or indirect external inputs such as sewage to the receiving environment this triggers multiple detrimental ecological and biogeochemical responses that affect primary productivity and oxygen balance reproduction growth and survival of organisms and has negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem function baker et al 2013 wear and vega thurber 2015 korth et al 2014 reported that nutrient inputs in the baltic sea are 400 higher than what they were in the 1950s when human activity was much lower more recently sinha et al 2017 reported hypoxia events in the mississippi river delta that are linked to increasing terrestrial nutrient inputs nitrate no3 is an important component of the total n pool and is a major cause of concern owing to its role in coastal eutrophication measuring the concentration of no3 can help identify regions of no3 pollution necessitating follow up remedial action however no3 can originate from multiple sources such as sewage atmospheric deposition groundwater nitrification and river run off and recycling and dispersal processes such as assimilation denitrification nitrification and anammox therefore additional tools are required to identify putative sources of contamination and monitor their fate and natural attenuation processes for better management of water resources granger and wankel 2016 stable isotopes of nitrate δ 15nno3 have been used since the 1970s to characterize the source and fate of

2 1 study area hong kong is situated in the pearl river delta fig 1 the fastest developing region in southern china populated by 120 million people the region is also well known for the pearl river estuary pre 3 26 1011 m3 yr 1 through which one of china s largest river systems the pearl river drains into the northern south china sea scs the enormous volume of freshwater discharge from the pre creates a marked gradient in seawater characteristics in hong kong s marine environment that ranges from estuarine low salinity in the west and south to oceanic high salinity in the east the marine environment is naturally stratified due to the high discharge from the pre wilson 1994 that results in a natural stratification with cold and saline bottom water separated from the fresh and warm surface water the stratification is especially strong during the wet season when the pearl river discharge is high summer hong kong is one of the most urbanized environments with the second highest population density on earth the marine environment is 1050 km2 in area and is home to a diversity of habitats and marine life in the 1980s and 1990s rapid development in the form of reclamation increased the city s pollution footprint while investment in wastewater treatment technology trailed consequently eutrophication has contributed to the loss of foundational species like hard corals and thus reduced the complexity diversity and function of benthic ecosystems since at least 1975 giving rise to environmental economic losses today there is speculation that eutrophication in hong kong is driven by regional sources owing to inorganic nitrogen inputs in the pearl river ye et al 2015 and local sources e g wastewater discharge groundwater discharge and leaking sewers putative end members table 1 yet to our knowledge there is no study that has successfully quantified the sources of no3 pollution and no3 transformation dynamics in the surface waters 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 seawater sampling surface seawater samples were collected from 76 long term water quality monitoring stations in july 2016 samples were collected by the environmental protection department of the hong kong special administrative region epd using a computer controlled rosette water sampler and stored at 4 c before nutrient analysis 2 2 2 water quality and stable isotope measurements seawater data

nitrogen orthophosphate phosphorous total phosphorous were obtained from epd s water quality database refer to details of methods in epd 2016 stable isotopes of nitrate δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 were determined using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 after no2 removal with sulfamic acid granger and sigman 2009 the bacterial denitrifier method is based on the measurement of the isotopic composition of n2o after no3 gets converted to n2o by bacteria that lack n2o reductase the isotopic composition of nitrite δ 15nno2 was measured following the protocol of mcllvin and altabet 2005 this involved quantitatively converting no2 to n2o by a helium purged 1 1 v v solution of 2 moll 1 sodium azide and 20 acetic acid isotope measurements are reported in the delta notation in permil relative to atmospheric n2 air for δ 15n and vsmow for δ 18o variations in isotope ratios are expressed using the delta notation as follows δ 15n 15n 14nsample 15n 14nstandard

was 0 2 for δ 15n and 0 3 for δ 18o at an injection level of 20 nmol n 2 3 data analysis in this study we propose a simple workflow using dual no3 isotopes physicochemical characteristics and no3 isotope anomalies to constrain source and transformation dynamics see fig 2 2 3 1 limiting nutrients nutrient parameters no3 and po4 3 were used to calculate n no3 16 po4 3 2 9 in μmol kg 1 and deviations from the redfield ratio no3 po4 3 n p deutsch et al 2007 areas with positive n values suggest excess no3 by n fixation and nitrification or additional sources and areas with negative n suggest denitrification or assimilation no3 removal processes low n p ratios are known to favor n fixation mclaughlin et al 2017 2 3 2 influences of river water seawater mixing to determine the apportionment of no3 sources we determined the concentration and stable isotope values of a sample as if it were a simple physical mixture cmixture of pure seawater and pure freshwater we applied a classical mixing model with riverine and marine end members adapted from ye et al 2015 as follows 1 cmixture q x criver 1 q x cocean where criver and cocean are no3 concentrations of river 86 6 μmol l 1 and marine 5 0 μmol l 1 end members respectively and q represents the freshwater fraction in a given sample calculated from salinity as follows salinityocean 34 5 psu salinityriver 1 37 psu 2 q salinityocean salinitysample salinityocean salinityriver in a simple physical mixing model the dual isotope values of a mixed sample with pure seawater and pure freshwater are obtained as follows 3 δ mixture q x criver x δ river 1 q x cocean x δ ocean cmixture where δ river and δ ocean are dual no3 isotopes of river δ 15nno3 5 2 δ 18ono3 0 3 and marine δ 15nno3 4 0 δ 18ono3 2 5 end members respectively 2 3 3 biological transformations in a simple mixing scenario no3 concentrations and dual isotopes vary linearly with salinity and follow conservative mixing properties as illustrated by kendall et al 2007 mixing of two end members in this case freshwater and seawater can also be explained by a straight line when dual isotopes are plotted against 1 no3 and by a curve when dual isotopes are plotted against ln no3 respectively wankel et al 2009 kendall et al 2007 however most real life scenarios are not true mixing scenarios where the δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values directly reflect the pollutant source they are often accompanied by transformations such as no3 removal by assimilation or denitrification which actively removes lighter no3 from the seawater mixture while enriching the residual pool in heavy isotopes variations in isotope values can also be due to the addition of n from sources that have a distinct stable isotope value e g sewage fertilizer nitrification therefore to better visualize and understand the data we plotted δ 15nno3 against δ 18ono3 values linear trajectories with slopes approximating 1 indicate assimilation and or denitrification granger and wankel 2016 this is because no3 removal processes often occur with a 1 1 enrichment in δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values if assimilation is the main driver of no3 removal the isotope enrichment factor ε is expected to be 6 ε 13 kendall et al 2007 however several studies indicate slightly varying ranges of enrichment factors for assimilation based on laboratory culture and field studies such as 3 ε 10 wankel et al 2009 another no3 sink is denitrification which results in a high 10 ε 30 dähnke et al 2008 2 3 4 stoichiometric calculations for net denitrification we calculated net denitrification n2 fixation rate minus denitrification rate as per wong and cheung 2000 who successfully used this model to measure net denitrification in the pre and northeast hong kong waters 4 n2 fixation denitrification δdin δdip x n p where δdin and δdip refer to inorganic nitrogen flux and inorganic phosphorous flux respectively 2 3 5 quantifying the deviation between dual no3 isotopes slopes deviating from 1 imply simultaneous enrichment or depletion by one or more transformation processes or sources in fact studies have shown that when two or more transformation processes co occur it can also cause deviations in the expected 1 1 ratio ye et al 2015 for example wankel et al 2007 observed a slope of 1 5 during the co occurrence of assimilation a no3 removal process and nitrification a no3 addition process therefore we calculated the deviation of our measured samples from the expected simple physical mixing scenario as per sigman et al 2005 5 δ 15 18 δ15n δ15nmixture 15ε 18ε x δ 18o δ 18omixture where 15ε 18ε 1 a culture derived estimate granger and wankel 2016 the slope of 1 is normally observed for marine ecosystems terrestrial systems often show slopes in the dual isotope plot between 0 5 and 1 δ15n and δ 18o refer to the no3 isotopic composition of the seawater sample negative δ 15 18 values indicate the addition of low δ 15nno3 for example n2 fixation derived n and or the oxidation of no2 to no3 however a better understanding of the isotope dynamics of no2 is required to better explain this mechanism so we extended the dual isotope analysis by calculating the δ 15n difference between no3 and no2 for every sample δδ 15n casciotti 2016 6 δδ 15n δ15nno3 δ15nno2 δ15nno3 and δ15nno2 refer to the no3 and no2 isotopic composition of the seawater samples we also calculated the magnitude of transformation 15ε and 18ε of our measured samples from the expected simple physical mixing scenario as per mariotti et al 1981 7 ε δ mixture δ sample ln f where f csample cmixture 2 3 6 other putative sources after consideration of potential transformation processes that can cause variations in the no3 isotope values we also took putative end member values into account such as those listed in table 1 these sources are adapted from previous studies that have been undertaken in the pre and hong kong all statistical analyses were conducted in jmp 13 0 sas institute all gis maps were made using qgis 12 8 by implementing the inverse distance weighing method p 2 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characteristics spatial distributions of salinity no3 nh4 don do chl a δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 are shown in appendix a overall northwest hong kong recorded the highest nutrient concentrations which gradually decreased with increasing distance to the east salinity of the surface water ranged from 0 3 psu near freshwater to 33 8 psu near seawater the surface marine environment was oxic mean do 200 μmol l 1 do and chl a were relatively low in the west and gradually increased eastward mean seawater no3 concentration was 22 4 μmol l 1 28 5 with highest values in the west 80 3 μmol l 1 33 8 that gradually decreased eastward central 27 2 μmol l 1 7 4 south 16 4 μmol l 1 9 0 and reached 1 1 μmol l 1 in the east mean seawater nh4 concentration was 7 5 μmol l 1 22 2 and mean no2 concentration was modest in all sampling stations 1 8 μmol l 1 3 3 don made up 60 of the total n pool in most areas and 90 of the n pool in northeast hong kong this area is known to have secondary biological sewage treatment facilities which discharge don rich wastewater effluents into the ocean a plot of no3 concentration versus salinity fig 3 showed nearly conservative mixing behaviour for many samples while some other points fell outside the freshwater seawater mixing line n p ratio varied from 2 to 66 with an average of 15 while n was generally positive throughout mean n 4 2 μmol kg 1 it reached a minimum 15 2 in the west which had the lowest salinity owing to the influence of freshwater from the pearl river 3 2 composition of nitrate species along a salinity gradient measured mean values for surface seawater δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 were 10 3 3 1 and 12 1 9 0 respectively δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 values were low in the west area of low salinity owing to freshwater discharge from the pearl river which gradually increased eastward unlike no3 concentrations when δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 were plotted against salinity there was no clear trend that could be attributed to physical mixing of freshwater and seawater fig 3 at salinities 20 psu dual isotopes remained nearly unchanged at δ 15nno3 7 and δ 18ono3 3 indicating simple dilution between freshwater and seawater however at salinities 20 psu instead of following a decreasing trend which is characteristic of simple physical mixing dual isotope values increased this suggests that there are other sources and sinks of no3 in the environment based on fig 4 we observed strong deviations from what is expected of conservative mixing in all plots therefore we concluded that simple mixing between freshwater and seawater does not explain the data distribution 3 3 n o isotope effects an isoplot of measured surface seawater δ 18ono3 and δ 15nno3 values was used to understand if mixing of other putative end members was responsible for the observed distribution fig 5 however data from our study show no clear trend only some samples lie on the conservative mixing line between river water and another end member sewage hence we concluded that although significant mixing is unlikely to explain all the variability in the data distribution owing to the presence of other non conservative processes we observed an n o ratio for isotope effects 18ε 15ε of 1 63 indicating that no3 addition processes n fixation nitrification and or other sources with low δ 15n relative to δ 18o are likely to be the cause ye et al 2015 however our analysis yielded average estimates of isotope enrichment factors 15ε 2 03 and 18ε 3 31 which point to a strong assimilation signal to resolve this uncertainty we calculated the average degree of deviation δ 15 18 5 49 no3 isotope anomaly sigman et al 2005 suggesting simultaneous no3 reduction therefore we concluded that fixation derived n nitrification and assimilation were driving no3 isotope variability to further understand the influence of n transformation processes we calculated the difference in n2 fixation rate and denitrification rate as per wong and cheung 2000 we observed that the system moved from being a net source rate of n2 fixation denitrification 0 59 mmol m 2 day 1 in the west and a balanced source sink n2 fixation n denitrification in central to a net sink 0 05 mmol m 2 day 1 in the east 4 discussion hong kong s marine environment has 31 4 109 m3 of seawater and receives nutrient inputs from a variety of point pearl river sewage and non point sources atmospheric deposition groundwater july 2016 recorded 1 04 109 m3 of rainfall in the region hko 2016 and the pearl river discharges 60 109 m3 of water per month in the wet season wong and cheung 2000 we also know that sewage treatment plants discharge 78 106 m3 of treated effluents into the ocean every month dsd 2016 and more recently submarine groundwater discharge sgd is known to account for 256 7 106 m3 of water discharged into the ocean luo et al 2014 therefore in addition to the known end members that have been considered river water and sea water atmospheric deposition sewage and groundwater can also play vital roles in n cycling and transformation dynamics given their contribution with reference to volume we expect the pearl river to have the most significant influence on the no3 isotope signal followed by sewage atmospheric deposition and groundwater however no3 biogeochemistry and isotopes unravel various sources and sinks making the story quite complex after consideration of all putative end members and transformation processes three plausible interpretations arise for deviations from conservative mixing behaviour we discuss these in detail in the section below 4 1 no3 removal processes our data suggests the presence of one or more transformation or fractionation processes linked to no3 removal which tend to enrich the residual nitrate pool in seawater samples during assimilation or denitrification of dissolved no3 microbes preferentially consume 14n and 16o resulting in a pool that is characterized by increased values of δ 15nno3 and δ 18ono3 we excluded denitrification as a possible source of transformation as all seawater samples are surface samples and had do 2 mg l a scenario that does not favor microbial removal of no3 by denitrification kendall et al 2007 this is further validated by the calculation of the difference between n fixation rate and denitrification rate that showed near zero presence of denitrification in the surface samples while it is unlikely that denitrification is playing a major role there are several indicators of assimilation the pattern of decreasing no3 and nh4 concentrations from the west to the east was consistent with proportionally increasing chl a concentrations see appendix the presence of elevated chl a suggests the presence of phytoplankton that would be capable of assimilating n this is also consistent with the trend in δ 15nno3 values which generally increased with concurrently decreasing no3 concentrations especially in the south further upon examination of the relationship between no3 and δ 15nno3 and no3 and δ 18ono3 we observed a significant negative correlation r 0 8 and r 0 9 respectively p 0 0001 in southern hong kong supporting the presence of assimilation thibodeau et al 2013 however we obtained a significant positive correlation r 0 7 p 0 0002 and r 0 4 p 0 03 respectively in the east suggesting that the variability in isotopic compositions is not solely influenced by assimilation and includes the isotopic fingerprint of other processes e g nitrification ye et al 2015 therefore we concluded that n isotope discrimination during algal phytoplankton no3 assimilation is driving the no3 isotope variability and is likely to overprint strong signals from external inputs of no3 in the south in other areas assimilation cannot be eliminated yet if present all isotopic values appear to be dominated by other no3 addition processes and or sources 4 2 no3 production processes negative δ 15 18 values have been known to arise from the co occurrence of n fixation and or nitrification both of which are characterized by high δ 18ono3 and or low δ 15nno3 values in this study δ 15 18 values increased as no3 concentration increased casciotti 2016 further clarifies that if no2 reduction is negligible in the system the δ 15n of newly fixed n will be similar to δ 15nno2 in our study mean δ 15nno2 2 was close to the average value of δ 15n for n fixation 1 kendall et al 2007 however the δ 15n difference between no3 and no2 and estimated mean δδ 15n 12 29 was less than 25 which would be expected at steady state if all no2 consumption occurred through no2 reduction casciotti 2016 although there is some uncertainty regarding the isotope effect of no2 reduction oxidation based on the arguments above we interpret that both n fixation and nitrification are required to explain the stable isotope data in this system nitrification is the conversion of nh4 to no2 and then to no3 these processes often cause a deviation 1 in the 1 1 isotope effect that is characteristic of assimilation and denitrification when complete nitrification occurs the resulting pool will be relatively depleted in δ 15n no3 as opposed to being enriched in the no3 removal processes described in the previous section in our study the slope of δ 18ono3 vs δ 15nno3 1 63 fig 5 may reflect the impact of simultaneous assimilation and nitrification which cause a greater enrichment of δ 18ono3 than δ 15nno3 branching fractionation casciotti 2016 recent studies have shown that nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 can be a new source of no3 in an urbanized coastal marine environment mclaughlin et al 2017 nitrification results in an initially low δ 15n no3 value which when assimilated will leave behind an enriched δ 15nno3 pool near the sewage outfall this is consistent with our observations firstly high fraction of no3 40 versus nh4 10 in the total n pool points to nitrification as a main driver of the isotopic composition secondly hong kong is home to the 10th largest wastewater treatment facility in the world which processes and discharges 2 106 m3 of sewage into the ocean on a daily basis this treatment facility releases nh4 rich effluents archana et al 2016 which are likely to be nitrified to no3 moreover the pearl river discharges freshwater that is rich in fertilizer derived and sewage derived n a likely major source of nh4 ye et al 2015 thirdly treated sewage effluents are known to have relatively enriched δ 15nno3 values 12 archana et al 2016 isotope values of seawater samples collected near the wastewater outfalls recorded values close to these reported numbers and decreased with increasing distance from the sewage outfall location 4 3 other putative sources the pattern of sewage derived no3 was not consistent across the study system in northeast hong kong lowest no3 concentration of 1 2 μmol l 1 there is no major source of sewage discharge so the no3 still found in the seawater is unaccounted for therefore we considered the contribution from two putative end members table 1 wet atmospheric deposition and submarine groundwater discharge sgd findings from luo et al 2014 point to the presence of sgd in northeastern waters although the east is known to record the largest proportion of annual rainfall 3000 mm hko 2016 our measurements are significantly differently from the rainwater end member suggesting mixing of other pollutant sources such as groundwater and or microbial n cycling such as denitrification that leave behind an enriched δ 15nno3 pool further wong and cheung 2000 reported a net effect from denitrification in these waters 0 05 mmol m 2 day 1 therefore we conclude that atmospheric deposition is not driving the isotopic signature of no3 and hypothesize that in northeast hong kong microbial cycling controls the supply of no3 to seawater and that this microbially cycled no3 likely originated from groundwater but may have been stored for several months or years before being flushed and mixed with seawater 4 4 impact of seasonality and tidal dynamics on n cycling seasonality and tidal dynamics are two important variables that can influence the spatial variability of 18ε 15ε ye et al 2015 discusses the apparent influence of water residence times on n cycling between the west and east pre and between the dry and wet seasons as water residence times directly influence the growth of bacteria that nitrify ammonium this can significantly influence the contribution of nitrification to the isotopic value of no3 coupling the proposed workflow with seasonality and water body mixing dynamics will represent a great step toward the objective of resolving all sources and transformations of no3 5 conclusion uncertainties and future work by combining various dual isotope analysis models from literature we investigated the contribution of no3 sources sewage atmospheric deposition n fixation and groundwater and no3 transformation processes assimilation nitrification and denitrification along a salinity gradient in hong kong we invoked several possibilities to explain our observations a no3 removal by assimilation 2 no3 addition by n2 fixation and nitrification of treated wastewater effluents and 3 microbial denitrification of groundwater although we highlight dominant players and eliminate negligible contributors we could not quantify the exact proportion of every source process entering the marine environment throughout this study we have taken into consideration isotope systematics only in surface waters in the wet season rendering our estimates variable therefore in future work seasonality and depth profiles must be considered in order to allow for a more mechanistic representation of nitrogen cycling in this region despite these constraints the data resulting from this work has multiple impacts firstly it serves as an important baseline for marine isotope food web studies in the region making this of particular relevance to coastal cities characterized by intense human activity secondly it will inform environmental managers and policy makers of the most important sources of nitrogen pollution which may be considered targets for future mitigation strategies periodic study of no3 sources can help in implementing management strategies to monitor effectiveness of sewage treatment upgrades and improve water quality thirdly it provides a simple workflow to

19488,applying silver nanoparticles nag or silver nitrate agno3 to ceramic water filters improves microbiological efficacy reduces biofilm formation and protects stored water from recontamination a challenge in ceramic filter production is adding sufficient silver to achieve these goals without exceeding the maximum recommended silver concentration in drinking water silver release is affected by silver type application method and influent water chemistry despite a lack of data there is an assumption that chlorinated water should not be used as influent water because it may increase silver

casein coated nag painted with agno3 or containing fired in nag over a range of ionic strength is 0 10 mm as nano3 in the presence or absence of natural organic matter nom influent deionized water containing chlorine increased silver release 2 5 fold compared to controls however this effect of chlorine was mitigated at higher is 1 mm or in the presence of nom 3 mg c l for filter disks painted with nag or agno3 silver release increased with increasing is with or without chlorine and effluent concentrations remained above the world health organization who guideline of 0 1 mg l even after 30 h 80 pore volumes pvs of flow with a background solution of 10 mm nano3 silver speciation nag vs ag was monitored in effluent samples from painted or fired in nag filter disks results indicated that in general greater than 90 of the eluted silver was due to ag dissolution rather than nag release additionally a filter disk prepared with fired in nag exhibited a lower released in the nanoparticle form nag 5 of total ag in effluent compared to painted on nag nag 14 of total ag in effluent the findings of this study suggest that chlorinated influent water has minimal impact on silver elution from ceramic filters under simulated natural water conditions and thus the recommendation to avoid the use of chlorinated water with ceramic filters is not necessary under most conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords ceramic water filters chlorine household water treatment silver nanoparticles silver nitrate silver dissolution 1 introduction ceramic water filters cwfs are household water treatment and safe storage devices manufactured in more than 50 factories worldwide they are designed to improve the quality of drinking water and reduce the burden of diarrheal disease brown et al 2008 cmwg 2011 cwfs are produced by pressing a mixture of clay and an organic burnout material into the filter shape i e ceramic pot and firing to a ceramic state silver nanoparticles nag or silver nitrate agno3 are added to the fired filter via brushing or dipping or before firing by direct addition to the filter mixture cmwg 2011 cwfs remove pathogens via pore size exclusion and physio chemical adsorption and the bactericidal action of silver improves bacteriological efficacy bielefeldt et al 2009 oyanedel craver and smith 2008 rayner et al 2013b silver also reduces biofilm formation and protects filtered water from recontamination it is currently recommended that factories use nag rather than agno3 due to concerns over the shorter lifetime of agno3 in the filters however nag is more expensive and typically needs to be imported cmwg 2011 rayner et al 2013a the current recommendation is to apply silver by painting on an nag suspension there is no existing recommendation to fire in nag due to a lack of research cmwg 2011 rayner et al 2013a the application of silver by dipping is currently not recommended because it is difficult to control the amount of silver applied and the actual amount of silver absorbed is unknown cmwg 2011 a challenge in ceramic filter production is adding sufficient silver to increase efficacy prevent biofilm growth and protect stored water without adding so much silver that the maximum recommended silver concentration in effluent drinking water is exceeded the world health organization who guideline value and united states environmental protection agency us epa secondary maximum contaminant level for silver in drinking water is 0 1 mg l usepa 2003 who 2011 in addition to potential health impacts from silver itself its release results in silver depletion from the ceramic matrix thus reducing beneficial effects with time water characteristics within a particular region can vary widely over time particularly in areas with intermittent water treatment and distribution systems unimproved water sources and in drought prone regions bielefeldt et al 2013 brown and sobsey 2010 who 2011 previous research has found that influent water chemistry including ph ionic strength is organic matter content and cation species influences silver release mittelman et al 2015 rayner et al 2013b ren and smith 2013 for example mittelman et al 2015 observed increased silver elution with increasing is 1 50 mm nano3 decreasing ph from ph values of 9 5 and presence of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 using ceramic filter disks painted with casein coated nag or agno3 in that study greater than 90 of eluted silver was in the ionic form ag rather than the nanoparticle nag and the highest amount of nag release occurred within the first 5 h 15 pore volumes pvs of flushing and represented less than 1 of the total silver mass released current recommendations suggest discarding the first three batches of filtered water approximately 30 l or 25 pvs for a 10 l capacity filter pot from cwfs due in part to this higher initial silver release cmwg 2011 the laboratory study by mittelman et al showed that effluent silver levels did not drop below the who us epa recommended level of 0 1 mg l until being flushed with 30 42 pvs of 10 mm nano3 at ph 7 mittelman et al 2015 when the ph was decreased from 7 to 5 in the presence of divalent ca2 mg2 cations or when is was increased from 10 mm to 50 mm nano3 effluent silver levels increased to 5 10 times the who us epa guideline 0 1 mg l within 10 20 pvs of flushing currently the recommendation is to not use or clean cwfs with chlorinated water as it is generally assumed that chlorine will strip silver from the filter cmwg 2011 this poses concern for recommending cwf use in urban and peri urban areas that may have intermittent chlorination and microbiologically contaminated drinking water kumpel and nelson 2013 2016 or in areas where household water treatment with chlorine is widely promoted the recommended free chlorine residual fcr concentration in drinking water varies based on distribution system type and place of treatment who 2011 because water quality characteristics can impact chlorination efficacy which is increased at lower ph and decreased in the presence of natural organic matter nom which exerts chlorine demand benjamin and lawler 2013 who 2011 in centrally treated infrastructure piped water systems the who recommends an fcr of 0 2 0 5 mg l at the endpoints water taps and stipulates a health based limit of 5 0 mg l who 2011 in some systems water may be intermittently chlorinated under or over treated or have leaks within or unregulated withdrawals from the system all of these factors may impact fcr concentrations kumpel and nelson 2013 2016 for water chlorination at the household level a chlorine dose of 2 0 mg l is recommended for clear water 10 nephelometric turbidity units ntu to maintain an fcr of 0 2 mg l while twice that dose 4 0 mg l as cl2 is recommended for turbid waters 10 ntu who 2011 thus cwfs may be used with water containing between 0 and 5 mg l fcr and the chlorine concentration may not be known at any given time research on the impact of chlorination on silver elution from cwfs is limited bielefeldt et al 2013 evaluated the impact of chlorine 8 8 mg l or 525 mg l ph 4 5 9 5 on total silver release from nag applied ceramic surfaces using a quartz crystal microbalance qcm a technique that can be used to rapidly assess small molecule and particle deposition behavior for a range of chemical and flow conditions the authors used silica coated quartz sensors because the crystalline sio2 material was the closest commercially available qcm sensor material to represent the alumino silicate surfaces in cwfs bielefeldt et al 2013 among the parameters evaluated by bielefeldt and colleagues ph is chlorine turbidity and nom chlorine was found to have the greatest impact on silver release an average of 83 and 86 silver removal after the addition of 8 8 mg l and 525 mg l free chlorine respectively after less than 3 h of flow which was attributed to oxidation reactions and enhanced dissolution of ag ions bielefeldt et al 2013 this finding suggests that contact between silver containing cwfs and chlorine could result in decreased disinfection effectiveness over time from the loss of silver and that chlorine solutions should not be used to clean silver containing cwfs however this study was limited by several factors 1 the fluid dynamics of qcm sensors are not representative of flow through a porous ceramic filter 2 a ceramic filter could not be used as the surface material 3 chlorine solutions were only prepared in deionized water 4 effluent silver concentrations were not measured nor was the form of silver determined i e nag vs ag and 5 the impact of chlorine at recommended drinking water fcr concentrations 0 5 mg l was not evaluated previous studies have demonstrated that increasing is can increase silver elution from nag or agno3 painted filters mittelman et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge the coupled effect of is and chlorine on silver release from cwfs has not been investigated nom which is ubiquitous in natural water sources can also affect the fate and transport of nag past work has demonstrated increased stability and mobility of nag through porous media in the presence of nom delay et al 2011 fabrega et al 2009 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 another important factor in filter performance and effluent water quality is the form of released silver ionic vs nanoparticle because the antimicrobial activity of nag is thought to result from the dissolution of ag choi et al 2008 lok et al 2007 xiu et al 2012 the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate silver dissolution and release of silver ions and nanoparticles from ceramic filter disks exposed to intermittently chlorinated water containing 0 4 mg l fcr 2 determine the impact of is as nano3 on silver dissolution and release from disks and 3 predict the lifetime of the silver as a function of chlorine and is three different silver application methods were tested disks painted with nag disks painted with agno3 and disks containing fired in nag 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ceramic filter disks 10 cm diameter 1 5 cm thick manufactured by advanced ceramics manufacturing acm tucson az following established protocols were used for one dimensional transport experiments ceramic disks were used instead of full sized filters to allow for controlled transport studies and to simplify manufacturing and test methods briefly clay was imported from a tanzanian factory and pine sawdust burn out material was purchased from pallet recyclers tucson az sawdust was sieved between us no 30 and no 60 mesh sieves 0 595 and 0 251 mm openings respectively prior to mixing with clay the mass ratio of sawdust to clay was 4 which provided an estimated flow rate equivalent to 2 3 l h in a full sized filter this estimated flow rate was calculated by scaling the surface area of the disks to the surface area region exposed to fluid of the full sized filter see supporting information si text s1 using dimensions of a frustum shaped full sized filter van halem 2006 and resulting falling head flow rate tests performed by acm on the newly manufactured filter disks the sawdust to clay ratio used in this study corresponds to the lower end of ratios used by factories who report adding 5 25 by weight to the filter mixture cmwg 2011 the amount of burn out material selected for this research was based on several factors including clay characteristics mesh used to screen sawdust firing temperature and reported filter mixture recipe from the factory that provided clays disks were formed with a hydraulic press and then fired in a furnace the temperature was gradually increased to 900 c and held for 60 min before cooling characterization of the filters porosity non reactive tracer transport cation exchange capacity was previously reported mittelman et al 2015 to compare the impact of painting vs firing in nag an experiment was carried out using one ceramic disk containing a proprietary amount of fired in nag this disk contained the same amount of silver used by some factories in haiti tanzania and the dominican republic and is similar to the higher end concentration 0 5 mg ag g filter evaluated by ren and smith 2013 however it is important to note that a higher concentration and different type of nag was used for the fired in method than for the painted nag filters 0 03 mg ag g filter in the present study the reason for this difference was the desire to use factory relevant conditions same silver source and application amount used by the factories that fire in silver these filters were prepared by gradually adding a suspension of silver nano powder type s2 80 ames goldsmith corp glens falls ny to the same type of dry clay and sawdust material mixture used for the filters without nag prior to firing the s2 80 nanoparticles coated with a proprietary surfactant have an average particle size of 80 nm as determined by the manufacturer using scanning electron microscopy other than the addition of nag these filters were manufactured identically to the other disks used in this study upon receipt from acm disks were reduced to 5 cm in diameter to fit existing holders oyanedel craver and smith 2008 using a hole saw and sterilized by heating at 550 c for 30 min the weight of the resulting filters was 45 0 2 g casein coated silver nanoparticles nag were obtained from argenol laboratories zaragoza spain in powder form 71 75 silver by weight these nanoparticles have a mean diameter of 45 nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy kallman et al 2011 silver nitrate agno3 99 9 metals basis was obtained from alfaaesar ward hill ma suwannee river natural organic matter srnom reverse osmosis ro isolate was purchased from the international humic substances society ihss st paul mn sodium hypochlorite 5 25 for chlorine dosing solutions was obtained from val tech diagnostics inc brackenridge pa 2 2 silver dissolution and release experiments a 200 mg l as total ag silver solution or suspension was prepared using previously described methods mittelman et al 2015 briefly agno3 or casein coated nag solid was weighed added to a known volume of di water and adjusted to ph 7 00 0 05 using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hno3 a teflontm coated paint brush shur line mooresville nc was used to apply 3 ml to each of the top and bottom surfaces 6 ml total applied resulting in the recommended silver application of 0 03 mg ag g filter proposed by the ceramic manufacturing working group cmwg 2011 more recent work has suggested revising this recommendation to 0 3 mg ag g for nag application only but not for agno3 rayner et al 2013b the experiments described herein used the current 0 03 mg ag g recommendation as a basis for painted nag and agno3 application as this is the amount used by the majority of factories after painting with agno3 or nag disks were air dried for 12 h placed in modified polycarbonate membrane holders model 420400 whatman uk oyanedel craver and smith 2008 and sealed with silicone glue and neoprene o rings mcmaster carr elmhurst il at the top and bottom of the disk to prevent the injected solutions from flowing around the disks a total of nine filter disk experiments were conducted with nine new filters to assess the impact of transient chlorine concentrations is and nom on silver release and dissolution from filter disks painted with agno3 n 2 or casein coated nag n 6 or from a filter containing fired in nag n 1 as shown in table 1 is was adjusted using 1 or 10 mm nano3 the na form was selected as a common monovalent cation and to avoid the effect of increased silver release from the presence of divalent cations shown previously by mittelman et al 2015 each silver release experiment began with approximately 20 pvs of flushing 7 h 240 ml with the corresponding background solution di water 1 mm nano3 or 10 mm nano3 at ph 7 using a masterflex peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills il at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min followed by the introduction of solutions containing free chlorine 0 2 2 or 4 mg l as cl2 depending on the experiment samples were exposed to three cycles of intermittent chlorination e g 0 mg l as cl2 for 20 pvs followed by 2 mg l as cl2 for 20 pvs then 0 2 0 2 and 0 mg l as cl2 for 10 pvs each filter effluent samples were collected in 15 or 50 ml polystyrene centrifuge tubes vwr international radnor pa every 10 min for the first 30 pvs 6 ml or 0 5 pvs per sample and then every 60 min for remainder of the experiment 36 ml or 3 pvs per sample using a cf 2 spectrachrom fraction collector spectrum laboratories inc rancho dominguez ca and analyzed for total ag and ag the chlorine concentration in the stock solution val tech sodium hypochlorite 5 25 was measured using a digital titrator and hach method 8209 free and total chlorine concentrations in the influent solution and effluent samples were measured using a lamotte colorimeter and dpd 1 and 3 instrument grade tablets lamotte company chestertown md to monitor for potential degradation of chlorine and reactions between chlorine and the ceramic material the influent chlorine solutions were confirmed to contain only free chlorine i e no combined chlorine chloramines by analyzing for both free and total chlorine and verifying that free chlorine concentration equaled total chlorine concentration chlorine concentrations in the influent solution were stable for the duration of the experiment e g for 2 mg l influent solutions average standard deviation 2 04 0 05 mg l cl2 except for the dosing solution containing srnom where a decrease in chlorine concentration over time was expected due to reaction with nom in that case the chlorine concentration was monitored throughout the injection sequence and fresh solutions were prepared for each intermittent chlorine dosing si fig s1 2 3 analytical methods the hydrodynamic diameter and electrophoretic mobility of nag suspensions were measured with a malvern zetasizer malvern worcestershire uk using dynamic light scattering dls and laser doppler velocimetry respectively these measurements were carried out in triplicate at 25 c using a measurement angle of 173 backscatter electrophoretic mobility measurements were converted into zeta potential values using the smoluchowski approximation smoluchowski 1917 silver concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 7300 dv perkinelmer waltham ma the detection limit for ag by icp oes was determined to be 9 μg l based on the method of hubaux and vos 1970 in a subset of effluent samples dissolved silver ag was separated from nag by centrifugation at 2500 g in ultrafiltration units amicon 3k millipore billerica ma the filtrate was then analyzed by icp oes to determine the silver speciation ag vs total ag the solid phase silver concentration in unused fired in nag disks was measured by microwave assisted acid digestion discover sp d cem corp matthews nc with concentrated nitric acid tracemetal grade fisher scientific waltham ma followed by analysis for silver by icp oes three extractions were performed on each solid sample to ensure that all retained silver was extracted i e acid digest removed for analysis sample rinsed 3 with di water fresh nitric acid added digestion repeated process repeated until no silver detected in acid digest on average the first extraction recovered 79 1 of the total extracted silver and the first and second extractions together recovered 94 1 of the total extracted silver 2 4 longevity analysis time to silver depletion was estimated using a constant flow rate of 0 6 ml min under two general conditions 1 a worst case scenario based on the mass of silver remaining after the initial flushing period of 20 pvs 7 h and the maximum silver effluent concentration from chlorine addition and 2 a more realistic estimate based on the mass of silver remaining and effluent concentration at 85 pvs 30 h the water volume to silver depletion in disks was converted to full sized filter volume 10 l capacity by scaling the surface area exposed to flow and equating pore volumes i e 12 ml in disk and 1 2 l in pot water volume was converted to years assuming use of 1 full filter day the longevity calculations are based on the methods used by mittelman et al 2015 and additional details are provided in si text s1 3 results discussion 3 1 ceramic filter and nanoparticle characterization the average pore volume pvs standard deviation of ceramic filter disks used in this study was 12 3 0 6 ml additional characterization was carried out in previous work using a batch of filters produced with the same materials by the same manufacturer under the same conditions mittelman et al 2015 filter disk porosity was determined to be 41 9 0 8 using mercury porosimetry and the filter disks contained a range of pore sizes approximately 35 pore diameters 20 nm 10 between 20 nm and 1 μm 45 between 1 μm and 30 μm and 10 30 μm the average standard deviation hydrodynamic diameter of the casein coated nag in di water was 58 7 nm as measured by dls and the average standard deviation zeta potential was 41 6 3 5 mv to evaluate the effect of chlorine on silver dissolution and release from ceramic filters experiments were performed with intermittent chlorination as a function of is silver type and application method painted nag or agno3 and fired in nag and in the presence of nom table 1 3 2 impact of ionic strength on silver release in painted on nag disks an increase in is from 0 to 10 mm nano3 resulted in increased silver release for ceramic disks painted with nag fig 1 after the initial flush of 20 pvs 7 h the effluent silver concentrations were 0 022 0 096 and 0 27 mg l for background solutions of di water 1 mm nano3 and 10 mm nano3 respectively the highest silver release occurred within the first 20 pvs 7 h accounting for 1 8 8 7 of the total applied ag si fig s2 the effluent silver fell below the who us epa guideline value of 0 1 mg l after 4 3 pvs 1 5 h of di water flushing fig 1a and 14 6 pvs 5 h for 1 mm nano3 fig 1b with a background of 10 mm nano3 and intermittent chlorination exposure the effluent silver concentration remained above 0 1 mg l at the completion of the experiment total ag 0 15 mg l at 84 pvs or 29 h fig 1c in a separate control experiment 10 mm nano3 no chlorine the effluent silver concentration fell below 0 1 mg l after 78 4 pvs 27 h of flushing with 10 mm nano3 si fig s3 the effluent silver concentrations in the first 180 min of flushing painted nag disks with a 10 mm is background ranged from 0 17 to 1 4 mg l fig 1c and s3 which were similar to the effluent levels observed by ren and smith 2013 for filter disks painted with argenol proteinate coated nag and exposed to the same flow rate is and time period effluent concentrations ranged from 0 2 to 2 mg l in selected effluent samples obtained from ceramic disks painted with nag or containing fired in nag both ag and total ag nag ag were measured to determine the silver speciation ag concentrations shown as symbol in figs 1 2 and 4 and s3 on average the ag comprised 90 of the total eluted ag si fig s4 suggesting that silver release was predominantly due to dissolution of the silver ion rather than release of nag the lowest release of nag highest ag was observed in the fired in nag filter disk effluent exp 9 average ag total ag 95 whereas the highest release of nag was observed during the first 40 pvs of flushing an nag painted filter with a background solution consisting of di water and 2 mg l cl2 intermittent chlorination exp 1 48 72 ag total ag other than exp 1 elution of ag versus nag varied throughout each experiment with no clear relationship between flushing time chlorination or water chemistry on the ratio of ag versus nag the speciation results of the present study are in agreement with previous research that showed primarily ag release 90 from ceramic filters painted with argenol casein coated nag and exposed to solutions with varying is 1 50 mm cations na mg2 ca2 and ph 5 9 mittelman et al 2015 however ren and smith 2013 observed the opposite trend in a study investigating the transport of nag through ceramic filters and release of silver from nag impregnated filter disks that were prepared by dipping painting or firing in methods in that work the authors reported that ag comprised less than 1 of the total silver concentration in effluent samples regardless of the silver application method suggesting that metallic silver ag0 was the dominant form of silver during transport and release ren and smith 2013 this contrasting result could be due in part to the different type of nanoparticles evaluated in the ren and smith study proteinate coated and citrate coated nag compared to the casein coated nag used for the present work as well as the different ag detection method employed silver sulfide ion selective electrode vs ultrafiltration and icp oes analysis details on the selected effluent sample concentrations or silver ion selective electrode detection limit were not reported in the ren and smith 2013 study but ion selective electrode detection limits are typically higher than those of icp oes 9 μg l for the present study and may not be appropriate for analyzing low μg l levels of ag a recent study by meade et al 2017 showed that a silver ion selective electrode hanna hi 98185 with a manufacturer specified measurement range of 0 11 107 900 mg l did not accurately measure ag concentrations below 0 2 mg l 3 3 impact of chlorine on silver release in painted on nag disks an fcr concentration of 2 mg l increased silver release 2 5 times for painted nag disks with a di water background fig 1a however even with this increase effluent silver concentrations remained below the international maximum recommendation of 0 1 mg l application of a lower chlorine dose 0 2 mg l fcr had no measurable impact on silver release with the di water background si fig s5 for disks with a 1 mm or 10 mm nano3 background chlorine had minimal impact on silver release fig 1b c with a background of 1 mm nano3 the first 2 mg l chlorine dose resulted in a 0 008 0 025 mg l 8 26 increase in silver release but subsequent chlorine doses showed no measurable impact similarly with the highest is background solution of 10 mm nano3 the initial chlorine dose resulted in a 0 0 04 mg l 0 15 increase in silver release in a previous study that used qcm to evaluate silver nanoparticle detachment from a silica coated quartz surface bielefeldt et al 2013 observed rapid release of silver following the addition of 8 8 or 525 mg l free chlorine 83 86 removal within 3 h in that study the chlorine was prepared in di water and the findings are in agreement with the di background results from the current study presented in fig 1a exp 1 however as shown in fig 1b with a slight increase in is 1 mm the impact of chlorine on silver release was minimal the findings of the present study suggest that is rather than chlorine will influence the silver release from ceramic filters at the chlorine doses that would typically be encountered in household water treatment applications source waters are likely to contain some level of background salts as an example in a study of 989 drinking water sources across the united states the us epa found a median na concentration of 16 4 mg l and maximum value of 1541 mg l usepa 2002 source water data from countries where cwfs are more commonly used is somewhat limited but data from the global environmental monitoring system www gemstat org shows a range of na concentrations for example median and maximum na levels in tanzania source waters from 1984 were 83 and 143 mg l respectively icwrgc for ghana in 2016 median and maximum na concentrations were 18 and 40 mg l respectively icwrgc background solutions containing 1 mm and 10 mm nano3 correspond to na concentrations of 23 mg l and 230 mg l representing average and higher end concentrations in water respectively 3 4 influence of natural organic matter on silver release from painted on nag disks the presence of nom 3 mg c l suwannee river nom in 1 mm nano3 resulted in slightly decreased silver release from painted nag disks compared to 1 mm nano3 alone for the initial flushing period of 20 pvs with effluent silver concentrations dropping below 0 1 mg l after 4 5 pvs 1 5 h flushing with 3 mg c l suwannee river nom in 1 mm nano3 fig 2 and fig 1b after the initial flushing period however effluent silver levels were similar to those observed for 1 mm nano3 alone si fig s6 the addition of chlorine 4 mg l as cl2 had no measurable impact on silver release in the presence of suwannee river nom fig 2 previous work with aqueous suspensions of nag has shown that humic acid a model nom can decrease the antimicrobial activity of nag fabrega et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 likely due to the nom coating the nag surface which could have implications for filter performance rayner et al 2013b evaluated the impact of 5 mg l humic acid solutions on the log reduction values lrv of e coli from ceramic filter disks painted with argenol casein coated nag or agno3 0 003 mg ag g filter and observed no difference in lrv compared to disks exposed to 150 mg l nacl or cacl2 solutions this lack of an effect may have been due to the low painted silver concentration so further experiments are needed to evaluate the coupled impact of nom on silver release and silver effectiveness in cwfs 3 5 effect of painted on silver type agno3 and nag while the majority of factories apply nag some factories use agno3 due to lower cost and or local availability rayner et al 2013a so the effect of painted silver type nag vs agno3 on silver release in the presence of chlorine was evaluated exps 7 8 table 1 a higher amount of silver release was observed for agno3 painted filter disks compared to those painted with nag during the first 20 pvs flushing fig s7 this is in agreement with previous work by mittelman et al 2015 where agno3 painted disks exhibited greater ag release relative to casein coated nag painted disks flushed with 10 mm nano3 at ph 7 in another study by rayner et al 2013b effluent silver concentrations were 3 4 5 times higher in agno3 painted compared to nag painted filter disks after 5 h of flow 0 03 mg ag g filter ph 7 4 16 3 mm phosphate buffer solution however in the current study with a background solution of 1 mm nano3 the effluent concentration from the painted agno3 filter disk continuously decreased whereas the painted nag disk effluent silver concentrations exhibited a faster initial decrease but then stabilized fig s7a after 80 pvs 27 5 h of flushing with 1 mm nano3 and intermittent 2 mg l chlorine the effluent silver concentrations for painted agno3 and painted nag filter disks were 0 03 mg l and 0 07 mg l respectively with 10 mm nano3 background effluent silver concentrations from painted agno3 filter disks were only slightly higher than effluent silver concentrations from painted nag disks and values were similar after 40 pvs flushing fig s7b the addition of chlorine did not have a measurable impact on silver release from painted agno3 filters with background solutions of 1 mm or 10 mm nano3 effluent levels continuously decreased during intermittent chlorination 3 6 fired in vs painted on silver nanoparticles previous work suggests that adding nag prior to the firing process fired in nag results in improved retention of nag which could reduce potential exposures to nag and extend cwf lifetime compared to those prepared by painting on or dipping in an nag suspension ren and smith 2013 therefore an experiment was performed to investigate silver elution following intermittent chlorination of a fired in nag filter exp 9 table 1 the average measured solid phase silver concentration standard deviation n 3 for the fired in disk before the start of the experiment was 0 34 0 02 mg ag g filter it should be noted that a higher concentration and different nanoparticles were used for fired in nag filter disks vs painted nag filters proprietary surfactant coated nag vs casein coated nag the reason for this difference was based on the desire to test factory relevant conditions same silver source and application amount used by the factories that fire in silver nonetheless with a background solution of 10 mm nano3 the total silver nag ag release was similar for the painted on and fired in nag filter disks figs 1c and 4 during the initial 30 pvs the percentage of total silver as ag in the effluent from the fired in nag disk was higher than in the effluent from the painted on disk si fig s4 suggesting that less silver was released in nag form from the fired in nag disk under the same ionic strength background 10 mm exp 5 vs 9 si fig s8 when 2 mg l chlorine was added a slight increase in total silver release was measured in effluent from the fired in nag filter fig 4 where the effluent ag increased from 0 22 mg l to 0 27 mg l then steadily decreased back to 0 23 mg l over 8 pvs or 2 8 h subsequent chlorine addition did not affect silver release similar to the painted on nag and agno3 filter results fig 1b c 2 3 ren and smith 2013 observed substantially lower silver release from ceramic filters containing fired in proteinate coated nag at 0 05 and 0 5 mg ag g filter in their study total effluent silver concentrations ranged from 0 002 to 0 02 mg l over 6 h of flushing 0 6 1 2 ml min with a synthetic moderately hard water is 10 mm ren and smith 2013 which is 10 390 times lower than the effluent concentrations observed for a fired in nag disk in this study fig 4 over a similar time frame flow rate and is the first 6 h of flushing at 0 6 ml min is 10 mm as nano3 these differences could be due to the nanoparticle coating type proteinate coated vs the proprietary surfactant coated nag used in the current work or silver ion detection method ion selective probe vs ultrafiltration icp oes in the present study but suggest that silver release from fired in nag filters should be further evaluated in particular the release of nag versus ag 3 7 silver longevity an estimate of the lifetime of the painted or fired in nag and painted agno3 in full sized filters was performed for each condition based on 1 a worst case scenario maximum silver effluent concentration from first chlorine dose and 2 a more realistic projection based on the effluent concentration after approximately 85 pvs 30 h of flow shown in fig 5 these calculations align with the longevity calculation methods used by mittelman et al 2015 and additional details are provided in the si text s1 the worst case scenario silver lifetime estimates ranged from 0 08 to 1 6 years and estimates based on effluent concentrations after 30 h of flow ranged from 0 16 to 2 6 years for a background solution of di water with intermittent chlorination at 2 mg l as cl2 the painted nag filter lifetime ranged from 0 55 years worst case scenario to 1 8 years based on effluent after 30 h flow while the same filter with a background of 10 mm nano3 ranged from 0 10 worst case scenario to 0 17 years based on effluent after 30 h flow the filter with the highest silver mass released during the first 20 pvs was observed for the painted agno3 filter disk and a background of 10 mm nano3 which resulted in lifetime estimates of 0 08 0 16 years it is important to note that even without silver application ceramic filters can achieve 2 log e coli reduction brown and sobsey 2010 kallman et al 2011 oyanedel craver and smith 2008 rayner et al 2013b van halem et al 2007 and therefore well made filters may continue to be effective after the silver coating is depleted 4 conclusions based on the results presented herein the following conclusions can be stated ionic strength and nom increasing is 0 10 mm nano3 resulted in increased silver release which reduces silver lifespan presence of nom 3 mg c l in 1 mm nano3 resulted in slightly decreased silver release from painted nag disks during the initial flushing period 20 pvs compared to filters under the same conditions without nom after initial flushing effluent silver levels remained below 0 1 mg l and were similar to those of filter disks exposed to 1 mm nano3 alone thus it is advised to maintain the current recommendation of discarding the first three batches of filtered water which results in flushing approximately 30 l 25 pvs through a 10 l capacity filter to reduce effluent silver to below 0 1 mg l particularly if using high is water is 10 mm chlorine application of chlorine increased silver release in di water but measured concentrations did not exceed international guidelines for silver in drinking water 0 1 mg l the observed increase in silver elution due to chlorine was mitigated when using representative natural waters with is and nom based on these results we propose that the recommendation for cwf operation and maintenance be it is acceptable to use and clean cwfs with chlorinated water at recommended drinking water fcr levels e g 0 2 4 mg l however it is not recommended to clean cwfs with undiluted bleach 50 000 80 000 mg l as cl2 or concentrations greater than drinking water fcr levels e g 5 mg l as cl2 until the impacts of cleaning with higher concentrations on silver elution are evaluated silver form painted on agno 3 versus nag higher initial silver release was observed from painted on agno3 compared to painted on nag disks although this trend did not continue during long term filter use at the conditions tested in this study silver application painted on versus fired in nag total effluent silver concentrations were similar between filter disks prepared with painted on and fired in nag however the of total silver as nag was lower for the filter disk with fired in nag average 5 as nag versus painted on nag average for all painted on nag experiments 14 as nag it is important to note that only one fired in nag experiment was performed in this study with a different type and concentration of silver compared to painted on nag nevertheless this finding suggests that the fired in nag application method could reduce potential exposure to nag thus the release of nag and ag from factory manufactured fired in nag and nag painted filters needs to be further evaluated over a range of anticipated conditions to confirm these results filter quality consistent with prior research the experimental results presented herein indicate that the lifetime of silver treatment to filters ranges from a few weeks to almost two years this work supports the recommendation that silver should not be relied on as the primary mechanism of drinking water treatment in filters and the pore structure of the cwf must be the primary mechanism of water treatment it is recommended that filter quality be evaluated by testing for microbial removal prior to silver application limitations limitations of this work are that microbiological efficacy was not assessed and that experiments were not performed in replicate it is recommended that future work be conducted on silver release and microbiological efficacy including using waters with nom and that replicate tests are carried out when possible acknowledgements support for this project was provided by a grant from the national

19488,applying silver nanoparticles nag or silver nitrate agno3 to ceramic water filters improves microbiological efficacy reduces biofilm formation and protects stored water from recontamination a challenge in ceramic filter production is adding sufficient silver to achieve these goals without exceeding the maximum recommended silver concentration in drinking water silver release is affected by silver type application method and influent water chemistry despite a lack of data there is an assumption that chlorinated water should not be used as influent water because it may increase silver elution thus the objective of this work was to systematically evaluate the impact of chlorinated water 0 4 mg l free chlorine residual fcr on silver release from ceramic filter disks painted with casein coated nag painted with agno3 or containing fired in nag over a range of ionic strength is 0 10 mm as nano3 in the presence or absence of natural organic matter nom influent deionized water containing chlorine increased silver release 2 5 fold compared to controls however this effect of chlorine was mitigated at higher is 1 mm or in the presence of nom 3 mg c l for filter disks painted with nag or agno3 silver release increased with increasing is with or without chlorine and effluent concentrations remained above the world health organization who guideline of 0 1 mg l even after 30 h 80 pore volumes pvs of flow with a background solution of 10 mm nano3 silver speciation nag vs ag was monitored in effluent samples from painted or fired in nag filter disks results indicated that in general greater than 90 of the eluted silver was due to ag dissolution rather than nag release additionally a filter disk prepared with fired in nag exhibited a lower released in the nanoparticle form nag 5 of total ag in effluent compared to painted on nag nag 14 of total ag in effluent the findings of this study suggest that chlorinated influent water has minimal impact on silver elution from ceramic filters under simulated natural water conditions and thus the recommendation to avoid the use of chlorinated water with ceramic filters is not necessary under most conditions graphical

however nag is more expensive and typically needs to be imported cmwg 2011 rayner et al 2013a the current recommendation is to apply silver by painting on an nag suspension there is no existing recommendation to fire in nag due to a lack of research cmwg 2011 rayner et al 2013a the application of silver by dipping is currently not recommended because it is difficult to control the amount of

itself its release results in silver depletion from the ceramic matrix thus reducing beneficial effects with time water characteristics within a particular region can vary widely over time particularly in areas with intermittent water treatment and distribution systems unimproved water sources and in drought prone regions bielefeldt et al 2013 brown and sobsey 2010 who 2011 previous research has found that influent water chemistry including ph ionic strength is organic matter content and cation species influences silver release mittelman et al 2015 rayner et al 2013b ren and smith 2013 for example mittelman et al 2015 observed increased silver elution with increasing is 1 50 mm nano3 decreasing ph from ph values of 9 5 and presence of divalent cations ca2 and mg2 using ceramic filter disks painted with casein coated nag or agno3 in that study greater than 90 of eluted silver was in the ionic form ag rather than the nanoparticle nag and the highest amount of nag release occurred within the first 5 h 15 pore volumes pvs of flushing and represented less than 1 of the total silver mass released current recommendations suggest discarding the first three batches of filtered water approximately 30 l or 25 pvs for a 10 l capacity filter pot from cwfs due in part to this higher initial silver release cmwg 2011 the laboratory study by mittelman et al showed that effluent silver levels did not drop below the who us epa recommended level of 0 1 mg l until being flushed with 30 42 pvs of 10 mm nano3 at ph 7 mittelman et al 2015 when the ph was decreased from 7 to 5 in the presence of divalent ca2 mg2 cations or when is was increased from 10 mm to 50 mm nano3 effluent silver levels increased to 5 10 times the who us epa guideline 0 1 mg l within 10 20 pvs of flushing currently the recommendation is to not use or clean cwfs with chlorinated water as it is generally assumed that chlorine will strip silver from the filter cmwg 2011 this poses concern for recommending cwf use in urban and peri urban areas that may have intermittent chlorination and microbiologically contaminated drinking water kumpel and nelson 2013 2016 or in areas where household water treatment with chlorine is widely promoted the recommended free chlorine residual fcr concentration in drinking water varies based on distribution system type and place of treatment who 2011 because water quality characteristics can impact chlorination efficacy which is increased at lower ph and decreased in the presence of natural organic matter nom which exerts chlorine demand benjamin and lawler 2013 who 2011 in centrally treated infrastructure piped water systems the who recommends an fcr of 0 2 0 5 mg l at the endpoints water taps and stipulates a health based limit of 5 0 mg l who 2011 in some systems water may be intermittently chlorinated under or over treated or have leaks within or unregulated withdrawals from the system all of these factors may impact fcr concentrations kumpel and nelson 2013 2016 for water chlorination at the household level a chlorine dose of 2 0 mg l is recommended for clear water 10 nephelometric turbidity units ntu to maintain an fcr of 0 2 mg l while twice that dose 4 0 mg l as cl2 is recommended for turbid waters 10 ntu who 2011 thus cwfs may be used with water containing between 0 and 5 mg l fcr and the chlorine concentration may not be known at any given time research on the impact of chlorination on silver elution from cwfs is limited bielefeldt et al 2013 evaluated the impact of chlorine 8 8 mg l or 525 mg l ph 4 5 9 5 on total silver release from nag applied ceramic surfaces using a quartz crystal microbalance qcm a technique that can be used to rapidly assess small molecule and particle deposition behavior for a range of chemical and flow conditions the authors used silica coated quartz sensors because the crystalline sio2 material was the closest commercially available qcm sensor material to represent the alumino silicate surfaces in cwfs bielefeldt et al 2013 among the parameters evaluated by bielefeldt and colleagues ph is chlorine turbidity and nom chlorine was found to have the greatest impact on silver release an average of 83 and 86 silver removal after the addition of 8 8 mg l and 525 mg l free chlorine respectively after less than 3 h of flow which was attributed to oxidation reactions and enhanced dissolution of ag ions bielefeldt et al 2013 this finding suggests that contact between silver containing cwfs and chlorine could result in decreased disinfection effectiveness over time from the loss of silver and that chlorine solutions should not be used to clean silver containing cwfs however this study was limited by several factors 1 the fluid dynamics of qcm sensors are not representative of flow through a porous ceramic filter 2 a ceramic filter could not be used as the surface material 3 chlorine solutions were only prepared in deionized water 4 effluent silver concentrations were not measured nor was the form of silver determined i e nag vs ag and 5 the impact of chlorine at recommended drinking water fcr concentrations 0 5 mg l was not evaluated previous studies have demonstrated that increasing is can increase silver elution from nag or agno3 painted filters mittelman et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge the coupled effect of is and chlorine on silver release from cwfs has not been investigated nom which is ubiquitous in natural water sources can also affect the fate and transport of nag past work has demonstrated increased stability and mobility of nag through porous media in the presence of nom delay et al 2011 fabrega et al 2009 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 another important factor in filter performance and effluent water quality is the form of released silver ionic vs nanoparticle because the antimicrobial activity of nag is thought to result from the dissolution of ag choi et al 2008 lok et al 2007 xiu et al 2012 the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate silver dissolution and release of silver ions and nanoparticles from ceramic filter disks exposed to intermittently chlorinated water containing 0 4 mg l fcr 2 determine the impact of is as nano3 on silver dissolution and release from disks and 3 predict the lifetime of the silver as a function of chlorine and is three different silver application methods were tested disks painted with nag disks painted with agno3 and disks containing fired in nag 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ceramic filter disks 10 cm diameter 1 5 cm thick manufactured by advanced ceramics manufacturing acm tucson az following established protocols were used for one dimensional transport experiments ceramic disks were used instead of full sized filters to allow for controlled transport studies and to simplify manufacturing and test methods briefly clay was imported from a tanzanian factory and pine sawdust burn out material was purchased from pallet recyclers tucson az sawdust was sieved between us no 30 and no 60 mesh sieves 0 595 and 0 251 mm openings respectively prior to mixing with clay the mass ratio of sawdust to clay was 4 which provided an estimated flow rate equivalent to 2 3 l h in a full sized filter this estimated flow rate was calculated by scaling the surface area of the disks to the surface area region exposed to fluid of the full sized filter see supporting information si text s1 using dimensions of a frustum shaped full sized filter van halem 2006 and resulting falling head flow rate tests performed by acm on the newly manufactured filter disks the sawdust to clay ratio used in this study corresponds to the lower end of ratios used by factories who report adding 5 25 by weight to the filter mixture cmwg 2011 the amount of burn out material selected for this research was based on several factors including clay characteristics mesh used to screen sawdust firing temperature and reported filter mixture recipe from the factory that provided clays disks were formed with a hydraulic press and then fired in a furnace the temperature was gradually increased to 900 c and held for 60 min before cooling characterization of the filters porosity non reactive tracer transport cation exchange capacity was previously reported mittelman et al 2015 to compare the impact of painting vs firing in nag an experiment was carried out using one ceramic disk containing a proprietary amount of fired in nag this disk contained the same amount of silver used by some factories in haiti tanzania and the dominican republic and is similar to the higher end concentration 0 5 mg ag g filter evaluated by ren and smith 2013 however it is important to note that a higher concentration and different type of nag was used for the fired in method than for the painted nag filters 0 03 mg ag g filter in the present study the reason for this difference was the desire to use factory relevant conditions same silver source and application amount used by the factories that fire in silver these filters were prepared by gradually adding a suspension of silver nano powder type s2 80 ames goldsmith corp glens falls ny to the same type of dry clay and sawdust material mixture used for the filters without nag prior to firing the s2 80 nanoparticles coated with a proprietary surfactant have an average particle size of 80 nm as determined by the manufacturer using scanning electron microscopy other than the addition of nag these filters were manufactured identically to the other disks used in this study upon receipt from acm disks were reduced to 5 cm in diameter to fit existing holders oyanedel craver and smith 2008 using a hole saw and sterilized by heating at 550 c for 30 min the weight of the resulting filters was 45 0 2 g casein coated silver nanoparticles nag were obtained from argenol laboratories zaragoza spain in powder form 71 75 silver by weight these nanoparticles have a mean diameter of 45 nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy kallman et al 2011 silver nitrate agno3 99 9 metals basis was obtained from alfaaesar ward hill ma suwannee river natural organic matter srnom reverse osmosis ro isolate was purchased from the international humic substances society ihss st paul mn sodium hypochlorite 5 25 for chlorine dosing solutions was obtained from val tech diagnostics inc brackenridge pa 2 2 silver dissolution and release experiments a 200 mg l as total ag silver solution or suspension was prepared using previously described methods mittelman et al 2015 briefly agno3 or casein coated nag solid was weighed added to a known volume of di water and adjusted to ph 7 00 0 05 using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hno3 a teflontm coated paint brush shur line mooresville nc was used to apply 3 ml to each of the top and bottom surfaces 6 ml total applied resulting in the recommended silver application of 0 03 mg ag g filter proposed by the ceramic manufacturing working group cmwg 2011 more recent work has suggested revising this recommendation to 0 3 mg ag g for nag application only but not for agno3 rayner et al 2013b the experiments described herein used the current 0 03 mg ag g recommendation as a basis for painted nag and agno3 application as this is the amount used by the majority of factories after painting with agno3 or nag disks were air dried for 12 h placed in modified polycarbonate membrane holders model 420400 whatman uk oyanedel craver and smith 2008 and sealed with silicone glue and neoprene o rings mcmaster carr elmhurst il at the top and bottom of the disk to prevent the injected solutions from flowing around the disks a total of nine filter disk experiments were conducted with nine new filters to assess the impact of transient chlorine concentrations is and nom on silver release and dissolution from filter disks painted with agno3 n 2 or casein coated nag n 6 or from a filter containing fired in nag n 1 as shown in table 1 is was adjusted using 1 or 10 mm nano3 the na form was selected as a common monovalent cation and to avoid the effect of increased silver release from the presence of divalent cations shown previously by mittelman et al 2015 each silver release experiment began with approximately 20 pvs of flushing 7 h 240 ml with the corresponding background solution di water 1 mm nano3 or 10 mm nano3 at ph 7 using a masterflex peristaltic pump cole parmer vernon hills il at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min followed by the introduction of solutions containing free chlorine 0 2 2 or 4 mg l as cl2 depending on the experiment samples were exposed to three cycles of intermittent chlorination e g 0 mg l as cl2 for 20 pvs followed by 2 mg l as cl2 for 20 pvs then 0 2 0 2 and 0 mg l as cl2 for 10 pvs each filter effluent samples were collected in 15 or 50 ml polystyrene centrifuge tubes vwr international radnor pa every 10 min for the first 30 pvs 6 ml or 0 5 pvs per sample and then every 60 min for remainder of the experiment 36 ml or 3 pvs per sample using a cf 2 spectrachrom fraction collector spectrum laboratories inc rancho dominguez ca and analyzed for total ag and ag the chlorine concentration in the stock solution val tech sodium hypochlorite 5 25 was measured using a digital titrator and hach method 8209 free and total chlorine concentrations in the influent solution and effluent samples were measured using a lamotte colorimeter and dpd 1 and 3 instrument grade tablets lamotte company chestertown md to monitor for potential degradation of chlorine and reactions between chlorine and the ceramic material the influent chlorine solutions were confirmed to contain only free chlorine i e no combined chlorine chloramines by analyzing for both free and total chlorine and verifying that free chlorine concentration equaled total chlorine concentration chlorine concentrations in the influent solution were stable for the duration of the experiment e g for 2 mg l influent solutions average standard deviation 2 04 0 05 mg l cl2 except for the dosing solution containing srnom where a decrease in chlorine concentration over time was expected due to reaction with nom in that case the chlorine concentration was monitored throughout the injection sequence and fresh solutions were prepared for each intermittent chlorine dosing si fig s1 2 3 analytical methods the hydrodynamic diameter and electrophoretic mobility of nag suspensions were measured with a malvern zetasizer malvern worcestershire uk using dynamic light scattering dls and laser doppler velocimetry respectively these measurements were carried out in triplicate at 25 c using a measurement angle of 173 backscatter electrophoretic mobility measurements were converted into zeta potential values using the smoluchowski approximation smoluchowski 1917 silver concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 7300 dv perkinelmer waltham ma the detection limit for ag by icp oes was determined to be 9 μg l based on the method of hubaux and vos 1970 in a subset of effluent samples dissolved silver ag was separated from nag by centrifugation at 2500 g in ultrafiltration units amicon 3k millipore billerica ma the filtrate was then analyzed by icp oes to determine the silver speciation ag vs total ag the solid phase silver concentration in unused fired in nag disks was measured by microwave assisted acid digestion discover sp d cem corp matthews nc with concentrated nitric acid tracemetal grade fisher scientific waltham ma followed by analysis for silver by icp oes three extractions were performed on each solid sample to ensure that all retained silver was extracted i e acid digest removed for analysis sample rinsed 3 with di water fresh nitric acid added digestion repeated process repeated until no silver detected in acid digest on average the first extraction recovered 79 1 of the total extracted silver and the first and second extractions together recovered 94 1 of the total extracted silver 2 4 longevity analysis time to silver depletion was estimated using a constant flow rate of 0 6 ml min under two general conditions 1 a worst case scenario based on the mass of silver remaining after the initial flushing period of 20 pvs 7 h and the maximum silver effluent concentration from chlorine addition and 2 a more realistic estimate based on the mass of silver remaining and effluent concentration at 85 pvs 30 h the water volume to silver depletion in disks was converted to full sized filter volume 10 l capacity by scaling the surface area exposed to flow and equating pore volumes i e 12 ml in disk and 1 2 l in pot water volume was converted to years assuming use of 1 full filter day the longevity calculations are based on the methods used by mittelman et al 2015 and additional details are provided in si text s1 3 results discussion 3 1 ceramic filter and nanoparticle characterization the average pore volume pvs standard deviation of ceramic filter disks used in this study was 12 3 0 6 ml additional characterization was carried out in previous work using a batch of filters produced with the same materials by the same manufacturer under the same conditions mittelman et al 2015 filter disk porosity was determined to be 41 9 0 8 using mercury porosimetry and the filter disks contained a range of pore sizes approximately 35 pore diameters 20 nm 10 between 20 nm and 1 μm 45 between 1 μm and 30 μm and 10 30 μm the average standard deviation hydrodynamic diameter of the casein coated nag in di water was 58 7 nm as measured by dls and the average standard deviation zeta potential was 41 6 3 5 mv to evaluate the effect of chlorine on silver dissolution and release from ceramic filters experiments were performed with intermittent chlorination as a function of is silver type and application method painted nag or agno3 and fired in nag and in the presence of nom table 1 3 2 impact of ionic strength on silver release in painted on nag disks an increase in is from 0 to 10 mm nano3 resulted in increased silver release for ceramic disks painted with nag fig 1 after the initial flush of 20 pvs 7 h the effluent silver concentrations were 0 022 0 096 and 0 27 mg l for background solutions of di water 1 mm nano3 and 10 mm nano3 respectively the highest silver release occurred within the first 20 pvs 7 h accounting for 1 8 8 7 of the total applied ag si fig s2 the effluent silver fell below the who us epa guideline value of 0 1 mg l after 4 3 pvs 1 5 h of di water flushing fig 1a and 14 6 pvs 5 h for 1 mm nano3 fig 1b with a background of 10 mm nano3 and intermittent chlorination exposure the effluent silver concentration remained above 0 1 mg l at the completion of the experiment total ag 0 15 mg l at 84 pvs or 29 h fig 1c in a separate control experiment 10 mm nano3 no chlorine the effluent silver concentration fell below 0 1 mg l after 78 4 pvs 27 h of flushing with 10 mm nano3 si fig s3 the effluent silver concentrations in the first 180 min of flushing painted nag disks with a 10 mm is background ranged from 0 17 to 1 4 mg l fig 1c and s3 which were similar to the effluent levels observed by ren and smith 2013 for filter disks painted with argenol proteinate coated nag and exposed to the same flow rate is and time period effluent concentrations ranged from 0 2 to 2 mg l in selected effluent samples obtained from ceramic disks painted with nag or containing fired in nag both ag and total ag nag ag were measured to determine the silver speciation ag concentrations shown as symbol in figs 1 2 and 4 and s3 on average the ag comprised 90 of the total eluted ag si fig s4 suggesting that silver release was predominantly due to dissolution of the silver ion rather than release of nag the lowest release of nag highest ag was observed in the fired in nag filter disk effluent exp 9 average ag total ag 95 whereas the highest release of nag was observed during the first 40 pvs of flushing an nag painted filter with a background solution consisting of di water and 2 mg l cl2 intermittent chlorination exp 1 48 72 ag total ag other than exp 1 elution of ag versus nag varied throughout each experiment with no clear relationship between flushing time chlorination or water chemistry on the ratio of ag versus nag the speciation results of the present study are in agreement with previous research that showed primarily ag release 90 from ceramic filters painted with argenol casein coated nag and exposed to solutions with varying is 1 50 mm cations na mg2 ca2 and ph 5 9 mittelman et al 2015 however ren and smith 2013 observed the opposite trend in a study investigating the transport of nag through ceramic filters and release of silver from nag impregnated filter disks that were prepared by dipping painting or firing in methods in that work the authors reported that ag comprised less than 1 of the total silver concentration in effluent samples regardless of the silver application method suggesting that metallic silver ag0 was the dominant form of silver during transport and release ren and smith 2013 this contrasting result could be due in part to the different type of nanoparticles evaluated in the ren and smith study proteinate coated and citrate coated nag compared to the casein coated nag used for the present work as well as the different ag detection method employed silver sulfide ion selective electrode vs ultrafiltration and icp oes analysis details on the selected effluent sample concentrations or silver ion selective electrode detection limit were not reported in the ren and smith 2013 study but ion selective electrode detection limits are typically higher than those of icp oes 9 μg l for the present study and may not be appropriate for analyzing low μg l levels of ag a recent study by meade et al 2017 showed that a silver ion selective electrode hanna hi 98185 with a manufacturer specified measurement range of 0 11 107 900 mg l did not accurately measure ag concentrations below 0 2 mg l 3 3 impact of chlorine on silver release in painted on nag disks an fcr concentration of 2 mg l increased silver release 2 5 times for painted nag disks with a di water background fig 1a however even with this increase effluent silver concentrations remained below the international maximum recommendation of 0 1 mg l application of a lower chlorine dose 0 2 mg l fcr had no measurable impact on silver release with the di water background si fig s5 for disks with a 1 mm or 10 mm nano3 background chlorine had minimal impact on silver release fig 1b c with a background of 1 mm nano3 the first 2 mg l chlorine dose resulted in a 0 008 0 025 mg l 8 26 increase in silver release but subsequent chlorine doses showed no measurable impact similarly with the highest is background solution of 10 mm nano3 the initial chlorine dose resulted in a 0 0 04 mg l 0 15 increase in silver release in a previous study that used qcm to evaluate silver nanoparticle detachment from a silica coated quartz surface bielefeldt et al 2013 observed rapid release of silver following the addition of 8 8 or 525 mg l free chlorine 83 86 removal within 3 h in that study the chlorine was prepared in di water and the findings are in agreement with the di background results from the current study presented in fig 1a exp 1 however as shown in fig 1b with a slight increase in is 1 mm the impact of chlorine on silver release was minimal the findings of the present study suggest that is rather than chlorine will influence the silver release from ceramic filters at the chlorine doses that would typically be encountered in household water treatment applications source waters are likely to contain some level of background salts as an example in a study of 989 drinking water sources across the united states the us epa found a median na concentration of 16 4 mg l and maximum value of 1541 mg l usepa 2002 source water data from countries where cwfs are more commonly used is somewhat limited but data from the global environmental monitoring system www gemstat org shows a range of na concentrations for example median and maximum na levels in tanzania source waters from 1984 were 83 and 143 mg l respectively icwrgc for ghana in 2016 median and maximum na concentrations were 18 and 40 mg l respectively icwrgc background solutions containing 1 mm and 10 mm nano3 correspond to na concentrations of 23 mg l and 230 mg l representing average and higher end concentrations in water respectively 3 4 influence of natural organic matter on silver release from painted on nag disks the presence of nom 3 mg c l suwannee river nom in 1 mm nano3 resulted in slightly decreased silver release from painted nag disks compared to 1 mm nano3 alone for the initial flushing period of 20 pvs with effluent silver concentrations dropping below 0 1 mg l after 4 5 pvs 1 5 h flushing with 3 mg c l suwannee river nom in 1 mm nano3 fig 2 and fig 1b after the initial flushing period however effluent silver levels were similar to those observed for 1 mm nano3 alone si fig s6 the addition of chlorine 4 mg l as cl2 had no measurable impact on silver release in the presence of suwannee river nom fig 2 previous work with aqueous suspensions of nag has shown that humic acid a model nom can decrease the antimicrobial activity of nag fabrega et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 likely due to the nom coating the nag surface which could have implications for filter performance rayner et al 2013b evaluated the impact of 5 mg l humic acid solutions on the log reduction values lrv of e coli from ceramic filter disks painted with argenol casein coated nag or agno3 0 003 mg ag g filter and observed no difference in lrv compared to disks exposed to 150 mg l nacl or cacl2 solutions this lack of an effect may have been due to the low painted silver concentration so further experiments are needed to evaluate the coupled impact of nom on silver release and silver effectiveness in cwfs 3 5 effect of painted on silver type agno3 and nag while the majority of factories apply nag some factories use agno3 due to lower cost and or local availability rayner et al 2013a so the effect of painted silver type nag vs agno3 on silver release in the presence of chlorine was evaluated exps 7 8 table 1 a higher amount of silver release was observed for agno3 painted filter disks compared to those painted with nag during the first 20 pvs flushing fig s7 this is in agreement with previous work by mittelman et al 2015 where agno3 painted disks exhibited greater ag release relative to casein coated nag painted disks flushed with 10 mm nano3 at ph 7 in another study by rayner et al 2013b effluent silver concentrations were 3 4 5 times higher in agno3 painted compared to nag painted filter disks after 5 h of flow 0 03 mg ag g filter ph 7 4 16 3 mm phosphate buffer solution however in the current study with a background solution of 1 mm nano3 the effluent concentration from the painted agno3 filter disk continuously decreased whereas the painted nag disk effluent silver concentrations exhibited a faster initial decrease but then stabilized fig s7a after 80 pvs 27 5 h of flushing with 1 mm nano3 and intermittent 2 mg l chlorine the effluent silver concentrations for painted agno3 and painted nag filter disks were 0 03 mg l and 0 07 mg l respectively with 10 mm nano3 background effluent silver concentrations from painted agno3 filter disks were only slightly higher than effluent silver concentrations from painted nag disks and values were similar after 40 pvs flushing fig s7b the addition of chlorine did not have a measurable impact on silver release from painted agno3 filters with background solutions of 1 mm or 10 mm nano3 effluent levels continuously decreased during intermittent chlorination 3 6 fired in vs painted on silver nanoparticles previous work suggests that adding nag prior to the firing process fired in nag results in improved retention of nag which could reduce potential exposures to nag and extend cwf lifetime compared to those prepared by painting on or dipping in an nag suspension ren and smith 2013 therefore an experiment was performed to investigate silver elution following intermittent chlorination of a fired in nag filter exp 9 table 1 the average measured solid phase silver concentration standard deviation n 3 for the fired in disk before the start of the experiment was 0 34 0 02 mg ag g filter it should be noted that a higher concentration and different nanoparticles were used for fired in nag filter disks vs painted nag filters proprietary surfactant coated nag vs casein coated nag the reason for this difference was based on the desire to test factory relevant conditions same silver source and application amount used by the factories that fire in silver nonetheless with a background solution of 10 mm nano3 the total silver nag ag release was similar for the painted on and fired in nag filter disks figs 1c and 4 during the initial 30 pvs the percentage of total silver as ag in the effluent from the fired in nag disk was higher than in the effluent from the painted on disk si fig s4 suggesting that less silver was released in nag form from the fired in nag disk under the same ionic strength background 10 mm exp 5 vs 9 si fig s8 when 2 mg l chlorine was added a slight increase in total silver release was measured in effluent from the fired in nag filter fig 4 where the effluent ag increased from 0 22 mg l to 0 27 mg l then steadily decreased back to 0 23 mg l over 8 pvs or 2 8 h subsequent chlorine addition did not affect silver release similar to the painted on nag and agno3 filter results fig 1b c 2 3 ren and smith 2013 observed substantially lower silver release from ceramic filters containing fired in proteinate coated nag at 0 05 and 0 5 mg ag g filter in their study total effluent silver concentrations ranged from 0 002 to 0 02 mg l over 6 h of flushing 0 6 1 2 ml min with a synthetic moderately hard water is 10 mm ren and smith 2013 which is 10 390 times lower than the effluent concentrations observed for a fired in nag disk in this study fig 4 over a similar time frame flow rate and is the first 6 h of flushing at 0 6 ml min is 10 mm as nano3 these differences could be due to the nanoparticle coating type proteinate coated vs the proprietary surfactant coated nag used in the current work or silver ion detection method ion selective probe vs ultrafiltration icp oes in the present study but suggest that silver release from fired in nag filters should be further evaluated in particular the release of nag versus ag 3 7 silver longevity an estimate of the lifetime of the painted or fired in nag and painted agno3 in full sized filters was performed for each condition based on 1 a worst case scenario maximum silver effluent concentration from first chlorine dose and 2 a more realistic projection based on the effluent concentration after approximately 85 pvs 30 h of flow shown in fig 5 these calculations align with the longevity calculation methods used by mittelman et al 2015 and additional details are provided in the si text s1 the worst case scenario silver lifetime estimates ranged from 0 08 to 1 6 years and estimates based on effluent concentrations after 30 h of flow ranged from 0 16 to 2 6 years for a background solution of di water with intermittent chlorination at 2 mg l as cl2 the painted nag filter lifetime ranged from 0 55 years worst case scenario to 1 8 years based on effluent after 30 h flow while the same filter with a background of 10 mm nano3 ranged from 0 10 worst case scenario to 0 17 years based on effluent after 30 h flow the filter with the highest silver mass released during the first 20 pvs was observed for the painted agno3 filter disk and a background of 10 mm nano3 which resulted in lifetime estimates of 0 08 0 16 years it is important to note that even without silver application ceramic filters can achieve 2 log e coli reduction brown and sobsey 2010 kallman et al 2011 oyanedel craver and smith 2008 rayner et al 2013b van halem et al 2007 and therefore well made filters may continue to be effective after the silver coating is depleted 4 conclusions based on the results presented herein the following conclusions can be stated ionic strength and nom increasing is 0 10 mm nano3 resulted in increased silver release which reduces silver lifespan presence of nom 3 mg c l in 1 mm nano3 resulted in slightly decreased silver release from painted nag disks during the initial flushing period 20 pvs compared to filters under the same conditions without nom after initial flushing effluent silver levels remained below 0 1 mg l and were similar to those of filter disks exposed to 1 mm nano3 alone thus it is advised to maintain the current recommendation of discarding the first three batches of filtered water which results in flushing approximately 30 l 25 pvs through a 10 l capacity filter to reduce effluent silver to below 0 1 mg l particularly if using high is water is 10 mm chlorine application of chlorine increased silver release in di water but measured concentrations did not exceed international guidelines for silver in drinking water 0 1 mg l the observed increase in silver elution due to chlorine was mitigated when using representative natural waters with is and nom based on these results we propose that the recommendation for cwf operation and maintenance be it is acceptable to use and clean cwfs with chlorinated water at recommended drinking water fcr levels e g 0 2 4 mg l however it is not recommended to clean cwfs with undiluted bleach 50 000 80 000 mg l as cl2 or concentrations greater than drinking water fcr levels e g 5 mg l as cl2 until the impacts of cleaning with higher concentrations on silver elution are evaluated silver form painted on agno 3 versus nag higher initial silver release was observed from painted on agno3 compared to painted on nag disks although this trend did not continue during long term filter use at the conditions tested in this study silver application painted on versus fired in nag total effluent silver concentrations were similar between filter disks prepared with painted on and fired in nag however the of total silver as nag was lower for the filter disk with fired in nag average 5 as nag versus painted on nag average for all painted on nag experiments 14 as nag it is important to note that only one fired in nag experiment was performed in this study with a different type and concentration of silver compared to painted on nag nevertheless this finding suggests that the fired in nag application method could reduce potential exposure to nag thus the release of nag and ag from factory manufactured fired in nag and nag painted filters needs to be further evaluated over a range of anticipated conditions to confirm these results filter quality consistent with prior research the experimental results presented herein indicate that the lifetime of silver treatment to filters ranges from a few weeks to almost two years this work supports the recommendation that silver should not be relied on as the primary mechanism of drinking water treatment in filters and the pore structure of the cwf must be the primary mechanism of water treatment it is recommended that filter quality be evaluated by testing for microbial removal prior to silver application limitations

19489,this study visually tracked the micro spatial water distribution in bio flocs of waste activated sludge through in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography primarily the two fractions of bound water the vicinal water adhering to the surface of organic compositions and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like structure of bio flocs were proposed based on the cross section imaging results furthermore the determinants on bound water occurrences were explored in terms of viscoelastic acoustic responses of extracellular polymeric substances eps the joint roles of hydrophilic substance removal eps aggregation compaction and colloidal instability of sludge flocs in bound water reduction were confirmed by the strong correlations pearson correlation coefficient rp

interstitial water were proposed to be the contributions of eps on bound water occurrences graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering x ray cmt eps 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is the most frequently employed technology in wastewater treatment plants due to its high adaptability to influent quality flexible operation mode and stable process performance mahmoud et al 2013 however a large amount of inevitable by product waste activated sludge was is produced and becomes a significant challenge in the sustainable development of biological wastewater treatments as the primary step for sludge treatment dewatering can minimize the sludge volume increase the energy utilization efficiency facilitate the transportation and even reduce the leachate production in the sludge landfill sites mahmoud et al 2013 wong et al 2016 however sludge is difficult to be dewatered directly due to the highly hydrated colloidal structures of microbial aggregates christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the presence of organic phase in sludge makes a certain part of water embedded in a bio polymeric network and behave very differently from the bulk water heukelekian and weisberg 1956 this portion of water is commonly termed as bound water smollen 1990 vesilind 1994 the differentiation of bound water and non bound water free water is desirable for predicting the water removal efficiency during mechanical dewatering process and the potential energy consumption during drying process many efforts have been donated to the differentiation and quantification of bound water in the floc structures of sludge primarily the energy definition was proposed by catalano et al catalano 1970 in this context an interaction energy is defined as the energy necessary to break the binding of water to solid material the states of water in solids as water bound with x kcal mol therefore lee 1996 proposed that the capability of bound water to resist freezing under low temperatures is attributed to the lowering of its thermodynamic activity by the water solid bond strength accordingly a quantification method of bound water based on the measurement of unfrozen water at the specific freezing temperature 20 c was established and widely accepted for the quantification of bound water in sludge colin and gazbar 1995 he et al 2015 lee 1996 smith and vesilind 1995 wu et al 1998 however the possible different bound water fractions cannot be identified by the energy definition therefore vesilind et al vesilind 1994 further distinguished the classifications of bound water in sludge based on arbitrary hypotheses called operational definition the operational definition regards the water that can be eliminated by simple thickening or by the application of weak mechanical strains as free water bound water is the water fixed to solid phase by chemical bindings hydrogen bond physical adsorption and mechanical capture in both micro and macrocapillaries of capillaryporous bodies and is hard to be removed from the sludge body using mechanical means of dewatering according to the above interactions between bound water and sludge floc structure vesilind et al vesilind 1994 moller et al möller 1983 and smollen et al smollen 1988 further refined the four water fractions as free or bulk water interstitial water vicinal water and water of hydration however no direct visualization of the above four water fractions was reported and the difference in the spatial distribution of water fractions with different binding forms to solid phase has never been documented since the conversion of bound water into free water should be the key point to realize the enhanced dewatering of sludge he et al 2015 lee 1996 wu et al 1998 it is also meaningful to investigate the determinants on bound water occurrences except for tracking its transformation during conditioning processes recently an increasing attention has been paid to the significant roles of extracellular polymeric substances eps in maintaining the colloidal structure of sludge and binding a large amount of water in the floc structures christensen et al 2015 han et al 2017 sheng et al 2006 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the matrix of eps is formed by different biochemicals secreted by microbes release of cellular material products by cell lysis and adsorption of organic matter in the medium eps distributes throughout the was flocs and plays important roles in protecting cells from harmful environmental effects responding to changes in environment and also determining various surface properties of sludge flocs such as hydrophilicity hydrophobicity charge characteristics and flocculation properties liao et al 2001 sheng et al 2006 wu et al 2017a in addition the eps influenced rheological properties of was including viscosity gel stability of bio flocs and pore structure of dewatered sludge cake are also found to be closely related to the dewatering behavior cao et al 2018 dursun and dentel 2009 therefore it can be inferred that the interactions between water and sludge flocs are actually mainly controlled by eps and the multifold characteristics of eps may also contribute to the different fractions of bound water however to our best knowledge how eps influence the occurrences of bound water fixed in the biological agglomeration was not well understood to address these problems the present study was first aimed at tracking the different conditioning approaches induced transformations of bound water occurrence by in situ visualization technique then quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d analysis was conducted to refine the bound water organic phase interactions based on the viscoelastic acoustic response of the dominant compositions controlling the colloidal properties of was eps finally the correspondences among bound water contents and eps physiochemical properties was established to reveal the potential roles of eps on the transformation of bound water in bio flocs of was all these results are believed to provide mechanism insights into bound water fractioning and also a promising pathway to realize the theoretically distinct bound water fractions 2 materials and methods 2 1 was was was collected from the secondary settling tank of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant using anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process three samples for triplicate studies were collected at 24 h intervals at the same time during the day from the wastewater treatment plant there was no rainfall on the sampling days the concentrated sludge sample had a ph of 6 85 0 05 moisture content of 99 12 0 02 total solids ts of 8 88 0 17 g l volatile solids vs of 6 23 0 02 g l capillary suction time cst of 79 3 7 7 s it was stored at 4 c before use all experiments were conducted within 5 days guo et al 2018 wu et al 2017a 2 2 typical procedures for sludge conditioning three typical conditioning approaches for sludge dewaterability improvement including coagulation flocculation and advanced oxidation process aop were all conducted to analyze the differences in their effects on physiochemical and micromechanical properties of eps the poly aluminum chloride pacl and cationic polyacrylamide cpam were selected as coagulant and flocculant respectively the predetermined dosages of pacl for four samples were 0 5 wt dry sludge ds 1 wt ds 3 wt ds and 5 wt ds respectively and the dosages of cpam for flocculation were 0 1 wt ds 0 3 wt ds 0 5 wt ds and 1 wt ds respectively the protocol for aop treatment was according to our previous work wu and chai 2016 cao2 was selected as the aop reagent and the addition ratio of fe ii and cao2 was set as 12 5 mmol g 0 025 g gds 0 05 g gds 0 075 g gds and 0 10 g gds cao2 were spiked in four sludge samples under magnetic stirring 300 rpm for 30 min respectively after ph of sludge was first adjusted to 3 by adding 3 mol l hcl and then fe ii feso4 with the corresponding dosage was added the sludge samples after the above pretreatments would be subjected to the dewaterability evaluation in terms of cst bound water analysis and eps extraction 2 3 analysis on bound water 2 3 1 bound water quantification the dilatometric technique was modified to measure bound water in raw and pretreated sludge according to the methods proposed by heukelekian and weisberg 1956 in brief the hydraulic oil was selected as the indicator fluid the dilatometer was filled with the sludge sample and the indicator fluid after that the dilatometer was immersed in the cold bath consisting of 50 wt ethanol solution to allow the temperature decrease to 10 c and the corresponding dilatometric reading was recorded then the sludge samples were further frozen at the temperature well below the freezing point typically 20 c and the dilatometric reading was also recorded knowing both the coefficient of contraction for the indicator fluid and the coefficient of expansion for the water the quantity of frozen water or free water in the system could be calculated the difference between the total water content and the free water content should be the bound water content 2 3 2 bound water visualization x ray can be a useful tool to realize the microtomography of an opaque solid liquid mixture of was due to its strong transmissive ability and the high energy x ray generated from synchrotron x ray source provides the possibility of the high resolution visualization of was therefore in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography cmt imaging technique was used to realize the visualization of bound water in sludge the raw sludge and sludge samples with the largest reagent dosages of the three above mentioned conditioning approaches were selected as imaging objects the three parallel samples were first well mixed and then loaded into capillaries with 0 5 mm diameter and then subjected to cmt imaging respectively before that 2 wt ki was added into sludge samples to increase the contrast between water phase and solid phase of sludge simultaneously with minimizing the influence on cellular osmotic pressure cmt experiments were performed at ambient conditions using high resolution cmt at the tomography beamline bl13w1 at shanghai synchrotron radiation facility with the photon energy of 13 kev a 0 6656 mm wide 1 mm high beam passes through a sample and collides against a csi scintillator and an optical lens coupled to a charge coupled device ccd camera binned to 2048 2048 pixels each tomogram was reconstructed by filtered back projection using the software pitre beamline bl13w1 shanghai synchrotron radiation facility from 900 projections collected over a 360 sample rotation with an exposure time of 4 s per projection each stack of two dimensional 2d images was later converted into a three dimensional 3d volume using the software amira 5 4 3 visage imaging inc richmond australia the reconstructed 3d image contains 600 slices of 2048 2048 pixels with an isotropic resolution size of 0 325 μm 2 4 eps extraction and composition analysis the eps extraction of sludge samples using centrifugation as well as ultrasonication was modified based on the procedures reported in previous studies mahmoud et al 2010 wu et al 2016a xu et al 2018 sludge was firstly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was termed soluble eps 0 5 wt nacl solution was added to re suspend the sludge pellets to the original volumes to prevent cell lysis then the samples were subjected to ultrasonication 40 khz and 120 w for 2 min and centrifuged at 20000 g for 20 min at 4 c the organic matter in the collected supernatant was termed as bound eps and the remaining sediment was the pellet the extracted eps solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm hydrophilic nylon filter millipore co usa to remove the possible suspended sludge floc particles the bound eps hereinafter referred to as eps were used as the objectives in the subsequent physicochemical and micromechanical property analysis polysaccharide and protein levels of eps were measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the modified lowry folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard bo et al 1996 gaudy 1962 respectively 2 5 zeta potential and size distribution of eps extracts according to the eps extraction method described in the above section the background solutions of all the eps extracts should be consistent and all the properties of eps should be determined by the added conditioning reagents therefore zeta potentials and size distribution of eps extracts were directly measured by electrophoresis and dynamic laser scattering through zetasizer nano z malvern united kingdom respectively to reflect the influencing trend of different conditioning approaches on the properties of eps extracts 2 6 qcm d analysis eps extraction from the three parallel samples were mixed as one single mixed sample for qcm d analysis during its adsorption to aurum coated crystals according to the electricity of bulk solution of sludge samples 0 5 wt nacl solution was selected as background solution two independent adsorption experiments were performed in the qcm d under this aquatic condition with similar results and one set of experimental data is presented in this study before each measurement the crystals were soaked in a mixed cleaning solution with pure water nh3 h2o and h2o2 the volume ratios of pure water 25 nh3 h2o solution and 30 h2o2 solution are 5 1 1 at 75 c for 15 min rinsed thoroughly with double distilled water and then dried with pure n2 gas prior to each of the qcm d experiments and after cleaning the crystals deionized water was initially injected into qcm d e4 q sense sweden to acquire a baseline until frequency drift 0 3 hz for analyzing the effects of sludge conditioning reagents on the eps viscoelastic properties solutions were injected sequentially to the qcm d system in the following order i deionized water ii background solution 0 5 wt nacl solution iii eps extraction iv background solution 0 5 wt nacl solution v deionized water frequency variations δf hz and dissipation factors δd were measured for four overtones n 3 5 7 and 9 for all experiments the flow rate was maintained at 0 15 ml min using a peristaltic pump ismatec pump idex germany after each measurement each flow line was rinsed by 10 15 ml 2 w w sds solution and 50 ml pure water at the flow rate of 1 5 ml min finally pure n2 gas were used to dry all the flow chambers the viscoelastic properties of the eps layers were calculated based on the voigt model according to voinova et al 1999 the density and viscosity of the solution used in this model were 1 g cm3 and 10 3 pa s respectively the density of the adsorbed layer was fixed at 1 030 g cm3 following the recommendations of gurdak et al 2005 the best fitting values of the shear viscosity η and shear modulus μ of the adsorbed layer were obtained and averaged by modeling the experimental data of δf and δd for the normalized 3rd 5th 7th and 9th overtone using the program q tools provided by q sense ab biolin scientific co sweden to minimize the negative effects of signal to noise ratio thio et al 2011 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using the software originpro 9 0 64bit originpro lab corp northampton ma usa pearson correlation coefficient rp was used to evaluate the linear correlation among physiochemical properties of eps and bound water content for viscosity and shear the data points at mid of qcm d analysis period 60 min were selected pearson coefficient is always between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 a perfect positive correlation and 0 the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bound water transformation tracked by in situ visualization technique 3 1 1 bound water quantification the bound water contents and dewaterability of was from different conditioning process were first investigated as shown in fig 1 cao2 had a superior performance on the cst reduction of sludge and bound water content also gradually decreased with the increasing cao2 addition fig 1a pacl had positive effects on the bound water content reduction but the similar reduction efficiencies up to 43 1 were obtained with different pacl dosages as shown in fig 1c which also accorded with the pacl induced reduction of bound water in previous work guo et al 2018 that phenomenon may reflect that the sludge particles have limited binding capacities for polymeric aluminum ion which was also in accordance with the measured trend of zeta potentials in the following section accordingly the coagulation by pacl has limited effects on floc compaction and resulted in partial release of bound water trapped in bio flocs even though the high dosage was employed as shown in fig 1b it is notable that cpam with a low dosage had limited effects on the conversion of free water to bound water which should be due to the possible introduction of hydrophilic functional groups by cpam ramaraj and radhakrishnan 1994 yang et al 2010 but the obvious aggregation of sludge particles caused by the large addition of cpam could be accompanied with the reduction of porosity and bound water trapped in the interstitial structure of sludge flocs which was verified by the particle size increase and compaction of eps extracts measured in the next section 3 1 2 bound water visualization the in situ synchrotron x ray cmt imaging technique was applied at distinguishing the fractions of bound water in sludge primarily the projections of raw sludge and sludge samples pretreated by different conditioning approaches were shown in fig 2 some loose aggregates with fine pores and dispersed particles were observed in the projection of raw sludge sample on the contrary according to the representative projection of cao2 pretreated sludge fig 2b the aggregates were destroyed after oxidation and the well dispersed small particles dominated the features of cao2 pretreated sludge flocs also these small particles of sludge flocs were compact and no obvious pores were observed compared with raw sludge the larger aggregates were both formed in the cpam and pacl added sludge fig 2c and d but much denser particles were observed in the pacl added sludge in addition the looser flocs of cpam pretreated sludge could be also reflected by some punctate regions of high luminance in the imaged position of sludge aggregates sinha et al 2006 wildenschild et al 2002 that may be due to the cpam introduced hydrophilic functional groups and the corresponding vicinal water accumulation through hydrogen bonds yang et al 2010 as discussed in section 3 1 1 cao2 had a constant decreasing trend on bound water reduction with the increasing dosage and also showed better performance in cst reduction than pacl and cpam in addition according to our previous works wu and chai 2016 wu et al 2016b 2018 cao2 had the dual effects radical oxidation by oh and coagulation by ca2 on the sludge dewaterability improvement which also corresponded to the disintegrated sludge flocs and dense sludge particles observed in the projection of cao2 pretreated sludge based on this fact cao2 can be both regarded as oxidizing and coagulation conditioning agent therefore the 3d perspective models of raw sludge and cao2 pretreated sludge were further reconstructed through collecting the circumferential projections that would provide a possibility to visually identify the different fractions of bound water which can be reduced by different reaction pathways of conditioning processes the different kinds of transmission media have different attenuation capacities for x ray wellington and vinegar 1987 due to the addition of ki as contrast agent the water phase showed the stronger attenuation than the organic phase in sludge the total attenuation with coherent scattering of 2 wt ki solution at 13 kev photon energy 4 793 cm2 g the total attenuation of biological compositions c60h87n12o23p in sludge at 13 kev photon energy 2 518 cm2 g metcalf et al 2003 therefore in the reconstructed cross sections fig 3 a and b the bright high pixel value and dark low pixel value spots represented the organic phase and water phase respectively as shown in fig 3a the net like structure of sludge flocs was easily identified visually in the tomographic volumes resulted from cmt scans of raw sludge and the dark fields existing in the pores of that floc regions obviously illustrated the water trapped in sludge flocs consequently this part of water can be referred to the water mechanically bound in the sludge flocs and defined as interstitial water furthermore a row profile plotting the pixel values along a line parallel to the image rows can show changes in image luminance or the average x ray transmission density the pixel values along the line at pixel location of x 1450 1650 y 1000 is shown in fig 3c the adjacent wave trough and peak clearly indicate the interlacing distribution of weak and strong attenuation regions respectively the smooth wave trough with certain widths is the direct evidence on the local accumulation of interstitial water in the net like flocs in addition both from the cross sectional image fig 3a and d perspective representation fig 3e of raw sludge the fibrous flocs were observed and without exception strong dark fields representing water could be marked along the surface surrounding of the fibrous sludge flocs also as shown in fig 3a the substantial difference in pixel values was detected between the above light and dark regions potentially representing the fibrous flocs and its surrounding adhering water these in situ imaging features can be definitely regarded as the evidences of vicinal water attached on the organic phase furthermore the adhering water layer occupied 20 pixels of the total 1620 pixels in the lateral imaging scale the capillary diameter 0 5 mm therefore it can be approximately estimated that the fibrous floc sphere of influence on water adhesion or the thickness of the vicinal water layer was 6 2 μm regarding to the cao2 pretreated sludge the organic aggregates were difficult to be found and the organic phase of pretreated sludge tended to be homogeneous or well distributed in the water phase fig 3b accordingly the net like structure trapping bound water disappeared instead the free water or water without attachment on any sludge aggregate was observed in the 3d perspective representation fig 3f which proved the simultaneous conversion of two fractions of bound water to free water induced by cao2 fig 3d also shows the pixel value along the line at the pixel location of x 1650 1810 y 1050 it can be found that the high and low pixel values fluctuated with the lateral scale and no obvious platform of weak or strong x ray attenuation was observed instead sharp peak and trough dominated the main feature of cao2 pretreated sludge cross section pixel value variation which reflected the well consistency among water and sludge compositions the disintegrated bio flocs would lead to a full mixture of organic compositions and water as a result no clearly interface among the trapped water and binding body can be identified and accordingly no distinct divisions of weak and strong attenuation areas could be detected therefore the positive effect of radical oxidation on the bound water conversion during the conditioning process was visually confirmed 3 2 mechanism insights into bound water transformation based on viscoelastic acoustic response of layered eps films as mentioned previously the properties of eps e g viscosity shear and surface energy the surface energy generally quantifies the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occur when a surface is created in this study it refers to the attractions among compositions of eps extracts which can be reflected by zeta potential control various properties of colloidal agglomeration of sludge flocs i e porosity rheological behavior and water holding capacity han et al 2017 ying et al 2010 therefore it is a promising way to reveal the mechanism of bound water transformation in terms of eps responses to different conditioning approaches furthermore according to our previous study wu et al 2017a the higher viscosity may be a reflection on the stronger capacity of storing elastic deformation energy and maintaining the internal water held in the colloidal aggregates of was thus in this section the layered eps films were first formed on the qcm d sensors and then the interactions between the conditioning reagent changed eps and water at the solid fluid interface were investigated in terms of viscoelastic acoustic response of eps layers the results are believed to further reflect the aggregation states or fluid like properties and definitely reveal the potential roles of eps on bound water occurrence in bio flocs 3 2 1 influence pathway of coagulation on bound water transformation the evolution of frequency and dissipation shifts of eps layers during adsorption and background solution washing stages was measured to evaluate eps viscosity and shear bearing capacity figure s1 s4 of supplementary materials the higher shift of frequency δf and dissipation d should correspond to the thicker eps adsorption layer on the sensor crystal which was caused by the stronger viscosity and shear bearing capacity ying et al 2010 as shown in fig 4 b and c it is likely that the addition of pacl and cpam would both lead to the increase in viscosity of eps layers the coagulation effect of interactions between poly aluminum ions and negatively charged eps fractions caused the increasing size of eps extracts from 167 3 0 8 nm to 210 3 2 1 nm and decreasing absolute value of zeta potential from 18 7 mv to 17 3 mv with the increase of pacl dosage fig s5 of supplementary materials that indicated the high ionic strength or positive charge density shielded the charges of the aurum surface and eps macromolecules due to electric double layer compression and charge screening leading to a decrease in electrostatic repulsion between the silica crystal surface and adsorbed eps film ying et al 2010 consequently the eps deposition and plasticity of eps layer could be enhanced the embedded water in eps layer and the affinity of eps layer film to fluidal bulk solution was reduced in another word the charge neutralization induced compaction of bound eps layers could be a potential way for coagulation to release bound water from bio flocs xu et al 2018 and also accompanied with a reduction in the repulsion among macromolecules of eps as a result the stability of eps layer under the condition of fluid flushing and the measured shear value in qcm d both showed increasing trend with increasing pacl dosage fig 4f but it can be also notable that the addition of pacl may lead to the decrease in the extraction amount of eps verified by the data in fig s5 of supplementary materials therefore the measured viscosity and shear modulus of pacl added eps layer could be lower than that of eps layer from raw sludge 3 2 2 influence pathway of flocculation on bound water transformation in terms of the cpam pretreated sludge samples due to reduced inter chain electrostatic repulsion induced by positive charge binding and the adsorption bridging effects caused by the chain like macromolecule cpam eps films became coiled and spherical in shape tsuneda et al 2003 wang et al 2013 forming a more compact layer the above changes of eps from cpam pretreated sludge were reflected by the factor that cpam induced higher increase in particle size of eps extracts than pacl fig s5 of supplementary materials however because of the relative lower positive charge density of cpam than poly aluminum ions yang et al 2010 the zeta potential reduction of eps extracts from cpam pretreated sludge was not as large as that of pacl pretreated sludge in addition cpam contains hydrophilic functional groups nh2 and co which endue the affinity of cpam with water molecules ramaraj and radhakrishnan 1994 yang et al 2010 as a result the fluidity of water was inhibited the presence of cpam increased the viscosity of eps water hybrid film and its storage capacity of elastic deformation energy directly which was reflected by the increase of eps aggregate viscosity from 0 00173 kg m to 0 00185 kg m fig 4b accordingly compared with pacl pretreated sludge the cpam addition also led to a higher shear modulus fig 4e and it consistently increased with the increasing cpam dosage xiong et al 2008 the higher shear modulus can be regarded as an indicator of stronger bio floc stability as a result the denser sludge aggregates caused by compaction of eps and the introduction of hydrophilic functional groups both stand for the dual roles of flocculation on bound water transformation 3 2 3 influence pathway of aop on bound water transformation differently the viscosity of eps layers decreased with the increase of cao2 dosage although the complexations of ca2 and fe2 fe3 with eps neutralized the negatively charge and promoted the aggregation of sludge floc particles the oxidation played the dominant role in the cao2 induced change of eps properties instead of ca2 binding as shown in fig s5 of supplementary materials the protein content was verified to decrease substantially from 11 4 0 1 mg gvs to 4 0 0 8 mg gvs after the pretreatment of sludge by 0 025 g gds cao2 the protein fraction is commonly recognized as the major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 wu et al 2017b yu et al 2010 the excellent performance on the protein removal showed once again that oh produced from cao2 solubilization could effectively reduce the hydrophilicity of sludge flocs by specifically depolymerization or solubilization of hydrophilic compounds attached to the main body of sludge flocs and further lead to the disintegration of sludge flocs he et al 2015 wu and chai 2016 wu et al 2016b 2017a 2018 yu et al 2016 which corresponded to the homogeneous organic phase observed in x ray cmt and should be the main pathway for aop inducing the release of bound water accordingly as shown in fig 4a the deposition of eps on crystals was hindered causing the decreased viscosity and no compact or larger eps extracts were observed the variation of shear modulus shown in fig 4d also accorded with the double effects of cao2 on eps the added ca2 neutralized the eps charge could promote attractions among eps molecules and increase the stability of eps aggregation in terms of higher measured shear modulus compared with eps extracted from raw sludge sample ying et al 2010 but the further decrease of shear modulus with the continuously increasing cao2 dosage again validated that the dominant role of cao2 in eps change was the oxidation induced disintegration the disintegrated eps extracts could not show a strong shear bearing capacity in another word the reduction of hydrophilic functional groups by aop based conditioning would lead to the weak ability of preventing the internal water motion wu et al 2017a therefore the eps layers had a poor ability to resist deformation induced by an external disturbance and exhibited a strong fluidity instead of elasticity 3 3 identification of determinants on bound water occurrence and transformation according to the discussion in the above section different conditioning approaches led to the different changes of water binding properties of eps also coagulation flocculation and aop induced the changes of eps macromolecules by different reaction pathways including the charge neutralization and depolymerization but all the three above conditioning operations had potentials in the bound water content elimination therefore it can be inferred that different fractions of bound water corresponding to or controlled by different physiochemical properties of eps might exist in sludge pearson correlative analysis among eps physiochemical properties and bound water content were conducted to investigate how the changes of eps influenced the bound water reduction and identify the potential determinants on bound water transformation according to the data in table 1 for the cao2 pretreated sludge the content of eps protein strongly correlated with both bound water content and cst as mentioned above protein was widely recognized as the main component comprising of the hydrophilic compositions of eps cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 thio et al 2011 wu et al 2017a yu et al 2010 therefore it can be concluded that cao2 reduced the bound water content mainly through the removal of hydrophilic compounds in eps also it directly specifies the existence of a type of bound water fraction that is adhering to the hydrophilic eps compositions vicinal water because the hydrophilic groups in protein like substances for example nh should be the dominant cause of interfacial water occurrence by hydrogen bond and could be effectively removed by radical oxidation inducing extracellular protein denaturation wu et al 2017a regarding to the pacl and cpam added sludge the bound water negatively and strongly correlated with zeta potential and viscosity of eps layer as discussed in the above section the increased viscosity was actually due to a more compact sludge floc structure resulted from the charge neutralization effect of pacl or adsorption bridging effect of cpam therefore the close correlation between viscosity and bound water content in pacl and cpam pretreated sludge reflected that the release of interstitial water trapped in net like sludge flocs could be enhanced by coagulant and flocculant through the reduced inter chain electrostatic repulsion and compactions of net like sludge flocs i e reduction of pore structures and agglomerate of fine particles wang et al 2016 also the strong correlation between eps shear modulus and cst of cpam added sludge could be regarded as an indicator that the compacted sludge gel with strong elasticity would be beneficial for the solid liquid separation in sludge cao et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2016 xu et al 2018 cao2 induced radical oxidation would effectively accelerate the destruction of sludge polymeric network crack the microbial cells trapped in sludge gels and enhance the sludge floc disintegration solubilization he et al 2015 kim et al 2016 wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2016 as a result of the disintegrated sludge flocs the bound water trapped in the colloidal sludge gel was liberated as free water xu et al 2018 which was also verified by the positive correlation rp 0 956 p value 0 011 between viscosity and bound water content in cao2 pretreated sludge samples all those phenomena further specify that eps with high degree of polymerization and its related floc structure with high viscosity contribute significantly to the existence of interstitial water that is mechanically trapped in the fine pores of sludge flocs 3 4 implications of bound water transformation mechanism on handling was to date the direct evidence of bound water fraction and the roles of eps physicochemical properties on bound water fractioning in microbial aggregates are still unclear as the main factors dominating bound water occurrence in sludge the accurate effects of eps physicochemical properties on the bound water fractions are expected to be well understood as a result the mechanism behind bound water reduction induced by various sludge conditioning approaches relying on eps transformation can be well elucidated for practical applications the removal of hydrophilic functional groups and the destruction of net like colloidal structure of sludge should be keys to converting bound water into free water the combined use of chemical means aiming at hydrophilicity reduction for example radical oxidation extracellular protein denaturation and physical means coagulation aiming at colloidal instability should be further explored to efficiently improve sludge dewaterability for theoretical values the proposed mechanism insights into how the eps physiochemical properties influence bound water fractioning should be noteworthy and it may be a promising pathway to realize the theoretically distinct bound water fractions 4 conclusions in this study the visualization of micro spatial water distribution in bio flocs of was was realized by in situ synchrotron x ray cmt the net like structure of sludge flocs the vicinal water attached to the surface of organic phase and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like structure of sludge flocs were all visually tracked in the tomographic scan or 3d perspective representation of raw sludge for the first time also the mechanism investigation on bound water transformation indicated that pacl and cpam helped interstitial water reduction by forming

19489,this study visually tracked the micro spatial water distribution in bio flocs of waste activated sludge through in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography primarily the two fractions of bound water the vicinal water adhering to the surface of organic compositions and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like structure of bio flocs were proposed based on the cross

interstitial water were proposed to be the contributions of eps on bound water occurrences graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering x ray cmt eps 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is the most frequently employed technology in wastewater treatment plants due to its high adaptability to influent quality flexible operation mode and stable process performance mahmoud et al 2013 however a large amount of inevitable by product waste activated sludge was is produced and becomes a significant challenge in the sustainable development of biological wastewater treatments as the primary step for sludge treatment dewatering can minimize the sludge volume increase the energy utilization efficiency facilitate the transportation and even reduce the leachate production in the sludge landfill sites mahmoud et al 2013 wong et al 2016 however sludge is difficult to be dewatered directly due to the highly hydrated colloidal structures of microbial aggregates christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the presence of organic phase in sludge makes a certain part of water embedded in a bio polymeric network and behave very differently from the bulk water heukelekian and weisberg 1956 this portion of water is commonly termed as bound water smollen 1990 vesilind 1994 the differentiation of bound water and non bound water free water is desirable for predicting the water removal efficiency during mechanical dewatering process and the potential energy consumption during drying process many efforts have been donated to the differentiation and quantification of bound water in the floc structures of sludge primarily the energy definition was proposed by catalano et al catalano 1970 in this context an interaction energy is defined as the energy necessary to break the binding of water to solid material the states of water in solids as water bound with x kcal mol therefore lee 1996 proposed that the capability of bound water to resist freezing under low temperatures is attributed to the lowering of its thermodynamic activity by the water solid bond strength accordingly a quantification method of bound water based on the measurement of unfrozen water at the specific freezing temperature 20 c was established and widely accepted for the quantification of bound water in sludge colin and gazbar 1995 he et al 2015 lee 1996 smith and vesilind 1995 wu et al 1998 however the possible different bound water fractions cannot be identified by the energy definition therefore vesilind et al vesilind 1994 further distinguished the classifications of bound water in sludge based on arbitrary hypotheses called operational definition the operational definition regards the water that can be eliminated by simple thickening or by the application of weak mechanical strains as free water bound water is the water fixed to solid phase by chemical bindings hydrogen bond physical adsorption and mechanical capture in both micro and macrocapillaries of capillaryporous bodies and is hard to be removed from the sludge body using mechanical means of dewatering according to the above interactions between bound water and sludge floc structure vesilind et al vesilind 1994 moller et al möller 1983 and smollen et al smollen 1988 further refined the four water fractions as free or bulk water interstitial water vicinal water and water of hydration however no direct visualization of the above four water fractions was reported and the difference in the spatial distribution of water fractions with different binding forms to solid phase has never been documented since the conversion of bound water into free water should be the key point to realize the enhanced dewatering of sludge he et al 2015 lee 1996 wu et al 1998 it is also meaningful to investigate the determinants on bound water occurrences except for tracking its transformation during conditioning processes recently an increasing attention has been paid to the significant roles of extracellular polymeric substances eps in maintaining the colloidal structure of sludge and binding a large amount of water in the floc structures christensen et al 2015 han et al 2017 sheng et al 2006 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the matrix of eps is formed by different biochemicals secreted by microbes release of cellular material products by cell lysis and adsorption of organic matter in the medium eps distributes throughout the was flocs and plays important roles in protecting cells from harmful environmental effects responding to changes in environment and also determining various surface properties of sludge flocs such as hydrophilicity hydrophobicity charge characteristics and flocculation properties liao et al 2001 sheng et al 2006 wu et al 2017a in addition the eps influenced rheological properties of was including viscosity gel stability of bio flocs and pore structure of dewatered sludge cake are also found to be closely related to the dewatering behavior cao et al 2018 dursun and dentel 2009 therefore it can be inferred that the interactions between water and sludge flocs are actually mainly controlled by eps and the multifold characteristics of eps may also contribute to the different fractions of bound water however to our best knowledge how eps influence the occurrences of bound water fixed in the biological agglomeration was not well understood to address these problems the present study was first aimed at tracking the different conditioning approaches induced transformations of bound water occurrence by in situ visualization technique then quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d analysis was conducted to refine the bound water organic phase interactions based on the viscoelastic acoustic response of the dominant compositions controlling the colloidal properties of was eps finally the correspondences among bound water contents and eps physiochemical properties was established to reveal the potential roles of eps on the transformation of bound water in bio flocs of was all these results are believed to provide mechanism insights into bound water fractioning and also a promising pathway to realize the theoretically distinct bound water fractions 2 materials and methods 2 1 was was was collected from the secondary settling tank of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant using anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process three samples for triplicate studies were collected at 24 h intervals at the same time during the day from the wastewater treatment plant there was no rainfall on the sampling days the concentrated sludge sample had a ph of 6 85 0 05 moisture content of 99 12 0 02 total solids ts of 8 88 0 17 g l volatile solids vs of 6 23 0 02 g l capillary suction time cst of 79 3 7 7 s it was stored at 4 c before use all experiments were conducted within 5 days guo et al 2018 wu et al 2017a 2 2 typical procedures for sludge conditioning three typical conditioning approaches for sludge dewaterability improvement including coagulation flocculation and advanced oxidation process aop were all conducted to analyze the differences in their effects on physiochemical and micromechanical properties of eps the poly aluminum chloride pacl and cationic polyacrylamide cpam were selected as coagulant and flocculant respectively the predetermined dosages of pacl for four samples were 0 5 wt dry sludge ds 1 wt ds 3 wt ds and 5 wt ds respectively and the dosages of cpam for flocculation were 0 1 wt ds 0 3 wt ds 0 5 wt ds and 1 wt ds respectively the protocol for aop treatment was according to our previous work wu and chai 2016 cao2 was selected as the aop reagent and the addition ratio of fe ii and cao2 was set as 12 5 mmol g 0 025 g gds 0 05 g gds 0 075 g gds and 0 10 g gds cao2 were spiked in four sludge samples under magnetic stirring 300 rpm for 30 min respectively after ph of sludge was first adjusted to 3 by adding 3 mol l hcl and then fe ii feso4 with the corresponding dosage was added the sludge samples after the above pretreatments would be subjected to the dewaterability evaluation in terms of cst bound water analysis and eps extraction 2 3 analysis on bound water 2 3 1 bound water quantification the dilatometric technique was modified to measure bound water in raw and pretreated sludge according to the methods proposed by heukelekian and weisberg 1956 in brief the hydraulic oil was selected as the indicator fluid the dilatometer was filled with the sludge sample and the indicator fluid after that the dilatometer was immersed in the cold bath consisting of 50 wt ethanol solution to allow the temperature decrease to 10 c and the corresponding dilatometric reading was recorded then the sludge samples were further frozen at the temperature well below the freezing point typically 20 c and the dilatometric reading was also recorded knowing both the coefficient of contraction for the indicator fluid and the coefficient of expansion for the water the quantity of frozen water or free water in the system could be calculated the difference between the total water content and the free water content should be the bound water content 2 3 2 bound water visualization x ray can be a useful tool to realize the microtomography of an opaque solid liquid mixture of was due to its strong transmissive ability and the high energy x ray generated from synchrotron x ray source provides the possibility of the high resolution visualization of was therefore in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography cmt imaging technique was used to realize the visualization of bound water in sludge the raw sludge and sludge samples with the largest reagent dosages of the three above mentioned conditioning approaches were selected as imaging objects the three parallel samples were first well mixed and then loaded into capillaries with 0 5 mm diameter and then subjected to cmt imaging respectively before that 2 wt ki was added into sludge samples to increase the contrast between water phase and solid phase of sludge simultaneously with minimizing the influence on cellular osmotic pressure cmt experiments were performed at ambient conditions using high resolution cmt at the tomography beamline bl13w1 at shanghai synchrotron radiation facility with the photon energy of 13 kev a 0 6656 mm wide 1 mm high beam passes through a sample and collides against a csi scintillator and an optical lens coupled to a charge coupled device ccd camera binned to 2048 2048 pixels each tomogram was reconstructed by filtered back projection using the software pitre beamline bl13w1 shanghai synchrotron radiation facility from 900 projections collected over a 360 sample rotation with an exposure time of 4 s per projection each stack of two dimensional 2d images was later converted into a three dimensional 3d volume using the software amira 5 4 3 visage imaging inc richmond australia the reconstructed 3d image contains 600 slices of 2048 2048 pixels with an isotropic resolution size of 0 325 μm 2 4 eps extraction and composition analysis the eps extraction of sludge samples using centrifugation as well as ultrasonication was modified based on the procedures reported in previous studies mahmoud et al 2010 wu et al 2016a xu et al 2018 sludge was firstly centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was termed soluble eps 0 5 wt nacl solution was added to re suspend the sludge pellets to the original volumes to prevent cell lysis then the samples were subjected to ultrasonication 40 khz and 120 w for 2 min and centrifuged at 20000 g for 20 min at 4 c the organic matter in the collected supernatant was termed as bound eps and the remaining sediment was the pellet the extracted eps solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm hydrophilic nylon filter millipore co usa to remove the possible suspended sludge floc particles the bound eps hereinafter referred to as eps were used as the objectives in the subsequent physicochemical and micromechanical property analysis polysaccharide and protein levels of eps were measured by the phenol sulfuric method with glucose as the standard and the modified lowry folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard bo et al 1996 gaudy 1962 respectively 2 5 zeta potential and size distribution of eps extracts according to the eps extraction method described in the above section the background solutions of all the eps extracts should be consistent and all the properties of eps should be determined by the added conditioning reagents therefore zeta potentials and size distribution of eps extracts were directly measured by electrophoresis and dynamic laser scattering through zetasizer nano z malvern united kingdom respectively to reflect the influencing trend of different conditioning approaches on the properties of eps extracts 2 6 qcm d analysis eps extraction from the three parallel samples were mixed as one single mixed sample for qcm d analysis during its adsorption to aurum coated crystals according to the electricity of bulk solution of sludge samples 0 5 wt nacl solution was selected as background solution two independent adsorption experiments were performed in the qcm d under this aquatic condition with similar results and one set of experimental data is presented in this study before each measurement the crystals were soaked in a mixed cleaning solution with pure water nh3 h2o and h2o2 the volume ratios of pure water 25 nh3 h2o solution and 30 h2o2 solution are 5 1 1 at 75 c for 15 min rinsed thoroughly with double distilled water and then dried with pure n2 gas prior to each of the qcm d experiments and after cleaning the crystals deionized water was initially injected into qcm d e4 q sense sweden to acquire a baseline until frequency drift 0 3 hz for analyzing the effects of sludge conditioning reagents on the eps viscoelastic properties solutions were injected sequentially to the qcm d system in the following order i deionized water ii background solution 0 5 wt nacl solution iii eps extraction iv background solution 0 5 wt nacl solution v deionized water frequency variations δf hz and dissipation factors δd were measured for four overtones n 3 5 7 and 9 for all experiments the flow rate was maintained at 0 15 ml min using a peristaltic pump ismatec pump idex germany after each measurement each flow line was rinsed by 10 15 ml 2 w w sds solution and 50 ml pure water at the flow rate of 1 5 ml min finally pure n2 gas were used to dry all the flow chambers the viscoelastic properties of the eps layers were calculated based on the voigt model according to voinova et al 1999 the density and viscosity of the solution used in this model were 1 g cm3 and 10 3 pa s respectively the density of the adsorbed layer was fixed at 1 030 g cm3 following the recommendations of gurdak et al 2005 the best fitting values of the shear viscosity η and shear modulus μ of the adsorbed layer were obtained and averaged by modeling the experimental data of δf and δd for the normalized 3rd 5th 7th and 9th overtone using the program q tools provided by q sense ab biolin scientific co sweden to minimize the negative effects of signal to noise ratio thio et al 2011 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using the software originpro 9 0 64bit originpro lab corp northampton ma usa pearson correlation coefficient rp was used to evaluate the linear correlation among physiochemical properties of eps and bound water content for viscosity and shear the data points at mid of qcm d analysis period 60 min were selected pearson coefficient is always between 1 and 1 where 1 denotes a perfect negative correlation 1 a perfect positive correlation and 0 the absence of a relationship the correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 bound water transformation tracked by in situ visualization technique 3 1 1 bound water quantification the bound water contents and dewaterability of was from different conditioning process were first investigated as shown in fig 1 cao2 had a superior performance on the cst reduction of sludge and bound water content also gradually decreased with the increasing cao2 addition fig 1a pacl had positive effects on the bound water content reduction but the similar reduction efficiencies up to 43 1 were obtained with different pacl dosages as shown in fig 1c which also accorded with the pacl induced reduction of bound water in previous work guo et al 2018 that phenomenon may reflect that the sludge particles have limited binding capacities for polymeric aluminum ion which was also in accordance with the measured trend of zeta potentials in the following section accordingly the coagulation by pacl has limited effects on floc compaction and resulted in partial release of bound water trapped in bio flocs even though the high dosage was employed as shown in fig 1b it is notable that cpam with a low dosage had limited effects on the conversion of free water to bound water which should be due to the possible introduction of hydrophilic functional groups by cpam ramaraj and radhakrishnan 1994 yang et al 2010 but the obvious aggregation of sludge particles caused by the large addition of cpam could be accompanied with the reduction of porosity and bound water trapped in the interstitial structure of sludge flocs which was verified by the particle size increase and compaction of eps extracts measured in the next section 3 1 2 bound water visualization the in situ synchrotron x ray cmt imaging technique was applied at distinguishing the fractions of bound water in sludge primarily the projections of raw sludge and sludge samples pretreated by different conditioning approaches were shown in fig 2 some loose aggregates with fine pores and dispersed particles were observed in the projection of raw sludge sample on the contrary according to the representative projection of cao2 pretreated sludge fig 2b the aggregates were destroyed after oxidation and the well dispersed small particles dominated the features of cao2 pretreated sludge flocs also these small particles of sludge flocs were compact and no obvious pores were observed compared with raw sludge the larger aggregates were both formed in the cpam and pacl added sludge fig 2c and d but much denser particles were observed in the pacl added sludge in addition the looser flocs of cpam pretreated sludge could be also reflected by some punctate regions of high luminance in the imaged position of sludge aggregates sinha et al 2006 wildenschild et al 2002 that may be due to the cpam introduced hydrophilic functional groups and the corresponding vicinal water accumulation through hydrogen bonds yang et al 2010 as discussed in section 3 1 1 cao2 had a constant decreasing trend on bound water reduction with the increasing dosage and also showed better performance in cst reduction than pacl and cpam in addition according to our previous works wu and chai 2016 wu et al 2016b 2018 cao2 had the dual effects radical oxidation by oh and coagulation by ca2 on the sludge dewaterability improvement which also corresponded to the disintegrated sludge flocs and dense sludge particles observed in the projection of cao2 pretreated sludge based on this fact cao2 can be both regarded as oxidizing and coagulation conditioning agent therefore the 3d perspective models of raw sludge and cao2 pretreated sludge were further reconstructed through collecting the circumferential projections that would provide a possibility to visually identify the different fractions of bound water which can be reduced by different reaction pathways of conditioning processes the different kinds of transmission media have different attenuation capacities for x ray wellington and vinegar 1987 due to the addition of ki as contrast agent the water phase showed the stronger attenuation than the organic phase in sludge the total attenuation with coherent scattering of 2 wt ki solution at 13 kev photon energy 4 793 cm2 g the total attenuation of biological compositions c60h87n12o23p in sludge at 13 kev photon energy 2 518 cm2 g metcalf et al 2003 therefore in the reconstructed cross sections fig 3 a and b the bright high pixel value and dark low pixel value spots represented the organic phase and water phase respectively as shown in fig 3a the net like structure of sludge flocs was easily identified visually in the tomographic volumes resulted from cmt scans of raw sludge and the dark fields existing in the pores of that floc regions obviously illustrated the water trapped in sludge flocs consequently this part of water can be referred to the water mechanically bound in the sludge flocs and defined as interstitial water furthermore a row profile plotting the pixel values along a line parallel to the image rows can show changes in image luminance or the average x ray transmission density the pixel values along the line at pixel location of x 1450 1650 y 1000 is shown in fig 3c the adjacent wave trough and peak clearly indicate the interlacing distribution of weak and strong attenuation regions respectively the smooth wave trough with certain widths is the direct evidence on the local accumulation of interstitial water in the net like flocs in addition both from the cross sectional image fig 3a and d perspective representation fig 3e of raw sludge the fibrous flocs were observed and without exception strong dark fields representing water could be marked along the surface surrounding of the fibrous sludge flocs also as shown in fig 3a the substantial difference in pixel values was detected between the above light and dark regions potentially representing the fibrous flocs and its surrounding adhering water these in situ imaging features can be definitely regarded as the evidences of vicinal water attached on the organic phase furthermore the adhering water layer occupied 20 pixels of the total 1620 pixels in the lateral imaging scale the capillary diameter 0 5 mm therefore it can be approximately estimated that the fibrous floc sphere of influence on water adhesion or the thickness of the vicinal water layer was 6 2 μm regarding to the cao2 pretreated sludge the organic aggregates were difficult to be found and the organic phase of pretreated sludge tended to be homogeneous or well distributed in the water phase fig 3b accordingly the net like structure trapping bound water disappeared instead the free water or water without attachment on any sludge aggregate was observed in the 3d perspective representation fig 3f which proved the simultaneous conversion of two fractions of bound water to free water induced by cao2 fig 3d also shows the pixel value along the line at the pixel location of x 1650 1810 y 1050 it can be found that the high and low pixel values fluctuated with the lateral scale and no obvious platform of weak or strong x ray attenuation was observed instead sharp peak and trough dominated the main feature of cao2 pretreated sludge cross section pixel value variation which reflected the well consistency among water and sludge compositions the disintegrated bio flocs would lead to a full mixture of organic compositions and water as a result no clearly interface among the trapped water and binding body can be identified and accordingly no distinct divisions of weak and strong attenuation areas could be detected therefore the positive effect of radical oxidation on the bound water conversion during the conditioning process was visually confirmed 3 2 mechanism insights into bound water transformation based on viscoelastic acoustic response of layered eps films as mentioned previously the properties of eps e g viscosity shear and surface energy the surface energy generally quantifies the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occur when a surface is created in this study it refers to the attractions among compositions of eps extracts which can be reflected by zeta potential control various properties of colloidal agglomeration of sludge flocs i e porosity rheological behavior and water holding capacity han et al 2017 ying et al 2010 therefore it is a promising way to reveal the mechanism of bound water transformation in terms of eps responses to different conditioning approaches furthermore according to our previous study wu et al 2017a the higher viscosity may be a reflection on the stronger capacity of storing elastic deformation energy and maintaining the internal water held in the colloidal aggregates of was thus in this section the layered eps films were first formed on the qcm d sensors and then the interactions between the conditioning reagent changed eps and water at the solid fluid interface were investigated in terms of viscoelastic acoustic response of eps layers the results are believed to further reflect the aggregation states or fluid like properties and definitely reveal the potential roles of eps on bound water occurrence in bio flocs 3 2 1 influence pathway of coagulation on bound water transformation the evolution of frequency and dissipation shifts of eps layers during adsorption and background solution washing stages was measured to evaluate eps viscosity and shear bearing capacity figure s1 s4 of supplementary materials the higher shift of frequency δf and dissipation d should correspond to the thicker eps adsorption layer on the sensor crystal which was caused by the stronger viscosity and shear bearing capacity ying et al 2010 as shown in fig 4 b and c it is likely that the addition of pacl and cpam would both lead to the increase in viscosity of eps layers the coagulation effect of interactions between poly aluminum ions and negatively charged eps fractions caused the increasing size of eps extracts from 167 3 0 8 nm to 210 3 2 1 nm and decreasing absolute value of zeta potential from 18 7 mv to 17 3 mv with the increase of pacl dosage fig s5 of supplementary materials that indicated the high ionic strength or positive charge density shielded the charges of the aurum surface and eps macromolecules due to electric double layer compression and charge screening leading to a decrease in electrostatic repulsion between the silica crystal surface and adsorbed eps film ying et al 2010 consequently the eps deposition and plasticity of eps layer could be enhanced the embedded water in eps layer and the affinity of eps layer film to fluidal bulk solution was reduced in another word the charge neutralization induced compaction of bound eps layers could be a potential way for coagulation to release bound water from bio flocs xu et al 2018 and also accompanied with a reduction in the repulsion among macromolecules of eps as a result the stability of eps layer under the condition of fluid flushing and the measured shear value in qcm d both showed increasing trend with increasing pacl dosage fig 4f but it can be also notable that the addition of pacl may lead to the decrease in the extraction amount of eps verified by the data in fig s5 of supplementary materials therefore the measured viscosity and shear modulus of pacl added eps layer could be lower than that of eps layer from raw sludge 3 2 2 influence pathway of flocculation on bound water transformation in terms of the cpam pretreated sludge samples due to reduced inter chain electrostatic repulsion induced by positive charge binding and the adsorption bridging effects caused by the chain like macromolecule cpam eps films became coiled and spherical in shape tsuneda et al 2003 wang et al 2013 forming a more compact layer the above changes of eps from cpam pretreated sludge were reflected by the factor that cpam induced higher increase in particle size of eps extracts than pacl fig s5 of supplementary materials however because of the relative lower positive charge density of cpam than poly aluminum ions yang et al 2010 the zeta potential reduction of eps extracts from cpam pretreated sludge was not as large as that of pacl pretreated sludge in addition cpam contains hydrophilic functional groups nh2 and co which endue the affinity of cpam with water molecules ramaraj and radhakrishnan 1994 yang et al 2010 as a result the fluidity of water was inhibited the presence of cpam increased the viscosity of eps water hybrid film and its storage capacity of elastic deformation energy directly which was reflected by the increase of eps aggregate viscosity from 0 00173 kg m to 0 00185 kg m fig 4b accordingly compared with pacl pretreated sludge the cpam addition also led to a higher shear modulus fig 4e and it consistently increased with the increasing cpam dosage xiong et al 2008 the higher shear modulus can be regarded as an indicator of stronger bio floc stability as a result the denser sludge aggregates caused by compaction of eps and the introduction of hydrophilic functional groups both stand for the dual roles of flocculation on bound water transformation 3 2 3 influence pathway of aop on bound water transformation differently the viscosity of eps layers decreased with the increase of cao2 dosage although the complexations of ca2 and fe2 fe3 with eps neutralized the negatively charge and promoted the aggregation of sludge floc particles the oxidation played the dominant role in the cao2 induced change of eps properties instead of ca2 binding as shown in fig s5 of supplementary materials the protein content was verified to decrease substantially from 11 4 0 1 mg gvs to 4 0 0 8 mg gvs after the pretreatment of sludge by 0 025 g gds cao2 the protein fraction is commonly recognized as the major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 wu et al 2017b yu et al 2010 the excellent performance on the protein removal showed once again that oh produced from cao2 solubilization could effectively reduce the hydrophilicity of sludge flocs by specifically depolymerization or solubilization of hydrophilic compounds attached to the main body of sludge flocs and further lead to the disintegration of sludge flocs he et al 2015 wu and chai 2016 wu et al 2016b 2017a 2018 yu et al 2016 which corresponded to the homogeneous organic phase observed in x ray cmt and should be the main pathway for aop inducing the release of bound water accordingly as shown in fig 4a the deposition of eps on crystals was hindered causing the decreased viscosity and no compact or larger eps extracts were observed the variation of shear modulus shown in fig 4d also accorded with the double effects of cao2 on eps the added ca2 neutralized the eps charge could promote attractions among eps molecules and increase the stability of eps aggregation in terms of higher measured shear modulus compared with eps extracted from raw sludge sample ying et al 2010 but the further decrease of shear modulus with the continuously increasing cao2 dosage again validated that the dominant role of cao2 in eps change was the oxidation induced disintegration the disintegrated eps extracts could not show a strong shear bearing capacity in another word the reduction of hydrophilic functional groups by aop based conditioning would lead to the weak ability of preventing the internal water motion wu et al 2017a therefore the eps layers had a poor ability to resist deformation induced by an external disturbance and exhibited a strong fluidity instead of elasticity 3 3 identification of determinants on bound water occurrence and transformation according to the discussion in the above section different conditioning approaches led to the different changes of water binding properties of eps also coagulation flocculation and aop induced the changes of eps macromolecules by different reaction pathways including the charge neutralization and depolymerization but all the three above conditioning operations had potentials in the bound water content elimination therefore it can be inferred that different fractions of bound water corresponding to or controlled by different physiochemical properties of eps might exist in sludge pearson correlative analysis among eps physiochemical properties and bound water content were conducted to investigate how the changes of eps influenced the bound water reduction and identify the potential determinants on bound water transformation according to the data in table 1 for the cao2 pretreated sludge the content of eps protein strongly correlated with both bound water content and cst as mentioned above protein was widely recognized as the main component comprising of the hydrophilic compositions of eps cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 thio et al 2011 wu et al 2017a yu et al 2010 therefore it can be concluded that cao2 reduced the bound water content mainly through the removal of hydrophilic compounds in eps also it directly specifies the existence of a type of bound water fraction that is adhering to the hydrophilic eps compositions vicinal water because the hydrophilic groups in protein like substances for example nh should be the dominant cause of interfacial water occurrence by hydrogen bond and could be effectively removed by radical oxidation inducing extracellular protein denaturation wu et al 2017a regarding to the pacl and cpam added sludge the bound water negatively and strongly correlated with zeta potential and viscosity of eps layer as discussed in the above section the increased viscosity was actually due to a more compact sludge floc structure resulted from the charge neutralization effect of pacl or adsorption bridging effect of cpam therefore the close correlation between viscosity and bound water content in pacl and cpam pretreated sludge reflected that the release of interstitial water trapped in net like sludge flocs could be enhanced by coagulant and flocculant through the reduced inter chain electrostatic repulsion and compactions of net like sludge flocs i e reduction of pore structures and agglomerate of fine particles wang et al 2016 also the strong correlation between eps shear modulus and cst of cpam added sludge could be regarded as an indicator that the compacted sludge gel with strong elasticity would be beneficial for the solid liquid separation in sludge cao et al 2018 mahmoud et al 2016 xu et al 2018 cao2 induced radical oxidation would effectively accelerate the destruction of sludge polymeric network crack the microbial cells trapped in sludge gels and enhance the sludge floc disintegration solubilization he et al 2015 kim et al 2016 wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2016 as a result of the disintegrated sludge flocs the bound water trapped in the colloidal sludge gel was liberated as free water xu et al 2018 which was also verified by the positive correlation rp 0 956 p value 0 011 between viscosity and bound water content in cao2 pretreated sludge samples all those phenomena further specify that eps with high degree of polymerization and its related floc structure with high viscosity contribute significantly to the existence of interstitial water that is mechanically trapped in the fine pores of sludge flocs 3 4 implications of bound water transformation mechanism on handling was to date the direct evidence of bound water fraction and the roles of eps physicochemical properties on bound water fractioning in microbial aggregates are still unclear as the main factors dominating bound water occurrence in sludge the accurate effects of eps physicochemical properties on the bound water fractions are expected to be well understood as a result the mechanism behind bound water reduction induced by various sludge conditioning approaches relying on eps transformation can be well elucidated for practical applications the removal of hydrophilic functional groups and the destruction of net like colloidal structure of sludge should be keys to converting bound water into free water the combined use of chemical means aiming at hydrophilicity reduction for example radical oxidation extracellular protein denaturation and physical means coagulation aiming at colloidal instability should be further explored to efficiently improve sludge dewaterability for theoretical values the proposed mechanism insights into how the eps physiochemical properties influence bound water fractioning should be noteworthy and it may be a promising pathway to realize the theoretically distinct bound water fractions 4 conclusions in this study the visualization of micro spatial water distribution in bio flocs of was was realized by in situ synchrotron x ray cmt the net like structure of sludge flocs the vicinal water attached to the surface of organic phase and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like structure of sludge flocs were all visually tracked in the tomographic scan or 3d perspective representation of raw sludge for the first time also the mechanism investigation on bound water transformation indicated that pacl and cpam helped interstitial water reduction by forming more compact eps aggregations through charge neutralization and adsorption bridging effects instead aop led to less hydrophilicity and viscosity of eps with vicinal water reduction the joint roles of hydrophilic substance removal eps aggregation compaction and colloidal instability of sludge flocs in bound water reduction were confirmed by the strong correlations rp 0 95 p value 0 04 among protein levels of eps eps viscosity and bound water contents accordingly providing adhering sites for vicinal water and forming viscous sludge flocs for trapping interstitial water were proposed to be the potential roles of eps on bound water occurrences declarations of interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by ministry of science and technology p r china no 2013zx07315 002 no
