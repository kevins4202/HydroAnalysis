6860,the paper presents various aspects of monitoring streamflows with stage discharge hqrc and index velocity ivrc based ratings at a non ideal gaging station with emphasis on their reliance during fast varying unsteady flows for this purpose the paper analyzes data obtained from customized experiments whereby the flow phases are tracked as they develop during flow transitions the analysis compares discharges obtained from hqrc and ivrc ratings with those directly measured with acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and a flowmeter set in the housing of the turbines that release the flow in the downstream channel it is found that during steady flows both hqrc and ivrc methods perform within the widely accepted 5 thresholds recommended for streamflow gaging despite that the site considerably deviates from the guidelines for gaging site selection for unsteady flows the performance of the ivrc is considerably better than hqrc attempts are made to complement the typical statistical analysis used for assessing the quality of discharge estimates provided by the ratings with insights into flow characteristics that deteriorate the quality of the flow estimates passing through the stations keywords non ideal gaging stations rating curves horizontal acoustic doppler current profilers index velocity method fast varying unsteady flows 1 introduction accurate estimation of flows is critical not only for understanding and progressing our knowledge on rivers but also for monitoring flows for practical purposes as currently riverine water supplies are facing continuously increasing demands while monitoring streamflow is one of the core hydrologic measurements this study does focus on its implementation at a hydropower site where the site and flow regime are complex hydropower industry is one of the water stressed areas of water resources as it strives to achieve both energy production goals and satisfaction of other water uses in addition to maintain a sustainable environment hydropower operations are constrained by the availability of water in the drainage basin feeding the reservoir the multi purpose regulatory functions at the dam and the need to supply appropriate flows downstream for protecting the environment in high and low flow conditions there are multiple factors tracking flows at hydropower dams each of them aimed at fulfilling specific purposes first monitoring the hydropower functional constraints is tracked by the power station operators by monitoring rates and volumes of flows these quantities need to be accurate and measured in real time for each of the turbine generator units to confirm the performance guaranteed by the turbine manufacturers and to optimize the dispatch of the units within the plant for maximizing the amount of power harnessed from the available water while concurrently meeting other economic goals continuous flow measurement in the units is also needed to monitor the performance of the power generation process over time as the system components are exposed to degradation changes in the operating environment and aging of the equipment additional flow monitoring means are set in the vicinity of the dam in order to monitor other water management objectives and verify the fulfillment of conditions required for maintaining a healthy aquatic environment downstream of the dam the latter requirement enforces location specific release parameters i e average maximum and minimum flow rates that the hydroelectric facility must comply with these constraints can vary seasonally or with specific flow conditions e g flood or drought events especially critical in the present context is the provision of minimum environmental flows downstream the dam as this requirement is increasingly competing with other water needs such as supply of fresh water power generation groundwater recharge and recreational benefits all the above considerations highlight the importance of plant s abilities to accurately quantify the flows released downstream off the dam in real or near real time i e with sampling intervals of the order of several minutes hydrologist are typically in charge of setting operating and optimizing the measurement means downstream of the hydropower dams discharge measurements need to be continuous hence recourse is made to one of the available methods e g rantz et al 1982b herschy 2009 the stage discharge hqrc is the first method developed for continuous streamflow estimation this method is the most extensively used and documented measurement approach for both conventional instruments e g sauer 2010 new technologies e g paris et al 2016 as well as data driven approaches e g wolfs and willems 2014 the index velocity ivrc method originally used in conjunction with mechanical devices rantz et al 1982a 1982b resurfaced vigorously with the use of travel time based acoustic instruments patino and ockerman 1997 and the adoption in the riverine environment of the doppler based acoustic velocimetry levesque and oberg 2012 while the hqrc construction and performance are extensively covered in multiple resources e g rantz et al 1982a 1982b herschy 2009 sauer 2010 the ivrc used in conjunction with adcps is still an active area of research and evaluation ruhl and simpson 2005 le coz et al 2008 levesque and oberg 2012 kastner et al 2018 the present study is mostly focused on the ivrc method used in conjunction with adcps in an attempt to complement the on going evaluation efforts similar to hqrcs the ivrcs require an initial dataset acquired with alternative discharge measurements for calibration of the ratings subsequently the rcs are checked periodically for their validity over time and range of flows passing through the station the estimation of the data quality for rcs is one of the major challenges for facility operators as there are no standards or widely accepted methodologies for assessing the uncertainty associated with them irrespective of their type the subject of rc accuracy is still an open scientific issue le coz et al 2014 under continuous scrutiny e g van eerdenbrugh et al 2016 manfreda 2018 consequently most often the data is communicated and used without providing the overall uncertainty despite that in some flow situations the uncertainty can be significant e g muste and lee 2013 holmes 2016 another challenge in estimation of the rcs uncertainty is the lack of a widely recognized standardized reference method for calibrating direct discharge measurements in natural streams instead discrete measurements conducted at the site with conventional or modern instruments are typically used as reference the lack of uncertainty analysis for ratings is unfortunate as mcmillan et al 2017 demonstrate with several practical cases that estimating streamflow uncertainty is not only important for assessing the quality of the measurement protocol but also for guiding the means for reducing economic losses and making robust decisions in management applications without providing a full fledged uncertainty analysis this work provides a synthesis of the uncertainty sources in hqrc method and some quantitative assessment samples according to these authors the main hqrc uncertainty sources include 1 the measured stage series used for uncertainty estimation 2 the measurements of stage and flow used to derive the rating curve 3 the models used for interpolation and extrapolation in the rating curve and 4 unrecognized changes in the channel cross section due to scour fill vegetation and ice presence as well as backwater and hysteresis effects given the shorter experience with ivrc such insights are not yet available for this method however it is expected that the addition of the index velocity measurement to stage measurement will inherently provide more information about the flow dynamics hence lead to improved discharge estimation accuracy for this reason ivrc is recommended for complex flow situations such as unsteady and non uniform flows levesque and oberg 2012 on the other hand the ivrc method is more sensitive to the site conditions than hqrc as slight changes in the flow distribution might add uncertainty in final discharge estimates irrespective if the flow is steady or unsteady for example deviations from the reference discharge larger than 20 were found for an ivrc based on h adcp measurements at a station installed in a river bend with irregular bed efforts are currently on going to find complementary measures to both assess and improve the accuracy of the ivrc method kastner et al 2018 this paper is focused on the assessment of the performance of continuous estimation of the discharges made with protocols based on hqrc and ivrc the station is located on the snake river immediately below the cj strike dam in idaho usa this station along with other gaging sites on the snake river displays several common features rapid flow changes occurring frequently to meet the load demand in the power grid local hydraulic control at the station and considerable seasonal aquatic growth on the river banks and streambed attaining good performance at gaging stations servicing hydropower dams is challenged by both functional and hydrologic constraints the functional constraints require to place the station as close as feasible to the dam which it serves the hydrological constraints require a set of provisions to ensure that the flow through the station is adequate for reliable measurements given that the functional role is the main reason for creating the discussed station the hydrologic constraints become secondary factors in choosing the monitoring site resulting in poorer than desired measurement conditions wood et al 2014 our paper neither seeks nor aims at estimating measurement uncertainties as such outcomes would not be relevant for the majority of gaging sites where conventional gaging methods are applied rather it illustrates the performance of the conventional monitoring methods at sites with complex morpho dynamic conditions that sometimes are unavoidable from practical perspectives it does so by comparing discharge estimates obtained with ivrc and hqrc methods along with direct adcp and turbine meter measurements in steady flows and during the rising and falling phases of flow transitions the experimental evidence presented in the paper relates detrimental flow features at the station with their effects on the discharge estimation complementing the statistical analysis approach typically used for constructing and evaluating data quality of the ratings 2 measurement methodology environment equipment and protocols 2 1 methodology overview the accuracy and stability of ivrc and hqrc based methods for well selected gaging sites depend on the accuracy of the calibration measurements and the methods used to construct the rcs if site selection does not follow the best practices rantz et al 1982a benson and dalrymple 1967 additional uncertainties will be introduced as every deviation from the guidelines produces flow disturbances that are not accounted for in the assumptions of the rating curve these additional complexities might affect the measurement without being part of the data collection process hence becoming sources for additional uncertainties embedded in the final results the selection of site and the construction of the ratings require a good understanding of the physical processes occurring at the site and their impact on the construction of the ratings over the whole flow range special attention needs to be paid to flow transitions as they are inherently different for the rising and falling phase especially if the flow changes are abrupt which is the case for the cj strike hydropower station efforts are currently being made by various communities to assess the performance of the rating based methods for various flow situations and develop robust standardized methodologies for the assessment of uncertainties for both direct measurements e g muste et al 2012 and rating curves e g le coz et al 2014 however there is insufficient information to estimate the uncertainties for all practical situations and measurement methods in the absence of such information the performance of the rc based methods is made by comparison with ad hoc references nihei and sakai 2006 kastner et al 2018 the present study adopts this latter approach by comparing discharge estimates obtained with ivrc and hqrc methods with direct adcp measurements the experimental evidence presented in this paper includes extensive measurements of the flow features developing at a non ideal gaging station site changes in the steady flow structure due to flow redistribution and changes in ratings due to unsteadiness the hqrc ratings beneficiate from century long assessments and abundant literature documenting theoretical and practical aspects of its performance in both steady and unsteady flows e g henderson 1966 rantz et al 1982a 1982b herschy 2009 sauer 2010 moreover the hqrc is equipped with methods for rating correction of unsteady flows e g schmidt 2002 dottori et al 2009 guided by recommendations offered by kennedy 1984 the hqrc rating for the cj strike station is a based on a power law of the following form 1 q 365 275 m 1 201 s s t a g e 0 60 m 1 799 where the discharge has unit of m3 s and the stage have the unit of m the fitting of the hqrc parameters is based on logarithmic grid against the log of discharge values in comparison there is less experimental evidence documenting the performance of the ivrc used in conjunction with acoustic profilers e g ruhl and simpson 2005 nihei and sakai 2006 le coz et al 2008 levesque and oberg 2012 jackson et al 2012 muste and lee 2013 and kastner et al 2018 because these instruments are relatively newer i e 1980s from this perspective the datasets presented in this paper represent a good resource for discussion and inferences on the performance of ivrc as the gaging site condition is quite challenging for both steady and unsteady flows following the guidelines formulated by levesque and oberg 2012 the type of ivrc rating adopted for this site is the multiple linear regression as shown in eq 2 2 v mean 0 158 v index 0 00914 m 1 v index s t a g e 0 146 m s where vmean and vindex have the unit of m s and stage has the unit of m this relationship obtained through multiple analysis of the trends observed in the coefficients of determination standard errors and residual plots accounts for stage variation in addition to the measured index velocity this type of rating indicates that the measurement site experiences significant changes in the flow distribution due to changes of the stages over a wide range and or changes along the channel geometry or combination of both the hydropower station s yearly analysis report an internal document specifies that 90 measurements were used for establishing this version of the rating curve with an r2 value of 0 95 and standard error of 0 052 m s two independent studies wood et al 2014 muste et al 2015 concluded that the measurement protocols for construction of the ivrc implemented at the cj strike dam gaging station are in compliance with the best practices for continuous discharge estimation displayed in fig 1 a are the calibration measurements leading to the current version of the ivrc relationship along with the 27 new direct measurements acquired in steady flows during the customized experiments the velocity residuals associated with the ivrc relationship calculated with the protocols described in levesque and oberg 2012 are plotted in fig 1b the inspection of the calibration and validation residuals shows that they do not depart considerably less than 5 from the current ivrc relationship and that the residual plots lack discernable patterns hence confirming its validity 2 2 gaging site general guidelines for hqrc based station selections are discussed in detail by rantz et al 1982a and 1982b however the chief criteria for selection of a gaging station adjacent to a flow control structure like the cj strike dam is to accurately monitor outflows of the power plant this dam as others on the snake river must fulfill stringent water right regulations soi 2005 consequently the gaging station must be located as close to the point of outflow released from the dam as possible to avoid contributions from runoff tributaries or seepage the latter source is caused by the movement of groundwater to surface water due to the high gradient of the groundwater in some reaches of the snake river basin hortness and vidmar 2005 for the present situation the geo morphologic conditions in the vicinity of the dam do not allow for a more favorable downstream location for the station as a result the cj strike dam gaging site had to be set immediately downstream of a bend as illustrated in fig 2 the channel is straight 75 m upstream and 450 m downstream from the gage the banks are high and not subject to overflow except for extremely high stages the streambed consists of cobble and gravel and is relatively stable it is obvious from the above description that this gaging site deviates considerably from ideal conditions suggested by the best practices levesque and oberg 2012 while the guidelines for gaging station selection are similar for hqrc and ivrc methods the latter has additional requirements regarding the flow distribution in the station which is a factor not required explicitly for hqrc more specifically levesque and oberg 2012 state that the flow distribution for ivrc should be uniform in both vertical and horizontal direction i e parallel flow lines and not affected by upstream geometrical disturbances however it is obvious that for the current situation the stream curvature and streambed morphology lead to the formation of three dimensional flow structures at the measurement section overall only three out of the nine specific criteria for favorable ivrc site conditions levesque and oberg 2012 are satisfied for the cj strike gauging station one of the objectives of this paper is to illustrate quantitatively the implications of such deviations on the station performance during daily routine operations the complexity of monitoring at this site is exacerbated by the frequent and rapid changes of the flow due to the operation of three turbines in various combinations fig 2 the daily demands of the power grid require up to three turbines in operation which results in daily flow changes from 130 to 370 m3 s flows above 370 m3 s only occur when there is excess water in the reservoir that needs to be released over the dam spillway the maximum flow was 850 m3 s during the 2009 2013 interval the left bank channel is typically active as it conveys the outflow from the power plant the right bank channel is active only during high flows immediately upstream of the station there is an island which is flooded at high stages at high stages the flow path upstream of the station changes drastically compared to the ones during typical power plant operations the hydraulic channel control is local and is provided by the inflow of two merging streams just upstream the gaging station 2 3 equipment type and settings the gaging station was operated as a hqrc station for twenty two years usgs station 13171620 and it has been served by both hqrc and ivrc for seven years wood et al 2014 currently the direct measurements continuously acquired at the site are stage index velocity and discharge measured with turbine attached meters the first two measurements are used to support the ivrc and hqrc protocols the decision to add an ivrc measurement protocol was motivated by the frequent presence of unsteady flows at the site the stage is measured with a design analysis h350xl h355 combo bubbler system located next to a downstream bridge pier fig 3 a winter kennedy meters wkm are set in the turbine housings to provide direct discharge measurements the wkm measurements can be used as absolute values only after in situ calibrations urquiza et al 2012 a process that was not conducted for this site therefore the wkm measurements are used herein as surrogate reference data as they are good indicators of the rapid changes of the flow downstream the dam and actually are in close agreement with the direct adcp discharge measurements a 600 khz trdi channelmaster horizontal acoustic doppler current profiler h adcp is used for the ivrc method the h adcp is positioned close to one of the upstream bridge piers in a deeper area of the cross section fig 3a and b which carries less than half of the stream s total discharge the elevation of the h adcp was determined to ensure that the h adcp remains operational for minimum flows muste et al 2015 the actual profiling range of the h adcp is limited to about 44 m because over this range the beam interferes with the free surface at minimum flows the inadequate location and orientation of the h adcp in the cross section might limit its performance and accuracy while the best practice guidelines levesque and oberg 2012 were known to the gaging station operators wood et al 2014 the shallowness of the flow at low discharges and the lack of steep banks in the cross section did not allow for a more favorable alternative for h adcp location and orientation the non optimal setting of the h adcp within the cross section poses several shortcomings levesque and oberg 2012 a a considerably unmeasured portion of the flow b interference to the h adcp acoustic beams from channel bottom and the free surface for low stages c difference of the in beam measured velocities due to the instrument orientation with respect to the streamflow direction at the time of installation the station s hydrographers had to balance the above shortcomings to minimize their detrimental effects on the measured index velocity the direct discharge measurements for calibration and validation of the rating curves at this station are made with boat mounted adcps operated in conformity with the usgs protocols outlined by mueller and wagner 2009 the review of the station s maintenance files reveals that the station managers apply rigorously and systematically the best available practices for both operational status of the instruments that acquire the direct measurements for the ratings as well as the good standing of the hqrc and ivrc ratings wood et al 2014 ipc 2014 fig 3c illustrates a sample time series for the wkm direct measurements and discharge estimates obtained continuously with the ivrc and hqrc methods during routine operations of the power station i e flow released by one or two turbines the time series highlight the abrupt and repeated changes that occur in the flow the study conducted by muste et al 2015 grouped the historical data in sub datasets to illustrate the impact of various site and flow conditions on the rating curve performance for steady flow the accuracy of both ivrc and hqrc for steady flows estimates is within 5 for the majority of the cases analyzed which is within the range of widely accepted stream gaging uncertainty pelletier 1988 carter and anderson 1963 the averages of the differences between hqrc ivrc and the surrogate reference i e wkm data across all the whole flow range are 0 57 and 2 0 respectively detailed discussions about the performance of the methods for discharge estimation in steady and unsteady flows using experiments specifically designed for this purpose are provided next 3 customized experiments for performance analysis guided by the observations from the exploratory analysis of the historic datasets a customized experiment was designed and implemented on august 26 and 27 2014 these experiments aimed at validating the inferences garnered from the historical data analysis and investigation of new flow measurement aspects of particular interest were the measurements designed to capture aspects that were not available from the historic data a changes in the flow structure along the path of h adcp as a function of the turbines in operation and flow magnitude b the capabilities of the rcs to accurately estimate unsteady flows for these purposes the routine measurements acquired at the station were complemented by adcp transect measurements acquired concurrently along two cross sections t1 and t2 in the vicinity of the gaging station fig 2 the adcp acquisition time for one transect was about 3 min the 86 direct measurements acquired over the two days at t1 and t2 were obtained with two types of adcps i e an m9 sontek ysi and a 1200 khz rio grande teledyne rdi respectively the transects were acquired back to back for steady 27 and unsteady 59 flow regimes only measurements at cross section t1 are provided in the present analysis as they are closer to the gaging station velocity and bathymetric mapping in the vicinity of the gage station was accomplished with the same adcps during the 2 day experiment courtesy of watercube llc fig 4 illustrates the timeline of the concurrent measurements and the discharge variation for each day the range of flows measured during the customized experiments corresponds to routine flow regimes passing through the hydropower station as released by one or two turbines operating alone or simultaneously prior to the analysis of the customized experiments the adcp transect data were synchronized with the other discharge data according to the guidance for validation of the ivrc performance over time described by levesque and oberg 2012 the procedure illustrated in fig 5 is particularly important as the flow is rapidly varying at the cj strike dam the minimum sampling frequency for the synchronization is dictated by the 3 min duration of the adcp transect measurements using the midpoint of the adcp transect duration the adcp transect value was paired with the stage measurement sampled every 3 min within this time window and the closest h adcp reading sampled every minute to the stage measurement an additional time synchronization was applied to the wkm data in order to account for the travel time of the flow propagating from the location of the wkm to section t1 where the rest of the measurements were acquired the transients caused by the rapid opening of the turbine gate propagate with a speed of 4 m s for the given flow conditions henderson 1966 that produce a delay of the wkm time series of about 105 s the synchronized measurements of the stage and index velocity are illustrated in fig 6 a and c the synchronized time series for the discharge using the four methods i e adcp transects wkm hqrc and ivrc are provided in fig 6b and d the discussion of the discharge estimation for both steady and unsteady flow only considers segments of the time series where all the types of discharge measurements are available which are essentially the segments when direct discharge measurements from adcp transects were acquired for the purpose of this analysis we will treat the circled data in fig 6b and d as steady stationary flow conditions the adcp datasets for steady flows contain 4 7 transects and no directional bias are detected in the consecutive transects the percent deviations for the adcp transects repeatedly acquired in the steady flows range from 0 7 to 1 9 the datasets for unsteady flows contains 30 points for the descending phase and 26 points for the rising phase of the flow transitions comparison of the hqrc and ivrc discharge estimates for the steady flows during the customized experiments are provided in table 1 along with the direct discharge measurements reported by the wkm the adcp transects the comparison is clustered by flow discharge range the analysis of the customized experiments reported in table 1 are referenced to the direct discharge measurements acquired with the m9 adcp in the cross section t1 fig 2 the first notable quantitative observation related to the steady flow dataset displayed in the table 1 and fig 6 is that the adcp measurements are 2 1 and 1 4 higher compared with the wkm for discharge values of 130 260 m3 s respectively it can be observed that the hqrc estimates are within 1 5 of adcp measurements except for one case and within 2 of the wkm data in comparison the ivrc estimates exhibit larger deviations from both adcp and wkm measurements this observation was also confirmed by the analysis of the historic data muste et al 2015 which reinforces the conclusion that the hqrc discharge estimates are of better quality for steady flows the ivrc discharge estimates display a difference up to 3 8 and 8 6 from adcp measurements for steady flows at 130 and 260 m3 s respectively this observation is consistent in the comparison of the ivrc estimates with wkm a notable feature of the data displayed in table 1 is that the percentage difference between adcp and ivrc discharges change signs when turbine 1 or 3 operates alone this last observation is most probably related to the change in flow structure within the h adcp measurement path which will be discussed below the most important observation at this point is that the difference among the methods currently used for monitoring discharge of the steady flow is within 5 fig 6b and d also entails the experimental evidence regarding the performance of hqrc and ivrc for unsteady flows the adcp transects for quantifying transient flows started synchronously with the change in the turbine operation through coordination between dam operators and hydrographers the adcp measurements for transient flow continued for about one hour after the change twelve to fifteen adcp transects were acquired for about 1 h after the abrupt flow changes it can be noticed that the fast opening of the turbine gate lasting about one minute is well captured by wkm meters located at the turbine and relatively closely followed by the adcp transect measurements acquired at section t1 fig 2 the same plots show that the sharp transitions in the flow are not closely followed by the hqrc or ivrc estimates the difference between the wkm and hqrc can be as large as 80 while the wkm and ivrc can be as large as 40 for the highest flow change rates these large differences between the reference data and hqrc and ivrc estimates during transitions are also attributable to the storage effect that occurs in the confluence area the storage effect is visible in the plots of fig 6a and c where the rate of change of the index velocity is decreasing faster than that of the stage the discharges do not settle to a constant value 3 4 h after the transition onset 4 discussion 4 1 inferences from steady flows for index velocity techniques to be effective there is set of criteria related to site and instrument selection along with instrument positioning and setting that need to be simultaneously fulfilled levesque and oberg 2012 provide a detailed inventory of these criteria suggesting that site selection is more critical than instrument related aspects as the latter can be somewhat counteracted with alternative operation and post processing means complementary ivrc related guidelines regarding data synchronization movement of the bed index velocity transducer alignment and data acquisition aspects are provided by ruhl and simpson 2005 given that the presented experimental evidence is limited to just one observation site the discussion below is not aimed at demonstrating quantifying or ranking the impact of these criteria on the rating performance instead by taking advantage of the availability of concurrent measurements with various spatial temporal characteristics at the same location this study aims to illustrate with case specific examples the impact of some of these deviations and describe the experimental means to capture these impacts a first notable aspect for the ivrc operation in the present situation is that due to bed irregularity of the bed and shallowness of the flow the h adcp samples from limited range of the cross section approx 44 m this limited range is dictated by the fact that the h adcp beam spreads and interfere with the free surface for distances larger than 44 m from the probe as illustrated in fig 3b the partial coverage of the cross section for the h adcp is not an uncommon situation as other investigators reported profiling ranges that covered only between a quarter and a tenth of the cross sectional length e g kastner et al 2018 similar reductions of the profiling range can be deliberately imposed when velocities in some cells of the h adcp deviate from the general pattern observed in the other cells due to local flow disturbances for such situations the deviating cell readings are discarded from the ivrc regression levesque and oberg 2012 intriguingly le coz et al 2008 found that measurements with a 300 khz h adcp were reliable only for distances shorter than the 60 m from the probe location consequently they discarded measurements for more than 1 3 of the cross section and developed ivrc curves using velocities measured only in this area for situations where the h adcp is considerably limited compared with the stream width numerical modeling for extrapolating the velocity distribution in the unmeasured vertical and horizontal areas can be used instead of direct measurements e g nihei and kimizu 2008 hidayat et al 2011 a second observation on the present measurements is that the flow structure in the gaging station s cross section is non uniform over flow ranges and remarkably different in the areas not measured by the h adcp as illustrated in fig 7 flow non uniformity is produced by changes in the flow magnitude and different combinations of operating turbines comparison of flow patterns for various flow magnitudes in historical and new measurements shows that the patterns are replicated for identical flow settings which indicates stable streambed for this measurement location the distribution of the depth averaged velocity profile over the cross section illustrated in fig 7a indicate that the flow is redistributed over subsections depending on flow magnitude and the location of the operating turbines most relevant for the present analysis are the top two plots in fig 7a and the top two graphs in fig 7b that display a different distribution along the hadcp measurement path for the same total discharge passing through the gaging station it should be noted that the results in fig 7a were obtained by averaging several adcp transects during steady flow to eliminate the potential noise introduced by turbulence and measurement instrument so that systematic difference of velocity distribution can be revealed this flow redistribution is only partially captured by the h adcp measurements that are acquired over 1 3 of the cross section leaving a considerable portion unmeasured along the right bank during the site visits strong currents in this area were observed which are also illustrated by the normalized depth averaged velocity profile in fig 7a in summary the experimental evidence discussed above illustrates that the site and the flow changes that are present in steady flows violates several of the general recommendations for good ivrc practices e g rantz et al 1982b levesque and oberg 2012 sauer 2010 i e lack of uniform flow distribution in the cross section non parallel flow lines non uniform channel geometry and a varying flow distribution with stage moreover the flow cross section is not well captured by the short h adcp profiling range and slightly oblique with the respect to the stream direction the overall effect of the above listed factors may render the current ivrc relationship less accurate than hqrc estimates especially for higher steady flows which was pointed out in our discussion of the historic data muste et al 2015 and the previous study conducted by wood et al 2014 the increase of scattering of discharge estimates within the ivrc method compared to hqrc can be also attributed to the fact that ivrc combines two direct measurements that are inherently and independently prone to scattering it can be concluded that despite all of the deviations from good practice guidelines the use of the ivrc method is surprisingly reliable for steady flows and close to the limits of acceptable accuracy i e 5 4 2 inferences from unsteady flows most of the methods used for river monitoring consider the watershed and river hydrology and hydraulics as the outcome of a stationary independent and identically distributed random process in time and space this view has given rise to empirical strategies for building rating curves for continuous monitoring of streamflows that are based on data records acquired using a random or quasi random sampling approach without consideration of the flow phases during the unsteady flows on the other hand a cursory review of a handful of detailed laboratory experiments tu and graf 1992 nezu and nakagawa 1995 song and graf 1996 graf and qu 2004 yang et al 2006 and field measurements nihei and sakai 2006 jackson et al 2012 muste and lee 2013 reveal that the velocity profiles during the propagation of an unsteady event are different for the same hydrograph depending on its phase more specifically the experiments conducted by song and graf 1996 showed that during the passage of the hydrograph the velocities on the rising limb are larger than on the falling limb for the same flow depth the difference was larger in the outer layer of the flow than in the inner layer where they stay close to the profile described by logarithmic law tu and graf 1992 nezu and nakagawa 1995 yang 2009 these experiments also showed that the difference between the flow phases increases with flow unsteadiness the above considerations do not imply that the degree of change of the velocity magnitude and velocity profile shape are considerable in all practical situations however they are systematic as they are driven by peculiar turbulence behavior in unsteady flows hunt 1997 yang and chow 2008 the changes are highly dependent on many variables acting in isolation or combined e g channel geometry velocity magnitude rate of acceleration deceleration etc the random or quasi random sampling approach for developing ratings seem to work well in steady and slow varying flows according to previous studies that conclude that the performance of ivrc is comparable with hqrc for inland streams and rivers e g morlock et al 2002 muste and lee 2013 for fast varying flows hqrc fails to accurately track flows and requires corrections which are well documented in the literature e g jones 1916 fread 1975 kennedy 1984 schmidt 2002 actually the creation of the ivrc is in part driven to counteract the poor performance of the hqrc in stream reaches affected by unsteady flows and or backwater rantz et al 1982b levesque and oberg 2012 however the differences in the magnitude and shape of the vertical velocity profiles for fast varying flows require more detailed scrutiny of the ivrc for these flows as these differences deteriorate the quality of the rating a certain degree of improvement of the ivrc based over hqrc discharge estimates for unsteady flows is expected from the sheer reasoning of continuously sampling both the stage a geometrical flow characteristic and index velocity a dynamic flow feature this improvement is illustrated in fig 8 c and d by the different discharges outputted by the two methods for pairs of simultaneously acquired stage and index velocity measurements in unsteady flows fig 8a and b the point of departure between the two methods is that ivrc senses the change in the position and shape of the unsteady velocity profiles with respect to the steady flow profile as they develop the hqrc returns only one value of the discharge i e qs for one stage value irrespective of the shape of the velocity during the measured flows the missed flow dynamics i e the looped rating illustrated in fig 8c can be reconstructed in the stage discharge plot if appropriate protocols are implemented in conjunction with the steady hqrc as discussed below the next part of this section summarizes the hqrc performance during the flow transitions occurring during the customized experiments conducted on august 26 27 2014 for this purpose fig 9 replicates the data from fig 6c and d with additional data for supporting the analysis visual inspection of fig 9a clearly shows that the hqrc displays the least dynamic behavior during transitions as the method relies on a one to one rc relationship stemming from the steady flow assumption this behavior is a consequence of the fact that hqrc ingests the stage a geometrical flow characteristics that does not capture the effect of temporal and spatial acceleration and the pressure gradient term involved in governing equations for unsteady flow propagation e g fenton and keller 2001 for the measurements at this specific gaging site the deviations from the reference data i e adcp and wkm are further increased by the presence of backwater that slows down the recovery in the hqrc discharge time series the backwater occurs because of the mild storage effect in the confluence area produced by the sudden release of the flow at the turbine gates as can be seen in figs 3c 6a and 6c the flow becomes uniform only 3 4 h after changes in turbine operation occur for completeness of this discussion one of the formulas for correcting the steady hqrc estimates during flow transitions is added in fig 9a this formula developed by fread 1975 has been extensively tested through previous analyses e g lee 2013 this correction applied to the hqrc time series brings the discharge estimates closer to the wkm and adcp measurements with better agreement for the rising than the falling limb the fact that the correction algorithm does not fully correct the hqrc estimates confirms the backwater presence at the station as fread correction algorithm does not account for this effect overall it is obvious that the corrections applied to hqrc improve its reliability for tracking unsteady flows finally the last part of this section focuses on the behavior of the ivrc based estimation method during unsteady flows the response of the ivrc based method to the sudden flow change is similar with respect to its performance to the one obtained from the fread correction applied to hqrc for the falling phases of the transitions the ivrc predicted discharges are close to the wkm and adcp the graphs in fig 9b and c illustrate that the ivrc leads to two distinct curves for the rising and falling limbs of the flow transitions even if the index velocity ivrc is analytically represented by one relationship the corrected hqrc and ivrc rating are in better agreement among themselves as well as with the direct adcp measured discharges these non conventional graphical representations of the ivrc method reiterate the capability of the ivrc method to better capture the dynamics of unsteady flow events compared to hqrc method the most interesting aspect of the experimental evidence discussed herein is that the multiple linear regression rating used for the index velocity displays a loop during the transitions see fig 9d and e to the knowledge of these authors the substantiation of the loop in the ivrc rating has not been reported before the different trajectories of the rating for the rising and the falling limb of the hydrographs is a direct results of the coupling of the index velocity velocity with stage by the stage in the ivrc relationship the thickness of such developed loops might be dependent on the rate of change of the velocity as observed in laboratory experiments tu and graf 1992 nezu and nakagawa 1995 field measurements holmes 2016 and with unsteady flow simulations lee 2013 it is worth mentioning that ivrc can also develop loops from aspects not strictly related to flow unsteadiness bad data synchronization can also lead to ivrc loops ruhl and simpson 2005 we analyzed the data in fig 9d and e for possible bad data synchronization and found that the thickness of the loop in the rating is increasing by changing the synchronization pattern described in fig 5 therefore concluding that the data synchronization is not a factor in producing the loop for the present situation a possible solution for the loop presence in the ivrc rating can be the protocol offered by ruhl and simpson 2005 they refer to the need to develop composite looped index velocity ratings for flow phases occurring in the same channel when there are considerable differences between the flow distributions of the phases as in the case of the tidal rivers these loops in the ivrc ratings were also observed by jackson et al 2012 during the propagation of unsteady events in a quasi regular rectangular channel geometry for such situations ruhl and simpson 2005 recommend separate ratings for the flood to web and ebb to flood flow phases rather than including the stage as an additional dependent variable in the ivrc relationship in other words they propose independent construction of separate ratings for the flow phases where changes in the velocity distribution might occur in the cross section for different phases of the unsteady flows by sheer comparison of all curves plotted in fig 9a it seems that the abrupt and large changes of the flow during turbine regime operation at the cj strike dam are relatively well handled by the ivrcs that include stage as an independent variable in the construction of the rating the current practice for the assessment of the quality of ivrc rating is typically made based on statistical means as mentioned in section 2 1 rather than identifying and evaluating directly the flow features that could affect the quality of the rating even less discussion is given to the changes that occur in the structure of open channel flow during unsteady flows and tracing their impact on the rating behavior systematic observations of the unsteady flows are needed using an event based tracking approach as the rising and falling limbs of the hydrographs are structurally different from steady flow and between themselves as illustrated in fig 8 it is worth mentioning that unsteady flows develop for every precipitation event in the drainage area of unregulated streams and quite often in controlled regime streams as is the case of the cj strike dam where the flow is considerably and abruptly changed 2 3 times per day 5 conclusions selection of a proper gaging site in natural streams is a ubiquitous challenge that is considerably aggravated when the gaging has to serve specific purposes as in the case discussed in this paper while the construction maintenance and the performance of hqrcs for steady and unsteady flows are documented by multiple guidelines and previous data there are relatively few similar resources available for demonstrating the performance of ivrcs for steady and unsteady flows this situation is expected due to the fact that ivrcs are a relatively novel method compared to hqrcs which have been developed over more than a century the results presented herein along with the associated discussions attempt to fill this gap by substantiating specific flow features developing at a non ideal gaging site location operated in frequent and fast flow transitions a first highlight of the analyzed experimental evidence is that for steady flows the hqrc is reliable for steady flows while the ivrc is affected by larger scattering over the whole flow range and slightly underestimates with the increase of the flow the slightly better hqrc performance is mostly attributed to the fact that this method is of a more global nature hence less sensitive to the changes in flow structure in contrast ivrc is sensitive to changes in the cross sectional flow structure irrespective of their source i e flow non uniformity in the test section redistribution of the vertical and transversal velocity profiles with the stage and or flow regime due to the hydropower plant operations and presence of secondary currents these changes cannot be fully captured by the index velocity acquired with an h adcp that covers only limited portion of the cross section section 4 for these situation the direct index velocity measurements need to be complemented with appropriate analytical or data driven algorithms that fill in data in the unmeasured flow areas the second highlight of the discussion illustrates that the addition of the stage to the index velocity measurement in the ivrc protocol is considerably improving the accuracy of monitoring unsteady flows in comparison with the hqrc method which relies only on stage as input the improvement is also attributed to the simultaneous acquisition of the two variables with high sampling frequency which makes the rating curve more adept to follow flow dynamics for the range of flows and the measurement environment tested in this study the ivrc method s deviations from the reference are up to 40 which is about half of the level of deviation found within the hqrc estimates large deviations of both the ivrc and hqrc estimates are expected in the present complex site case as the construction of these curves follow practices strictly valid for ideal sites and steady flows neither of which applies to the situations at this site such complex sites require a thorough evaluation of the added benefits of ivrc usage over the less expensive hqrc before deployment the third highlight is related to the protocols used to collect the data for building and validating ratings for unsteady flows often times the choice of monitoring method cannot be made prior to collection and analysis of discharge measurements holmes 2016 therefore a good practice recommends to conduct detailed measurements over the whole range of flows including transitional periods before selecting the method the available literature does not offer useful criteria either for identifying when flow unsteadiness is significantly affecting the ratings performance or for recommending site specific procedures to account for unsteadiness hysteresis commensurate with the flow conditions the paper demonstrates that the adoption of event based sampling protocols has the capability to capture the propagation of unsteady flows including the hysteresis presence the high sampling rates for the stage velocity datasets enabled by the new non intrusive instruments in conjunction with fast acquired adcp measurements as those described in this study can very aptly support the evaluation of the monitoring method s performance the present analysis and the conclusions drawn herewith are based on limited datasets therefore the outcomes of the discussion should be regarded as being indicative rather than confirmative however the presented experimental evidence clearly illustrates that attaining streamflow monitoring with improved accuracy requires the acquisition of additional measurements that provide insights of adverse flow features that deteriorates the quality of the rating based methods for both steady and unsteady flows of special importance is the evaluation of the hysteresis related effects on steady rcs irrespective of their type as the available experimental studies are still scarce and fragmented due to the difficulty to acquire direct measurements that track all aspects of the unsteady flow propagation through an event the current possibility to acquire direct measurements such as those reported here enable to make sound judgements on the performance of the rcs during flow transitions it is expected that the adoption of more rigorous and systematic assessment of the flow intricacies will lead to better understanding of the cause effect relationship on the quality of the ratings and eventually to methods to detect and resolve the quality issue of the stream monitoring outcomes these improvements require long term efforts but are indispensable at a time when the need to accurately estimate streamflow

6860,the paper presents various aspects of monitoring streamflows with stage discharge hqrc and index velocity ivrc based ratings at a non ideal gaging station with emphasis on their reliance during fast varying unsteady flows for this purpose the paper analyzes data obtained from customized experiments whereby the flow phases are tracked as they develop during flow transitions the analysis compares discharges obtained from hqrc and ivrc ratings with those directly measured with acoustic doppler current profilers adcp and a flowmeter set in the housing of the turbines that release the flow in the downstream channel it is found that during steady flows both hqrc and ivrc methods perform within the widely accepted 5 thresholds recommended for streamflow gaging despite that the site considerably deviates from the guidelines for gaging site selection for unsteady flows the performance of the ivrc is considerably better than hqrc attempts are made to complement the typical statistical analysis used for assessing the quality of discharge estimates provided by the ratings with insights into flow characteristics that deteriorate the quality of the flow estimates passing through the stations keywords non ideal gaging stations rating curves horizontal acoustic doppler current profilers index velocity method fast varying unsteady flows 1 introduction accurate estimation of flows is critical not only for understanding and progressing our knowledge on rivers but also for monitoring flows for practical purposes as currently riverine water supplies are facing continuously increasing demands while monitoring streamflow is one of the core hydrologic measurements this study does focus on its implementation at a hydropower site where the site and flow regime are complex hydropower industry is one of the water stressed areas of water resources as it strives to achieve both energy production goals and satisfaction of other water uses in addition to maintain a sustainable environment hydropower operations are constrained by the availability of water in the drainage basin feeding the reservoir the multi purpose regulatory functions at the dam and the need to supply appropriate flows downstream for protecting the environment in high and low flow conditions there are multiple factors tracking flows at hydropower dams each of them aimed at fulfilling specific purposes first monitoring the hydropower functional constraints is tracked by the power station operators by monitoring rates and volumes of flows these quantities need to be accurate and measured in real time for each of the turbine generator units to confirm the performance guaranteed by the turbine manufacturers and to optimize the dispatch of the units within the plant for maximizing the amount of power harnessed from the available water while concurrently meeting other economic goals continuous flow measurement in the units is also needed to monitor the performance of the power generation process over time as the system components are exposed to degradation changes in the operating environment and aging of the equipment additional flow monitoring means are set in the vicinity of the dam in order to monitor other water management objectives and verify the fulfillment of conditions required for maintaining a healthy aquatic environment downstream of the dam the latter requirement enforces location specific release parameters i e average maximum and minimum flow rates that the hydroelectric facility must comply with these constraints can vary seasonally or with specific flow conditions e g flood or drought events especially critical in the present context is the provision of minimum environmental flows downstream the dam as this requirement is increasingly competing with other water needs such as supply of fresh water power generation groundwater recharge and recreational benefits all the above considerations highlight the importance of plant s abilities to accurately quantify the flows released downstream off the dam in real or near real time i e with sampling intervals of the order of several minutes hydrologist are typically in charge of setting operating and optimizing the measurement means downstream of the hydropower dams discharge measurements need to be continuous hence recourse is made to one of the available methods e g rantz et al 1982b herschy 2009 the stage discharge hqrc is the first method developed for continuous streamflow estimation this method is the most extensively used and documented measurement approach for both conventional instruments e g sauer 2010 new technologies e g paris et al 2016 as well as data driven approaches e g wolfs and willems 2014 the index velocity ivrc method originally used in conjunction with mechanical devices rantz et al 1982a 1982b resurfaced vigorously with the use of travel time based acoustic instruments patino and ockerman 1997 and the adoption in the riverine environment of the doppler based acoustic velocimetry levesque and oberg 2012 while the hqrc construction and performance are extensively covered in multiple resources e g rantz et al 1982a 1982b herschy 2009 sauer 2010 the ivrc used in conjunction with adcps is still an active area of research and evaluation ruhl and simpson 2005 le coz et al 2008 levesque and oberg 2012 kastner et al 2018 the present study is mostly focused on the ivrc method used in conjunction with adcps in an attempt to complement the on going evaluation efforts similar to hqrcs the ivrcs require an initial dataset acquired with alternative discharge measurements for calibration of the ratings subsequently the rcs are checked periodically for their validity over time and range of flows passing through the station the estimation of the data quality for rcs is one of the major challenges for facility operators as there are no standards or widely accepted methodologies for assessing the uncertainty associated with them irrespective of their type the subject of rc accuracy is still an open scientific issue le coz et al 2014 under continuous scrutiny e g van eerdenbrugh et al 2016 manfreda 2018 consequently most often the data is communicated and used without providing the overall uncertainty despite that in some flow situations the uncertainty can be significant e g muste and lee 2013 holmes 2016 another challenge in estimation of the rcs uncertainty is the lack of a widely recognized standardized reference method for calibrating direct discharge measurements in natural streams instead discrete measurements conducted at the site with conventional or modern instruments are typically used as reference the lack of uncertainty analysis for ratings is unfortunate as mcmillan et al 2017 demonstrate with several practical cases that estimating streamflow uncertainty is not only important for assessing the quality of the measurement protocol but also for guiding the means for reducing economic losses and making robust decisions in management applications without providing a full fledged uncertainty analysis this work provides a synthesis of the uncertainty sources in hqrc method and some quantitative assessment samples according to these authors the main hqrc uncertainty sources include 1 the measured stage series used for uncertainty estimation 2 the measurements of stage and flow used to derive the rating curve 3 the models used for interpolation and extrapolation in the rating curve and 4 unrecognized changes in the channel cross section due to scour fill vegetation and ice presence as well as backwater and hysteresis effects given the shorter experience with ivrc such insights are not yet available for this method however it is expected that the addition of the index velocity measurement to stage measurement will inherently provide more information about the flow dynamics hence lead to improved discharge estimation accuracy for this reason ivrc is recommended for complex flow situations such as unsteady and non uniform flows levesque and oberg 2012 on the other hand the ivrc method is more sensitive to the site conditions than hqrc as slight changes in the flow distribution might add uncertainty in final discharge estimates irrespective if the flow is steady or unsteady for example deviations from the reference discharge larger than 20 were found for an ivrc based on h adcp measurements at a station installed in a river bend with irregular bed efforts are currently on going to find complementary measures to both assess and improve the accuracy of the ivrc method kastner et al 2018 this paper is focused on the assessment of the performance of continuous estimation of the discharges made with protocols based on hqrc and ivrc the station is located on the snake river immediately below the cj strike dam in idaho usa this station along with other gaging sites on the snake river displays several common features rapid flow changes occurring frequently to meet the load demand in the power grid local hydraulic control at the station and considerable seasonal aquatic growth on the river banks and streambed attaining good performance at gaging stations servicing hydropower dams is challenged by both functional and hydrologic constraints the functional constraints require to place the station as close as feasible to the dam which it serves the hydrological constraints require a set of provisions to ensure that the flow through the station is adequate for reliable measurements given that the functional role is the main reason for creating the discussed station the hydrologic constraints become secondary factors in choosing the monitoring site resulting in poorer than desired measurement conditions wood et al 2014 our paper neither seeks nor aims at estimating measurement uncertainties as such outcomes would not be relevant for the majority of gaging sites where conventional gaging methods are applied rather it illustrates the performance of the conventional monitoring methods at sites with complex morpho dynamic conditions that sometimes are unavoidable from practical perspectives it does so by comparing discharge estimates obtained with ivrc and hqrc methods along with direct adcp and turbine meter measurements in steady flows and during the rising and falling phases of flow transitions the experimental evidence presented in the paper relates detrimental flow features at the station with their effects on the discharge estimation complementing the statistical analysis approach typically used for constructing and evaluating data quality of the ratings 2 measurement methodology environment equipment and protocols 2 1 methodology overview the accuracy and stability of ivrc and hqrc based methods for well selected gaging sites depend on the accuracy of the calibration measurements and the methods used to construct the rcs if site selection does not follow the best practices rantz et al 1982a benson and dalrymple 1967 additional uncertainties will be introduced as every deviation from the guidelines produces flow disturbances that are not accounted for in the assumptions of the rating curve these additional complexities might affect the measurement without being part of the data collection process hence becoming sources for additional uncertainties embedded in the final results the selection of site and the construction of the ratings require a good understanding of the physical processes occurring at the site and their impact on the construction of the ratings over the whole flow range special attention needs to be paid to flow transitions as they are inherently different for the rising and falling phase especially if the flow changes are abrupt which is the case for the cj strike hydropower station efforts are currently being made by various communities to assess the performance of the rating based methods for various flow situations and develop robust standardized methodologies for the assessment of uncertainties for both direct measurements e g muste et al 2012 and rating curves e g le coz et al 2014 however there is insufficient information to estimate the uncertainties for all practical situations and measurement methods in the absence of such information the performance of the rc based methods is made by comparison with ad hoc references nihei and sakai 2006 kastner et al 2018 the present study adopts this latter approach by comparing discharge estimates obtained with ivrc and hqrc methods with direct adcp measurements the experimental evidence presented in this paper includes extensive measurements of the flow features developing at a non ideal gaging station site changes in the steady flow structure due to flow redistribution and changes in ratings due to unsteadiness the hqrc ratings beneficiate from century long assessments and abundant literature documenting theoretical and practical aspects of its performance in both steady and unsteady flows e g henderson 1966 rantz et al 1982a 1982b herschy 2009 sauer 2010 moreover the hqrc is equipped with methods for rating correction of unsteady flows e g schmidt 2002 dottori et al 2009 guided by recommendations offered by kennedy 1984 the hqrc rating for the cj strike station is a based on a power law of the following form 1 q 365 275 m 1 201 s s t a g e 0 60 m 1 799 where the discharge has unit of m3 s and the stage have the unit of m the fitting of the hqrc parameters is based on logarithmic grid against the log of discharge values in comparison there is less experimental evidence documenting the performance of the ivrc used in conjunction with acoustic profilers e g ruhl and simpson 2005 nihei and sakai 2006 le coz et al 2008 levesque and oberg 2012 jackson et al 2012 muste and lee 2013 and kastner et al 2018 because these instruments are relatively newer i e 1980s from this perspective the datasets presented in this paper represent a good resource for discussion and inferences on the performance of ivrc as the gaging site condition is quite challenging for both steady and unsteady flows following the guidelines formulated by levesque and oberg 2012 the type of ivrc rating adopted for this site is the multiple linear regression as shown in eq 2 2 v mean 0 158 v index 0 00914 m 1 v index s t a g e 0 146 m s where vmean and vindex have the unit of m s and stage has the unit of m this relationship obtained through multiple analysis of the trends observed in the coefficients of determination standard errors and residual plots accounts for stage variation in addition to the measured index velocity this type of rating indicates that the measurement site experiences significant changes in the flow distribution due to changes of the stages over a wide range and or changes along the channel geometry or combination of both the hydropower station s yearly analysis report an internal document specifies that 90 measurements were used for establishing this version of the rating curve with an r2 value of 0 95 and standard error of 0 052 m s two independent studies wood et al 2014 muste et al 2015 concluded that the measurement protocols for construction of the ivrc implemented at the cj strike dam gaging station are in compliance with the best practices for continuous discharge estimation displayed in fig 1 a are the calibration measurements leading to the current version of the ivrc relationship along with the 27 new direct measurements acquired in steady flows during the customized experiments the velocity residuals associated with the ivrc relationship calculated with the protocols described in levesque and oberg 2012 are plotted in fig 1b the inspection of the calibration and validation residuals shows that they do not depart considerably less than 5 from the current ivrc relationship and that the residual plots lack discernable patterns hence confirming its validity 2 2 gaging site general guidelines for hqrc based station selections are discussed in detail by rantz et al 1982a and 1982b however the chief criteria for selection of a gaging station adjacent to a flow control structure like the cj strike dam is to accurately monitor outflows of the power plant this dam as others on the snake river must fulfill stringent water right regulations soi 2005 consequently the gaging station must be located as close to the point of outflow released from the dam as possible to avoid contributions from runoff tributaries or seepage the latter source is caused by the movement of groundwater to surface water due to the high gradient of the groundwater in some reaches of the snake river basin hortness and vidmar 2005 for the present situation the geo morphologic conditions in the vicinity of the dam do not allow for a more favorable downstream location for the station as a result the cj strike dam gaging site had to be set immediately downstream of a bend as illustrated in fig 2 the channel is straight 75 m upstream and 450 m downstream from the gage the banks are high and not subject to overflow except for extremely high stages the streambed consists of cobble and gravel and is relatively stable it is obvious from the above description that this gaging site deviates considerably from ideal conditions suggested by the best practices levesque and oberg 2012 while the guidelines for gaging station selection are similar for hqrc and ivrc methods the latter has additional requirements regarding the flow distribution in the station which is a factor not required explicitly for hqrc more specifically levesque and oberg 2012 state that the flow distribution for ivrc should be uniform in both vertical and horizontal direction i e parallel flow lines and not affected by upstream geometrical disturbances however it is obvious that for the current situation the stream curvature and streambed morphology lead to the formation of three dimensional flow structures at the measurement section overall only three out of the nine specific criteria for favorable ivrc site conditions levesque and oberg 2012 are satisfied for the cj strike gauging station one of the objectives of this paper is to illustrate quantitatively the implications of such deviations on the station performance during daily routine operations the complexity of monitoring at this site is exacerbated by the frequent and rapid changes of the flow due to the operation of three turbines in various combinations fig 2 the daily demands of the power grid require up to three turbines in operation which results in daily flow changes from 130 to 370 m3 s flows above 370 m3 s only occur when there is excess water in the reservoir that needs to be released over the dam spillway the maximum flow was 850 m3 s during the 2009 2013 interval the left bank channel is typically active as it conveys the outflow from the power plant the right bank channel is active only during high flows immediately upstream of the station there is an island which is flooded at high stages at high stages the flow path upstream of the station changes drastically compared to the ones during typical power plant operations the hydraulic channel control is local and is provided by the inflow of two merging streams just upstream the gaging station 2 3 equipment type and settings the gaging station was operated as a hqrc station for twenty two years usgs station 13171620 and it has been served by both hqrc and ivrc for seven years wood et al 2014 currently the direct measurements continuously acquired at the site are stage index velocity and discharge measured with turbine attached meters the first two measurements are used to support the ivrc and hqrc protocols the decision to add an ivrc measurement protocol was motivated by the frequent presence of unsteady flows at the site the stage is measured with a design analysis h350xl h355 combo bubbler system located next to a downstream bridge pier fig 3 a winter kennedy meters wkm are set in the turbine housings to provide direct discharge measurements the wkm measurements can be used as absolute values only after in situ calibrations urquiza et al 2012 a process that was not conducted for this site therefore the wkm measurements are used herein as surrogate reference data as they are good indicators of the rapid changes of the flow downstream the dam and actually are in close agreement with the direct adcp discharge measurements a 600 khz trdi channelmaster horizontal acoustic doppler current profiler h adcp is used for the ivrc method the h adcp is positioned close to one of the upstream bridge piers in a deeper area of the cross section fig 3a and b which carries less than half of the stream s total discharge the elevation of the h adcp was determined to ensure that the h adcp remains operational for minimum flows muste et al 2015 the actual profiling range of the h adcp is limited to about 44 m because over this range the beam interferes with the free surface at minimum flows the inadequate location and orientation of the h adcp in the cross section might limit its performance and accuracy while the best practice guidelines levesque and oberg 2012 were known to the gaging station operators wood et al 2014 the shallowness of the flow at low discharges and the lack of steep banks in the cross section did not allow for a more favorable alternative for h adcp location and orientation the non optimal setting of the h adcp within the cross section poses several shortcomings levesque and oberg 2012 a a considerably unmeasured portion of the flow b interference to the h adcp acoustic beams from channel bottom and the free surface for low stages c difference of the in beam measured velocities due to the instrument orientation with respect to the streamflow direction at the time of installation the station s hydrographers had to balance the above shortcomings to minimize their detrimental effects on the measured index velocity the direct discharge measurements for calibration and validation of the rating curves at this station are made with boat mounted adcps operated in conformity with the usgs protocols outlined by mueller and wagner 2009 the review of the station s maintenance files reveals that the station managers apply rigorously and systematically the best available practices for both operational status of the instruments that acquire the direct measurements for the ratings as well as the good standing of the hqrc and ivrc ratings wood et al 2014 ipc 2014 fig 3c illustrates a sample time series for the wkm direct measurements and discharge estimates obtained continuously with the ivrc and hqrc methods during routine operations of the power station i e flow released by one or two turbines the time series highlight the abrupt and repeated changes that occur in the flow the study conducted by muste et al 2015 grouped the historical data in sub datasets to illustrate the impact of various site and flow conditions on the rating curve performance for steady flow the accuracy of both ivrc and hqrc for steady flows estimates is within 5 for the majority of the cases analyzed which is within the range of widely accepted stream gaging uncertainty pelletier 1988 carter and anderson 1963 the averages of the differences between hqrc ivrc and the surrogate reference i e wkm data across all the whole flow range are 0 57 and 2 0 respectively detailed discussions about the performance of the methods for discharge estimation in steady and unsteady flows using experiments specifically designed for this purpose are provided next 3 customized experiments for performance analysis guided by the observations from the exploratory analysis of the historic datasets a customized experiment was designed and implemented on august 26 and 27 2014 these experiments aimed at validating the inferences garnered from the historical data analysis and investigation of new flow measurement aspects of particular interest were the measurements designed to capture aspects that were not available from the historic data a changes in the flow structure along the path of h adcp as a function of the turbines in operation and flow magnitude b the capabilities of the rcs to accurately estimate unsteady flows for these purposes the routine measurements acquired at the station were complemented by adcp transect measurements acquired concurrently along two cross sections t1 and t2 in the vicinity of the gaging station fig 2 the adcp acquisition time for one transect was about 3 min the 86 direct measurements acquired over the two days at t1 and t2 were obtained with two types of adcps i e an m9 sontek ysi and a 1200 khz rio grande teledyne rdi respectively the transects were acquired back to back for steady 27 and unsteady 59 flow regimes only measurements at cross section t1 are provided in the present analysis as they are closer to the gaging station velocity and bathymetric mapping in the vicinity of the gage station was accomplished with the same adcps during the 2 day experiment courtesy of watercube llc fig 4 illustrates the timeline of the concurrent measurements and the discharge variation for each day the range of flows measured during the customized experiments corresponds to routine flow regimes passing through the hydropower station as released by one or two turbines operating alone or simultaneously prior to the analysis of the customized experiments the adcp transect data were synchronized with the other discharge data according to the guidance for validation of the ivrc performance over time described by levesque and oberg 2012 the procedure illustrated in fig 5 is particularly important as the flow is rapidly varying at the cj strike dam the minimum sampling frequency for the synchronization is dictated by the 3 min duration of the adcp transect measurements using the midpoint of the adcp transect duration the adcp transect value was paired with the stage measurement sampled every 3 min within this time window and the closest h adcp reading sampled every minute to the stage measurement an additional time synchronization was applied to the wkm data in order to account for the travel time of the flow propagating from the location of the wkm to section t1 where the rest of the measurements were acquired the transients caused by the rapid opening of the turbine gate propagate with a speed of 4 m s for the given flow conditions henderson 1966 that produce a delay of the wkm time series of about 105 s the synchronized measurements of the stage and index velocity are illustrated in fig 6 a and c the synchronized time series for the discharge using the four methods i e adcp transects wkm hqrc and ivrc are provided in fig 6b and d the discussion of the discharge estimation for both steady and unsteady flow only considers segments of the time series where all the types of discharge measurements are available which are essentially the segments when direct discharge measurements from adcp transects were acquired for the purpose of this analysis we will treat the circled data in fig 6b and d as steady stationary flow conditions the adcp datasets for steady flows contain 4 7 transects and no directional bias are detected in the consecutive transects the percent deviations for the adcp transects repeatedly acquired in the steady flows range from 0 7 to 1 9 the datasets for unsteady flows contains 30 points for the descending phase and 26 points for the rising phase of the flow transitions comparison of the hqrc and ivrc discharge estimates for the steady flows during the customized experiments are provided in table 1 along with the direct discharge measurements reported by the wkm the adcp transects the comparison is clustered by flow discharge range the analysis of the customized experiments reported in table 1 are referenced to the direct discharge measurements acquired with the m9 adcp in the cross section t1 fig 2 the first notable quantitative observation related to the steady flow dataset displayed in the table 1 and fig 6 is that the adcp measurements are 2 1 and 1 4 higher compared with the wkm for discharge values of 130 260 m3 s respectively it can be observed that the hqrc estimates are within 1 5 of adcp measurements except for one case and within 2 of the wkm data in comparison the ivrc estimates exhibit larger deviations from both adcp and wkm measurements this observation was also confirmed by the analysis of the historic data muste et al 2015 which reinforces the conclusion that the hqrc discharge estimates are of better quality for steady flows the ivrc discharge estimates display a difference up to 3 8 and 8 6 from adcp measurements for steady flows at 130 and 260 m3 s respectively this observation is consistent in the comparison of the ivrc estimates with wkm a notable feature of the data displayed in table 1 is that the percentage difference between adcp and ivrc discharges change signs when turbine 1 or 3 operates alone this last observation is most probably related to the change in flow structure within the h adcp measurement path which will be discussed below the most important observation at this point is that the difference among the methods currently used for monitoring discharge of the steady flow is within 5 fig 6b and d also entails the experimental evidence regarding the performance of hqrc and ivrc for unsteady flows the adcp transects for quantifying transient flows started synchronously with the change in the turbine operation through coordination between dam operators and hydrographers the adcp measurements for transient flow continued for about one hour after the change twelve to fifteen adcp transects were acquired for about 1 h after the abrupt flow changes it can be noticed that the fast opening of the turbine gate lasting about one minute is well captured by wkm meters located at the turbine and relatively closely followed by the adcp transect measurements acquired at section t1 fig 2 the same plots show that the sharp transitions in the flow are not closely followed by the hqrc or ivrc estimates the difference between the wkm and hqrc can be as large as 80 while the wkm and ivrc can be as large as 40 for the highest flow change rates these large differences between the reference data and hqrc and ivrc estimates during transitions are also attributable to the storage effect that occurs in the confluence area the storage effect is visible in the plots of fig 6a and c where the rate of change of the index velocity is decreasing faster than that of the stage the discharges do not settle to a constant value 3 4 h after the transition onset 4 discussion 4 1 inferences from steady flows for index velocity techniques to be effective there is set of criteria related to site and instrument selection along with instrument positioning and setting that need to be simultaneously fulfilled levesque and oberg 2012 provide a detailed inventory of these criteria suggesting that site selection is more critical than instrument related aspects as the latter can be somewhat counteracted with alternative operation and post processing means complementary ivrc related guidelines regarding data synchronization movement of the bed index velocity transducer alignment and data acquisition aspects are provided by ruhl and simpson 2005 given that the presented experimental evidence is limited to just one observation site the discussion below is not aimed at demonstrating quantifying or ranking the impact of these criteria on the rating performance instead by taking advantage of the availability of concurrent measurements with various spatial temporal characteristics at the same location this study aims to illustrate with case specific examples the impact of some of these deviations and describe the experimental means to capture these impacts a first notable aspect for the ivrc operation in the present situation is that due to bed irregularity of the bed and shallowness of the flow the h adcp samples from limited range of the cross section approx 44 m this limited range is dictated by the fact that the h adcp beam spreads and interfere with the free surface for distances larger than 44 m from the probe as illustrated in fig 3b the partial coverage of the cross section for the h adcp is not an uncommon situation as other investigators reported profiling ranges that covered only between a quarter and a tenth of the cross sectional length e g kastner et al 2018 similar reductions of the profiling range can be deliberately imposed when velocities in some cells of the h adcp deviate from the general pattern observed in the other cells due to local flow disturbances for such situations the deviating cell readings are discarded from the ivrc regression levesque and oberg 2012 intriguingly le coz et al 2008 found that measurements with a 300 khz h adcp were reliable only for distances shorter than the 60 m from the probe location consequently they discarded measurements for more than 1 3 of the cross section and developed ivrc curves using velocities measured only in this area for situations where the h adcp is considerably limited compared with the stream width numerical modeling for extrapolating the velocity distribution in the unmeasured vertical and horizontal areas can be used instead of direct measurements e g nihei and kimizu 2008 hidayat et al 2011 a second observation on the present measurements is that the flow structure in the gaging station s cross section is non uniform over flow ranges and remarkably different in the areas not measured by the h adcp as illustrated in fig 7 flow non uniformity is produced by changes in the flow magnitude and different combinations of operating turbines comparison of flow patterns for various flow magnitudes in historical and new measurements shows that the patterns are replicated for identical flow settings which indicates stable streambed for this measurement location the distribution of the depth averaged velocity profile over the cross section illustrated in fig 7a indicate that the flow is redistributed over subsections depending on flow magnitude and the location of the operating turbines most relevant for the present analysis are the top two plots in fig 7a and the top two graphs in fig 7b that display a different distribution along the hadcp measurement path for the same total discharge passing through the gaging station it should be noted that the results in fig 7a were obtained by averaging several adcp transects during steady flow to eliminate the potential noise introduced by turbulence and measurement instrument so that systematic difference of velocity distribution can be revealed this flow redistribution is only partially captured by the h adcp measurements that are acquired over 1 3 of the cross section leaving a considerable portion unmeasured along the right bank during the site visits strong currents in this area were observed which are also illustrated by the normalized depth averaged velocity profile in fig 7a in summary the experimental evidence discussed above illustrates that the site and the flow changes that are present in steady flows violates several of the general recommendations for good ivrc practices e g rantz et al 1982b levesque and oberg 2012 sauer 2010 i e lack of uniform flow distribution in the cross section non parallel flow lines non uniform channel geometry and a varying flow distribution with stage moreover the flow cross section is not well captured by the short h adcp profiling range and slightly oblique with the respect to the stream direction the overall effect of the above listed factors may render the current ivrc relationship less accurate than hqrc estimates especially for higher steady flows which was pointed out in our discussion of the historic data muste et al 2015 and the previous study conducted by wood et al 2014 the increase of scattering of discharge estimates within the ivrc method compared to hqrc can be also attributed to the fact that ivrc combines two direct measurements that are inherently and independently prone to scattering it can be concluded that despite all of the deviations from good practice guidelines the use of the ivrc method is surprisingly reliable for steady flows and close to the limits of acceptable accuracy i e 5 4 2 inferences from unsteady flows most of the methods used for river monitoring consider the watershed and river hydrology and hydraulics as the outcome of a stationary independent and identically distributed random process in time and space this view has given rise to empirical strategies for building rating curves for continuous monitoring of streamflows that are based on data records acquired using a random or quasi random sampling approach without consideration of the flow phases during the unsteady flows on the other hand a cursory review of a handful of detailed laboratory experiments tu and graf 1992 nezu and nakagawa 1995 song and graf 1996 graf and qu 2004 yang et al 2006 and field measurements nihei and sakai 2006 jackson et al 2012 muste and lee 2013 reveal that the velocity profiles during the propagation of an unsteady event are different for the same hydrograph depending on its phase more specifically the experiments conducted by song and graf 1996 showed that during the passage of the hydrograph the velocities on the rising limb are larger than on the falling limb for the same flow depth the difference was larger in the outer layer of the flow than in the inner layer where they stay close to the profile described by logarithmic law tu and graf 1992 nezu and nakagawa 1995 yang 2009 these experiments also showed that the difference between the flow phases increases with flow unsteadiness the above considerations do not imply that the degree of change of the velocity magnitude and velocity profile shape are considerable in all practical situations however they are systematic as they are driven by peculiar turbulence behavior in unsteady flows hunt 1997 yang and chow 2008 the changes are highly dependent on many variables acting in isolation or combined e g channel geometry velocity magnitude rate of acceleration deceleration etc the random or quasi random sampling approach for developing ratings seem to work well in steady and slow varying flows according to previous studies that conclude that the performance of ivrc is comparable with hqrc for inland streams and rivers e g morlock et al 2002 muste and lee 2013 for fast varying flows hqrc fails to accurately track flows and requires corrections which are well documented in the literature e g jones 1916 fread 1975 kennedy 1984 schmidt 2002 actually the creation of the ivrc is in part driven to counteract the poor performance of the hqrc in stream reaches affected by unsteady flows and or backwater rantz et al 1982b levesque and oberg 2012 however the differences in the magnitude and shape of the vertical velocity profiles for fast varying flows require more detailed scrutiny of the ivrc for these flows as these differences deteriorate the quality of the rating a certain degree of improvement of the ivrc based over hqrc discharge estimates for unsteady flows is expected from the sheer reasoning of continuously sampling both the stage a geometrical flow characteristic and index velocity a dynamic flow feature this improvement is illustrated in fig 8 c and d by the different discharges outputted by the two methods for pairs of simultaneously acquired stage and index velocity measurements in unsteady flows fig 8a and b the point of departure between the two methods is that ivrc senses the change in the position and shape of the unsteady velocity profiles with respect to the steady flow profile as they develop the hqrc returns only one value of the discharge i e qs for one stage value irrespective of the shape of the velocity during the measured flows the missed flow dynamics i e the looped rating illustrated in fig 8c can be reconstructed in the stage discharge plot if appropriate protocols are implemented in conjunction with the steady hqrc as discussed below the next part of this section summarizes the hqrc performance during the flow transitions occurring during the customized experiments conducted on august 26 27 2014 for this purpose fig 9 replicates the data from fig 6c and d with additional data for supporting the analysis visual inspection of fig 9a clearly shows that the hqrc displays the least dynamic behavior during transitions as the method relies on a one to one rc relationship stemming from the steady flow assumption this behavior is a consequence of the fact that hqrc ingests the stage a geometrical flow characteristics that does not capture the effect of temporal and spatial acceleration and the pressure gradient term involved in governing equations for unsteady flow propagation e g fenton and keller 2001 for the measurements at this specific gaging site the deviations from the reference data i e adcp and wkm are further increased by the presence of backwater that slows down the recovery in the hqrc discharge time series the backwater occurs because of the mild storage effect in the confluence area produced by the sudden release of the flow at the turbine gates as can be seen in figs 3c 6a and 6c the flow becomes uniform only 3 4 h after changes in turbine operation occur for completeness of this discussion one of the formulas for correcting the steady hqrc estimates during flow transitions is added in fig 9a this formula developed by fread 1975 has been extensively tested through previous analyses e g lee 2013 this correction applied to the hqrc time series brings the discharge estimates closer to the wkm and adcp measurements with better agreement for the rising than the falling limb the fact that the correction algorithm does not fully correct the hqrc estimates confirms the backwater presence at the station as fread correction algorithm does not account for this effect overall it is obvious that the corrections applied to hqrc improve its reliability for tracking unsteady flows finally the last part of this section focuses on the behavior of the ivrc based estimation method during unsteady flows the response of the ivrc based method to the sudden flow change is similar with respect to its performance to the one obtained from the fread correction applied to hqrc for the falling phases of the transitions the ivrc predicted discharges are close to the wkm and adcp the graphs in fig 9b and c illustrate that the ivrc leads to two distinct curves for the rising and falling limbs of the flow transitions even if the index velocity ivrc is analytically represented by one relationship the corrected hqrc and ivrc rating are in better agreement among themselves as well as with the direct adcp measured discharges these non conventional graphical representations of the ivrc method reiterate the capability of the ivrc method to better capture the dynamics of unsteady flow events compared to hqrc method the most interesting aspect of the experimental evidence discussed herein is that the multiple linear regression rating used for the index velocity displays a loop during the transitions see fig 9d and e to the knowledge of these authors the substantiation of the loop in the ivrc rating has not been reported before the different trajectories of the rating for the rising and the falling limb of the hydrographs is a direct results of the coupling of the index velocity velocity with stage by the stage in the ivrc relationship the thickness of such developed loops might be dependent on the rate of change of the velocity as observed in laboratory experiments tu and graf 1992 nezu and nakagawa 1995 field measurements holmes 2016 and with unsteady flow simulations lee 2013 it is worth mentioning that ivrc can also develop loops from aspects not strictly related to flow unsteadiness bad data synchronization can also lead to ivrc loops ruhl and simpson 2005 we analyzed the data in fig 9d and e for possible bad data synchronization and found that the thickness of the loop in the rating is increasing by changing the synchronization pattern described in fig 5 therefore concluding that the data synchronization is not a factor in producing the loop for the present situation a possible solution for the loop presence in the ivrc rating can be the protocol offered by ruhl and simpson 2005 they refer to the need to develop composite looped index velocity ratings for flow phases occurring in the same channel when there are considerable differences between the flow distributions of the phases as in the case of the tidal rivers these loops in the ivrc ratings were also observed by jackson et al 2012 during the propagation of unsteady events in a quasi regular rectangular channel geometry for such situations ruhl and simpson 2005 recommend separate ratings for the flood to web and ebb to flood flow phases rather than including the stage as an additional dependent variable in the ivrc relationship in other words they propose independent construction of separate ratings for the flow phases where changes in the velocity distribution might occur in the cross section for different phases of the unsteady flows by sheer comparison of all curves plotted in fig 9a it seems that the abrupt and large changes of the flow during turbine regime operation at the cj strike dam are relatively well handled by the ivrcs that include stage as an independent variable in the construction of the rating the current practice for the assessment of the quality of ivrc rating is typically made based on statistical means as mentioned in section 2 1 rather than identifying and evaluating directly the flow features that could affect the quality of the rating even less discussion is given to the changes that occur in the structure of open channel flow during unsteady flows and tracing their impact on the rating behavior systematic observations of the unsteady flows are needed using an event based tracking approach as the rising and falling limbs of the hydrographs are structurally different from steady flow and between themselves as illustrated in fig 8 it is worth mentioning that unsteady flows develop for every precipitation event in the drainage area of unregulated streams and quite often in controlled regime streams as is the case of the cj strike dam where the flow is considerably and abruptly changed 2 3 times per day 5 conclusions selection of a proper gaging site in natural streams is a ubiquitous challenge that is considerably aggravated when the gaging has to serve specific purposes as in the case discussed in this paper while the construction maintenance and the performance of hqrcs for steady and unsteady flows are documented by multiple guidelines and previous data there are relatively few similar resources available for demonstrating the performance of ivrcs for steady and unsteady flows this situation is expected due to the fact that ivrcs are a relatively novel method compared to hqrcs which have been developed over more than a century the results presented herein along with the associated discussions attempt to fill this gap by substantiating specific flow features developing at a non ideal gaging site location operated in frequent and fast flow transitions a first highlight of the analyzed experimental evidence is that for steady flows the hqrc is reliable for steady flows while the ivrc is affected by larger scattering over the whole flow range and slightly underestimates with the increase of the flow the slightly better hqrc performance is mostly attributed to the fact that this method is of a more global nature hence less sensitive to the changes in flow structure in contrast ivrc is sensitive to changes in the cross sectional flow structure irrespective of their source i e flow non uniformity in the test section redistribution of the vertical and transversal velocity profiles with the stage and or flow regime due to the hydropower plant operations and presence of secondary currents these changes cannot be fully captured by the index velocity acquired with an h adcp that covers only limited portion of the cross section section 4 for these situation the direct index velocity measurements need to be complemented with appropriate analytical or data driven algorithms that fill in data in the unmeasured flow areas the second highlight of the discussion illustrates that the addition of the stage to the index velocity measurement in the ivrc protocol is considerably improving the accuracy of monitoring unsteady flows in comparison with the hqrc method which relies only on stage as input the improvement is also attributed to the simultaneous acquisition of the two variables with high sampling frequency which makes the rating curve more adept to follow flow dynamics for the range of flows and the measurement environment tested in this study the ivrc method s deviations from the reference are up to 40 which is about half of the level of deviation found within the hqrc estimates large deviations of both the ivrc and hqrc estimates are expected in the present complex site case as the construction of these curves follow practices strictly valid for ideal sites and steady flows neither of which applies to the situations at this site such complex sites require a thorough evaluation of the added benefits of ivrc usage over the less expensive hqrc before deployment the third highlight is related to the protocols used to collect the data for building and validating ratings for unsteady flows often times the choice of monitoring method cannot be made prior to collection and analysis of discharge measurements holmes 2016 therefore a good practice recommends to conduct detailed measurements over the whole range of flows including transitional periods before selecting the method the available literature does not offer useful criteria either for identifying when flow unsteadiness is significantly affecting the ratings performance or for recommending site specific procedures to account for unsteadiness hysteresis commensurate with the flow conditions the paper demonstrates that the adoption of event based sampling protocols has the capability to capture the propagation of unsteady flows including the hysteresis presence the high sampling rates for the stage velocity datasets enabled by the new non intrusive instruments in conjunction with fast acquired adcp measurements as those described in this study can very aptly support the evaluation of the monitoring method s performance the present analysis and the conclusions drawn herewith are based on limited datasets therefore the outcomes of the discussion should be regarded as being indicative rather than confirmative however the presented experimental evidence clearly illustrates that attaining streamflow monitoring with improved accuracy requires the acquisition of additional measurements that provide insights of adverse flow features that deteriorates the quality of the rating based methods for both steady and unsteady flows of special importance is the evaluation of the hysteresis related effects on steady rcs irrespective of their type as the available experimental studies are still scarce and fragmented due to the difficulty to acquire direct measurements that track all aspects of the unsteady flow propagation through an event the current possibility to acquire direct measurements such as those reported here enable to make sound judgements on the performance of the rcs during flow transitions it is expected that the adoption of more rigorous and systematic assessment of the flow intricacies will lead to better understanding of the cause effect relationship on the quality of the ratings and eventually to methods to detect and resolve the quality issue of the stream monitoring outcomes these improvements require long term efforts but are indispensable at a time when the need to accurately estimate streamflow

6861,the lower reaches of the yellow river huanghe a typical raised bed river have experienced many huge flood events in chinese history as the main factor controlling the topographic evolution of the channel the water and sediment supply conditions of the yellow river have undergone significant changes since the implementation of the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs in 2002 by the joint operation of large reservoirs hence it is necessary to conduct systematic research and evaluation on how the regulation scheme influences the scouring and deposition of the downstream channel this study used the elevation data of 79 fixed profiles collected between 1992 and 2012 from the channel downstream from gaocun in the yellow river to establish a digital elevation model the elevation model was used to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of channel scouring and deposition in the study area and to determine the main controlling factors the results show that on an inter annual scale the channel scouring and deposition pattern began to change from substantial deposition to rapid erosion after 2002 on a seasonal scale the overall characteristic was erosion in the flood season and deposition in the dry season however the erosion rate in the flood season increased and the deposition rate in the dry season decreased after 2002 from the spatial perspective the downstream riverbed experienced net deposition before 2002 and net scouring after 2002 the wsrs altered the regimes of water and sediment of the river and therefore dominated scouring and deposition in the downstream channel since the implementation of the wsrs continuous channel scouring in the study area provided about 41 of coarse grained sediments for the yellow river and formed an important source of sediments entering the sea however because of the formation of an armor layer of coarse grained sediments on the downstream riverbed surface due to continuous scouring after the implementation of the wsrs the erosion flux of the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river has shown a significant decrease since 2005 this study provides a typical case study for the response of the topographic evolution of rivers to water and sediment changes under the influence of intense human activities keywords lower yellow river huanghe reservoir regulation channel evolution

irreplaceable role in agricultural and industrial development as well as urban construction therefore the stability of a river is of great importance for the socio economic development of the river

2008 phillips 2013 vandenberghe 2002 since the 1950s human activities such as the rapid construction of dams and reservoirs in river basins have significant impacts on water regulation and sediment flux of large global rivers nilsson et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 consequently the topographic evolution of river channels in response to the regulation of reservoirs has been a topic of research interest since then lai et al 2017 petts and gurnell 2005 schumm and galay 1994 williams and wolman 1984 the yellow river was once the second most sediment laden river in the world with an average of 1 08 gt yr of sediments emptying into the sea due to its typical characteristics of low water discharge with high sediment load the yellow river has the highest suspended sediment concentration ssc in the world milliman and meade 1983 the terrain slope in the lower reaches of the yellow river after huayuankou hydrological station is significantly reduced fig 1 a thus when highly sediment laden water enters the lower reaches a significant quantity of coarse grained sediments is deposited on the riverbed as a result the riverbed is 5 8 m higher than the surrounding area and only 3 5 m lower than the levees on both banks wang et al 2017 forming a typical raised bed river chen et al 2012 consequently a large number of huge flood events that have affected the lower reaches of the yellow river throughout chinese history and significantly influenced china s social and economic development wang et al 2014 2007 since the 1950s a combination of climate change and human activities such as construction of large reservoirs soil and water conservation projects and water consumption have dramatically reduced the flux of water and sediments in the yellow river wang et al 2007 2006 more than that drying up even occurred water discharge lower than 1 m3 s in the lower reaches after 1972 with no flow days peaking at 226 days in 1997 at lijin station the last hydrological station before the yellow river empties into the sea xu 2004a resulting in severe degradation of the river channel and rapid elevation of the riverbed in order to reduce deposition in the downstream channel and reservoirs and increase the flood carrying capacity of the downstream channel the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc began to use large reservoirs in the main stream of the yellow river for the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs in july 2002 the wsrs is carried out mainly by xiaolangdi reservoir in combination with the sanmenxia and wanjiazhai reservoirs fig 1a the sluice gates of the reservoirs are opened around mid june each year to create artificial flood peaks scour downstream channels and transport large amounts of sediment to the sea wang et al 2017 since natural flood peaks have been replaced by artificial flood peaks that are short period events causing significant changes in the regime of water and sediment of the lower yellow river wang et al 2010 it has been more than 10 years since the implementation of the wsrs and on a 10 year scale deposition erosion has probably achieved equilibrium or quasi equilibrium batalla et al 2018 hence it is necessary to systematically and periodically assess the response of the topographic evolution of the river channel in the lower reaches to the wsrs many studies have been carried out on the scouring and deposition of the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river chu 2014 hu and zhang 2010 kong et al 2015 shi 2005 wang et al 2008 studies concluded that the atrophication of the downstream reaches of the river began in the 1970s and was most severe in the 1990s hu and zhang 2010 after xiaolangdi reservoir became operational in 2000 the situation in the lower reaches of the river channel changed from deposition to erosion chu 2014 wang et al 2010 some researchers argued that this change began after the implementation of the wsrs in 2002 bi et al 2014a kong et al 2015 the evolution of erosion

lower reaches of the yellow river were based on the sediment discharge equilibrium e g kong et al 2015 shi 2005 and cross sectional topography chu 2014 wang et al 2008 methods the sediment discharge equilibrium method uses the measured data of water and sediments at hydrological stations data of tributary sediment supply and water diversion between hydrological stations to calculate a material balance however existing survey methods are not usually accurate enough to collect statistics on the bedload discharge in addition data on tributary sediment supply and diversion between hydrological stations are neither complete nor systematic and are sometimes absent the method itself also has a deficiency in terms of error accumulation making its long term calculation results prone to distortion chien and wan 1956 the cross sectional topography method calculates the erosion deposition volume using the areas of the cross sections and the distances between sections pan et al 2015 few parameters are used in this method and when the meandering of the main channel makes the profile and the flow direction non perpendicular errors may occur in the calculated results yuan et al 2015 with the development of computers and remote sensing technology in recent years the grid topographical method has emerged which is a new method for quantitatively calculating channel scouring and deposition a digital elevation model dem for river channels is established based on satellite remote sensing data and field surveys of three dimensional topographic data for use in the calculation e g falkowski et al 2017 legleiter and kyriakidis 2008 merwade et al 2008 2006 schäppi et al 2010 this method can avoid the errors caused by the meandering of the river channel and changes in the profile width thereby improving the accuracy of the calculation results however it has rarely been used for the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river previous research mainly focused on the inter annual changes in channel scouring and deposition and rarely reported seasonal changes furthermore previous research mainly investigated the upper reaches of the yellow river as far as lijin hydrological station and rarely explored the characteristics of scouring and deposition in the reaches more than 100 km lower than lijin the lower reaches of the yellow river downstream of gaocun hydrological station were selected as the study area fig 1 a dem was established based on curved orthogonal grids using cross sectional elevation data and satellite remote sensing data using this model we calculated the inter annual and seasonal scouring and deposition flux of the lower reaches of the yellow river during 1991 2012 and analyzed the spatio temporal changes in channel scouring and deposition in the study area hence we were able to ascertain the evolution mechanism of scouring and deposition of the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river furthermore the overall contribution of channel scouring and deposition flux of the yellow river to the flux of sediments entering the sea was estimated 2 study area originating from the tibetan plateau the yellow river is about 5464 km long and empties into the bohai sea fig 1a it is the second longest river in china after the yangtze river changjiang and its basin area is 79 5 104 km2 the lower reaches of the yellow river start from the huayuankou hydrological station and comprise the last 760 km of the river the study area is part of these lower reaches flowing from gaocun station shandong province in the west to the river mouth in the east with a total length of about 534 km and a fall of approximately 60 m the lower reaches of the river exhibit two types of river channels braided to meandering transitional channels gaocun to aishan and meandering channels aishan to the river mouth xia et al 2014b most riverbeds are sandy and silty in the lower reaches of the yellow river the channel is flat and open and experiences extremely high rates of deposition with the riverbed elevation generally being 4 6 m above the level of the floodplains wang et al 2017 due to long term development of levees it is a typical raised bed river because the river is basically controlled by levees at the sides of the river fig 1b these flood control measures are under huge pressure and bursts and course changes occur frequently according to statistics the course of the yellow river has changed on a large scale nine times since 1855 from gaocun there is no obvious tributary flowing into the river channel fig 1a runoff and sediment mainly come from the upper reaches therefore the channel reach from gaocun is an ideal place to study the responses of channel scouring and deposition to water and sediment inflow process more than 3100 reservoirs have been built in the yellow river basin including four massive reservoirs i e longyangxia liujiaxia sanmenxia and xiaolangdi fig 1a with a total storage capacity of more than 68 km3 wang et al 2007 xiaolangdi reservoir has a designed capacity of 12 65 km3 its construction began in 1997 and it was put into use in 2000 currently as the second largest reservoir in the yellow river basin xiaolangdi reservoir controls the supply of water and sediments in the lower reaches of the yellow river as of october 2016 the accumulated volume of sediments in xiaolangdi reservoir was about 3 26 km3 yrcc 2016 which greatly reduced the amount of sediments flowing into the lower reaches of the yellow river and reaching the sea 3 materials and methods 3 1 data source the elevation data of the cross sections of the downstream channel reach from gaocun that were collected by the yrcc from 1991 to 2012 usually from may to june before the flood season and from september to october after the flood season were used for this study there were 79 profiles in the study area with a distance of about 2 13 km between profiles fig 1b for a given profile the main channel was measured using an sdh 13d digital echo sounder with an accuracy of 5 cm 0 4 h 0 4 of the water depth whereas the measurements on the floodplains were conducted by rtk gps or total station with an error less than 5 cm the remote sensing data were from landsat tm etm remote sensing images which are available for free download from the earth resources observation and science eros center http glovis usgs gov with a resolution of 30 m this study selected remote sensing image data of the study area in cloud free or slightly cloudy weather in the flood season from 1991 to 2012 the water and sediment data which included data on the monthly average runoff sediment discharge and annual average grain size of sediment on the river channel in 1999 and 2008 were measured by the yrcc 3 2 calculation method in this study profile data and satellite remote sensing data were combined to establish a dem based on curved orthogonal grids in order to calculate channel scouring and deposition the specific procedure was as follows 1 among landsat remote sensing images bands 4 5 and 1 rgb that were the most sensitive to the land water boundary were selected to synthesize false color pictures arcgis software version 9 3 was used to extract the boundary of the river channel during the period 1991 2012 based on this and the profile area the area for the dem generation was determined 2 considering the meandering nature of the river channel curved orthogonal grids that fitted the boundary of the river channel were selected fig 2 a the grid spacing generally ranged between 30 m and 100 m 3 the inverse distance interpolation method was used to interpolate the measured profile elevation data to the grid control points in order to obtain the dem of the channel fig 2b 4 the volume of the obtained dem was calculated and the changes in the channel scouring and deposition volume in different periods were calculated according to eqs 1 3 based on the scouring and deposition volume and the dry bulk density 1 3 t m3 the erosion and deposition flux were calculated 1 δ v d i v d i v f i 1 2 δ v f i v f i v d i 3 δ v a i v f i v f i 1 where δvd δvf and δva are the scouring and deposition volume in the dry season flood season and inter annual period respectively vd is the volume of river channel in the dry season vf represents the volume in the flood season subscript i represents the year the results of the calculations based on the curved orthogonal grid method and the cross sectional topography method were basically the same fig 3 a and the two methods showed a significant positive correlation in the scouring and deposition volume however the scouring and deposition volume obtained by the curved orthogonal grid method was about 13 higher than that obtained by the cross sectional topography method fig 3b 4 spatio temporal changes of channel scouring and deposition 4 1 temporal changes of channel scouring and deposition on an inter annual scale the main channel in the study area initially experienced deposition followed by erosion fig 4 a the period 1991 2001 witnessed net deposition for the downstream channel from gaocun the total amount of sediment was 244 106 m3 the average deposition rate was 24 106 m3 yr and the annual maximum amount of sediments was 119 106 m3 in 1997 1992 1996 and 1998 witnessed scouring in 1996 in particular the amount of scouring in the downstream channel reach up to 80 106 m3 from 2002 onward the downstream channel began to experience erosion using 1991 as a baseline the total erosion was about 300 106 m3 from 2002 to 2012 the average scouring rate was 49 106 m3 yr and the maximum annual erosion reached up to 129 106 m3 in 2003 however the erosion rate in the study area has decreased since 2005 from the perspective of seasonal changes the scouring and deposition in the study area showed obvious seasonality and periodicity fig 4b from 1991 to 2001 the dry seasons all witnessed deposition with the maximum deposition flux being about 127 106 m3 and the average deposition rate being about 50 106 m3 yr the flood season mainly witnessed scouring with an average annual scouring rate of approximately 23 106 m3 yr however the inter annual variation was larger with the maximum scouring amount being about 152 106 m3 yr some years such as 1994 and 1997 witnessed substantial deposition during the dry season of 2002 2012 the downstream channel of the yellow river still experienced substantial deposition but the deposition rate was significantly reduced the maximum deposition rate was only about 30 106 m3 yr and the average deposition rate was about 14 106 m3 yr which was about 30 of the first stage since 2002 the channel routinely showed scouring during the flood season the average scouring rate was 61 106 m3 yr which was about 2 7 times higher than during the first stage as with the inter annual scouring rate the erosion rate of the downstream channel has slightly decreased since 2005 4 2 spatial distribution of channel scouring and deposition in this study the main hydrological stations in the lower reaches of the yellow river were used as nodes to analyze the spatial distribution of scouring and deposition in the study area the results showed that the amounts of erosion and deposition varied greatly within different channel reaches from 1991 to 2001 the gaocun sunkou channel reach had the largest deposition volume in the study area its average annual deposition amount was approximately 10 106 m3 yr fig 5 a accounting for approximately 42 of the total deposition in the study area the luokou lijin channel reach ranked second with an annual deposition flux of about 6 106 m3 yr the deposition flux in the channel downstream of the lijin station was the smallest at only 1 106 m3 yr and it accounted for about 4 of the total deposition in the study area from 2002 to 2012 the gaocun sunkou channel reach still had the largest erosion volume its annual erosion volume was approximately 16 106 m3 yr accounting for 30 of the total erosion in the study area the luokou lijin channel reach also ranked second in this category with an annual erosion flux of approximately 13 106 m3 yr the erosion flux of the channel downstream from lijin was about 6 106 m3 yr accounting for around 12 of the total erosion in the study area in terms of the erosion and deposition intensity of different channel reaches the erosion and deposition volume per unit length of channel the spatial differences between channel reaches were significant from 1991 to 2001 the deposition intensity decreased downstream in the lower reaches of the river channel fig 5b the deposition intensity was highest in the gaocun sunkou channel reach which was up to 80 m3 m yr it decreased to 35 45 m3 m yr in the sunkou lijin channel reach it dropped to about 13 m3 m yr downstream of lijin which is only about 16 of the intensity of the gaocun sunkou channel reach in 2002 2012 the erosion intensity and deposition intensity varied significantly the maximum erosion intensity still occurred in the gaocun sunkou channel reach which was about 140 m3 m yr however from the sunkou channel reach to the river mouth the erosion intensity did not vary significantly and was stable at around 75 m3 m yr 5 main factors controlling the evolution of river channel river channel evolution is the result of the change in water and sediment regimes gregory et al 2008 phillips 2013 vandenberghe 2002 and their interaction with riverbed and bank sediment supply conditions miao et al 2016 water and sediment are influenced by climate change and human activities e g reservoir construction group et al 2001 milliman et al 2008 vorosmarty 2000 wang et al 2007 2006 as of 2005 at least 45000 dams above 15 m in height have been built on rivers globally nilsson et al 2005 these dams along with other human activities have drastically altered the flow and sediment transport processes of many rivers in the past century or so milliman et al 2008 syvitski 2005 as a result river channel erosion downstream of dams has been widely documented in large rivers such as the colorado river after the hoover dam williams and wolman 1984 the nile river after the aswan dam schumm and galay 1994 and the yangtze river after the three gorges dam lai et al 2017 the riverbed sediment conditions supply and grain size have important effects on riverbed erosion as well falkowski et al 2017 the variation in the grain size of riverbed sediments significantly affects the sediment discharge rate which in turn influences the evolution of the river topography paola and seal 1995 yuill et al 2010 5 1 changes in water and sediment inflow from upstream since the 1950s large reservoirs have been built in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river such as sanmenxia reservoir in 1963 liujiaxia reservoir in 1968 longyangxia reservoir in 1986 and xiaolangdi reservoir in 1999 fig 1a the sediment blocking effect of large reservoirs along with the water and soil conservation project in the loess plateau has led to a sharp decline in sediment discharge since the 1950s wang et al 2007 2016 since its operation in 1999 xiaolangdi reservoir due to its significant sediment blocking effect has experienced a significant reduction in its storage capacity at a rate of 0 3 km3 yr wang et al 2017 which has resulted in a significant decrease in seasonal and inter annual sediment discharge downstream the average annual sediment discharge at the gaocun station decreased from 0 5 gt yr in 1991 2000 to 0 14 gt yr in 2001 2012 a drop of more than 72 fig 6 a the sediment discharge in the flood season was about 0 42 gt yr before the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir and fell sharply by about 74 to 0 11 gt yr after the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir fig 6b in the dry season the sediment discharge decreased by around 62 5 from 0 08 gt yr to 0 03 gt yr after the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir began this decrease was less than that in the flood season fig 6c furthermore together with sanmenxia and wanjiazhai reservoirs in the middle reaches xiaolangdi reservoir plays a significant role in regulating runoff in the wsrs which has stabilized the downstream water diversion peng et al 2010 consequently the inter annual yellow river runoff rose by approximately 27 from 19 2 km3 yr to 24 4 km3 yr after implementation of the wsrs fig 6a water and sediment regulation mainly refers to creating artificial floods by releasing runoff from wanjiazhai sanmenxia and xiaolangdi reservoirs in the middle of june each year i e the flood season in this study resulting in a significant increase in runoff during the flood season from 11 2 km3 yr to 15 6 km3 yr fig 6b in the dry season the runoff did not change significantly before or after the implementation of the wsrs and was effectively stable at about 8 6 km3 yr fig 6c for the yellow river characterized by high sediment discharge changes in channel scouring and deposition are controlled not only by the upstream runoff q or sediment inflow qs but also by the upstream flow sediment combinations such as the ssc ssc qs q kong et al 2015 xu 2014 and sediment inflow coefficient ssc q fu et al 2010 wu et al 2008 xia et al 2014a xu 2003 the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir especially the wsrs resulted in a sharp decrease in sediment discharge and an increase in runoff upstream from gaocun since then the flow sediment combinations of the yellow river especially the sediment inflow coefficient have changed fig 6d before the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir the sediment inflow coefficient was greater than 20 g s m6 and could reach 130 g s m6 after the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir the sediment inflow coefficient dropped and could be as low as 2 g s m6 this shows that under the condition of constant runoff the sediment inflow concentration in the upper reaches of the yellow river as far as gaocun reduced significantly with a constant sediment carrying capacity of the runoff the yellow river eroded the riverbed to obtain a supply of sediment thereby achieving equilibrium between its sediment carrying capacity and the ssc xu 2004b as a result erosion has occurred in the riverbed of the yellow river downstream of the reservoirs since the implementation of the wsrs fig 4a the flood process including the flood intensity and frequency is an important factor influencing the topographic evolution of the river channel batalla et al 2018 williams 1978 xia et al 2014a xu 2015 owing to the high sediment carrying capacity and high ssc of floodwater the topography of the river has changed significantly abate et al 2015 krapesch et al 2011 wang and xu 2016 flood control by dams led to a significant reduction in flood intensity and frequency magilligan et al 2003 resulting in substantial deposition on the riverbed brandt 2000 petts and pratts 1983 for the lower reaches of the yellow river there was no significant change in flood intensity before and after the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir fig 7 whereas the frequency of flood peaks was significantly reduced flooding typically only occurred during water and sediment regulation therefore the flood intensity and frequency were not factors influencing channel erosion after 2002 the yellow river typically has a high ssc natural floods were mainly caused by heavy rainfall in the basin particularly in the loess plateau in the middle reaches of the river surface runoff caused by rainfall eroded the surface of the basin resulting in the synchronization of sediment peaks and flood peaks fig 7a highly sediment laden flows significantly reduced the erosion efficiency of floods which was also a major factor influencing the substantial deposition in the lower reaches of the yellow river xu 2014 after the wsrs was implemented the water and sediment regimes in the lower reaches of the yellow river were altered through joint regulation of xiaolangdi wanjiazhai and sanmenxia reservoirs wang et al 2017 in the early stage of the wsrs artificial flood peaks were created mainly by discharging clean water from xiaolangdi reservoir the peak flood flow rate was generally up to 4000 m3 s and could last about two weeks fig 7b furthermore the ssc was significantly lower than the sediment carrying capacity during the flood peaks leading to significant erosion of the riverbed during the sediment discharge period the sediments of xiaolangdi reservoir were washed away by the floods of wanjiazhai and sanmenxia reservoirs resulting in hyperpycnal flows wang et al 2017 compared with natural floods the ssc during the sediment discharge period was basically the same as that during the natural flood peaks however xiaolangdi reservoir mainly discharged fine grained sediments with a median grain size below 10 μm bi et al 2014b as the grain size of suspended sediments reduces the sediment carrying capacity of the water significantly increases hu and guo 2004 which in turn leads to a significant decrease in channel deposition flux xu et al 2009 therefore the wsrs greatly changed the water and sediment regimes in the lower reaches of the yellow river in the flood season and thus dominated the erosion in the riverbed in the downstream reaches of the yellow river in the flood season fig 4b 5 2 downstream water consumption the changes in scouring and deposition of the lower reaches of the yellow river is not only related to the water and sediment inflow conditions of the upper reaches but also controlled by changes in water and sediments discharges in the downstream basin which play important roles in both the energy of water flow and the sediment carrying capacity of the river abate et al 2015 hu and guo 2004 the lower reaches of the yellow river are raised above the ground and lack tributaries fig 1 therefore water consumption in the lower reaches dominates changes in downstream volumes since the 1950s a significant increase in water consumption in the lower reaches has been witnessed wang et al 2006 the increase in water consumption along with the decrease in upstream inflow results that drying up with a total of 940 days has been recorded at lijin station since 1972 including 901 days in the 1990s xu 2004a from 1991 to 2012 the change in water consumption in the gaocun lijin reach indicated that the water consumption of the lower reaches of the yellow river decreased after water and sediment regulation of the yellow river prior to the wsrs the water consumption of the gaocun lijin channel reach accounted for about 35 of the gaocun runoff in the flood season however water consumption dropped dramatically to 10 after water and sediment regulation the proportion of water diversion in the dry season decreased from 59 before water and sediment regulation to about 42 afterwards fig 8 a after implementation of the wsrs the disorganized water diversion was effectively controlled peng et al 2010 particularly during the wsrs period all downstream diversion gates were closed resulting in the sharp decrease in water consumption in the dry season the water demand for agricultural production significantly increased due to the lack of rainfall in the lower reaches therefore after the wsrs was implemented the proportion of water diversion decreased in the dry season but it was still higher than that in the flood season in addition the drying up was no longer witnessed in the lower reaches of the yellow river after the wsrs kong et al 2015 the water consumption in the gaocun lijin channel reach had a significant impact on the sediment carrying capacity of the river when the water consumption reached a certain value for example about 30 the ssc at the lijin station decreased significantly with the increase of water consumption fig 8b this implies that after the water consumption along the river decreased to a certain value the sediment carrying capacity of the runoff decreased to less than the ssc resulting in sedimentation in the river channel therefore after wsrs the water diversion of the lower reaches in the flood season effectively ensured the sediment carrying capacity of the river and exacerbated the riverbed erosion in the lower reaches however although the water consumption in the dry season decreased after the wsrs it was still maintained at a high proportion of river volume therefore the water consumption in the lower reaches in the dry season intensified the deposition on the downstream riverbed fig 4 in addition as most water diversion outlets are far away from the river channel the diverted water had a low concentration of sediments and those had a finer grain size consequently the ssc and sediment grain size of the water flow in the channel were relatively increased which further reduced the sediment carrying capacity of the water flow hence mass diversion of water inevitably reduced the sediment carrying capacity of the water flow thereby increasing deposition of the channel hu and guo 2004 5 3 sediment coarsening in the downstream riverbed since the implementation of the wsrs the riverbed downstream from gaocun has undergone significant erosion however the flood season and inter annual erosion showed that after about 2005 the erosion rate in the lower reaches of the yellow river decreased significantly fig 4 previous studies have shown that the decline rate of the riverbed elevation in the lower reaches of the yellow river has also been significantly reduced since 2005 miao et al 2016 whereas the bankfull flow in the lower reaches of the yellow river has increased rapidly since water and sediment regulation began in 2002 but has not changed much since 2005 xia et al 2014a b however the sediment inflow coefficient upstream of the gaocun station on the yellow river continued to decrease fig 9 a from 8 g s m3 in the initial stage of water and sediment regulation to less than 1 g s m3 in 2012 which indicates that the upstream flow sediment combinations were more favorable for erosion of the riverbed than for deposition hence the changes in water and sediment inflow conditions are not the reasons for the reduction in the riverbed erosion rate the downstream riverbed erosion efficiency runoff required for erosion per unit mass of riverbed sediments has increased 2 5 fold between the initiation of the wsrs in 2002 and 2005 from about 0 5 m3 kg to about 1 7 m3 kg fig 9a this shows that the resistance to downstream riverbed erosion has gradually increased since the wsrs was implemented on the yellow river the grain size of riverbed sediments in the lower reaches has changed significantly before the wsrs the grain size of riverbed sediments in the lower reaches tended to decrease along the course from approximately 50 30 μm after the implementation of the wsrs the grain size of riverbed sediments became significantly coarser it was generally greater than 60 μm and could reach up to 80 μm fig 9b the continuous erosion of the downstream riverbed of the yellow river enabled relatively finer sediments in the surface of the riverbed to be eroded and transported downstream making the surface of the riverbed more coarsely grained under such circumstances the surface layer of the riverbed gradually formed an obvious armor layer that protected the underlying sediments miao et al 2016 parker and sutherland 1990 resulting in a significant decrease in the erosion flux in the downstream riverbed of the yellow river since 2005 fig 4 5 4 longitudinal slope and profile of the river channel the longitudinal slope in the lower reaches of the yellow river is steeper upstream than downstream it falls from a maximum of 0 5 in the huayuankou gaocun channel reach to 0 11 in the gaocun aishan channel reach and then to less than 0 09 xia et al 2014b with the significant decrease of the longitudinal slope of the channel both the energy and sediment carrying capacity of the river decrease significantly causing sediments carried by the upstream river as far as gaocun to rapidly precipitate in the gaocun aishan channel reach thus prior to the wsrs the gaocun sunkou channel reach saw the highest levels of deposition flux and intensity fig 5 because of the natural characteristics of selective deposition of rivers paola et al 1992 and the slight change in the longitudinal slope of the rivers from aishan the deposition intensity along the river decreases continuously fig 5b and the riverbed sediments along the river become finer grained fig 9b additionally the shortening of the river channel caused by the shift of the deltaic river channel resulted in an increase in the longitudinal slope as a whole zheng et al 2017 consequently the whole river channel in the lower reaches was under scouring conditions in 1996 fig 4 when the deltaic river channel migrated northward and the river channel shortened by approximately 20 km zheng et al 2017 the channels in the lower reaches of the yellow river are divided into three types braided huayuankou gaocun braided to meandering transitional gaocun aishan and meandering downstream of aishan wu et al 2008 xia et al 2014b the channel in the gaocun aishan river reach is wide and shallow with a width of approximately 500 700 m and a depth of only 2 5 m in contrast the channel from aishan is narrow and deep with a width of only 400 m and a depth of up to 12 m fig 10 after the implementation of the wsrs significant erosion occurred downstream of gaocun the gaocun aishan channel reach was dominated by two dimensional erosion widening and deepening from 2000 to 2012 the cross sectional channel of gaocun was widened by approximately 150 m and was deepened by 3 5 m fig 10a for the lower reaches below aishan the narrow and deep channel together with the artificial bank protection works limited the lateral erosion of the river so the erosion of the river was mainly vertical although the maximum depth of erosion was similar to the profile at gaocun fig 10b the narrowness of the river channel made the erosion intensity of the lower reaches from aishan significantly lower than that of the gaocun aishan channel reach fig 5b 6 effect of channel erosion on the yellow river sediments entering the sea the lijin hydrological station is the last hydrological station before the yellow river empties into the sea fig 1 it was 40 50 km to the river mouth as it was first established in 1934 pang and si 1979 hence its water and sediment fluxes are considered to represent the runoff and sediment discharge from the yellow river into the sea for years the yellow river sediments entering the sea have accumulated continuously and rapidly and the coastline of the river mouth has constantly moved seaward due to these factors the lijin hydrological station is approximately 100 km away from the current river mouth of the yellow river fig 1 this distance accounts for 15 of the total length of the downstream river channel however there is no quantitative study on the effect of scouring and depositional changes in the downstream channel from lijin on the yellow river sediments entering the sea the changes in average annual deposition in the study area from 1991 to 2001 which are ascribed to upstream changes in channel scouring and deposition were about 24 4 106 m3 yr fig 4 which is about 31 8 mt yr with the dry bulk density being 1 3 t m3 of this 30 3 mt yr is associated with the gaocun lijin channel reach and 1 5 mt yr is related to the lower reaches below lijin which accounted for 9 4 and 0 5 respectively of the average annual sediment discharge at the lijin hydrological station during the same period in general channel deposition had little effect on sediment discharge at the lijin station while the lower reaches below lijin could be ignored however it should be noted that in certain years with low sediment discharge such as 1997 2000 and 2001 the channel deposition fluxes below lijin could reach more than 28 of the sediment discharges at the lijin station table 1 after the initiation of the yellow river wsrs 2002 2012 the study area was rapidly scoured the annual scour of the gaocun lijin channel reach was about 9 4 143 2 mt averaging about 57 7 mt yr it accounted for 35 1 of the sediment flux of the lijin hydrological station the average annual scour of the lower reaches below lijin was about 8 0 mt yr with the highest value of 24 8 mt yr accounting for about 5 of the sediment discharge at the lijin station during the same period with the decrease of the sediment flux at the lijin station the percentage of the annual scour increased with its maximum being about 44 4 in 2002 in summary after the wsrs riverbed erosion in the lower reaches of the yellow river has become an important source of sediments entering the sea in the context of the drastic reduction in sediment discharge from the yellow river wang et al 2007 2016 the sediment discharge at the lijin station has remained at a low level in recent years according to the yellow river sediment bulletin the sediment discharge at the lijin station has averaged less than 40 mt yr in 2014 2016 yrcc 2016 2015 therefore the contribution of the reaches lower than lijin to the flux of sediments entering the sea cannot be ignored after the wsrs since the implementation of the wsrs the continuous scouring of river channels in the study area provided about 41 of the coarse grained sediment supply for the yellow river in combination with the erosion of the huayuankou gaocun channel reach this has become the main source of yellow river sediments entering the sea replacing the loess plateau in addition the grain size of sediments entering the sea increased by nearly 50 bi et al 2014a wang et al 2010 the coarse grained sediments entering the sea are key components for delta construction nittrouer and viparelli 2014 the larger quantity of coarse sediments entering the sea has proved to be a rich supply for the formation of the yellow river delta causing a shift in the river mouth and the present delta lobe from landward erosion to seaward accretion since 2002 bi et al 2014a wu et al 2017 as the source and grain size of sediments entering the sea changed variations also occurred in the flux of pollutants and nutrients entering the sea such as particulate heavy metals bi et al 2014b organic pollutants dong et al 2015 particulate organic carbon zhang et al 2013 particulate phosphorus and bio silicon liu 2015 liu et al 2012 in turn this has significantly changed the ecological environment of the river mouth bai et al 2012 liu 2015 however as the riverbed became coarser and formed an armor barrier the scour efficiency decreased continuously fig 9 and the flux of the coarse grained sediments scoured from the river channel gradually declined table 1 this inevitably influenced the evolution of delta erosion the flux of pollutants and nutrients entering the sea and the environment at the river mouth 7 conclusions during the 20 years between 1992 and 2012 the processes of scouring and deposition in the downstream channel of the yellow river the gaocun lijin channel reach have undergone significant changes on an inter annual scale the downstream channel witnessed significant deposition before 2002 with an annual volume of approximately 24 4 106 m3 yr after 2002 rapid erosion occurred at an annual rate of 49 106 m3 yr but the annual erosion rate reduced after 2005 on a seasonal scale the 20 year period generally witnessed erosion in the flood season and deposition in the dry season however this balance changed after the operation of the wsrs the erosion rate in the flood seasons after 2002 was approximately 2 7 times higher than before 2002 whereas the deposition rate in the dry season was only 30 of that before 2002 from a spatial perspective the downstream riverbed experienced net deposition before 2002 and net scouring after 2002 the gaocun aishan transitional channel reach witnessed the maximum depositional and erosional flux and intensity whereas the deposition erosion flux and intensity in the meandering channel reach were lower the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir changed the regimes of water and sediment of the yellow river and was the main factor controlling the changes in the scouring and deposition of the downstream channel xiaolangdi reservoir intercepted the sediment inflow from the middle reaches of the yellow river thereby reducing the sediment flux downstream and increasing runoff at the same time the wsrs implemented through the joint operation of reservoirs separated the flood peak from the sediment peak and was the main reason for a significant increase in erosion in the flood season the downstream channel underwent perennial deposition in the dry season mainly because the water consumption in the dry season was higher than in the flood season due to constant scouring of the downstream riverbed an armor layer of coarse grained sediments developed on the surface of the riverbed its barrier role has led to a significant decrease in the erosion fluxes of the channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river since 2005 the spatial distribution characteristics of erosion and deposition in the downstream channel were mainly controlled by parameters such as the profile and longitudinal slope of the channel since the yellow river water and sediment regulation continuous channel scouring in the study area provided about 41 of coarse grained sediments for the yellow river which were important sources of sediments entering the sea the contribution of the lower reaches from lijin reached up to 5 which can no longer be ignored as it was prior to the wsrs changes in sediment sources and properties had a significant impact on the environment of the river mouth and the erosion efficiency continued to decrease because of the barrier effect of the coarse layer of the riverbed however the present water and sediment regimes make it difficult to scour the coarse layer of the downstream riverbed thus it is necessary to properly adjust the wsrs such as increasing the peak water discharge under inbank flow conditions increasing flood frequency or reducing downstream water consumption to improve erosive capacity of river flow in the future conflict of interest none acknowledgements we appreciate the constructive comments from the reviewers that improved the science and quality of the original

6861,the lower reaches of the yellow river huanghe a typical raised bed river have experienced many huge flood events in chinese history as the main factor controlling the topographic evolution of the channel the water and sediment supply conditions of the yellow river have undergone significant changes since the implementation of the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs in 2002 by the joint operation of large reservoirs hence it is necessary to conduct systematic research and evaluation on how the regulation scheme influences the scouring and deposition of the downstream channel this study used the elevation data of 79 fixed profiles collected between 1992 and 2012 from the channel downstream from gaocun in the yellow river to establish a digital elevation model the elevation model was used to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of channel scouring and deposition in the study area and to determine the main controlling factors the results show that on an inter annual scale the channel scouring and deposition pattern began to change from substantial deposition to rapid erosion after 2002 on a seasonal scale the overall characteristic was erosion in the flood season and deposition in the dry season however the erosion rate in the flood season increased and the deposition rate in the dry season decreased after 2002 from the spatial perspective the downstream riverbed experienced net deposition before 2002 and net scouring after 2002 the wsrs altered the regimes of water and sediment of the river and therefore dominated scouring and deposition in the downstream channel since the implementation of the wsrs continuous channel scouring in the study area provided about 41 of coarse grained sediments for the yellow river and formed an important source of sediments entering the sea however because of the formation of an armor layer of coarse grained sediments on the downstream riverbed surface due to continuous scouring after the implementation of the wsrs the erosion flux of the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river has shown a significant decrease since 2005 this study provides a typical case study for the response of the topographic evolution of rivers to water and sediment changes under the influence of intense human activities keywords lower yellow river huanghe reservoir regulation channel evolution water sediment regime 1 introduction rivers are the main vehicle for transporting terrigenous material to the sea more than 90 of terrigenous substances are transported into the sea by rivers providing abundant sediments organic matter and nutrients for the oceans hedges 1992 turner and millward 2002 in addition river basins are major gathering places for human beings and play an irreplaceable role in agricultural and industrial development as well as urban construction therefore the stability of a river is of great importance for the socio economic development of the river basin changes in channel scouring and deposition are considered to be key indicators of river stability hathaway 1948 which is controlled by changes in river water and sediment regimes gregory et al 2008 phillips 2013 vandenberghe 2002 since the 1950s human activities such as the rapid construction of dams and reservoirs in river basins have significant impacts on water regulation and sediment flux of large global rivers nilsson et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 consequently the topographic evolution of river channels in response to the regulation of reservoirs has been a topic of research interest since then lai et al 2017 petts and gurnell 2005 schumm and galay 1994 williams and wolman 1984 the yellow river was once the second most sediment laden river in the world with an average of 1 08 gt yr of sediments emptying into the sea due to its typical characteristics of low water discharge with high sediment load the yellow river has the highest suspended sediment concentration ssc in the world milliman and meade 1983 the terrain slope in the lower reaches of the yellow river after huayuankou hydrological station is significantly reduced fig 1 a thus when highly sediment laden water enters the lower reaches a significant quantity of coarse grained sediments is deposited on the riverbed as a result the riverbed is 5 8 m higher than the surrounding area and only 3 5 m lower than the levees on both banks wang et al 2017 forming a typical raised bed river chen et al 2012 consequently a large number of huge flood events that have affected the lower reaches of the yellow river throughout chinese history and significantly influenced china s social and economic development wang et al 2014 2007 since the 1950s a combination of climate change and human activities such as construction of large reservoirs soil and water conservation projects and water consumption have dramatically reduced the flux of water and sediments in the yellow river wang et al 2007 2006 more than that drying up even occurred water discharge lower than 1 m3 s in the lower reaches after 1972 with no flow days peaking at 226 days in 1997 at lijin station the last hydrological station before the yellow river empties into the sea xu 2004a resulting in severe degradation of the river channel and rapid elevation of the riverbed in order to reduce deposition in the downstream channel and reservoirs and increase the flood carrying capacity of the downstream channel the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc began to use large reservoirs in the main stream of the yellow river for the water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs in july 2002 the wsrs is carried out mainly by xiaolangdi reservoir in combination with the sanmenxia and wanjiazhai reservoirs fig 1a the sluice gates of the reservoirs are opened around mid june each year to create artificial flood peaks scour downstream channels and transport large amounts of sediment to the sea wang et al 2017 since natural flood peaks have been replaced by artificial flood peaks that are short period events causing significant changes in the regime of water and sediment of the lower yellow river wang et al 2010 it has been more than 10 years since the implementation of the wsrs and on a 10 year scale deposition erosion has probably achieved equilibrium or quasi equilibrium batalla et al 2018 hence it is necessary to systematically and periodically assess the response of the topographic evolution of the river channel in the lower reaches to the wsrs many studies have been carried out on the scouring and deposition of the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river chu 2014 hu and zhang 2010 kong et al 2015 shi 2005 wang et al 2008 studies concluded that the atrophication of the downstream reaches of the river began in the 1970s and was most severe in the 1990s hu and zhang 2010 after xiaolangdi reservoir became operational in 2000 the situation in the lower reaches of the river channel changed from deposition to erosion chu 2014 wang et al 2010 some researchers argued that this change began after the implementation of the wsrs in 2002 bi et al 2014a kong et al 2015 the evolution of erosion in the downstream channel of the yellow river is controlled by downstream flow changes hu and zhang 2010 water and sediment diversion within the basin hu and guo 2004 wang et al 2008 ssc hu and guo 2004 kong et al 2015 flow sediment combination xu 2015 and changes in the grain size of riverbed sediments miao et al 2016 most previous studies on scouring and deposition of the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river were based on the sediment discharge equilibrium e g kong et al 2015 shi 2005 and cross sectional topography chu 2014 wang et al 2008 methods the sediment discharge equilibrium method uses the measured data of water and sediments at hydrological stations data of tributary sediment supply and water diversion between hydrological stations to calculate a material balance however existing survey methods are not usually accurate enough to collect statistics on the bedload discharge in addition data on tributary sediment supply and diversion between hydrological stations are neither complete nor systematic and are sometimes absent the method itself also has a deficiency in terms of error accumulation making its long term calculation results prone to distortion chien and wan 1956 the cross sectional topography method calculates the erosion deposition volume using the areas of the cross sections and the distances between sections pan et al 2015 few parameters are used in this method and when the meandering of the main channel makes the profile and the flow direction non perpendicular errors may occur in the calculated results yuan et al 2015 with the development of computers and remote sensing technology in recent years the grid topographical method has emerged which is a new method for quantitatively calculating channel scouring and deposition a digital elevation model dem for river channels is established based on satellite remote sensing data and field surveys of three dimensional topographic data for use in the calculation e g falkowski et al 2017 legleiter and kyriakidis 2008 merwade et al 2008 2006 schäppi et al 2010 this method can avoid the errors caused by the meandering of the river channel and changes in the profile width thereby improving the accuracy of the calculation results however it has rarely been used for the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river previous research mainly focused on the inter annual changes in channel scouring and deposition and rarely reported seasonal changes furthermore previous research mainly investigated the upper reaches of the yellow river as far as lijin hydrological station and rarely explored the characteristics of scouring and deposition in the reaches more than 100 km lower than lijin the lower reaches of the yellow river downstream of gaocun hydrological station were selected as the study area fig 1 a dem was established based on curved orthogonal grids using cross sectional elevation data and satellite remote sensing data using this model we calculated the inter annual and seasonal scouring and deposition flux of the lower reaches of the yellow river during 1991 2012 and analyzed the spatio temporal changes in channel scouring and deposition in the study area hence we were able to ascertain the evolution mechanism of scouring and deposition of the river channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river furthermore the overall contribution of channel scouring and deposition flux of the yellow river to the flux of sediments entering the sea was estimated 2 study area originating from the tibetan plateau the yellow river is about 5464 km long and empties into the bohai sea fig 1a it is the second longest river in china after the yangtze river changjiang and its basin area is 79 5 104 km2 the lower reaches of the yellow river start from the huayuankou hydrological station and comprise the last 760 km of the river the study area is part of these lower reaches flowing from gaocun station shandong province in the west to the river mouth in the east with a total length of about 534 km and a fall of approximately 60 m the lower reaches of the river exhibit two types of river channels braided to meandering transitional channels gaocun to aishan and meandering channels aishan to the river mouth xia et al 2014b most riverbeds are sandy and silty in the lower reaches of the yellow river the channel is flat and open and experiences extremely high rates of deposition with the riverbed elevation generally being 4 6 m above the level of the floodplains wang et al 2017 due to long term development of levees it is a typical raised bed river because the river is basically controlled by levees at the sides of the river fig 1b these flood control measures are under huge pressure and bursts and course changes occur frequently according to statistics the course of the yellow river has changed on a large scale nine times since 1855 from gaocun there is no obvious tributary flowing into the river channel fig 1a runoff and sediment mainly come from the upper reaches therefore the channel reach from gaocun is an ideal place to study the responses of channel scouring and deposition to water and sediment inflow process more than 3100 reservoirs have been built in the yellow river basin including four massive reservoirs i e longyangxia liujiaxia sanmenxia and xiaolangdi fig 1a with a total storage capacity of more than 68 km3 wang et al 2007 xiaolangdi reservoir has a designed capacity of 12 65 km3 its construction began in 1997 and it was put into use in 2000 currently as the second largest reservoir in the yellow river basin xiaolangdi reservoir controls the supply of water and sediments in the lower reaches of the yellow river as of october 2016 the accumulated volume of sediments in xiaolangdi reservoir was about 3 26 km3 yrcc 2016 which greatly reduced the amount of sediments flowing into the lower reaches of the yellow river and reaching the sea 3 materials and methods 3 1 data source the elevation data of the cross sections of the downstream channel reach from gaocun that were collected by the yrcc from 1991 to 2012 usually from may to june before the flood season and from september to october after the flood season were used for this study there were 79 profiles in the study area with a distance of about 2 13 km between profiles fig 1b for a given profile the main channel was measured using an sdh 13d digital echo sounder with an accuracy of 5 cm 0 4 h 0 4 of the water depth whereas the measurements on the floodplains were conducted by rtk gps or total station with an error less than 5 cm the remote sensing data were from landsat tm etm remote sensing images which are available for free download from the earth resources observation and science eros center http glovis usgs gov with a resolution of 30 m this study selected remote sensing image data of the study area in cloud free or slightly cloudy weather in the flood season from 1991 to 2012 the water and sediment data which included data on the monthly average runoff sediment discharge and annual average grain size of sediment on the river channel in 1999 and 2008 were measured by the yrcc 3 2 calculation method in this study profile data and satellite remote sensing data were combined to establish a dem based on curved orthogonal grids in order to calculate channel scouring and deposition the specific procedure was as follows 1 among landsat remote sensing images bands 4 5 and 1 rgb that were the most sensitive to the land water boundary were selected to synthesize false color pictures arcgis software version 9 3 was used to extract the boundary of the river channel during the period 1991 2012 based on this and the profile area the area for the dem generation was determined 2 considering the meandering nature of the river channel curved orthogonal grids that fitted the boundary of the river channel were selected fig 2 a the grid spacing generally ranged between 30 m and 100 m 3 the inverse distance interpolation method was used to interpolate the measured profile elevation data to the grid control points in order to obtain the dem of the channel fig 2b 4 the volume of the obtained dem was calculated and the changes in the channel scouring and deposition volume in different periods were calculated according to eqs 1 3 based on the scouring and deposition volume and the dry bulk density 1 3 t m3 the erosion and deposition flux were calculated 1 δ v d i v d i v f i 1 2 δ v f i v f i v d i 3 δ v a i v f i v f i 1 where δvd δvf and δva are the scouring and deposition volume in the dry season flood season and inter annual period respectively vd is the volume of river channel in the dry season vf represents the volume in the flood season subscript i represents the year the results of the calculations based on the curved orthogonal grid method and the cross sectional topography method were basically the same fig 3 a and the two methods showed a significant positive correlation in the scouring and deposition volume however the scouring and deposition volume obtained by the curved orthogonal grid method was about 13 higher than that obtained by the cross sectional topography method fig 3b 4 spatio temporal changes of channel scouring and deposition 4 1 temporal changes of channel scouring and deposition on an inter annual scale the main channel in the study area initially experienced deposition followed by erosion fig 4 a the period 1991 2001 witnessed net deposition for the downstream channel from gaocun the total amount of sediment was 244 106 m3 the average deposition rate was 24 106 m3 yr and the annual maximum amount of sediments was 119 106 m3 in 1997 1992 1996 and 1998 witnessed scouring in 1996 in particular the amount of scouring in the downstream channel reach up to 80 106 m3 from 2002 onward the downstream channel began to experience erosion using 1991 as a baseline the total erosion was about 300 106 m3 from 2002 to 2012 the average scouring rate was 49 106 m3 yr and the maximum annual erosion reached up to 129 106 m3 in 2003 however the erosion rate in the study area has decreased since 2005 from the perspective of seasonal changes the scouring and deposition in the study area showed obvious seasonality and periodicity fig 4b from 1991 to 2001 the dry seasons all witnessed deposition with the maximum deposition flux being about 127 106 m3 and the average deposition rate being about 50 106 m3 yr the flood season mainly witnessed scouring with an average annual scouring rate of approximately 23 106 m3 yr however the inter annual variation was larger with the maximum scouring amount being about 152 106 m3 yr some years such as 1994 and 1997 witnessed substantial deposition during the dry season of 2002 2012 the downstream channel of the yellow river still experienced substantial deposition but the deposition rate was significantly reduced the maximum deposition rate was only about 30 106 m3 yr and the average deposition rate was about 14 106 m3 yr which was about 30 of the first stage since 2002 the channel routinely showed scouring during the flood season the average scouring rate was 61 106 m3 yr which was about 2 7 times higher than during the first stage as with the inter annual scouring rate the erosion rate of the downstream channel has slightly decreased since 2005 4 2 spatial distribution of channel scouring and deposition in this study the main hydrological stations in the lower reaches of the yellow river were used as nodes to analyze the spatial distribution of scouring and deposition in the study area the results showed that the amounts of erosion and deposition varied greatly within different channel reaches from 1991 to 2001 the gaocun sunkou channel reach had the largest deposition volume in the study area its average annual deposition amount was approximately 10 106 m3 yr fig 5 a accounting for approximately 42 of the total deposition in the study area the luokou lijin channel reach ranked second with an annual deposition flux of about 6 106 m3 yr the deposition flux in the channel downstream of the lijin station was the smallest at only 1 106 m3 yr and it accounted for about 4 of the total deposition in the study area from 2002 to 2012 the gaocun sunkou channel reach still had the largest erosion volume its annual erosion volume was approximately 16 106 m3 yr accounting for 30 of the total erosion in the study area the luokou lijin channel reach also ranked second in this category with an annual erosion flux of approximately 13 106 m3 yr the erosion flux of the channel downstream from lijin was about 6 106 m3 yr accounting for around 12 of the total erosion in the study area in terms of the erosion and deposition intensity of different channel reaches the erosion and deposition volume per unit length of channel the spatial differences between channel reaches were significant from 1991 to 2001 the deposition intensity decreased downstream in the lower reaches of the river channel fig 5b the deposition intensity was highest in the gaocun sunkou channel reach which was up to 80 m3 m yr it decreased to 35 45 m3 m yr in the sunkou lijin channel reach it dropped to about 13 m3 m yr downstream of lijin which is only about 16 of the intensity of the gaocun sunkou channel reach in 2002 2012 the erosion intensity and deposition intensity varied significantly the maximum erosion intensity still occurred in the gaocun sunkou channel reach which was about 140 m3 m yr however from the sunkou channel reach to the river mouth the erosion intensity did not vary significantly and was stable at around 75 m3 m yr 5 main factors controlling the evolution of river channel river channel evolution is the result of the change in water and sediment regimes gregory et al 2008 phillips 2013 vandenberghe 2002 and their interaction with riverbed and bank sediment supply conditions miao et al 2016 water and sediment are influenced by climate change and human activities e g reservoir construction group et al 2001 milliman et al 2008 vorosmarty 2000 wang et al 2007 2006 as of 2005 at least 45000 dams above 15 m in height have been built on rivers globally nilsson et al 2005 these dams along with other human activities have drastically altered the flow and sediment transport processes of many rivers in the past century or so milliman et al 2008 syvitski 2005 as a result river channel erosion downstream of dams has been widely documented in large rivers such as the colorado river after the hoover dam williams and wolman 1984 the nile river after the aswan dam schumm and galay 1994 and the yangtze river after the three gorges dam lai et al 2017 the riverbed sediment conditions supply and grain size have important effects on riverbed erosion as well falkowski et al 2017 the variation in the grain size of riverbed sediments significantly affects the sediment discharge rate which in turn influences the evolution of the river topography paola and seal 1995 yuill et al 2010 5 1 changes in water and sediment inflow from upstream since the 1950s large reservoirs have been built in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river such as sanmenxia reservoir in 1963 liujiaxia reservoir in 1968 longyangxia reservoir in 1986 and xiaolangdi reservoir in 1999 fig 1a the sediment blocking effect of large reservoirs along with the water and soil conservation project in the loess plateau has led to a sharp decline in sediment discharge since the 1950s wang et al 2007 2016 since its operation in 1999 xiaolangdi reservoir due to its significant sediment blocking effect has experienced a significant reduction in its storage capacity at a rate of 0 3 km3 yr wang et al 2017 which has resulted in a significant decrease in seasonal and inter annual sediment discharge downstream the average annual sediment discharge at the gaocun station decreased from 0 5 gt yr in 1991 2000 to 0 14 gt yr in 2001 2012 a drop of more than 72 fig 6 a the sediment discharge in the flood season was about 0 42 gt yr before the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir and fell sharply by about 74 to 0 11 gt yr after the operation of the xiaolangdi reservoir fig 6b in the dry season the sediment discharge decreased by around 62 5 from 0 08 gt yr to 0 03 gt yr after the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir began this decrease was less than that in the flood season fig 6c furthermore together with sanmenxia and wanjiazhai reservoirs in the middle reaches xiaolangdi reservoir plays a significant role in regulating runoff in the wsrs which has stabilized the downstream water diversion peng et al 2010 consequently the inter annual yellow river runoff rose by approximately 27 from 19 2 km3 yr to 24 4 km3 yr after implementation of the wsrs fig 6a water and sediment regulation mainly refers to creating artificial floods by releasing runoff from wanjiazhai sanmenxia and xiaolangdi reservoirs in the middle of june each year i e the flood season in this study resulting in a significant increase in runoff during the flood season from 11 2 km3 yr to 15 6 km3 yr fig 6b in the dry season the runoff did not change significantly before or after the implementation of the wsrs and was effectively stable at about 8 6 km3 yr fig 6c for the yellow river characterized by high sediment discharge changes in channel scouring and deposition are controlled not only by the upstream runoff q or sediment inflow qs but also by the upstream flow sediment combinations such as the ssc ssc qs q kong et al 2015 xu 2014 and sediment inflow coefficient ssc q fu et al 2010 wu et al 2008 xia et al 2014a xu 2003 the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir especially the wsrs resulted in a sharp decrease in sediment discharge and an increase in runoff upstream from gaocun since then the flow sediment combinations of the yellow river especially the sediment inflow coefficient have changed fig 6d before the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir the sediment inflow coefficient was greater than 20 g s m6 and could reach 130 g s m6 after the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir the sediment inflow coefficient dropped and could be as low as 2 g s m6 this shows that under the condition of constant runoff the sediment inflow concentration in the upper reaches of the yellow river as far as gaocun reduced significantly with a constant sediment carrying capacity of the runoff the yellow river eroded the riverbed to obtain a supply of sediment thereby achieving equilibrium between its sediment carrying capacity and the ssc xu 2004b as a result erosion has occurred in the riverbed of the yellow river downstream of the reservoirs since the implementation of the wsrs fig 4a the flood process including the flood intensity and frequency is an important factor influencing the topographic evolution of the river channel batalla et al 2018 williams 1978 xia et al 2014a xu 2015 owing to the high sediment carrying capacity and high ssc of floodwater the topography of the river has changed significantly abate et al 2015 krapesch et al 2011 wang and xu 2016 flood control by dams led to a significant reduction in flood intensity and frequency magilligan et al 2003 resulting in substantial deposition on the riverbed brandt 2000 petts and pratts 1983 for the lower reaches of the yellow river there was no significant change in flood intensity before and after the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir fig 7 whereas the frequency of flood peaks was significantly reduced flooding typically only occurred during water and sediment regulation therefore the flood intensity and frequency were not factors influencing channel erosion after 2002 the yellow river typically has a high ssc natural floods were mainly caused by heavy rainfall in the basin particularly in the loess plateau in the middle reaches of the river surface runoff caused by rainfall eroded the surface of the basin resulting in the synchronization of sediment peaks and flood peaks fig 7a highly sediment laden flows significantly reduced the erosion efficiency of floods which was also a major factor influencing the substantial deposition in the lower reaches of the yellow river xu 2014 after the wsrs was implemented the water and sediment regimes in the lower reaches of the yellow river were altered through joint regulation of xiaolangdi wanjiazhai and sanmenxia reservoirs wang et al 2017 in the early stage of the wsrs artificial flood peaks were created mainly by discharging clean water from xiaolangdi reservoir the peak flood flow rate was generally up to 4000 m3 s and could last about two weeks fig 7b furthermore the ssc was significantly lower than the sediment carrying capacity during the flood peaks leading to significant erosion of the riverbed during the sediment discharge period the sediments of xiaolangdi reservoir were washed away by the floods of wanjiazhai and sanmenxia reservoirs resulting in hyperpycnal flows wang et al 2017 compared with natural floods the ssc during the sediment discharge period was basically the same as that during the natural flood peaks however xiaolangdi reservoir mainly discharged fine grained sediments with a median grain size below 10 μm bi et al 2014b as the grain size of suspended sediments reduces the sediment carrying capacity of the water significantly increases hu and guo 2004 which in turn leads to a significant decrease in channel deposition flux xu et al 2009 therefore the wsrs greatly changed the water and sediment regimes in the lower reaches of the yellow river in the flood season and thus dominated the erosion in the riverbed in the downstream reaches of the yellow river in the flood season fig 4b 5 2 downstream water consumption the changes in scouring and deposition of the lower reaches of the yellow river is not only related to the water and sediment inflow conditions of the upper reaches but also controlled by changes in water and sediments discharges in the downstream basin which play important roles in both the energy of water flow and the sediment carrying capacity of the river abate et al 2015 hu and guo 2004 the lower reaches of the yellow river are raised above the ground and lack tributaries fig 1 therefore water consumption in the lower reaches dominates changes in downstream volumes since the 1950s a significant increase in water consumption in the lower reaches has been witnessed wang et al 2006 the increase in water consumption along with the decrease in upstream inflow results that drying up with a total of 940 days has been recorded at lijin station since 1972 including 901 days in the 1990s xu 2004a from 1991 to 2012 the change in water consumption in the gaocun lijin reach indicated that the water consumption of the lower reaches of the yellow river decreased after water and sediment regulation of the yellow river prior to the wsrs the water consumption of the gaocun lijin channel reach accounted for about 35 of the gaocun runoff in the flood season however water consumption dropped dramatically to 10 after water and sediment regulation the proportion of water diversion in the dry season decreased from 59 before water and sediment regulation to about 42 afterwards fig 8 a after implementation of the wsrs the disorganized water diversion was effectively controlled peng et al 2010 particularly during the wsrs period all downstream diversion gates were closed resulting in the sharp decrease in water consumption in the dry season the water demand for agricultural production significantly increased due to the lack of rainfall in the lower reaches therefore after the wsrs was implemented the proportion of water diversion decreased in the dry season but it was still higher than that in the flood season in addition the drying up was no longer witnessed in the lower reaches of the yellow river after the wsrs kong et al 2015 the water consumption in the gaocun lijin channel reach had a significant impact on the sediment carrying capacity of the river when the water consumption reached a certain value for example about 30 the ssc at the lijin station decreased significantly with the increase of water consumption fig 8b this implies that after the water consumption along the river decreased to a certain value the sediment carrying capacity of the runoff decreased to less than the ssc resulting in sedimentation in the river channel therefore after wsrs the water diversion of the lower reaches in the flood season effectively ensured the sediment carrying capacity of the river and exacerbated the riverbed erosion in the lower reaches however although the water consumption in the dry season decreased after the wsrs it was still maintained at a high proportion of river volume therefore the water consumption in the lower reaches in the dry season intensified the deposition on the downstream riverbed fig 4 in addition as most water diversion outlets are far away from the river channel the diverted water had a low concentration of sediments and those had a finer grain size consequently the ssc and sediment grain size of the water flow in the channel were relatively increased which further reduced the sediment carrying capacity of the water flow hence mass diversion of water inevitably reduced the sediment carrying capacity of the water flow thereby increasing deposition of the channel hu and guo 2004 5 3 sediment coarsening in the downstream riverbed since the implementation of the wsrs the riverbed downstream from gaocun has undergone significant erosion however the flood season and inter annual erosion showed that after about 2005 the erosion rate in the lower reaches of the yellow river decreased significantly fig 4 previous studies have shown that the decline rate of the riverbed elevation in the lower reaches of the yellow river has also been significantly reduced since 2005 miao et al 2016 whereas the bankfull flow in the lower reaches of the yellow river has increased rapidly since water and sediment regulation began in 2002 but has not changed much since 2005 xia et al 2014a b however the sediment inflow coefficient upstream of the gaocun station on the yellow river continued to decrease fig 9 a from 8 g s m3 in the initial stage of water and sediment regulation to less than 1 g s m3 in 2012 which indicates that the upstream flow sediment combinations were more favorable for erosion of the riverbed than for deposition hence the changes in water and sediment inflow conditions are not the reasons for the reduction in the riverbed erosion rate the downstream riverbed erosion efficiency runoff required for erosion per unit mass of riverbed sediments has increased 2 5 fold between the initiation of the wsrs in 2002 and 2005 from about 0 5 m3 kg to about 1 7 m3 kg fig 9a this shows that the resistance to downstream riverbed erosion has gradually increased since the wsrs was implemented on the yellow river the grain size of riverbed sediments in the lower reaches has changed significantly before the wsrs the grain size of riverbed sediments in the lower reaches tended to decrease along the course from approximately 50 30 μm after the implementation of the wsrs the grain size of riverbed sediments became significantly coarser it was generally greater than 60 μm and could reach up to 80 μm fig 9b the continuous erosion of the downstream riverbed of the yellow river enabled relatively finer sediments in the surface of the riverbed to be eroded and transported downstream making the surface of the riverbed more coarsely grained under such circumstances the surface layer of the riverbed gradually formed an obvious armor layer that protected the underlying sediments miao et al 2016 parker and sutherland 1990 resulting in a significant decrease in the erosion flux in the downstream riverbed of the yellow river since 2005 fig 4 5 4 longitudinal slope and profile of the river channel the longitudinal slope in the lower reaches of the yellow river is steeper upstream than downstream it falls from a maximum of 0 5 in the huayuankou gaocun channel reach to 0 11 in the gaocun aishan channel reach and then to less than 0 09 xia et al 2014b with the significant decrease of the longitudinal slope of the channel both the energy and sediment carrying capacity of the river decrease significantly causing sediments carried by the upstream river as far as gaocun to rapidly precipitate in the gaocun aishan channel reach thus prior to the wsrs the gaocun sunkou channel reach saw the highest levels of deposition flux and intensity fig 5 because of the natural characteristics of selective deposition of rivers paola et al 1992 and the slight change in the longitudinal slope of the rivers from aishan the deposition intensity along the river decreases continuously fig 5b and the riverbed sediments along the river become finer grained fig 9b additionally the shortening of the river channel caused by the shift of the deltaic river channel resulted in an increase in the longitudinal slope as a whole zheng et al 2017 consequently the whole river channel in the lower reaches was under scouring conditions in 1996 fig 4 when the deltaic river channel migrated northward and the river channel shortened by approximately 20 km zheng et al 2017 the channels in the lower reaches of the yellow river are divided into three types braided huayuankou gaocun braided to meandering transitional gaocun aishan and meandering downstream of aishan wu et al 2008 xia et al 2014b the channel in the gaocun aishan river reach is wide and shallow with a width of approximately 500 700 m and a depth of only 2 5 m in contrast the channel from aishan is narrow and deep with a width of only 400 m and a depth of up to 12 m fig 10 after the implementation of the wsrs significant erosion occurred downstream of gaocun the gaocun aishan channel reach was dominated by two dimensional erosion widening and deepening from 2000 to 2012 the cross sectional channel of gaocun was widened by approximately 150 m and was deepened by 3 5 m fig 10a for the lower reaches below aishan the narrow and deep channel together with the artificial bank protection works limited the lateral erosion of the river so the erosion of the river was mainly vertical although the maximum depth of erosion was similar to the profile at gaocun fig 10b the narrowness of the river channel made the erosion intensity of the lower reaches from aishan significantly lower than that of the gaocun aishan channel reach fig 5b 6 effect of channel erosion on the yellow river sediments entering the sea the lijin hydrological station is the last hydrological station before the yellow river empties into the sea fig 1 it was 40 50 km to the river mouth as it was first established in 1934 pang and si 1979 hence its water and sediment fluxes are considered to represent the runoff and sediment discharge from the yellow river into the sea for years the yellow river sediments entering the sea have accumulated continuously and rapidly and the coastline of the river mouth has constantly moved seaward due to these factors the lijin hydrological station is approximately 100 km away from the current river mouth of the yellow river fig 1 this distance accounts for 15 of the total length of the downstream river channel however there is no quantitative study on the effect of scouring and depositional changes in the downstream channel from lijin on the yellow river sediments entering the sea the changes in average annual deposition in the study area from 1991 to 2001 which are ascribed to upstream changes in channel scouring and deposition were about 24 4 106 m3 yr fig 4 which is about 31 8 mt yr with the dry bulk density being 1 3 t m3 of this 30 3 mt yr is associated with the gaocun lijin channel reach and 1 5 mt yr is related to the lower reaches below lijin which accounted for 9 4 and 0 5 respectively of the average annual sediment discharge at the lijin hydrological station during the same period in general channel deposition had little effect on sediment discharge at the lijin station while the lower reaches below lijin could be ignored however it should be noted that in certain years with low sediment discharge such as 1997 2000 and 2001 the channel deposition fluxes below lijin could reach more than 28 of the sediment discharges at the lijin station table 1 after the initiation of the yellow river wsrs 2002 2012 the study area was rapidly scoured the annual scour of the gaocun lijin channel reach was about 9 4 143 2 mt averaging about 57 7 mt yr it accounted for 35 1 of the sediment flux of the lijin hydrological station the average annual scour of the lower reaches below lijin was about 8 0 mt yr with the highest value of 24 8 mt yr accounting for about 5 of the sediment discharge at the lijin station during the same period with the decrease of the sediment flux at the lijin station the percentage of the annual scour increased with its maximum being about 44 4 in 2002 in summary after the wsrs riverbed erosion in the lower reaches of the yellow river has become an important source of sediments entering the sea in the context of the drastic reduction in sediment discharge from the yellow river wang et al 2007 2016 the sediment discharge at the lijin station has remained at a low level in recent years according to the yellow river sediment bulletin the sediment discharge at the lijin station has averaged less than 40 mt yr in 2014 2016 yrcc 2016 2015 therefore the contribution of the reaches lower than lijin to the flux of sediments entering the sea cannot be ignored after the wsrs since the implementation of the wsrs the continuous scouring of river channels in the study area provided about 41 of the coarse grained sediment supply for the yellow river in combination with the erosion of the huayuankou gaocun channel reach this has become the main source of yellow river sediments entering the sea replacing the loess plateau in addition the grain size of sediments entering the sea increased by nearly 50 bi et al 2014a wang et al 2010 the coarse grained sediments entering the sea are key components for delta construction nittrouer and viparelli 2014 the larger quantity of coarse sediments entering the sea has proved to be a rich supply for the formation of the yellow river delta causing a shift in the river mouth and the present delta lobe from landward erosion to seaward accretion since 2002 bi et al 2014a wu et al 2017 as the source and grain size of sediments entering the sea changed variations also occurred in the flux of pollutants and nutrients entering the sea such as particulate heavy metals bi et al 2014b organic pollutants dong et al 2015 particulate organic carbon zhang et al 2013 particulate phosphorus and bio silicon liu 2015 liu et al 2012 in turn this has significantly changed the ecological environment of the river mouth bai et al 2012 liu 2015 however as the riverbed became coarser and formed an armor barrier the scour efficiency decreased continuously fig 9 and the flux of the coarse grained sediments scoured from the river channel gradually declined table 1 this inevitably influenced the evolution of delta erosion the flux of pollutants and nutrients entering the sea and the environment at the river mouth 7 conclusions during the 20 years between 1992 and 2012 the processes of scouring and deposition in the downstream channel of the yellow river the gaocun lijin channel reach have undergone significant changes on an inter annual scale the downstream channel witnessed significant deposition before 2002 with an annual volume of approximately 24 4 106 m3 yr after 2002 rapid erosion occurred at an annual rate of 49 106 m3 yr but the annual erosion rate reduced after 2005 on a seasonal scale the 20 year period generally witnessed erosion in the flood season and deposition in the dry season however this balance changed after the operation of the wsrs the erosion rate in the flood seasons after 2002 was approximately 2 7 times higher than before 2002 whereas the deposition rate in the dry season was only 30 of that before 2002 from a spatial perspective the downstream riverbed experienced net deposition before 2002 and net scouring after 2002 the gaocun aishan transitional channel reach witnessed the maximum depositional and erosional flux and intensity whereas the deposition erosion flux and intensity in the meandering channel reach were lower the operation of xiaolangdi reservoir changed the regimes of water and sediment of the yellow river and was the main factor controlling the changes in the scouring and deposition of the downstream channel xiaolangdi reservoir intercepted the sediment inflow from the middle reaches of the yellow river thereby reducing the sediment flux downstream and increasing runoff at the same time the wsrs implemented through the joint operation of reservoirs separated the flood peak from the sediment peak and was the main reason for a significant increase in erosion in the flood season the downstream channel underwent perennial deposition in the dry season mainly because the water consumption in the dry season was higher than in the flood season due to constant scouring of the downstream riverbed an armor layer of coarse grained sediments developed on the surface of the riverbed its barrier role has led to a significant decrease in the erosion fluxes of the channel in the lower reaches of the yellow river since 2005 the spatial distribution characteristics of erosion and deposition in the downstream channel were mainly controlled by parameters such as the profile and longitudinal slope of the channel since the yellow river water and sediment regulation continuous channel scouring in the study area provided about 41 of coarse grained sediments for the yellow river which were important sources of sediments entering the sea the contribution of the lower reaches from lijin reached up to 5 which can no longer be ignored as it was prior to the wsrs changes in sediment sources and properties had a significant impact on the environment of the river mouth and the erosion efficiency continued to decrease because of the barrier effect of the coarse layer of the riverbed however the present water and sediment regimes make it difficult to scour the coarse layer of the downstream riverbed thus it is necessary to properly adjust the wsrs such as increasing the peak water discharge under inbank flow conditions increasing flood frequency or reducing downstream water consumption to improve erosive capacity of river flow in the future conflict of interest none acknowledgements we appreciate the constructive comments from the reviewers that improved the science and quality of the original

6862,the study explores the shifts in water management paradigms in the caspian sea basin over the last three centuries with an emphasis on the period after 1990 the investigation is based on the chronological analysis of developments in the water sector treaties and agreements between the littoral states important technical inventions and changes in political regimes the methodology used in the paper captures two concepts the concept of water management paradigms helps to comprehend developmental stages of water management of the caspian sea the concept of hydrosocial cycle was applied as an analytical lens for studying each paradigm we examine different understandings of water in the following five stages i pre industrial era before 1846 ii industrialization era 1846 1917 iii soviet collectivization era 1917 1940 iv hydraulic mission 1940 1990 v independent littoral states 1990 present before the industrial revolution the caspian sea was managed by the russian empire and persia for navigation and fishing only the ensuing technical progress gave an impulse to regional sectoral activities pushing forward the hydraulic mission that caused a considerable degradation of the sea s ecosystems the adoption of the tehran convention in 2003 became a first step towards the integrated water resources management iwrm paradigm for the caspian however the water governance of the caspian states does not adhere to the principles of iwrm and consequently environment continues to deteriorate the study provides new directions and approaches for reviewing the role of society in the governance of the caspian sea and its resources keywords industrial modernity reflexive modernity environmental degradation legal status the caspian sea list of acronyms ussr union of soviet

unclos united nations convention on the law of the sea mml modified median line 1 introduction the caspian sea with its abundant resources plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region and the littoral states 1 the reason we used the term littoral instead of riparian is that in general littoral states are countries on the shore of a sea ocean bay or lake and riparian are those on a river or water stream in this study the current littoral states of the caspian sea are kazakhstan russia azerbaijan turkmenistan and iran 1 azerbaijan iran kazakhstan russia and turkmenistan the countries sharing the sea are faced with difficulties in building effective regional cooperation due to different positions on the legal status of the sea before the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 the entire caspian sea was under the formal jurisdiction of only two states the ussr and iran after the collapse of the soviet union the increased number of littoral states led to a problem of transboundary cooperation on issues related to the caspian sea and its natural resources attempts made by azerbaijan russia kazakhstan turkmenistan and iran to secure their own water rights and interests created not only a number of political constraints but also produced legal problems for economic activities makili aliyev 2014 the caspian sea has become an object of serious dispute in the region and continues to be a highly potential area for conflict due to unresolved controversies over the seabed boundary delimitation in addition the unstable economic situation of the coastal states and their political regimes further exacerbate issues related to the management of the transboundary body of water the caspian sea located in the middle of the eurasian continent is a unique landlocked water mass that contains exclusive fisheries and enormous oil and gas resources however the sea s ecosystem has been degraded due to intensive anthropogenic activities barannik et al 2004 mark out the oil industry agriculture fisheries transportation and hydropower generation as the sectors for which the caspian water resources are most important all of these activities contribute directly or indirectly to pollution biodiversity degradation and changes in the sea s water level detecting the root of these challenges requires a comprehensive analysis of the past and current water management practices in the caspian sea region an investigation of the social and political conditions in the region can help unveil a set of key issues causing international disputes and threatening economic development and environmental sustainability in the caspian sea area changes in water management are tightly bound with mankind s relationship to nature and water loftus 2009 the aim of this study is to investigate shifts in understanding related to the role and value of the caspian sea in order to reveal the reasons for changes and uncover challenges in solving current problems the authors explore existing transboundary agreements made between the littoral states concerning the caspian sea as well as the regulation of main sector activities technical progress changes in political regimes and environmental conditions to reveal the attitude of society towards the caspian ecosystem while a considerable body of research has described only historical changes the present work is the first attempt to look constructively at the development of the water management of the caspian sea with the set of analytical tools one of them is the framework of water management paradigms that assumes different approaches to the water and resources being managed the aims of management and the ways to achieve the aims pahl wostl et al 2011 in this study we define five paradigms for the water and resources management of the caspian sea that are paradigms of i pre industrial era before 1846 ii industrialization era 1846 1917 iii soviet collectivization era 1917 1940 iv hydraulic mission 1940 1990 and v independent littoral states time 1990 present another tool we apply in this study is the concept of hydrosocial cycle which plays a key role in the relationship between water and society in the caspian sea region the hydrosocial cycle concept will be applied for five periods of caspian sea development the results section introduces an analysis of the agreements on the caspian sea between the littoral states a history of water management in the region and the impact of human activities on the environmental situation finally the discussion and conclusion outline the changes of all five water paradigms in the caspian region and look at the extent to which the current paradigm is reflexive 2 the current state of the environment in the caspian sea region the caspian sea nowadays endures critical environmental degradation including biodiversity loss water quality deterioration soil contamination and poor public health weak environmental regulation and the absence of joint efforts in the five littoral states reduce the effectiveness of efforts to protect the caspian environment the newly independent countries kazakhstan turkmenistan and azerbaijan have been intensively developing their oil and gas industries and trying to attract more investment to these sectors fig 1 shows the rate of oil production in the caspian region for the period 1992 2014 it is clear that kazakhstan and azerbaijan have significant shares of the total oil production fig 1 the absence of iran in the figure is due to inessential production in the caspian region the caspian sea is dramatically exposed to the threat of pollution from oil and gas extraction transportation refining storage use of petroleum products and accidental oil spills over two million years old the caspian sea has a unique ecosystem with more than 400 endemic species including 115 types of fish currently such abundant biodiversity is suffering from water contamination and habitat demolition adb 2009 for instance the caspian seal was listed in the international union for conservation of nature s list of threatened and endangered species iucn 2017 thousands of seals have died due to a weakened immune system caused by the contaminated water the number of caspian seals has declined dramatically since 1950 fig 2 the drop in seal population was generally caused by severe hunting reduced biological capacity of the sea commercial fishing and water pollution the caspian environment programme cep 2011 in its analysis of the caspian sea reveals that the number of sturgeon caught in iran and the former ussr republics declined over the years between 1929 and 1998 fig 3 the ups and downs of the sturgeon production can be explained by the unstable political situation in the region the rehabilitation of industry after the second world war resulted in a progressive increase in yearly catch that peaked at about 28 900 tonnes in 1977 after the collapse of the soviet union the lack of environmental regulations in the newly independent states led to large scale organized poaching and became a main reason for the sharp decline in sturgeon catch today some species became endangered by increasing oil extraction followed by pollution the invasion of alien species the loss of habitats and poaching providing a legal mechanism for water and resource management as well as the protection of the natural environment and creating a common regulating institutional body are essential for eradicating environmental problems in the area zonn 2000 3 conceptual framework 3 1 hydrosocial cycle substantial literature has considered the hydrologic cycle as a physical process from various approaches that have been changing over time duffy 2017 however some scholars criticize the hydrologic cycle for ignoring the social dimensions linton 2010 hydrologic cycle demonstrates the physical states and conditions of water referring to this process as asocial and apolitical the concept of hydrosocial cycle has contrasted to hydrologic cycle as more holistic process that captures biophysical and socio political dimensions budds et al 2014 social progress and institutional change have increasingly influenced hydrologic processes water as politically contended resource has been closely studied by mollinga 2001 who claims that water management institutes and water policies are the results of political actions although the concept of the hydrosocial cycle appeared much earlier it has been intensively discussed by a number of scientists during the last decades many have tried to explain the development of water management in terms of hydrosocial cycles which reflect the impact of society on water resources abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2013 linton 2010 2008 swyngedouw 2009 in simple terms this concept demonstrates how social power and political and economic factors interrelate with water are changed by water and transform water palomino schalscha et al 2016 keil and young 2001 define the hydrosocial cycle as the sum of the human and physical interrelationships pertaining to water in cities stressing that societies govern water as part of social political cultural and economic systems according to turton et al 2001 the hydrosocial cycle operates with reference to social contract theories as such there is a hydrosocial nexus working at the intersection of water management social and legal norms the state and the environment this means that water is embedded in the social arena by social norms water resources and the rights of individuals as well as the social fabric of the societies developing water relations from the perspective of political ecology the hydrosocial cycle contributes to understanding how nature and society interact with each other on different levels and determines the conditions for change in water management practices cook and swyngedouw 2012 adopted from linton and budds 2014 the diagram fig 4 of the hydrosocial cycle demonstrates the process of interrelation between water and society through space and time the material water intervenes with the social structure which manipulates the quantity and quality of the water flow by using technological achievements and the manipulations in turn influences the material water transformation in one of the components leads to changes in the others the hydrosocial cycle can be associated with socio hydrology the nascent interdisciplinary science proposed by sivapalan et al 2012 that focus on observing understanding and forecasting of co evolution of coupled human water systems however the difference is that hydrosocial cycle is analytical tool serving for identification the composition of historical hydrological political and technological conditions of water linton and budds 2014 one could see hydrosocial cycle as a part of the mosaic of socio hydrology a science the boundaries of which seem to stretch far beyond analytical tools and incorporate complex socio hydrological models montanari et al 2013 2014 3 2 water management paradigms in 1990 s several scholars emphasized the need for reassessment of management practices in public land and water resources in other words a paradigm shift behan 1990 kessler et al 1992 they argued that traditional paradigm associated with sustained supply of water for economic needs is being invalidated and should be replaced by new paradigms based on sustainable ecosystem management and processes of collective decision making cortner and moote 1994 kuhn 1970 uses the term paradigm implying the way of thinking theories and values commonly accepted by certain communities by kuhn s terminology the water management paradigm refers to the mindset of how water management should be implemented by the actors of a certain community technical infrastructure legal rules social norms and engineering practices represent the global view on water and the ways in which water management targets can be reached in the 1930s the state hydraulic paradigm or hydraulic mission era reflected the development of water supplies by state agencies that viewed water simply as a resource for the construction of mega water projects such as dams irrigation canals hydroelectric stations and large scale reservoirs water management based on this paradigm consisted of the exploitation of water without taking into consideration the complex relationship between water and human society bakker 2003 from this point of view the hydrologic cycle only represented the technical dimension of water depriving it of a social and ecological context it was a period of anthropocentricity whereby nature was considered a neutral resource that could be exploited limitlessly and controlled by humankind with the help of technology beck et al 2003 as a result water and water related resources were used to produce other commodities consideration of water as solely economic good was convenient for the modern state at the time and was a key component of the state hydraulic paradigm molle mollinga and wester 2009 the general decline of the state hydraulic paradigm over the last three decades can be explained by a number of factors including an increasing awareness of ecological social and sustainable water management diminishing supplies of unexploited water and a shift in attention from water supply to water demand management allan 2005 in the late 1970s american society began to grow concerned about environmental problems that started to seriously restrict social progress in 1976 the american sociological association established a new section on environmental sociology which tried to explain societal changes not from an anthropocentric perspective but from a non anthropocentric paradigm the main idea of the new flow was to understand that human societies are part of ecosystems and those interactions between the environment and people are a natural process catton and dunlap 1978 announced the arrival of the new environmental paradigm nep which took the place of the human exceptionalism paradigm a paradigm that had ignored the dependence of society on the environment the nep consisted of several assumptions that emphasized the role of humans as a part of the ecosystem and the finiteness of natural resources the nep introduced a new dimension for researchers from different scientific fields an increasing number of decommissioned dams in the united states and western europe demonstrate the historic shift in managing water towards the concept of the hydrosocial cycle allan 2005 represents changes in global water management in a schematic form where the hydraulic mission is one of the water management paradigms that changed after the 1970s especially in the developed countries and remained the same in developing countries referred to as north and south in fig 5 upon the whole he distinguishes five particular water management paradigms the first paradigm of water management pertains to the pre modern community that is defined as the period before industrialization and the development of technology the second paradigm of industrial modernity can be characterized by modern engineering the appearance of state centric management and the hydraulic mission it was an era of the continuous supply of water to meet the demand created by industrial and agricultural development the upward trend of water use represents the hydraulic mission of water or the process of taking more and more water out of the environment to produce food in the agricultural sector in the 1970s the main ideas of industrial modernity began to be questioned and the era of reflexive modernity characterized by the modernization of modernity beck et al 1994 and the modifying of social institutions due to social change giddens 1987 came with a new wave of environmentalism the hydrosocial cycle concept corresponds with allan s period of reflexive modernity furthermore it can be considered as part of the reflexive modernity period in water management which reflects the impact of water on socio economic and political interactions among stakeholders the era of reflexive modernity incorporating three water management paradigms arose in the north the third paradigm refers to the shift from the hydraulic mission to environmental awareness raised by the green social movement and returning water back into the environment such international organizations as united nations the world bank the world water council and the global water partnership also tried to raise this idea in the southern countries however the trend in water use remained the same and even more water was used in order to increase food and energy production and meet the food demand the different trajectories in the upper part of fig 5 represent freshwater use in the arid and semi arid north and the semi arid south since 1980 changes in water management continued throughout the period of the fourth paradigm demonstrating the significance and the new role of water as a limited economic resource the final paradigm was built on the concept of iwrm that states that water management is a political process this paradigm emphasizes the importance of the participation of all stakeholders civil society government and non government organizations in policy making issues the purpose of applying the concept of water management paradigms to the caspian sea s governance is to figure out the environmental and social changes that can help to understand approach to the sea in the region 4 the hydrosocial cycle of the caspian sea and water management paradigms for the hydrosocial analysis of water management in the caspian sea region we considered the changes in social technical and environmental indicators that represent the three parts of the hydrosocial cycle the first part is a social one that encompasses political and economic aspects such as changes in sector activities political systems and regulations in this study political aspect refers to the disputes on legal status of the sea and international agreements between the littoral states that demonstrate transboundary management at the regional level reviewing interstate agreements and protocols allows to trace evolution of the attitudes of the littoral states towards the sea and its ecosystem while the old treaties can be found in documents of foreign policy of the ussr dpr sssr and on the website of the ministry of foreign affairs of the republic of azerbaijan faolex provides the majority of legal documents on the caspian sea agreements on transboundary water objects reflect cooperation between countries on the common use of water and related resources and establish the rules of transboundary water management it has been almost three centuries since the littoral states began to sign agreements with each other thus we can investigate how the caspian sea has been managed legally in addition institutional changes in the littoral states have significant influence on economic activities which in turn may cause environmental degradation the economic aspect includes human activities that contribute to the economies of the littoral states in the caspian sea the most significant human activities are the oil and gas industries and fisheries the second dimension is the technical part of hydrosocial cycle which determines the scale of human activities and their contribution to the economy through the analysis of outstanding technological inventions we can investigate how society used technical tools to shape water management according to scott 1998 ecological and social transformations are driven by hydraulic engineers for example investigating a case of canal irrigation in south india mollinga 2014 finds that technical infrastructure facilitates water flow and makes it possible to rearrange the hydrological cycle in time and space using reservoirs and hierarchically ordered canals large scale structural interventions were made possible through modern water science and engineering technologies molle 2006 therefore a particular focus needs to be placed on the effect of technological developments in the major economic sectors in the caspian sea region finally the environmental dimension considers the conditions of water quality and water level caspian bio resources and the coastal environment to show the environmental changes we use biological indicators from fao fishery statistics and the cep data on the sea level was obtained from kostianoy et al 2010 exploring the above dimensions in the caspian water management through time we defined the following sequence of paradigms presented in fig 6 each paradigm is scrutinized in the next section in chronological order and provides details on the most important political technical and environmental changes we begin to discern paradigms and trace changes with first interstate treaties between littoral states because content of official documents best demonstrates the main governance aspects of the sea 5 water paradigms in the caspian sea region 5 1 paradigm 1 pre modern water management the first paradigm of pre modern water management involves strong connections between traditional technical practices the main governance regime and water use 5 1 1 socioeconomic changes the period of limited technical capacity before 1846 can be considered as an era of two states russian empire and persia fig 7 focused on issues of navigation and fishing russia became a caspian actor following the conquest of the astrakhan khanate in the 16th century agreements signed by the russian and persian empires table 1 were based on the coastal approach that considered the caspian sea as a mare nullius private sea managed by the two states for small scale fishing and commercial navigation in fact the sea was almost completely under the russian control the first ratified agreement the treaty of resht consolidated the liberty of trade and navigation for the russian empire which was eager to conquer persian territories later the golestan and the turkmenchay treaties granted equal navigation and commercial fleet rights to the littoral states but only russia could have a military fleet this exclusive right strengthened the dominating position of russia in the caspian sea frappi and garibov 2014 under these two treaties azerbaijan was divided into south persian and north russian azerbaijan as can be seen from treaties the interrelation between the russian and persian empires was purely built on defining their territories 5 1 2 environmental changes although we could not find any records regarding the environmental situation of the caspian it can be assumed that environmental pollution was not a problem in that period fisheries and commercial navigation were organized according to traditional techniques due to the absence of a high degree of economic activities the ecosystems as well as biodiversity were in good condition the pre industrial society was not able to construct massive infrastructure saparov 2015 that could adversely affect water quality and biodiversity the sea level only began to be measured instrumentally in 1837 at baku and averaged a level of around 25 5 m fig 8 above the baltic sea datum bsd kostianoy et al 2010 5 2 paradigm 2 the beginning of industrialization 5 2 1 socioeconomic and technical changes the appearance of new technological inventions after the industrial revolution dramatically changed practices in all sectoral activities and fossil fuels became an important energy source the modern day oil industry began to form in 1846 in bibi aybat borough near baku it was the first mechanically drilled oil well in the world and represented an important technical innovation the mechanical production of oil attracted a number of foreign investors to the region that led to the growth of the regional population and fish demand established in baku in 1873 the nobel brothers oil extracting partnership developed a number of inventions beneficial to oil production the most substantial invention was oil tankers in the caspian sea karagiannis 2002 after construction of the first azerbaijan railways in 1880 connecting baku to its outlying oilfields the nobel brothers introduced railway tanks for oil transportation that enormously improved the turnover of oil and reduced transportation costs barnes and briggs 2003 despite the appearance of many small petrochemical companies around baku control over the oil industry in the caspian was concentrated in the hands of the nobel brothers fig 9 5 2 2 environmental changes the tremendous development of the oil industry in the caspian sea resulted in the extraction of 10 7 million tons annually in the early 1890s nearly half of the world s oil production with the increased transportation of oil in bunkers tons of petroleum products started to spill into the caspian oil released into the sea and the coastal area from oil extraction transportation refining and storage reached more than one million tons a year by the end of the 1880s kosarev and gyul 1996 the annual variability of the caspian in this period was relatively stable and the water level fluctuated at around 26 2 m below sea level the second paradigm which is characterized by navigation fishing and extraction of mechanically drilled oil became the next step of development in the water management of the caspian sea 5 3 paradigm 3 soviet collectivization 5 3 1 socioeconomic changes in accordance with the study by abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2013 where they describe the period between 1920s and 1940s in central asia as a turning point from traditional water management systems to highly centralized farming systems we characterize the span of 1917 1940 as the preparation to hydraulic mission in the caspian sea region the littoral states experienced significant political and institutional changes that affected sectoral activities after the bolshevik revolution of october 1917 the newly established socialist federal republic of the soviets of russia found a way to regain control over the former regions of the russian empire reoccupying central asia and azerbaijan the russian government closed the caspian basin to foreign states and guaranteed iran that they would respect the agreed upon borders parvizpur 1984 the situation became difficult when in 1920 the communist party nationalized the whole economy including the oil industry and implemented a policy of the expansion of industrial production for military needs protesting the action taken by the communist party all western companies sold their holdings in the region and pulled the financial support from economic sectors all the concessions on fishing before the treaty of friendship 1921 table 2 had been in the exclusive ownership of the russians the new agreement declared null and void the treaties of golestan and turkmenchay which diminished the rights of the persian people although the treaty article 14 had ended such a monopoly allowing the iranians the same full rights to fishing as the russian side the legal status of the caspian sea had not yet been addressed the right of navigation belonged exclusively to the two littoral states oil and gas exploration as well as drillings in the area remained beyond the scope of bilateral regulations further agreements the 1931 and 1935 treaties provided the right of freedom for both states to fish in the sea with the exception of a zone of 10 miles along the coastal line that remained an exclusive fishery area 5 3 2 environmental changes the nationalization of the fishing industry resulted in a reduction in the number of fish caught however the new centralized control regime began to invest in fisheries and production recovered in a short period the collectivization of the agricultural sector of the ussr between 1928 and 1940 forced the consolidation of individual farms into collective fish farms along the volga river the extremely high economic goals of the government resulted in overfishing and the depletion of the local fish population kalgin 2004 the construction of reservoirs led to a dramatic decrease in the volga runoff the main source of the caspian the ivankovo complex in 1937 and the uglich in 1939 were built on the river covering together more than 576 square kilometers the water level sharply dropped by 1 8 m reaching 27 5 m at the end of the 1940s fashchevsky 2003 5 4 paradigm 4 hydraulic mission 5 4 1 socioeconomic and technical changes after the second world war the soviet union came into a period of construction and economic and military competition with the united states the main target of the soviet economic policy was to increase industrial and agricultural productivity through the mobilization of additional resources grossman 1987 opened in 1952 the volga don canal joined the caspian to the world s oceans and made possible the transportation of mineral resources to western markets by ships rucevska and simonett 2006 gigantic dams canals and huge irrigation systems built in the caspian region demonstrated the scale of technological progress in this period and the desire to control natural resources the treaty of commerce and navigation signed in 1940 refers to the caspian sea as the soviet iranian sea for the first time dpr sssr the treaty once again reaffirmed the equal and exclusive navigation and fishing rights of both countries the coastal approach to the governance of the caspian sea remained undisputed throughout the entire period of the ussr butler 1969 5 4 2 environmental changes the long period of political tension and military competition between the ussr and the united states led to vast environmental damage to implement the five year plans for fishing hydropower generation agriculture development of the oil industry and transportation the rivers of the caspian watershed and its marine resources were used for decades as a commodity and a tool with which more benefits and higher production rates could be gained at any cost the construction of a large number of industrial facilities along the rivers such as volga ural terek and kura feeding into the caspian led to an important decrease in the quantity of water inflow and the production of sturgeon with its valuable caviar during the period of 1940 1977 there was an additional drop of more than 1 m and the sea level fell to around 29 m fig 8 however after 1977 the caspian sea level began to increase due to the significant natural increase of the volga discharge and reached 27 5 m by the end of the 1990s rozengurt and hedgpeth 1989 altogether the above facts suggest that the fourth paradigm differs from the previous paradigms by an extremely high level of development of hydraulic infrastructure and high levels of environmental pressure on the caspian sea resources 5 5 paradigm 5 independent littoral states 5 5 1 socioeconomic changes the role of the caspian sea in the regional economic development increased dramatically after the 1990s the disintegration of the ussr and the appearance of three new actors azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan totally modified the course of international relations in the caspian region and destroyed the former water management and governance regime the treaties between iran and the ussr lost their power and the previous bilateral cooperation regime of the caspian sea became invalid makili aliyev 2014 even though the caspian sea was formally under the jurisdiction of the ussr and iran until 1991 it was in fact almost the exclusive sovereignty of the soviet union after the appearance of new actors in the international arena the legal status of the sea became a source of dispute among them azerbaijan iran russia kazakhstan and turkmenistan were faced with the challenge of effective cooperation regarding the management of such a huge transboundary water basin the problem of cooperation rapidly increased with the oil and gas production boom in the 1990s in 1993 turkmenistan claimed a 12 mile coastal zone under its jurisdiction according to the un convention on the law of the sea of 10 december 1982 unclos azerbaijan and kazakhstan declared a part of the sea as national territory and started to trade licenses for the exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources hille 2010 current trend in water governance of the caspian sea can be tracked through the interstate agreements which can be splitted into two categories delimitation of the seabed and environmental protection table 3 almost all agreements on the delimitation of the seabed have been bilateral and signed in order to ease the extraction of hydrocarbon resources in the sub soil however absence of consensus on the legal status and disputes on the ownership of several oil and gas fields has prevented the implementation of large offshore projects unequal distribution of the offshore hydrocarbon reserves has played the main role in disagreements referring to the legal status among the five caspian littoral states biresselioglu 2011 p 75 signed in august 2018 the convention on the legal status of the caspian sea became a tremendous achievement for the littoral states although this convention clarify the special legal status and identifies the caspian sea as the body of water surrounded by the land territories it provides little details on how to split the seabed mentioning that delimitation to be based on bilateral agreements virtually the convention on legal status officially recognizes the status neither sea nor transboundary lake and the approach for the seabed delimitation that the littoral states used before the reason of reaching the consensus on the status after almost 30 years of disputes is security issues that pushed iran and russia to take prompt steps in order to prevent any military forces from using the caspian ports warsaw institute 2018 5 5 2 environmental changes while the littoral states were disputing about the legal status and delimitation of the sea and its resources negotiations on environmental problems have been halted for more than ten years none of the five states has agreed to accept responsibility for the deterioration of the water quality or the depletion of its natural resources and biodiversity including the caspian seal instead they continue to excessively extract hydrocarbon resources and only use a limited application of environmentally friendly technologies until 2003 there were no agreements on the environmental protection of the caspian sea signed in november 2003 by all littoral states the framework convention for the protection of the marine environment of the caspian sea the tehran convention became the first regional legally binding document aimed at the protection of the ecosystem the tehran convention together with its three signed protocols indicates a movement towards reflexive modernity and sets up the principal requirements and the institutional mechanism for the preservation and sustainable development of the marine environment nevertheless the practical implementation of the tehran convention has been delayed u n news 2003 because the five caspian littoral states were unable to reach consensus in the negotiations of protocols on the conservation of biodiversity pollution combating oil incidents and environmental impact assessment entered into force on 25 july 2016 the aktau protocol requires the littoral states to prepare for and respond to oil contamination incidents although some countries ratified the moscow and ashgabat protocols these documents have yet to enter into force the only regional institution for the protection of the marine environment of the caspian sea is the tehran convention secretariat under the administration of the unep that assists the five caspian states in complying with the tehran convention and its protocols the new convention on the legal status might be an important step on the way to sustainable water governance of the caspian sea nevertheless the most of the principles in the convention focus on the priority of regional security while environmental issues are limited with rules on scientific research related to hydrobiological resources 6 discussion and conclusions in the previous section we incorporated political economic social and environmental transformations related to the water governance of the caspian sea into the framework of water management paradigms in order to demonstrate the strong interdependence of the components in a water society nexus the technical dimension plays a secondary role and determines the scale and effectiveness of the use of marine resources by supplementing the analysis with international agreements and protocols between the littoral states we extend the concept of the hydrosocial cycle this was done for two reasons to demonstrate which issues concern the littoral states and to what extent regional cooperation on environmental protection is effective the analysis of the hydrosocial cycle within various historical periods facilitates to identify the way humans perceive water hydraulic mission that started after the second world war has continued to persist after the dissolution of the ussr in the caspian region with a new force exploration of the seabed hydrocarbon resources economically weak littoral states are unable to break the ties between economic growth and use of marine resources azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan are heavily dependent on the caspian resources and cannot deny that they favor economic gains over the environmental state of the caspian sea iran and russia are mostly concerned about geopolitical power in the region and try to prevent azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan from exporting energy resources along corridors other than russian and iranian ones slogans about the necessity of focusing on water management using interdisciplinary and holistic approaches periodically arise on the meetings of the parties to tehran convention however there is no significant change towards the paradigm of reflexive modernity the long period between the signing and implementation of the interstate agreements on the protection of the caspian ecosystem demonstrates the unwillingness of the countries to take responsibility for environmental damage the recent convention on the legal status did not bring substantial improvements on the delimitation of the seabed in addition by officially leaving the status unclear and serving mainly to ease the extraction of hydrocarbon reserves this convention only proves that no one from the littoral states concern about the environmental conditions of the sea despite attempts to recognize iwrm concept in the region the caspian littoral states fails to implement integrated strategies incorporation of ecological values into the water management and governance in the region faces a number of obstacles which derive from the scarcity of water resources and economic weaknesses of the littoral states ladaa 2005 including the caspian littoral states into the global south which failed to shift to reflexive modernity we simultaneously cannot conclude that the global north has completely changed its perception of water environmental conditions of some water bodies in developed countries such as ohio river in the united states murray darling basin in australia ross and connell 2016 jordan river basin in the israel hoff et al 2011 show that governments in the north also seek economic benefits when the sphere of environmental protection of water bodies stands in contradiction with economic goals the lack of effective regional cooperation and consensus on environmental issues continue to undermine the efforts of the states and discourage them from protecting the environment therefore the caspian littoral states should aspire to promote the regional cooperation giving priority to environmental consequences from anthropogenic activities developing an integrated technical system and common natural resources management in the form of various platforms and local institutions is crucial but not effective without implementing changes into policies and national legislation to push the region to the reflexive modernity and incorporate principles of iwrm in the caspian sea water reservoir it is necessary to build the institutional and administrative capacity that could turn the agreements and protocols into the national law 
6862,the study explores the shifts in water management paradigms in the caspian sea basin over the last three centuries with an emphasis on the period after 1990 the investigation is based on the chronological analysis of developments in the water sector treaties and agreements between the littoral states important technical inventions and changes in political regimes the methodology used in the paper captures two concepts the concept of water management paradigms helps to comprehend developmental stages of water management of the caspian sea the concept of hydrosocial cycle was applied as an analytical lens for studying each paradigm we examine different understandings of water in the following five stages i pre industrial era before 1846 ii industrialization era 1846 1917 iii soviet collectivization era 1917 1940 iv hydraulic mission 1940 1990 v independent littoral states 1990 present before the industrial revolution the caspian sea was managed by the russian empire and persia for navigation and fishing only the ensuing technical progress gave an impulse to regional sectoral activities pushing forward the hydraulic mission that caused a considerable degradation of the sea s ecosystems the adoption of the tehran convention in 2003 became a first step towards the integrated water resources management iwrm paradigm for the caspian however the water governance of the caspian states does not adhere to the principles of iwrm and consequently environment continues to deteriorate the study provides new directions and approaches for reviewing the role of society in the governance of the caspian sea and its resources keywords industrial modernity reflexive modernity environmental degradation legal status the caspian sea list of acronyms ussr union of soviet

unclos united nations convention on the law of the sea mml modified median line 1 introduction the caspian sea with its abundant resources plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of the region and the littoral states 1 the reason we used the term littoral instead of riparian is that in general littoral states are countries on the shore of a sea ocean bay or lake and riparian are those on a river or water stream in this study the current littoral states of the caspian sea are kazakhstan russia azerbaijan turkmenistan and iran 1 azerbaijan iran kazakhstan russia and turkmenistan the countries sharing the sea are faced with difficulties in building effective regional cooperation due to different positions on the legal status of the sea before the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 the entire caspian sea was under the formal jurisdiction of only two states the ussr and iran after the collapse of the soviet union the increased number of littoral states led to a problem of transboundary cooperation on issues related to the caspian sea and its natural resources attempts made by azerbaijan russia kazakhstan turkmenistan and iran to secure their own water rights and interests created not only a number of political constraints but also produced legal problems for economic activities makili aliyev 2014 the caspian sea has become an object of serious dispute in the region and continues to be a highly potential area for conflict due to unresolved controversies over the seabed boundary delimitation in addition the unstable economic situation of the coastal states and their political regimes further exacerbate issues related to the management of the transboundary body of water the caspian sea located in the middle of the eurasian continent is a unique landlocked water mass that contains exclusive fisheries and enormous oil and gas resources however the sea s ecosystem has been degraded due to intensive anthropogenic activities barannik et al 2004 mark out the oil industry agriculture fisheries transportation and hydropower generation as the sectors for which the caspian water resources are most important all of these activities contribute directly or indirectly to pollution biodiversity degradation and changes in the sea s water level detecting the root of these challenges requires a comprehensive analysis of the past and current water management practices in the caspian sea region an investigation of the social and political conditions in the region can help unveil a set of key issues causing international disputes and threatening economic development and environmental sustainability in the caspian sea area changes in water management are tightly bound with mankind s relationship to nature and water loftus 2009 the aim of this study is to investigate shifts in understanding related to the role and value of the caspian sea in order to reveal the reasons for changes and uncover challenges in solving current problems the authors explore existing transboundary agreements made between the littoral states concerning the caspian sea as well as the regulation of main sector activities technical progress changes in political regimes and environmental conditions to reveal the attitude of society towards the caspian ecosystem while a considerable body of research has described only historical changes the present work is the first attempt to look constructively at the development of the water management of the caspian sea with the set of analytical tools one of them is the framework of water management paradigms that assumes different approaches to the water and resources being managed the aims of management and the ways to achieve the aims pahl wostl et al 2011 in this study we define five paradigms for the water and resources management of the caspian sea that are paradigms of i pre industrial era before 1846 ii industrialization era 1846 1917 iii soviet collectivization era 1917 1940 iv hydraulic mission 1940 1990 and v independent littoral states time 1990 present another tool we apply in this study is the concept of hydrosocial cycle which plays a key role in the relationship between water and society in the caspian sea region the hydrosocial cycle concept will be applied for five periods of caspian sea development the results section introduces an analysis of the agreements on the caspian sea between the littoral states a history of water management in the region and the impact of human activities on the environmental situation finally the discussion and conclusion outline the changes of all five water paradigms in the caspian region and look at the extent to which the current paradigm is reflexive 2 the current state of the environment in the caspian sea region the caspian sea nowadays endures critical environmental degradation including biodiversity loss water quality deterioration soil contamination and poor public health weak environmental regulation and the absence of joint efforts in the five littoral states reduce the effectiveness of efforts to protect the caspian environment the newly independent countries kazakhstan turkmenistan and azerbaijan have been intensively developing their oil and gas industries and trying to attract more investment to these sectors fig 1 shows the rate of oil production in the caspian region for the period 1992 2014 it is clear that kazakhstan and azerbaijan have significant shares of the total oil production fig 1 the absence of iran in the figure is due to inessential production in the caspian region the caspian sea is dramatically exposed to the threat of pollution from oil and gas extraction transportation refining storage use of petroleum products and accidental oil spills over two million years old the caspian sea has a unique ecosystem with more than 400 endemic species including 115 types of fish currently such abundant biodiversity is suffering from water contamination and habitat demolition adb 2009 for instance the caspian seal was listed in the international union for conservation of nature s list of threatened and endangered species iucn 2017 thousands of seals have died due to a weakened immune system caused by the contaminated water the number of caspian seals has declined dramatically since 1950 fig 2 the drop in seal population was generally caused by severe hunting reduced biological capacity of the sea commercial fishing and water pollution the caspian environment programme cep 2011 in its analysis of the caspian sea reveals that the number of sturgeon caught in iran and the former ussr republics declined over the years between 1929 and 1998 fig 3 the ups and downs of the sturgeon production can be explained by the unstable political situation in the region the rehabilitation of industry after the second world war resulted in a progressive increase in yearly catch that peaked at about 28 900 tonnes in 1977 after the collapse of the soviet union the lack of environmental regulations in the newly independent states led to large scale organized poaching and became a main reason for the sharp decline in sturgeon catch today some species became endangered by increasing oil extraction followed by pollution the invasion of alien species the loss of habitats and poaching providing a legal mechanism for water and resource management as well as the protection of the natural environment and creating a common regulating institutional body are essential for eradicating environmental problems in the area zonn 2000 3 conceptual framework 3 1 hydrosocial cycle substantial literature has considered the hydrologic cycle as a physical process from various approaches that have been changing over time duffy 2017 however some scholars criticize the hydrologic cycle for ignoring the social dimensions linton 2010 hydrologic cycle demonstrates the physical states and conditions of water referring to this process as asocial and apolitical the concept of hydrosocial cycle has contrasted to hydrologic cycle as more holistic process that captures biophysical and socio political dimensions budds et al 2014 social progress and institutional change have increasingly influenced hydrologic processes water as politically contended resource has been closely studied by mollinga 2001 who claims that water management institutes and water policies are the results of political actions although the concept of the hydrosocial cycle appeared much earlier it has been intensively discussed by a number of scientists during the last decades many have tried to explain the development of water management in terms of hydrosocial cycles which reflect the impact of society on water resources abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2013 linton 2010 2008 swyngedouw 2009 in simple terms this concept demonstrates how social power and political and economic factors interrelate with water are changed by water and transform water palomino schalscha et al 2016 keil and young 2001 define the hydrosocial cycle as the sum of the human and physical interrelationships pertaining to water in cities stressing that societies govern water as part of social political cultural and economic systems according to turton et al 2001 the hydrosocial cycle operates with reference to social contract theories as such there is a hydrosocial nexus working at the intersection of water management social and legal norms the state and the environment this means that water is embedded in the social arena by social norms water resources and the rights of individuals as well as the social fabric of the societies developing water relations from the perspective of political ecology the hydrosocial cycle contributes to understanding how nature and society interact with each other on different levels and determines the conditions for change in water management practices cook and swyngedouw 2012 adopted from linton and budds 2014 the diagram fig 4 of the hydrosocial cycle demonstrates the process of interrelation between water and society through space and time the material water intervenes with the social structure which manipulates the quantity and quality of the water flow by using technological achievements and the manipulations in turn influences the material water transformation in one of the components leads to changes in the others the hydrosocial cycle can be associated with socio hydrology the nascent interdisciplinary science proposed by sivapalan et al 2012 that focus on observing understanding and forecasting of co evolution of coupled human water systems however the difference is that hydrosocial cycle is analytical tool serving for identification the composition of historical hydrological political and technological conditions of water linton and budds 2014 one could see hydrosocial cycle as a part of the mosaic of socio hydrology a science the boundaries of which seem to stretch far beyond analytical tools and incorporate complex socio hydrological models montanari et al 2013 2014 3 2 water management paradigms in 1990 s several scholars emphasized the need for reassessment of management practices in public land and water resources in other words a paradigm shift behan 1990 kessler et al 1992 they argued that traditional paradigm associated with sustained supply of water for economic needs is being invalidated and should be replaced by new paradigms based on sustainable ecosystem management and processes of collective decision making cortner and moote 1994 kuhn 1970 uses the term paradigm implying the way of thinking theories and values commonly accepted by certain communities by kuhn s terminology the water management paradigm refers to the mindset of how water management should be implemented by the actors of a certain community technical infrastructure legal rules social norms and engineering practices represent the global view on water and the ways in which water management targets can be reached in the 1930s the state hydraulic paradigm or hydraulic mission era reflected the development of water supplies by state agencies that viewed water simply as a resource for the construction of mega water projects such as dams irrigation canals hydroelectric stations and large scale reservoirs water management based on this paradigm consisted of the exploitation of water without taking into consideration the complex relationship between water and human society bakker 2003 from this point of view the hydrologic cycle only represented the technical dimension of water depriving it of a social and ecological context it was a period of anthropocentricity whereby nature was considered a neutral resource that could be exploited limitlessly and controlled by humankind with the help of technology beck et al 2003 as a result water and water related resources were used to produce other commodities consideration of water as solely economic good was convenient for the modern state at the time and was a key component of the state hydraulic paradigm molle mollinga and wester 2009 the general decline of the state hydraulic paradigm over the last three decades can be explained by a number of factors including an increasing awareness of ecological social and sustainable water management diminishing supplies of unexploited water and a shift in attention from water supply to water demand management allan 2005 in the late 1970s american society began to grow concerned about environmental problems that started to seriously restrict social progress in 1976 the american sociological association established a new section on environmental sociology which tried to explain societal changes not from an anthropocentric perspective but from a non anthropocentric paradigm the main idea of the new flow was to understand that human societies are part of ecosystems and those interactions between the environment and people are a natural process catton and dunlap 1978 announced the arrival of the new environmental paradigm nep which took the place of the human exceptionalism paradigm a paradigm that had ignored the dependence of society on the environment the nep consisted of several assumptions that emphasized the role of humans as a part of the ecosystem and the finiteness of natural resources the nep introduced a new dimension for researchers from different scientific fields an increasing number of decommissioned dams in the united states and western europe demonstrate the historic shift in managing water towards the concept of the hydrosocial cycle allan 2005 represents changes in global water management in a schematic form where the hydraulic mission is one of the water management paradigms that changed after the 1970s especially in the developed countries and remained the same in developing countries referred to as north and south in fig 5 upon the whole he distinguishes five particular water management paradigms the first paradigm of water management pertains to the pre modern community that is defined as the period before industrialization and the development of technology the second paradigm of industrial modernity can be characterized by modern engineering the appearance of state centric management and the hydraulic mission it was an era of the continuous supply of water to meet the demand created by industrial and agricultural development the upward trend of water use represents the hydraulic mission of water or the process of taking more and more water out of the environment to produce food in the agricultural sector in the 1970s the main ideas of industrial modernity began to be questioned and the era of reflexive modernity characterized by the modernization of modernity beck et al 1994 and the modifying of social institutions due to social change giddens 1987 came with a new wave of environmentalism the hydrosocial cycle concept corresponds with allan s period of reflexive modernity furthermore it can be considered as part of the reflexive modernity period in water management which reflects the impact of water on socio economic and political interactions among stakeholders the era of reflexive modernity incorporating three water management paradigms arose in the north the third paradigm refers to the shift from the hydraulic mission to environmental awareness raised by the green social movement and returning water back into the environment such international organizations as united nations the world bank the world water council and the global water partnership also tried to raise this idea in the southern countries however the trend in water use remained the same and even more water was used in order to increase food and energy production and meet the food demand the different trajectories in the upper part of fig 5 represent freshwater use in the arid and semi arid north and the semi arid south since 1980 changes in water management continued throughout the period of the fourth paradigm demonstrating the significance and the new role of water as a limited economic resource the final paradigm was built on the concept of iwrm that states that water management is a political process this paradigm emphasizes the importance of the participation of all stakeholders civil society government and non government organizations in policy making issues the purpose of applying the concept of water management paradigms to the caspian sea s governance is to figure out the environmental and social changes that can help to understand approach to the sea in the region 4 the hydrosocial cycle of the caspian sea and water management paradigms for the hydrosocial analysis of water management in the caspian sea region we considered the changes in social technical and environmental indicators that represent the three parts of the hydrosocial cycle the first part is a social one that encompasses political and economic aspects such as changes in sector activities political systems and regulations in this study political aspect refers to the disputes on legal status of the sea and international agreements between the littoral states that demonstrate transboundary management at the regional level reviewing interstate agreements and protocols allows to trace evolution of the attitudes of the littoral states towards the sea and its ecosystem while the old treaties can be found in documents of foreign policy of the ussr dpr sssr and on the website of the ministry of foreign affairs of the republic of azerbaijan faolex provides the majority of legal documents on the caspian sea agreements on transboundary water objects reflect cooperation between countries on the common use of water and related resources and establish the rules of transboundary water management it has been almost three centuries since the littoral states began to sign agreements with each other thus we can investigate how the caspian sea has been managed legally in addition institutional changes in the littoral states have significant influence on economic activities which in turn may cause environmental degradation the economic aspect includes human activities that contribute to the economies of the littoral states in the caspian sea the most significant human activities are the oil and gas industries and fisheries the second dimension is the technical part of hydrosocial cycle which determines the scale of human activities and their contribution to the economy through the analysis of outstanding technological inventions we can investigate how society used technical tools to shape water management according to scott 1998 ecological and social transformations are driven by hydraulic engineers for example investigating a case of canal irrigation in south india mollinga 2014 finds that technical infrastructure facilitates water flow and makes it possible to rearrange the hydrological cycle in time and space using reservoirs and hierarchically ordered canals large scale structural interventions were made possible through modern water science and engineering technologies molle 2006 therefore a particular focus needs to be placed on the effect of technological developments in the major economic sectors in the caspian sea region finally the environmental dimension considers the conditions of water quality and water level caspian bio resources and the coastal environment to show the environmental changes we use biological indicators from fao fishery statistics and the cep data on the sea level was obtained from kostianoy et al 2010 exploring the above dimensions in the caspian water management through time we defined the following sequence of paradigms presented in fig 6 each paradigm is scrutinized in the next section in chronological order and provides details on the most important political technical and environmental changes we begin to discern paradigms and trace changes with first interstate treaties between littoral states because content of official documents best demonstrates the main governance aspects of the sea 5 water paradigms in the caspian sea region 5 1 paradigm 1 pre modern water management the first paradigm of pre modern water management involves strong connections between traditional technical practices the main governance regime and water use 5 1 1 socioeconomic changes the period of limited technical capacity before 1846 can be considered as an era of two states russian empire and persia fig 7 focused on issues of navigation and fishing russia became a caspian actor following the conquest of the astrakhan khanate in the 16th century agreements signed by the russian and persian empires table 1 were based on the coastal approach that considered the caspian sea as a mare nullius private sea managed by the two states for small scale fishing and commercial navigation in fact the sea was almost completely under the russian control the first ratified agreement the treaty of resht consolidated the liberty of trade and navigation for the russian empire which was eager to conquer persian territories later the golestan and the turkmenchay treaties granted equal navigation and commercial fleet rights to the littoral states but only russia could have a military fleet this exclusive right strengthened the dominating position of russia in the caspian sea frappi and garibov 2014 under these two treaties azerbaijan was divided into south persian and north russian azerbaijan as can be seen from treaties the interrelation between the russian and persian empires was purely built on defining their territories 5 1 2 environmental changes although we could not find any records regarding the environmental situation of the caspian it can be assumed that environmental pollution was not a problem in that period fisheries and commercial navigation were organized according to traditional techniques due to the absence of a high degree of economic activities the ecosystems as well as biodiversity were in good condition the pre industrial society was not able to construct massive infrastructure saparov 2015 that could adversely affect water quality and biodiversity the sea level only began to be measured instrumentally in 1837 at baku and averaged a level of around 25 5 m fig 8 above the baltic sea datum bsd kostianoy et al 2010 5 2 paradigm 2 the beginning of industrialization 5 2 1 socioeconomic and technical changes the appearance of new technological inventions after the industrial revolution dramatically changed practices in all sectoral activities and fossil fuels became an important energy source the modern day oil industry began to form in 1846 in bibi aybat borough near baku it was the first mechanically drilled oil well in the world and represented an important technical innovation the mechanical production of oil attracted a number of foreign investors to the region that led to the growth of the regional population and fish demand established in baku in 1873 the nobel brothers oil extracting partnership developed a number of inventions beneficial to oil production the most substantial invention was oil tankers in the caspian sea karagiannis 2002 after construction of the first azerbaijan railways in 1880 connecting baku to its outlying oilfields the nobel brothers introduced railway tanks for oil transportation that enormously improved the turnover of oil and reduced transportation costs barnes and briggs 2003 despite the appearance of many small petrochemical companies around baku control over the oil industry in the caspian was concentrated in the hands of the nobel brothers fig 9 5 2 2 environmental changes the tremendous development of the oil industry in the caspian sea resulted in the extraction of 10 7 million tons annually in the early 1890s nearly half of the world s oil production with the increased transportation of oil in bunkers tons of petroleum products started to spill into the caspian oil released into the sea and the coastal area from oil extraction transportation refining and storage reached more than one million tons a year by the end of the 1880s kosarev and gyul 1996 the annual variability of the caspian in this period was relatively stable and the water level fluctuated at around 26 2 m below sea level the second paradigm which is characterized by navigation fishing and extraction of mechanically drilled oil became the next step of development in the water management of the caspian sea 5 3 paradigm 3 soviet collectivization 5 3 1 socioeconomic changes in accordance with the study by abdullaev and rakhmatullaev 2013 where they describe the period between 1920s and 1940s in central asia as a turning point from traditional water management systems to highly centralized farming systems we characterize the span of 1917 1940 as the preparation to hydraulic mission in the caspian sea region the littoral states experienced significant political and institutional changes that affected sectoral activities after the bolshevik revolution of october 1917 the newly established socialist federal republic of the soviets of russia found a way to regain control over the former regions of the russian empire reoccupying central asia and azerbaijan the russian government closed the caspian basin to foreign states and guaranteed iran that they would respect the agreed upon borders parvizpur 1984 the situation became difficult when in 1920 the communist party nationalized the whole economy including the oil industry and implemented a policy of the expansion of industrial production for military needs protesting the action taken by the communist party all western companies sold their holdings in the region and pulled the financial support from economic sectors all the concessions on fishing before the treaty of friendship 1921 table 2 had been in the exclusive ownership of the russians the new agreement declared null and void the treaties of golestan and turkmenchay which diminished the rights of the persian people although the treaty article 14 had ended such a monopoly allowing the iranians the same full rights to fishing as the russian side the legal status of the caspian sea had not yet been addressed the right of navigation belonged exclusively to the two littoral states oil and gas exploration as well as drillings in the area remained beyond the scope of bilateral regulations further agreements the 1931 and 1935 treaties provided the right of freedom for both states to fish in the sea with the exception of a zone of 10 miles along the coastal line that remained an exclusive fishery area 5 3 2 environmental changes the nationalization of the fishing industry resulted in a reduction in the number of fish caught however the new centralized control regime began to invest in fisheries and production recovered in a short period the collectivization of the agricultural sector of the ussr between 1928 and 1940 forced the consolidation of individual farms into collective fish farms along the volga river the extremely high economic goals of the government resulted in overfishing and the depletion of the local fish population kalgin 2004 the construction of reservoirs led to a dramatic decrease in the volga runoff the main source of the caspian the ivankovo complex in 1937 and the uglich in 1939 were built on the river covering together more than 576 square kilometers the water level sharply dropped by 1 8 m reaching 27 5 m at the end of the 1940s fashchevsky 2003 5 4 paradigm 4 hydraulic mission 5 4 1 socioeconomic and technical changes after the second world war the soviet union came into a period of construction and economic and military competition with the united states the main target of the soviet economic policy was to increase industrial and agricultural productivity through the mobilization of additional resources grossman 1987 opened in 1952 the volga don canal joined the caspian to the world s oceans and made possible the transportation of mineral resources to western markets by ships rucevska and simonett 2006 gigantic dams canals and huge irrigation systems built in the caspian region demonstrated the scale of technological progress in this period and the desire to control natural resources the treaty of commerce and navigation signed in 1940 refers to the caspian sea as the soviet iranian sea for the first time dpr sssr the treaty once again reaffirmed the equal and exclusive navigation and fishing rights of both countries the coastal approach to the governance of the caspian sea remained undisputed throughout the entire period of the ussr butler 1969 5 4 2 environmental changes the long period of political tension and military competition between the ussr and the united states led to vast environmental damage to implement the five year plans for fishing hydropower generation agriculture development of the oil industry and transportation the rivers of the caspian watershed and its marine resources were used for decades as a commodity and a tool with which more benefits and higher production rates could be gained at any cost the construction of a large number of industrial facilities along the rivers such as volga ural terek and kura feeding into the caspian led to an important decrease in the quantity of water inflow and the production of sturgeon with its valuable caviar during the period of 1940 1977 there was an additional drop of more than 1 m and the sea level fell to around 29 m fig 8 however after 1977 the caspian sea level began to increase due to the significant natural increase of the volga discharge and reached 27 5 m by the end of the 1990s rozengurt and hedgpeth 1989 altogether the above facts suggest that the fourth paradigm differs from the previous paradigms by an extremely high level of development of hydraulic infrastructure and high levels of environmental pressure on the caspian sea resources 5 5 paradigm 5 independent littoral states 5 5 1 socioeconomic changes the role of the caspian sea in the regional economic development increased dramatically after the 1990s the disintegration of the ussr and the appearance of three new actors azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan totally modified the course of international relations in the caspian region and destroyed the former water management and governance regime the treaties between iran and the ussr lost their power and the previous bilateral cooperation regime of the caspian sea became invalid makili aliyev 2014 even though the caspian sea was formally under the jurisdiction of the ussr and iran until 1991 it was in fact almost the exclusive sovereignty of the soviet union after the appearance of new actors in the international arena the legal status of the sea became a source of dispute among them azerbaijan iran russia kazakhstan and turkmenistan were faced with the challenge of effective cooperation regarding the management of such a huge transboundary water basin the problem of cooperation rapidly increased with the oil and gas production boom in the 1990s in 1993 turkmenistan claimed a 12 mile coastal zone under its jurisdiction according to the un convention on the law of the sea of 10 december 1982 unclos azerbaijan and kazakhstan declared a part of the sea as national territory and started to trade licenses for the exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources hille 2010 current trend in water governance of the caspian sea can be tracked through the interstate agreements which can be splitted into two categories delimitation of the seabed and environmental protection table 3 almost all agreements on the delimitation of the seabed have been bilateral and signed in order to ease the extraction of hydrocarbon resources in the sub soil however absence of consensus on the legal status and disputes on the ownership of several oil and gas fields has prevented the implementation of large offshore projects unequal distribution of the offshore hydrocarbon reserves has played the main role in disagreements referring to the legal status among the five caspian littoral states biresselioglu 2011 p 75 signed in august 2018 the convention on the legal status of the caspian sea became a tremendous achievement for the littoral states although this convention clarify the special legal status and identifies the caspian sea as the body of water surrounded by the land territories it provides little details on how to split the seabed mentioning that delimitation to be based on bilateral agreements virtually the convention on legal status officially recognizes the status neither sea nor transboundary lake and the approach for the seabed delimitation that the littoral states used before the reason of reaching the consensus on the status after almost 30 years of disputes is security issues that pushed iran and russia to take prompt steps in order to prevent any military forces from using the caspian ports warsaw institute 2018 5 5 2 environmental changes while the littoral states were disputing about the legal status and delimitation of the sea and its resources negotiations on environmental problems have been halted for more than ten years none of the five states has agreed to accept responsibility for the deterioration of the water quality or the depletion of its natural resources and biodiversity including the caspian seal instead they continue to excessively extract hydrocarbon resources and only use a limited application of environmentally friendly technologies until 2003 there were no agreements on the environmental protection of the caspian sea signed in november 2003 by all littoral states the framework convention for the protection of the marine environment of the caspian sea the tehran convention became the first regional legally binding document aimed at the protection of the ecosystem the tehran convention together with its three signed protocols indicates a movement towards reflexive modernity and sets up the principal requirements and the institutional mechanism for the preservation and sustainable development of the marine environment nevertheless the practical implementation of the tehran convention has been delayed u n news 2003 because the five caspian littoral states were unable to reach consensus in the negotiations of protocols on the conservation of biodiversity pollution combating oil incidents and environmental impact assessment entered into force on 25 july 2016 the aktau protocol requires the littoral states to prepare for and respond to oil contamination incidents although some countries ratified the moscow and ashgabat protocols these documents have yet to enter into force the only regional institution for the protection of the marine environment of the caspian sea is the tehran convention secretariat under the administration of the unep that assists the five caspian states in complying with the tehran convention and its protocols the new convention on the legal status might be an important step on the way to sustainable water governance of the caspian sea nevertheless the most of the principles in the convention focus on the priority of regional security while environmental issues are limited with rules on scientific research related to hydrobiological resources 6 discussion and conclusions in the previous section we incorporated political economic social and environmental transformations related to the water governance of the caspian sea into the framework of water management paradigms in order to demonstrate the strong interdependence of the components in a water society nexus the technical dimension plays a secondary role and determines the scale and effectiveness of the use of marine resources by supplementing the analysis with international agreements and protocols between the littoral states we extend the concept of the hydrosocial cycle this was done for two reasons to demonstrate which issues concern the littoral states and to what extent regional cooperation on environmental protection is effective the analysis of the hydrosocial cycle within various historical periods facilitates to identify the way humans perceive water hydraulic mission that started after the second world war has continued to persist after the dissolution of the ussr in the caspian region with a new force exploration of the seabed hydrocarbon resources economically weak littoral states are unable to break the ties between economic growth and use of marine resources azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan are heavily dependent on the caspian resources and cannot deny that they favor economic gains over the environmental state of the caspian sea iran and russia are mostly concerned about geopolitical power in the region and try to prevent azerbaijan kazakhstan and turkmenistan from exporting energy resources along corridors other than russian and iranian ones slogans about the necessity of focusing on water management using interdisciplinary and holistic approaches periodically arise on the meetings of the parties to tehran convention however there is no significant change towards the paradigm of reflexive modernity the long period between the signing and implementation of the interstate agreements on the protection of the caspian ecosystem demonstrates the unwillingness of the countries to take responsibility for environmental damage the recent convention on the legal status did not bring substantial improvements on the delimitation of the seabed in addition by officially leaving the status unclear and serving mainly to ease the extraction of hydrocarbon reserves this convention only proves that no one from the littoral states concern about the environmental conditions of the sea despite attempts to recognize iwrm concept in the region the caspian littoral states fails to implement integrated strategies incorporation of ecological values into the water management and governance in the region faces a number of obstacles which derive from the scarcity of water resources and economic weaknesses of the littoral states ladaa 2005 including the caspian littoral states into the global south which failed to shift to reflexive modernity we simultaneously cannot conclude that the global north has completely changed its perception of water environmental conditions of some water bodies in developed countries such as ohio river in the united states murray darling basin in australia ross and connell 2016 jordan river basin in the israel hoff et al 2011 show that governments in the north also seek economic benefits when the sphere of environmental protection of water bodies stands in contradiction with economic goals the lack of effective regional cooperation and consensus on environmental issues continue to undermine the efforts of the states and discourage them from protecting the environment therefore the caspian littoral states should aspire to promote the regional cooperation giving priority to environmental consequences from anthropogenic activities developing an integrated technical system and common natural resources management in the form of various platforms and local institutions is crucial but not effective without implementing changes into policies and national legislation to push the region to the reflexive modernity and incorporate principles of iwrm in the caspian sea water reservoir it is necessary to build the institutional and administrative capacity that could turn the agreements and protocols into the national law 
6863,check dams are very important structures for torrent control areas throughout the world measuring the sediment deposition behind check dams is thought to be an effective method of estimating the sediment yield of small catchments in this study we employed a high density electrical resistivity system to detect sediment at six check dams distributed in the hilly and gully area of the loess plateau a total of 11 lines were arranged with 60 electrodes along each line the resultant resistivity data were inverted into subsurface structures using least squares inversion techniques the results indicate that the sediment bottom can been identified using an electrical resistivity contour method using trenches boreholes and drillings to calibrate the calculated values the accuracy of the high density electrical resistivity tomography method was found to be quite high 95 7 the bulk density increases with the sediment deposit depth and can reach a maximum of 1 6 g cm 3 geometric methods considering three shapes v shaped u shaped and trapezoidal were used to estimate the profile area of the check dams the v shaped geometric method showed high accuracy this study provides a four step approach based on high density electrical resistivity tomography and a geometric method to estimate sediment yield for check dam controlled catchments this methodology enables the measurement of the total sediment yield including both the suspended and bedload sediment transport from an ungauged catchment keywords small catchment loess plateau soil erosion sediment deposition sediment volume estimation 1 introduction check dams are one of humanity s earliest constructions leigh et al 2013 the building of check dams has been one of the most commonly utilized structural measures for channel stabilization and erosion control in catchments that experience torrents garcia and mario 2010 romero díaz et al 2012 in addition in arid and semiarid regions check dams can make land less susceptible to erosion and can help restore eroded land to its former condition doolittle 2013 measuring sediment deposition behind check dams is thought to be an effective method of calculating sediment yield verstraeten and poesen 2002 compared to simultaneous measurement at the plot scale and the creation of sediment rating curves at the large river scale measuring sediment trapped by check dams provides useful information at the small catchment scale plotting the observation data is problematic for large watersheds and station gauge data provides sediment yield curves which more closely reflect the suspended sediment rather than the total sediment yield in addition performing soil erosion observations is a time consuming and resource intensive process cerdan et al 2010 fang et al 2017 however using a check dam based methodology allows measurement of the total sediment yield including both the suspended and bedload sediment transport from an ungauged catchment soil erosion leads to widespread land degradation and many other environmental problems fang et al 2017 the chinese loess plateau clp is one of the global hotspots of soil erosion due to its combination of unique soil properties and considerable human pressures wang et al 2007a b on the loess plateau an approximately 2 5 105 km2 area is subject to extremely severe erosion and has a yearly soil erosion modulus greater than 5000 t km 2 fu et al 2011 this area is mainly distributed in the hilly and gully loess area chen et al 2007 to mitigate soil erosion and improve land productivity the construction of check dams has been widely implemented since the 1960s most of the check dams constructed before the 1980s were without flood discharge facilities or spillways according to the yellow river conservancy commission there were 31 797 check dams constructed in the cities of yulin and yan an hilly area of the clp during 1950 to 1989 among those check dams 83 had no spillway as a result these dams had low flood prevention ability and could easily be destroyed by floods in 1986 the key dams project was implemented on the clp this project aimed to construct check dams with large capacity and high quality by 2013 a total of 58 446 check dams providing more than 10 000 m3 of storage had been constructed and remained intact the resultant sediment silting was estimated to be approximately 5 7 billionm3 cmwr 2014 however this number was lower than previous records cmwr 2003 and most old dams constructed before 1980 were no included wang et al 2011 reported that more than 11 104 checked dams had been constructed and captured approximately 21 109 m3 sediment on the clp as of 2003 it is not clear how many check dams currently exist on the clp many studies e g fu et al 2011 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017a b have reported that the sediment load of yellow river decreased from 1 34 gt yr 1 during 1950 1979 to 0 32 gt yr 1 during 2000 2010 mainly due to construction of check dams and ecological restoration projects on the clp however exact estimations of the sediment trapped by check dam are scare detailed records on the topography of the channel bed and trapped sediment area available for key check dam with capacity 5 105 m3 funded by the central government see supplementary information however no sediment volume information is available for the considerable number of smaller dams constructed by local farmers due to the semiarid climate of the loess plateau these check dams usually hold no surface water making experiments more convenient to conduct the sediment deposited behind check dams exhibits a distinct sedimentary sequence related to each flood with the thickness of each couplet varying from a few centimeters to several decimeters chen et al 2016 wang et al 2017 and provides deep insights into the long term sediment deposition process in the catchment ecosystems chen et al 2017 the studies conducted on check dams include research on the particle size redistributed by soil erosion vaez et al 2017 carbon sequestration opportunities lü et al 2012 ran et al 2014 the fingerprint method used to calculate sediment sources chen et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and soil erosion modeling grum et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b earlier studies estimated sediment volume and mass by using one profile or several drillings to represent the whole check dam for example wei et al 2017 used ten drilling holes from three check dams to estimate their retained sediment li et al 2016 use one profile per check dam to correlate the sedimentation of three check dams with the rainstorm characteristics on the loess plateau this method was also used by zhao et al 2017a b and wang et al 2017 excavating sediment profiles and drilling are laborious costly and time consuming tasks therefore researchers cannot obtain a complete description of the depth of a large check dam it is necessary to develop a convenient method to reveal the true dam depth and accurately calculate the sediment volume due to its convenience low time requirement and high resolution electrical resistivity tomography ert has been widely used in various engineering environmental and mining studies baines et al 2002 ritz et al 1999 for example for soil layer heterogeneity characterization with 2 d fukue et al 1999 besson et al 2004 and 3 d imaging techniques bourennane et al 1998 chambers et al 2012 hsu et al 2010 used electrical resistivity imaging to accurately detect sediment deposits along the peikang river chambers et al 2012 showed that ert provides a quick method to quantify the sediment filling volume across large sites with a high degree of precision in the present study ert imaging is used to investigate sediment deposits behind check dams on the loess plateau china the specific aims of this study are 1 to quantitatively assess a simple approach to detect the depth of check dam fill deposit sediments using the ert technique and 2 to calculate the sediment yield of small catchments based on the sediment volume estimation to achieve these aims six check dams with different characteristics were selected in the hilly and gully area of the loess plateau field work included creating deep trenches boreholes and manual drillings for calibrating the ert results 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area and field work we conducted field experiments at six catchments in the hilly and gully area of the loess plateau among all the catchments the hujiawan hjw shayangou syg and nianyangou nyg catchments were studied for calibrating the proposed detection method while the other catchments the lijiata ljt lannigou lng and nianzigou nzg catchments were selected for applying this method fig 1 and table 1 the check dams are mostly upper stream check dams the climate of the study area is semiarid continental with an average annual precipitation that varies between 420 and 510 mm precipitation occurs mainly from june to september in the form of high intensity storms the studied catchment areas vary from 0 13 to 27 02 km2 the loess soil depth is approximately 80 120 m in this area liu et al 1994 the soil can be divided into the malan loess lishi loess and wucheng loess the pleistocene wucheng loess at the bottom of the soil profile is also called old loess it has a tight structure and is very resistant to erosion the new world q4 secondary loess at the surface ranges from fine silt to silt and is vulnerable to erosion check dams are usually built across gullies on bedrock or the base of the wucheng loess a high precision global positioning system gps and quickbird imagery were used to obtain topographic maps scale 1 10 000 of the catchments the ert method was calibrated using data from trenches boreholes and drillings in the hjw syg and nyg catchments in both the hjw and syg catchments the trenches were explored using an excavator boreholes were explored in both the syg and nyg catchments in the other catchments at least one manual drilling for each check dam was explored fig 2 bulk soil density bd g cm 3 samples were collected from the trenches of hjw and syg the samples were collected from the top to the bottom of the trenches 2 2 high density electrical resistivity tomography high density ert requires many observations we employed a duk 2b high density electrical resistivity system chongqing geological instrument factory china we used 60 electrodes spaced at different intervals to create survey lines varying from 60 to 295 m long fig 3 a total of 11 lines were arranged in the six studied catchments table 2 the lines at syg nyg and nzg were arranged parallel to each other but perpendicular to the other nine lines wenner configurations alpha were adopted according to the experiments of hauck et al 2003 electrodes a and b are power poles with an electric current i the electrical resistivity was calculated through the difference in voltage value δu between electrodes m and n as described by eq 1 1 ρ k δ u i in which ρ is electrical resistivity and k is a coefficient related to the electrode configurations the resistivity of fluvial sediment is mainly dominated by the porosity and water saturation of its pore spaces hsu et al 2010 sediments deposited behind a check dam exhibit sedimentary sequences of flood couplets the coarse sediment is always below the fine sediment in a couplet a couplet can vary from a few centimeters to several decimeters or even meters chen et al 2016 in addition sediment delivery triggered by soil erosion exhibits size selectivity wang et al 2014 the resistivity data sets were processed using geogiga rimager 5 02 geogiga technology corp canada to check the noise i 0 01 a and then the data were inverted to images using the software package res2dinv loke and barker 1995 res2dinv rebuilt the tomographic image using a smoothness constrained least squares method the deposit sediment is expected to have a different resistivity than that of the channel bottom electrons are discharged in the deposited sediment and recharged in the bedload causing abrupt changes in the inverted image data hsu et al 2010 used a laplacian operator method to detect an abrupt change corresponding to laplacian zero lines in the present study the rebuilt tomographic image data were reprocessed using a contour method to differentiate the layered structures the lines of abrupt change corresponding to possible bottom boundaries were then extracted this step was processed using originpro 9 software originlab corporation northampton usa irregular sediment volumes behind check dams were reconstructed using arcmap 10 0 esri inc usa and autocad 2014 autodesk inc usa the ert method was then calibrated using the results of the field work we calculated the differences between the results of the ert method and field trench borehole or drilling method at hjw nyg and syg respectively the percent bias pbias which is expressed as eq 2 was used to describe the differences 2 pbias i 1 n x i y i x i n 100 where yi is the value of the ert depth and xi is the depth obtained from the trench borehole or drilling method which provided the real values 2 3 sediment estimation once the lithological boundaries are determined several methods may be used to estimate sediment volume v m3 ramos diez et al 2016 several geometric methods e g using a prism castillo et al 2007 a pyramid romero díaz et al 2007 or trapezoids bellin et al 2011 have been used at small check dams to calculate the dam volume we employed three of the most common dam shapes on the loess plateau v shaped u shaped and trapezoidal to calculate the volume of the sediment trapped by the studied check dams we used arcgis 3d and autocad to calculate the real volume for a quick estimation method we consider v shaped dams as triangular prisms we divided u shaped sediment into two parts including a cuboid above and a semicylinder below and consider trapezoidal dam land as prismoid we evaluated the prediction capability of each geometric method with respect to the real volume of sediment estimated using the field survey method we use the pbias coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ens values to evaluate the performance of each geometric method these metrics are expressed as follows 3 ens 1 i 1 n f i g i 2 i 1 n f i f ave 2 4 pbias i 1 n f i g i f i n 100 5 r 2 i 1 n f i f ave g i g ave 1 n f i f ave 2 0 5 1 n g i g ave 2 0 5 2 where fi is the volume calculated by the field survey method fave is the mean of the survey values gi is the volume calculated by the geometric methods and gave is the mean of the survey values the sediment yield of the corresponding catchments were determined using the following equation 6 sy 100 i 1 n v i bd i te where sy is the sediment yield t vi is the volume of sediment at a given depth and bdi is the dry bulk density of the sediment deposit at the given depth g cm 3 at the hjw and syg catchments bdi was obtained from the trench samples while for the other four catchments bdi was derived from the relationship between bd and depth te is the sediment trap efficiency of the check dam percent determined by the proportion of fluvial sediment that is deposited in the check dam in this study we used the empirical equation of brown and jarvis 1943 to estimate te which is described by eq 4 7 te 100 1 1 1 0 0021 d c a where c is the storage capacity of the check dam m3 a is the catchment area km2 and d is the empirical parameter that depends on the characteristics of the reservoir based on the studies of verstraeten and poesen 2000 and bellin et al 2011 we used a d value of 1 in this study the area specific sediment yield ssy t km 2 a 1 was then calculated as follows 8 ssy sy a y e where a is the catchment area and ye is the sediment silt year see table 1 3 results 3 1 electrical resistivity imaging and sediment bottom detection following the approach of loke et al 2003 and chambers et al 2012 a least squares method was used to simulate a model that is consistent with the measured data to reduce the discrepancy between the simulated model and observed data iterative programs were used to produce a geologically realistic model of the inverted image fig 4 shows the inversion of the electrical resistivity at survey lines 1 to 11 across the six check dams due to differences in topography sediment couplets and hydraulic conditions the electrical resistivities show large variances among the check dams generally most upper layers exhibited resistivities 50 ohm m except for line 4 and line 5 at nyg which were between 50 and 100 ohm m notably lines 1 and 2 were recorded in april 2017 before the planting season while the other nine lines were recorded in november after the harvest thus a comparison of line 2 and line 3 shows seasonal changes integrated and continuous layered structures were found in all 11 inverted images we anticipate that the interface between the sediment and channel bottom coincides with one of the lines of change in the inverted images following hsu et al 2010 and chambers et al 2012 we searched for abrupt vertical changes in the resistivity data fig 4 shows that all 11 images have well layered structures we used field surveys to locate the electrical boundary at the hjw syg and nyg catchments at the hjw check dam one trench and three drillings were used to calibrate the boundary of the check dam determined by ert two boreholes were used to calibrate the sediment bottom at the syg and nyg catchments the results show that abrupt changes in increasing electrical resistance coincided with the dam bottom at hjw at the nyg and syg catchments however the channel bottom has a lower electric signal than that of the upper sediment layer the results from these three check dams show that the channel bottom always coincides with an abrupt change in electrical resistivity however the change can be exhibited as either a decrease or an increase meaning that the electrical resistivity of the upper sediment can be either higher or lower than that of the channel bottom as schematically represented in fig 5 the difference in the results between the ert and field survey methods varies from 1 7 to 7 3 with an average pbias of 4 3 the electrode arrangement and field survey information from all six check dams are given in table 2 manual drillings were used to check the boundaries of the channel bottom depth however drilling at the lng check dam failed to provide information because the channel bottom depth of the dam is deeper than the drilling thus the ert bottom boundary at the lng check dam is inferred based on the results of the other five check dams 3 2 sediment volume and mass estimation fig 6 shows all the boundaries determined by the ert method and calibrated by the field data except for line 11 which was inferred at lng the depth of the check dams vary considerably the ljt check dam is the shallowest dam the average depths from lines 6 and 7 are 2 4 and 2 7 m respectively the ljt check dam controlled a small drainage area of 0 31 km2 and the silt years were from 2012 to 2017 when the grain for green project had been implemented for more than 10 years line 11 at lng shows the deepest depth with an average depth of 27 5 m trenches were explored using an excavator machine in the hjw and syg catchments at the hjw dam we collected bd samples from the top to the bottom of the trench the bd of hjw varied from 1 36 to 1 60 g cm 3 while the bd of syg varied from 1 32 to 1 60 g cm 3 both bd trends increased from the top to the bottom of these check dams for the syg dam we collected bd samples in the top 10 m because mud prevented the excavation of a deeper trench we use the average value of the bottom five samples to represent the bd of depths greater than 10 m in syg and of depths greater than 12 7 m in hjw these averages are 1 53 and 1 56 g cm 3 for the syg and hjw respectively for the depths of the other four check dams we used the relationship between bd and depth de at hjw and syg to generate a predictive equation which can be expressed as follows 9 bd 0 0155 d e 1 39 r 2 0 57 d 12 7 m when de 12 7 we consider bd equal to 1 56 g cm 3 the fluctuation of bd can be attributed to the grain size pore space and water saturation difference of each sediment couplet chen et al 2017 in the trench profile of the hjw check dam the sediment water content increases with depth this relationship can be expressed as follows 10 wc 0 0002 d e 0 0767 n 20 r 2 0 85 where wc is the water content of the sediment samples and de is the depth fig 7 shows the cross sectional shapes of the six check dams the dam body profiles can be grouped into three categories v shaped trapezoidal and u shaped the sediment volumes were calculated as 631421 327600 223960 31043 2189 and 378754 m3 for hjw nzg syg nyg ljt and lng respectively to provide a quick and convenient estimate of the sediment volume we used geometric methods ramos diez et al 2016 to estimate the sediment volume in each dam and then compared the differences between the geometric methods and field survey results for the geometric methods we need only three parameters which are top width sediment surface at the check dam body bottom width and the vertical height of the dam the criteria for examining the accuracy of the geometric estimation are shown in table 3 the overall performance of the v shaped estimation is the best as evidenced by pbias r2 and ens values of 15 0 988 and 0 973 respectively the trapezoidal estimation is acceptable while the u shaped estimation is poor based on the bd and sediment volume the total sediment yields were calculated at every depth interval the total sediment yields were estimated to be 947131 484848 335940 5633 3109 and 575706 t for hjw nzg syg nyg ljt and lng respectively fig 8 the ssy values for the six check dams were then calculated as 2337 3061 8542 8451 3109 and 7625 t km 2 a 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 trapped sediment estimation by applying the ert technique we estimate the boundary between the sediment and underlying subface using inverted images the trench borehole and drilling data confirm the high accuracy of the ert methods fig 4 the boundary determination with this method is more complicated than that described in the studies of hsu et al 2010 and chambers et al 2012 the landform of the study area is fragile and complicated causing the channel bottom to have a very complicated shape for example several slopes extended below the sediment at deeper deposit depths in the nyg catchment our results show that the contour method can identify a surface of change that coincides with the bottom of a check dam in an inverted electrical resistivity image the existing studies of sediment volume evaluation were mainly conducted in europe e g castillo et al 2007 ramos diez et al 2017a b compared several methods of evaluating the volumes of 25 check dams and found significant differences among these methods geometric prism and pyramid topographic digital terrain models trapezoids and section methods the abovementioned studies are the most detailed descriptions of sediment volume estimation of check dams however check dams in europe are very different from those on the loess plateau of china due to severe soil erosion the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in this study is three to four times greater than that of the check dams studied by ramos diez et al 2017a b existing studies usually use one profile or a limited number of boreholes to estimate sediment volume and sediment surveying is limited to the surface layer e g 0 2 m wang et al 2007a b 0 6 m bao et al 2005 and 1 m sun and guo 2011 the bd values of the surface sediment vary from 1 32 to 1 45 g cm 3 li et al 2007 sun et al 2004 wei et al 2006 wang et al 2008 in the existing studies here we obtained bd samples from two deep trench profiles based on the relationship between bd and depth we suggest that a bd of 1 5 g cm 3 is more appropriate when the sediment deposit is deeper than 7 m the ssy values of 8542 8451 7625 t km 2 a 1 were calculated for the syg nyg and lng catchments and those of 3061 2337 3109 t km 2 a 1 were calculated for the nzg hjw and ljt catchments respectively the primary difference was mainly caused by the different silt periods of the check dams and intensities of the local agricultural activities during the 1960s to 1990s nearly all the slopes in syg nyg and lng were used for farming and the agricultural activity in these catchments was very intense since 1999 after the implementation of the grain for green project in the hilly loess region soil erosion reduced greatly because many croplands were converted to grass or forest wang and shi 2015 chen et al 2007 fu et al 2011 farmland with slopes 25 was restored due to the grain for green project through which farmers received subsidies from the government and restored farmland with those steep slopes fang et al 2016 the ljt catchment shows low ssy results because the vegetation cover was healthy during its silt period 2012 2017 therefore the main sediment source was gully erosion the hjw catchment is the largest of the six studied catchments and shows the lowest syy which we attribute to the large area of forestland 62 3 4 2 quick estimation method for a quick estimation of the silt sediment of a check dam four steps are recommended i using the ert method to obtain an inverted electrical resistivity image ii using at least one drilling to calibrate the line of abrupt change as the boundary of the sediment iii using an appropriate geometric method to estimate the sediment volume and iv determining empirical bds based on the dam depth to calculate sy and ssy in this study the results show v shaped got good accuracy however an appropriate geometric method should consider the real shape of the objective check dam check dams are a widespread soil and water conservation measure in areas where gully development is a problem frankl et al 2011 in addition to the clp check dams are constructed in ethiopia nyssen et al 2009 italy bombino et al 2006 the us norman et al 2016 spain romero díaz et al 2012 and iran hassanli et al 2009 the significant difference between check dams on the clp and those in the other areas is their capacity most check dams on the clp have capacities 10 000 m3 and thousands 500 000 m3 while check dams in other areas are typically small barriers constructed in shallow rivers and streams for harvesting water and controlling erosion balooni et al 2008 previous studies have demonstrated the convenience and precision of applying the ert method to shallow sediment hsu et al 2010 chambers et al 2012 we are confident that our estimation method can be applied to other areas where check dams are constructed in this study the ert method with 60 electrodes resulted in 16 resistivity layers fig 3 the depth of investigation is directly proportional to the length of the arranged electrode lines the triangle shaped inverted image has data missing from both ends in the horizontal direction although the ert method allows the arrangement of electrodes to extended the studied check dam area the steep slope of the gullies make the depth adjustment very difficult thus this method is suitable for deep sediment deposits with large surface areas when this method is applied to a new check dam we recommend that the arrange survey lines be as long as practicable 295 m ert with 3 d images has been used to successfully detect sediment deposits e g chambers et al 2012 however we do not recommend this 3 d technique for check dams on the loess plateau the large surface areas and deep depths of the deposits will require many more electrodes than are used to create a 2 d image therefore the 3 d method is more laborious and time consuming 5 conclusions in this study the ert method was used to detect the boundary of sediment deposits and channel bottoms behind six check dams on the loess plateau china the resistivity data were inverted into subsurface electrical structures using least squares inversion techniques layered structures were observed in all the resistivity images lithological boundaries can be identified in the inverted resistivity image using a contour method the field surveys showed that the ert method can accurately detect the depth of the sediment however at least one drilling or trench or borehole is recommended for calibration overall this study provides a quick and inexpensive method to estimate the sediment volume of check dams in the loess plateau with high accuracy while check dams are widespread on the loess plateau retention check dams have been built in gullies badlands creeks streams and rivers in several other parts of the world thus the ert methods described in this study can also be used as a

6863,check dams are very important structures for torrent control areas throughout the world measuring the sediment deposition behind check dams is thought to be an effective method of estimating the sediment yield of small catchments in this study we employed a high density electrical resistivity system to detect sediment at six check dams distributed in the hilly and gully area of the loess plateau a total of 11 lines were arranged with 60 electrodes along each line the resultant resistivity data were inverted into subsurface structures using least squares inversion techniques the results indicate that the sediment bottom can been identified using an electrical resistivity contour method using trenches boreholes and drillings to calibrate the calculated values the accuracy of the high density electrical resistivity tomography method was found to be quite high 95 7 the bulk density increases with the sediment deposit depth and can reach a maximum of 1 6 g cm 3 geometric methods considering three shapes v shaped u shaped and trapezoidal were used to estimate the profile area of the check dams the v shaped geometric method showed high accuracy this study provides a four step approach based on high density electrical resistivity tomography and a geometric method to estimate sediment yield for check dam controlled catchments this methodology enables the measurement of the total sediment yield including both the suspended and bedload sediment transport from an ungauged catchment keywords small catchment loess plateau soil erosion sediment deposition sediment volume estimation 1 introduction check dams are one of humanity s earliest constructions leigh et al 2013 the building of check dams has been one of the most commonly utilized structural measures for channel stabilization and erosion control in catchments that experience torrents garcia and mario 2010 romero díaz et al 2012 in addition in arid and semiarid regions check dams can make land less susceptible to erosion and can help restore eroded land to its former condition doolittle 2013 measuring sediment deposition behind check dams is thought to be an effective method of calculating sediment yield verstraeten and poesen 2002 compared to simultaneous measurement at the plot scale and the creation of sediment rating curves at the large river scale measuring sediment trapped by check dams provides useful information at the small catchment scale plotting the observation data is problematic for large watersheds and station gauge data provides sediment yield curves which more closely reflect the suspended sediment rather than the total sediment yield in addition performing soil erosion observations is a time consuming and resource intensive process cerdan et al 2010 fang et al 2017 however using a check dam based methodology allows measurement of the total sediment yield including both the suspended and bedload sediment transport from an ungauged catchment soil erosion leads to widespread land degradation and many other environmental problems fang et al 2017 the chinese loess plateau clp is one of the global hotspots of soil erosion due to its combination of unique soil properties and considerable human pressures wang et al 2007a b on the loess plateau an approximately 2 5 105 km2 area is subject to extremely severe erosion and has a yearly soil erosion modulus greater than 5000 t km 2 fu et al 2011 this area is mainly distributed in the hilly and gully loess area chen et al 2007 to mitigate soil erosion and improve land productivity the construction of check dams has been widely implemented since the 1960s most of the check dams constructed before the 1980s were without flood discharge facilities or spillways according to the yellow river conservancy commission there were 31 797 check dams constructed in the cities of yulin and yan an hilly area of the clp during 1950 to 1989 among those check dams 83 had no spillway as a result these dams had low flood prevention ability and could easily be destroyed by floods in 1986 the key dams project was implemented on the clp this project aimed to construct check dams with large capacity and high quality by 2013 a total of 58 446 check dams providing more than 10 000 m3 of storage had been constructed and remained intact the resultant sediment silting was estimated to be approximately 5 7 billionm3 cmwr 2014 however this number was lower than previous records cmwr 2003 and most old dams constructed before 1980 were no included wang et al 2011 reported that more than 11 104 checked dams had been constructed and captured approximately 21 109 m3 sediment on the clp as of 2003 it is not clear how many check dams currently exist on the clp many studies e g fu et al 2011 wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017a b have reported that the sediment load of yellow river decreased from 1 34 gt yr 1 during 1950 1979 to 0 32 gt yr 1 during 2000 2010 mainly due to construction of check dams and ecological restoration projects on the clp however exact estimations of the sediment trapped by check dam are scare detailed records on the topography of the channel bed and trapped sediment area available for key check dam with capacity 5 105 m3 funded by the central government see supplementary information however no sediment volume information is available for the considerable number of smaller dams constructed by local farmers due to the semiarid climate of the loess plateau these check dams usually hold no surface water making experiments more convenient to conduct the sediment deposited behind check dams exhibits a distinct sedimentary sequence related to each flood with the thickness of each couplet varying from a few centimeters to several decimeters chen et al 2016 wang et al 2017 and provides deep insights into the long term sediment deposition process in the catchment ecosystems chen et al 2017 the studies conducted on check dams include research on the particle size redistributed by soil erosion vaez et al 2017 carbon sequestration opportunities lü et al 2012 ran et al 2014 the fingerprint method used to calculate sediment sources chen et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and soil erosion modeling grum et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b earlier studies estimated sediment volume and mass by using one profile or several drillings to represent the whole check dam for example wei et al 2017 used ten drilling holes from three check dams to estimate their retained sediment li et al 2016 use one profile per check dam to correlate the sedimentation of three check dams with the rainstorm characteristics on the loess plateau this method was also used by zhao et al 2017a b and wang et al 2017 excavating sediment profiles and drilling are laborious costly and time consuming tasks therefore researchers cannot obtain a complete description of the depth of a large check dam it is necessary to develop a convenient method to reveal the true dam depth and accurately calculate the sediment volume due to its convenience low time requirement and high resolution electrical resistivity tomography ert has been widely used in various engineering environmental and mining studies baines et al 2002 ritz et al 1999 for example for soil layer heterogeneity characterization with 2 d fukue et al 1999 besson et al 2004 and 3 d imaging techniques bourennane et al 1998 chambers et al 2012 hsu et al 2010 used electrical resistivity imaging to accurately detect sediment deposits along the peikang river chambers et al 2012 showed that ert provides a quick method to quantify the sediment filling volume across large sites with a high degree of precision in the present study ert imaging is used to investigate sediment deposits behind check dams on the loess plateau china the specific aims of this study are 1 to quantitatively assess a simple approach to detect the depth of check dam fill deposit sediments using the ert technique and 2 to calculate the sediment yield of small catchments based on the sediment volume estimation to achieve these aims six check dams with different characteristics were selected in the hilly and gully area of the loess plateau field work included creating deep trenches boreholes and manual drillings for calibrating the ert results 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area and field work we conducted field experiments at six catchments in the hilly and gully area of the loess plateau among all the catchments the hujiawan hjw shayangou syg and nianyangou nyg catchments were studied for calibrating the proposed detection method while the other catchments the lijiata ljt lannigou lng and nianzigou nzg catchments were selected for applying this method fig 1 and table 1 the check dams are mostly upper stream check dams the climate of the study area is semiarid continental with an average annual precipitation that varies between 420 and 510 mm precipitation occurs mainly from june to september in the form of high intensity storms the studied catchment areas vary from 0 13 to 27 02 km2 the loess soil depth is approximately 80 120 m in this area liu et al 1994 the soil can be divided into the malan loess lishi loess and wucheng loess the pleistocene wucheng loess at the bottom of the soil profile is also called old loess it has a tight structure and is very resistant to erosion the new world q4 secondary loess at the surface ranges from fine silt to silt and is vulnerable to erosion check dams are usually built across gullies on bedrock or the base of the wucheng loess a high precision global positioning system gps and quickbird imagery were used to obtain topographic maps scale 1 10 000 of the catchments the ert method was calibrated using data from trenches boreholes and drillings in the hjw syg and nyg catchments in both the hjw and syg catchments the trenches were explored using an excavator boreholes were explored in both the syg and nyg catchments in the other catchments at least one manual drilling for each check dam was explored fig 2 bulk soil density bd g cm 3 samples were collected from the trenches of hjw and syg the samples were collected from the top to the bottom of the trenches 2 2 high density electrical resistivity tomography high density ert requires many observations we employed a duk 2b high density electrical resistivity system chongqing geological instrument factory china we used 60 electrodes spaced at different intervals to create survey lines varying from 60 to 295 m long fig 3 a total of 11 lines were arranged in the six studied catchments table 2 the lines at syg nyg and nzg were arranged parallel to each other but perpendicular to the other nine lines wenner configurations alpha were adopted according to the experiments of hauck et al 2003 electrodes a and b are power poles with an electric current i the electrical resistivity was calculated through the difference in voltage value δu between electrodes m and n as described by eq 1 1 ρ k δ u i in which ρ is electrical resistivity and k is a coefficient related to the electrode configurations the resistivity of fluvial sediment is mainly dominated by the porosity and water saturation of its pore spaces hsu et al 2010 sediments deposited behind a check dam exhibit sedimentary sequences of flood couplets the coarse sediment is always below the fine sediment in a couplet a couplet can vary from a few centimeters to several decimeters or even meters chen et al 2016 in addition sediment delivery triggered by soil erosion exhibits size selectivity wang et al 2014 the resistivity data sets were processed using geogiga rimager 5 02 geogiga technology corp canada to check the noise i 0 01 a and then the data were inverted to images using the software package res2dinv loke and barker 1995 res2dinv rebuilt the tomographic image using a smoothness constrained least squares method the deposit sediment is expected to have a different resistivity than that of the channel bottom electrons are discharged in the deposited sediment and recharged in the bedload causing abrupt changes in the inverted image data hsu et al 2010 used a laplacian operator method to detect an abrupt change corresponding to laplacian zero lines in the present study the rebuilt tomographic image data were reprocessed using a contour method to differentiate the layered structures the lines of abrupt change corresponding to possible bottom boundaries were then extracted this step was processed using originpro 9 software originlab corporation northampton usa irregular sediment volumes behind check dams were reconstructed using arcmap 10 0 esri inc usa and autocad 2014 autodesk inc usa the ert method was then calibrated using the results of the field work we calculated the differences between the results of the ert method and field trench borehole or drilling method at hjw nyg and syg respectively the percent bias pbias which is expressed as eq 2 was used to describe the differences 2 pbias i 1 n x i y i x i n 100 where yi is the value of the ert depth and xi is the depth obtained from the trench borehole or drilling method which provided the real values 2 3 sediment estimation once the lithological boundaries are determined several methods may be used to estimate sediment volume v m3 ramos diez et al 2016 several geometric methods e g using a prism castillo et al 2007 a pyramid romero díaz et al 2007 or trapezoids bellin et al 2011 have been used at small check dams to calculate the dam volume we employed three of the most common dam shapes on the loess plateau v shaped u shaped and trapezoidal to calculate the volume of the sediment trapped by the studied check dams we used arcgis 3d and autocad to calculate the real volume for a quick estimation method we consider v shaped dams as triangular prisms we divided u shaped sediment into two parts including a cuboid above and a semicylinder below and consider trapezoidal dam land as prismoid we evaluated the prediction capability of each geometric method with respect to the real volume of sediment estimated using the field survey method we use the pbias coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ens values to evaluate the performance of each geometric method these metrics are expressed as follows 3 ens 1 i 1 n f i g i 2 i 1 n f i f ave 2 4 pbias i 1 n f i g i f i n 100 5 r 2 i 1 n f i f ave g i g ave 1 n f i f ave 2 0 5 1 n g i g ave 2 0 5 2 where fi is the volume calculated by the field survey method fave is the mean of the survey values gi is the volume calculated by the geometric methods and gave is the mean of the survey values the sediment yield of the corresponding catchments were determined using the following equation 6 sy 100 i 1 n v i bd i te where sy is the sediment yield t vi is the volume of sediment at a given depth and bdi is the dry bulk density of the sediment deposit at the given depth g cm 3 at the hjw and syg catchments bdi was obtained from the trench samples while for the other four catchments bdi was derived from the relationship between bd and depth te is the sediment trap efficiency of the check dam percent determined by the proportion of fluvial sediment that is deposited in the check dam in this study we used the empirical equation of brown and jarvis 1943 to estimate te which is described by eq 4 7 te 100 1 1 1 0 0021 d c a where c is the storage capacity of the check dam m3 a is the catchment area km2 and d is the empirical parameter that depends on the characteristics of the reservoir based on the studies of verstraeten and poesen 2000 and bellin et al 2011 we used a d value of 1 in this study the area specific sediment yield ssy t km 2 a 1 was then calculated as follows 8 ssy sy a y e where a is the catchment area and ye is the sediment silt year see table 1 3 results 3 1 electrical resistivity imaging and sediment bottom detection following the approach of loke et al 2003 and chambers et al 2012 a least squares method was used to simulate a model that is consistent with the measured data to reduce the discrepancy between the simulated model and observed data iterative programs were used to produce a geologically realistic model of the inverted image fig 4 shows the inversion of the electrical resistivity at survey lines 1 to 11 across the six check dams due to differences in topography sediment couplets and hydraulic conditions the electrical resistivities show large variances among the check dams generally most upper layers exhibited resistivities 50 ohm m except for line 4 and line 5 at nyg which were between 50 and 100 ohm m notably lines 1 and 2 were recorded in april 2017 before the planting season while the other nine lines were recorded in november after the harvest thus a comparison of line 2 and line 3 shows seasonal changes integrated and continuous layered structures were found in all 11 inverted images we anticipate that the interface between the sediment and channel bottom coincides with one of the lines of change in the inverted images following hsu et al 2010 and chambers et al 2012 we searched for abrupt vertical changes in the resistivity data fig 4 shows that all 11 images have well layered structures we used field surveys to locate the electrical boundary at the hjw syg and nyg catchments at the hjw check dam one trench and three drillings were used to calibrate the boundary of the check dam determined by ert two boreholes were used to calibrate the sediment bottom at the syg and nyg catchments the results show that abrupt changes in increasing electrical resistance coincided with the dam bottom at hjw at the nyg and syg catchments however the channel bottom has a lower electric signal than that of the upper sediment layer the results from these three check dams show that the channel bottom always coincides with an abrupt change in electrical resistivity however the change can be exhibited as either a decrease or an increase meaning that the electrical resistivity of the upper sediment can be either higher or lower than that of the channel bottom as schematically represented in fig 5 the difference in the results between the ert and field survey methods varies from 1 7 to 7 3 with an average pbias of 4 3 the electrode arrangement and field survey information from all six check dams are given in table 2 manual drillings were used to check the boundaries of the channel bottom depth however drilling at the lng check dam failed to provide information because the channel bottom depth of the dam is deeper than the drilling thus the ert bottom boundary at the lng check dam is inferred based on the results of the other five check dams 3 2 sediment volume and mass estimation fig 6 shows all the boundaries determined by the ert method and calibrated by the field data except for line 11 which was inferred at lng the depth of the check dams vary considerably the ljt check dam is the shallowest dam the average depths from lines 6 and 7 are 2 4 and 2 7 m respectively the ljt check dam controlled a small drainage area of 0 31 km2 and the silt years were from 2012 to 2017 when the grain for green project had been implemented for more than 10 years line 11 at lng shows the deepest depth with an average depth of 27 5 m trenches were explored using an excavator machine in the hjw and syg catchments at the hjw dam we collected bd samples from the top to the bottom of the trench the bd of hjw varied from 1 36 to 1 60 g cm 3 while the bd of syg varied from 1 32 to 1 60 g cm 3 both bd trends increased from the top to the bottom of these check dams for the syg dam we collected bd samples in the top 10 m because mud prevented the excavation of a deeper trench we use the average value of the bottom five samples to represent the bd of depths greater than 10 m in syg and of depths greater than 12 7 m in hjw these averages are 1 53 and 1 56 g cm 3 for the syg and hjw respectively for the depths of the other four check dams we used the relationship between bd and depth de at hjw and syg to generate a predictive equation which can be expressed as follows 9 bd 0 0155 d e 1 39 r 2 0 57 d 12 7 m when de 12 7 we consider bd equal to 1 56 g cm 3 the fluctuation of bd can be attributed to the grain size pore space and water saturation difference of each sediment couplet chen et al 2017 in the trench profile of the hjw check dam the sediment water content increases with depth this relationship can be expressed as follows 10 wc 0 0002 d e 0 0767 n 20 r 2 0 85 where wc is the water content of the sediment samples and de is the depth fig 7 shows the cross sectional shapes of the six check dams the dam body profiles can be grouped into three categories v shaped trapezoidal and u shaped the sediment volumes were calculated as 631421 327600 223960 31043 2189 and 378754 m3 for hjw nzg syg nyg ljt and lng respectively to provide a quick and convenient estimate of the sediment volume we used geometric methods ramos diez et al 2016 to estimate the sediment volume in each dam and then compared the differences between the geometric methods and field survey results for the geometric methods we need only three parameters which are top width sediment surface at the check dam body bottom width and the vertical height of the dam the criteria for examining the accuracy of the geometric estimation are shown in table 3 the overall performance of the v shaped estimation is the best as evidenced by pbias r2 and ens values of 15 0 988 and 0 973 respectively the trapezoidal estimation is acceptable while the u shaped estimation is poor based on the bd and sediment volume the total sediment yields were calculated at every depth interval the total sediment yields were estimated to be 947131 484848 335940 5633 3109 and 575706 t for hjw nzg syg nyg ljt and lng respectively fig 8 the ssy values for the six check dams were then calculated as 2337 3061 8542 8451 3109 and 7625 t km 2 a 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 trapped sediment estimation by applying the ert technique we estimate the boundary between the sediment and underlying subface using inverted images the trench borehole and drilling data confirm the high accuracy of the ert methods fig 4 the boundary determination with this method is more complicated than that described in the studies of hsu et al 2010 and chambers et al 2012 the landform of the study area is fragile and complicated causing the channel bottom to have a very complicated shape for example several slopes extended below the sediment at deeper deposit depths in the nyg catchment our results show that the contour method can identify a surface of change that coincides with the bottom of a check dam in an inverted electrical resistivity image the existing studies of sediment volume evaluation were mainly conducted in europe e g castillo et al 2007 ramos diez et al 2017a b compared several methods of evaluating the volumes of 25 check dams and found significant differences among these methods geometric prism and pyramid topographic digital terrain models trapezoids and section methods the abovementioned studies are the most detailed descriptions of sediment volume estimation of check dams however check dams in europe are very different from those on the loess plateau of china due to severe soil erosion the volume of sediment deposited behind check dams in this study is three to four times greater than that of the check dams studied by ramos diez et al 2017a b existing studies usually use one profile or a limited number of boreholes to estimate sediment volume and sediment surveying is limited to the surface layer e g 0 2 m wang et al 2007a b 0 6 m bao et al 2005 and 1 m sun and guo 2011 the bd values of the surface sediment vary from 1 32 to 1 45 g cm 3 li et al 2007 sun et al 2004 wei et al 2006 wang et al 2008 in the existing studies here we obtained bd samples from two deep trench profiles based on the relationship between bd and depth we suggest that a bd of 1 5 g cm 3 is more appropriate when the sediment deposit is deeper than 7 m the ssy values of 8542 8451 7625 t km 2 a 1 were calculated for the syg nyg and lng catchments and those of 3061 2337 3109 t km 2 a 1 were calculated for the nzg hjw and ljt catchments respectively the primary difference was mainly caused by the different silt periods of the check dams and intensities of the local agricultural activities during the 1960s to 1990s nearly all the slopes in syg nyg and lng were used for farming and the agricultural activity in these catchments was very intense since 1999 after the implementation of the grain for green project in the hilly loess region soil erosion reduced greatly because many croplands were converted to grass or forest wang and shi 2015 chen et al 2007 fu et al 2011 farmland with slopes 25 was restored due to the grain for green project through which farmers received subsidies from the government and restored farmland with those steep slopes fang et al 2016 the ljt catchment shows low ssy results because the vegetation cover was healthy during its silt period 2012 2017 therefore the main sediment source was gully erosion the hjw catchment is the largest of the six studied catchments and shows the lowest syy which we attribute to the large area of forestland 62 3 4 2 quick estimation method for a quick estimation of the silt sediment of a check dam four steps are recommended i using the ert method to obtain an inverted electrical resistivity image ii using at least one drilling to calibrate the line of abrupt change as the boundary of the sediment iii using an appropriate geometric method to estimate the sediment volume and iv determining empirical bds based on the dam depth to calculate sy and ssy in this study the results show v shaped got good accuracy however an appropriate geometric method should consider the real shape of the objective check dam check dams are a widespread soil and water conservation measure in areas where gully development is a problem frankl et al 2011 in addition to the clp check dams are constructed in ethiopia nyssen et al 2009 italy bombino et al 2006 the us norman et al 2016 spain romero díaz et al 2012 and iran hassanli et al 2009 the significant difference between check dams on the clp and those in the other areas is their capacity most check dams on the clp have capacities 10 000 m3 and thousands 500 000 m3 while check dams in other areas are typically small barriers constructed in shallow rivers and streams for harvesting water and controlling erosion balooni et al 2008 previous studies have demonstrated the convenience and precision of applying the ert method to shallow sediment hsu et al 2010 chambers et al 2012 we are confident that our estimation method can be applied to other areas where check dams are constructed in this study the ert method with 60 electrodes resulted in 16 resistivity layers fig 3 the depth of investigation is directly proportional to the length of the arranged electrode lines the triangle shaped inverted image has data missing from both ends in the horizontal direction although the ert method allows the arrangement of electrodes to extended the studied check dam area the steep slope of the gullies make the depth adjustment very difficult thus this method is suitable for deep sediment deposits with large surface areas when this method is applied to a new check dam we recommend that the arrange survey lines be as long as practicable 295 m ert with 3 d images has been used to successfully detect sediment deposits e g chambers et al 2012 however we do not recommend this 3 d technique for check dams on the loess plateau the large surface areas and deep depths of the deposits will require many more electrodes than are used to create a 2 d image therefore the 3 d method is more laborious and time consuming 5 conclusions in this study the ert method was used to detect the boundary of sediment deposits and channel bottoms behind six check dams on the loess plateau china the resistivity data were inverted into subsurface electrical structures using least squares inversion techniques layered structures were observed in all the resistivity images lithological boundaries can be identified in the inverted resistivity image using a contour method the field surveys showed that the ert method can accurately detect the depth of the sediment however at least one drilling or trench or borehole is recommended for calibration overall this study provides a quick and inexpensive method to estimate the sediment volume of check dams in the loess plateau with high accuracy while check dams are widespread on the loess plateau retention check dams have been built in gullies badlands creeks streams and rivers in several other parts of the world thus the ert methods described in this study can also be used as a

6864,this paper presents a model of flow and solute transport of intermittent catchments in arid and semi arid regions highlighting challenges caused by the complex interactions between subsurface and surface flows a case study is used for the application of the integrated mike she model to investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of water and salinity in a small ephemeral catchment in southwestern victoria australia mike she was successfully calibrated and validated against experimental data of streamflow groundwater levels and salt discharged from the catchment projections of climatic conditions adopting representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 were used to infer how salinity discharge and concentrations might be affected across a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios with different severity the calibration of the water fluxes was solely based on parameters associated with the model of evapotranspiration with other parameters selected from field observations and literature the calibrated parameters for the salt transport were the longitudinal and lateral dispersivities the calibration and validation of streamflow series led to index of agreement ioa of 0 92 and 0 8 respectively while the simulation of groundwater levels was more challenging ioa ranging from 0 22 to 0 89 parameter equifinality was observed with different parameter sets achieving a good fit of streamflow and groundwater levels although leading to differing spatial patterns of evapotranspiration rates calibration and validation of the discharge concentrations appeared more difficult ioa of 0 35 for calibration and 0 44 for validation as they are affected by errors in the simulated flow climate projections rcp 8 5 suggested a reduction of salt discharge with consequent increased concentrations within the catchment the study showed the ability of mike she to be successfully applied to intermittent dry catchments to possibly support water and land

water flow in intermittent catchments camporese et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 niedda and pirastru 2014 with only a few also describing salinity and solute transport alaghmand et al 2014a b 2015 scudeler et al 2016 the development of hydrological models able to describe the main dynamics of subsurface surface water interaction in arid and semi arid areas where flow is intermittent and to simulate the relationships between a suite of stresses such as water limitations and catchment salinization is very valuable for catchment management projections of future conditions of water fluxes and stores as well as their implications for soil salinity and land productivity are important for water allocation and are especially challenging for arid environments with large climatic variability leblanc et al 2012 although projections of climatic trends are very common for atmospheric variables such as temperature and rainfall the translation of these projections to catchment hydrological conditions and salinization is still rare this study thus has two aims the main aim is to test the ability of a well established integrated surface subsurface hydrological model isshm i e mike she to simulate water and salt fluxes in intermittent catchments this is a challenging endeavor considering the complexity of intermittent catchments where both streamflow and groundwater levels need to be modelled appropriately to be able to reproduce flow periods and magnitudes as well as the associated salt dynamics the second aim is to show the application of the integrated model in future projections of water and salt balance at the catchment scale with potential applications to water and land management use of isshms for future projections is rare in the literature and the intent here is not to provide future prediction but to show that hydrological models that describe a series of complex processes can be effectively used as tools to support catchment management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data description the study site is a small catchment 0 48 km2 located at mirranatwa in southwest victoria australia the outlet of the catchment is located at an elevation of 254 m above the australian height datum ahd with the highest elevation of the catchment being about 305 m fig 1 the catchment is mainly used as rain fed pasture for grazing sheep with winter active grass cover the climate falls under cfb mediterranean maritime temperate in the koppen classification system with wet winters and springs and dry summers in the last 10 years the mean annual rainfall amounted to 638 mm while annual mean reference evapotranspiration was estimated at 1071 mm using the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 the ratio between these terms yields an aridity index barrow 1992 of 0 59 placing the area in the category of dry subhumid the upper regolith layer is composed of around 7 m of alluvial colluvial material underlain by granite which has decomposed to variable extents resulting in a decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth at 30 m depth the granite bedrock constitutes a relatively impermeable layer further details on the site can be found in dean et al 2016 and dresel et al 2018 catchment discharge was monitored at 30 min intervals using a triangular weir at the catchment outlet dean et al 2016 daily groundwater levels were calculated from levels in 8 bores fig 1 at 4 h intervals electrical conductivity ec of the discharge water was available from measurements by a conductivity cell installed at the base of the weir pool ec in μs cm 1 was internally compensated for temperature and multiplied by a constant factor of 0 6 to estimate total dissolved solids tds in 1 dedjtr 2017 groundwater salinity was available as the concentration of tds from a composition analysis of groundwater samples in 2010 and 2011 dean et al 2014 however to be consistent with the discharge measurements groundwater salinity was also estimated based on ec vapour pressure temperature and solar radiation data were taken from the queensland government silo spatially interpolated database http www longpaddock qld gov au silo daily rainfall data were from the bureau of meteorology bom weather station 089019 located 2 km to the south of the study area standardized reference evapotranspiration et o was obtained through a reduced set fao 56 method which requires wind speed as a long term average value estimations are available as monthly wind speed grids produced from bom s mesolaps pt125 model simulations climate projections were also obtained from the silo database available from the consistent climate scenarios project 2 2 model selection and description five commonly used physically based integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms were reviewed table 1 parflow is a parallel integrated hydrological model that simulates spatially distributed surface and subsurface flow as well as land surface processes including evapotranspiration and snow maxwell et al 2015 the process based adaptive watershed simulator paws shen and phanikumar 2010 describes major hydrologic processes e g surface subsurface flow river network wetlands vegetation and snowpack using an efficient surface subsurface coupling scheme these two models currently do not model surface and subsurface solute transport catchment hydrology cathy and hydrogeosphere hgs couple a three dimensional equation for subsurface flow to approximations of the saint venant equation for surface flow and they have been used for both water fluxes and solute transport alaghmand et al 2016 haaken et al 2017 liggett et al 2014 scudeler et al 2016 mike she is also capable of modelling water fluxes and solute transport e g hester et al 2016 long et al 2015 for surface flow all the models solve a 2d representation of surface flow except cathy which implements an algorithm to define a network of 1d flow paths camporese et al 2010 for the subsurface paws and mike she benefit from higher computational efficiency due to a lower dimensionality in the non linear richards equation the models are thus better applicable to catchment scale problems where lateral fluxes are small compared to vertical fluxes in the unsaturated zone kollet et al 2016 advection and diffusion are the main processes defining the transport of salt in both surface and subsurface these two are included in three of the models however some also implement other processes such as decay and sorption which are applicable to other solutes parflow could be coupled to the community land model clm oleson et al 2008 to provide evapotranspiration as well as other processes kollet and maxwell 2006 while mike she and hgs use the method developed by kristensen and jensen 1975 and cathy can implement either a boundary condition switching procedure or root water uptake formulations camporese et al 2015 a comparison of performance for these models can be found in maxwell et al 2014 and kollet et al 2016 mike she was selected for this study because it is designed for simulations of both water and solute fluxes at the catchment scale and uses a very computationally efficient coupling between the saturated and unsaturated zone models details of mike she are in dhi 2014 and a brief summary is provided here the subsurface model is composed of two separate modules for the saturated and unsaturated zones flow in the saturated zone is described by the three dimensional darcy equation while the flow in the unsaturated zone is described by the one dimensional richards equation richards 1931 the flow equation in the unsaturated zone is coupled to the saturated zone at the interface via a pressure boundary condition thereby allowing for larger times for the saturated flow surface runoff is modelled as a two dimensional sheet flow using the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equations and a strickler manning type law to relate flow depth to velocity chanson 2004 solute transport is modelled with an advection dispersion equation coupled to overland flow and the flow in the saturated and unsaturated zones in the subsurface dispersion is controlled by longitudinal and transverse dispersivities α l α t while in the overland flow there is no general relationship between the mean flow velocity and dispersion and thus the dispersion coefficient d needs to be specified directly the value of actual evapotranspiration is calculated at each grid cell dynamically described as the sum of three individual components namely actual transpiration e at evaporation from the soil surface e s and direct evaporation from vegetation canopy e can at each time step e at is calculated as a fraction of the reference evapotranspiration et o depending on soil moisture vegetation and other soil attributes kristensen and jensen 1975 e at is thus calculated from the root extinction depth as 1 e at f 1 lai f 2 θ f 3 a root z r et o where f 1 accounts for a reduction of root uptake depending on leaf area index lai f 2 limits the root uptake based on soil saturation θ and f 3 is the root distribution function rdf which is described in terms of a root shape factor a root and root extinction depth z r the equation for soil evaporation is 2 e s et o f 4 θ et o e at et o f 4 θ f 5 θ 1 f 1 lai where the first term on the right hand side et o f 4 θ describes multiple phases of a persistent evaporation from soil surface depending on soil moisture content and the second term describes soil evaporation when soil moisture approaches field capacity dhi 2014 kristensen and jensen 1975 the evaporation from vegetation canopy is obtained as 3 e can min i max et o δ t where δ t is the model time step and i max is the maximum canopy storage defined as 4 i max c int lai c int being the canopy interception coefficient 2 3 model set up 2 3 1 model parameters the average specific yield of the aquifer as well as values of some of the parameters characterizing the soil according to the van genuchten retention curve formulation van genuchten 1980 are calibrated values from a model presented in camporese et al 2014 and dean et al 2016 based on a grain size analysis reported in dean et al 2015 due to the small size of the catchment subsurface parameters were assumed constant across the catchment the saturated hydraulic conductivity was assumed to decrease with depth according to k s 1 01 10 5 z 0 27 camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 porosity θ s was given an average value of 0 40 and specific yield was assigned the mean value of measurements at 0 095 0 014 dean et al 2015 saturation at field capacity θ fc and water content at wilting point θ wp were calculated using the van genuchten curve at 0 3 and 0 05 corresponding to suction pressures of 0 0061 and 1 5538 mpa respectively specific storage coefficient s s was found to be an insensitive parameter therefore a value of 1 10 3 m 1 was assigned uniformly across the catchment the key parameters in the kristensen and jensen 1975 model are c 1 c 2 and lai acceptable ranges taken from the literature vazquez 2003 were used in an auto calibration procedure parameter c 3 was given the value of 20 mm day 1 while canopy storage was assigned a typical value of 0 2 mm as no sensitivity was observed for feasible values of this parameter to limit root water uptake to the first 20 cm of the soil column representing annual pasture grass a constant value of 1 m 1 was assigned as a root and root extinction depth was set equal to 1 m the solute transport model parameters α l and α t were obtained through model calibration while d in the surface flow was neglected due to insensitivity all parameters used in this study and their values are listed in table 2 2 3 2 discretization the model grid was constructed from a digital elevation model with a 20 m x 20 m cell resolution the vertical discretization for the unsaturated zone consisted of 16 layers of exponentially increasing thickness beginning from 0 05 m near the surface and ending at 2 m for the saturated zone an initial simulation using a single soil layer was first performed to approximately obtain the minimum water table levels required to minimize errors associated with the coupling of saturated and unsaturated zones dhi 2014 the elevation map of the minimum water table depths was then used to define the bottom slice of the first saturated layer while the remaining thickness up to the bottom model domain boundary was evenly divided to provide overall five saturated zone layers 2 3 3 boundary conditions based on a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity with depth an impermeable bottom boundary was assumed 10 m below the ground surface all the lateral boundaries of the catchment were also assumed impermeable dean et al 2016 and daily rainfall and evapotranspiration defined the flux boundary condition at the soil surface the boundary conditions for the solute transport equation were defined based on primary sources of salt and their measurements reported in dean et al 2014 one of these identified sources is dissolved salts in rainwater for which measurements indicate a mean value of 7 mg l 1 this value was used to impose a flux boundary condition at the soil surface where the mass input of salt is determined by the rainfall volume to obtain an estimation for the rate of salt input through decomposition of granite material which is another continuous source of salt the average annual salt input from rainfall was multiplied by the ratio between granite originated and rainfall originated solute concentrations the obtained value 0 64 tonne year 1 was then assigned as a prescribed salts flux boundary condition to the bottom layer 2 3 4 initial conditions a recursive simulation ajami et al 2015 showed that the shortest time for the system to reach a status not affected by the initial conditions is achieved when the warm up run starts from soil moisture at field capacity across the catchment to minimize model sensitivity to the initial conditions starting from soil moisture at field capacity 10 years of real precipitation solar radiation and minimum and maximum daily temperature data were used in a warm up run this includes the majority of the millennium drought period i e 1996 to 2009 van dijk et al 2013 to ensure that the modelled catchment conditions are physically consistent and properly reflect the history of the catchment the final catchment state resulting from this simulation was used as initial condition to start the calibration run the initial conditions for the solute transport model were defined based on the groundwater salinity measurements whose current levels are reported to be due to the deposition of salts from rainwater over time and decomposition of the bedrock prior to land use change dean et al 2014 for initial groundwater salt concentrations a raster map approximating salinity at each grid cell was required since the number of sampling bores was not adequate to perform interpolation this was achieved using an observed relationship between surface elevation and groundwater tds to this end observed salinities for the bores dean et al 2014 were plotted against the surface elevation at these bores samples from b77 and b80 see fig 1 were excluded in this relationship because b77 receives freshwater through preferential pathways along the granite fractures dean et al 2014 and b80 reaches the deep aquifer below the model domain a linear decrease in salinity with increasing ground surface elevation was observed with a coefficient of determination equal to 0 85 fig 2 the progressive addition of salt to groundwater from infiltration causes a gradual increase of groundwater salinity towards the lower parts of the catchment e g bennetts et al 2006 salt concentration measurements in the unsaturated zone were not available thus the model was used to infer their initial value in the unsaturated zone the model produced quick salinity levels in equilibrium with the groundwater the model was run for several years repeating climatic data from one year before the actual simulation period i e year 2010 with the observed concentrations of groundwater imposed as a constant concentration boundary condition in the saturated zone layers given the estimated distribution of groundwater salinity the salinity of the unsaturated zone approached a common value at the end of each year across the catchment indicating no sensitivity of the concentration distribution in the unsaturated zone to the number of initialization years therefore this common distribution was used as the initial concentration fig 2c any possible storage of salt in the deep regolith can be reasonably assumed to be immobile considering that the clearance of the native vegetation cover has occurred more than a century ago and hence the aquifer has been under recharge ever since white et al 2003 2 4 calibration and validation most of the model parameters were estimated from field measurements and previous modelling work of the water balance at the same catchment camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 vegetation specific parameters and diffusive transport parameters i e longitudinal and transverse dispersivities as well as surface flow dispersion coefficient were obtained through calibration table 2 a preliminary sensitivity analysis revealed that the determining parameters in controlling evapotranspiration are c 1 c 2 and lai therefore feasible ranges of these parameters were taken from the literature for an auto calibration procedure vazquez 2003 the population simplex evolution algorithm implemented in the autocal software madsen 2003 proved to be efficient and was thus used for auto calibration the period chosen for model calibration was the time interval of 15 02 2011 to 15 02 2012 while the subsequent year from 16 02 2012 to 15 02 2013 was chosen as the model validation period the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated values of streamflow was the calibration objective function other metrics such as the index of agreement ioa willmott 1981 and the coefficient of determination r2 were also used for the assessment of fit of groundwater levels as in camporese et al 2014 and dean et al 2016 the bores considered for the model performance are b76 b74 and b96 with the exception of b95 the other bores had groundwater levels below 10 m outside the model domain although b95 at the outlet has water levels within 10 m from the surface it is about 30 m deep and screened in the granite bedrock once the flow model results were validated the solute transport model was calibrated using an iterative trial and error method where in each iteration the performance of the solute transport model was evaluated by comparing ioa for simulated and the observed concentration values however only concentration of the catchment discharge water was used for calibration since recurrent measurements for groundwater concentration at various bores were not available 2 5 projections of climatic conditions the validated model was used to provide projections in the future status of catchment salinity over a predicted hotter and drier climate using daily weather data projections these weather projections represent three main greenhouse gas emission scenarios i e rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 simulated by a general circulation model gcm in terms of precipitation solar radiation minimum and maximum daily temperature for australia daily scaled projections using the change factor method cfm anandhi et al 2011 are available from the silo database this method calculated the arithmetic difference between daily temperature derived from a current baseline climate simulation and derived from a future climate scenario taken at the same gcm grid location this difference was added to historical local values to obtain the modeled future values of daily temperature for rainfall and solar radiation multiplicative change factors rather than arithmetic differences between the future and baseline gcm simulations were calculated and the historical values were multiplied by the change factor the duration of 1960 to 2015 defined the historical observed as well as the baseline gcm simulated period while 2050 was the future scenario year queensland department of science information technology and innovation 2015 projected rainfall timeseries were directly used in this study whereas the projections for other variables were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration according to the hargreaves samani method these projections are generated by the csiro mk36 which is among the gcms reported in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment deemed to be most reliable for the australian region suppiah et al 2007 a seasonal summary of these projections is given in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological model 3 1 1 model performance catchment discharge flow for the calibration period is shown in fig 3 with water table levels at three shallow bores near the drainage line where the water table is more dynamic fig 3 shows that for the catchment discharge series the model achieved a good fit ioa 0 92 through calibration of only et parameters the intermittent regime of flow and timing of events are accurately reproduced with magnitudes of individual events as well as cumulative discharge being also in good agreement with observations fig 3 inset low flow events in particular during the initial part of the year february april are well captured by the model indicating a good approximation of initial soil moisture during the warm up run water table fluctuations at b96 near the catchment outlet are in agreement with observations in terms of both magnitude and seasonal dynamics with slight over and under estimations during the dry and wet seasons water table levels at b74 follow the seasonal pattern of the observations r2 0 81 with an offset of about 2 m throughout the calibration period water table levels at b76 show acceptable consistency with observations during the wet season when the surface flow maintains the groundwater head at the ground surface similar to the calibration phase the model is also able to predict the period of flow and the dynamics of groundwater levels for the validation period fig 4 nevertheless the annual flow is underestimated and the sharp increase of the water table level near the outlet is modelled as a gradual groundwater rise it is rather difficult to find a set of parameters that work for an unusually wet year 2011 and a moderately dry year 2012 considering the challenging nature of arid and semi arid catchment modelling it is a good fit for a catchment with a ratio of discharge to rainfall as little as 3 the performance in both calibration and validation is comparable to previous modelling results in the same catchment camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 a summary of the model performance for calibration and validation is reported in appendix a 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis because three parameters were calibrated different sets of values of these parameters led to comparable results to understand how the model responds to these parameters the parameter sets obtained from auto calibration were sorted in a table based on rmse of catchment discharge see appendix b from these parameter sets those associated with the smallest rmse values and with little correlation among them were used in individual simulations for the assessment of their control for all these simulations equifinality of results was observed for the annual sum of et and its daily dynamics as well as the water table level in all observation bores however as expected variations were present for the proportionality between et components as well as the spatial distribution of annual et a quantification of these variations can be obtained by calculating sensitivities of annual e to t ratio e t and absolute annual et at the location of three observation bores in terms of standardized percentage change this index can be defined as the variation from the central value of each parameter range at each particular run divided by the total variation range of that parameter fig 5 shows sensitivities to c 2 and to the product of lai and c 1 the rationale for choosing this product is that the results show no sensitivity to each individual parameter this is because the product of these two parameters mostly appears in the k j kristensen and jensen 1975 formulations with the exception of evaporation from vegetation canopy this product will be referred to as the vegetation density factor fig 5 shows the sensitivity of e t ratio to c 2 and the vegetation density factor considering a similar range of variation for c 2 and the vegetation density factor 0 31 0 41 0 34 0 43 it is apparent that equal and opposite variations of the two parameters linearly change e t while the total annual et remains approximately constant the spatial distribution of annual et on the other hand is considerably affected and its sensitivity differs from point to point the parameters exhibit a strong complementary control on localized total et along the drainage line b76 being less influential at b74 and b96 fig 5 it is possible that the dynamics at b74 and b96 are influenced by the boundary conditions thereby reducing the effect of changes in the parameters therefore while the combination of multiple parameters lead to good model performance dynamics within the catchment can be very different 3 2 solute transport model the calibration of the transport model provided the values 5 m and 0 5 m for α l and α t respectively physically realistic values for d did not affect the transport simulation results and therefore this parameter was set to zero fig 6 shows the results of the transport model calibration and validation in terms of catchment discharge concentration for the calibration period the model is able to reproduce the pattern for individual rainfall events concentration match is particularly good for the high flow events between june and september when the pattern for concentration generally shows marked decreases with rainfall events the main difference in the measured and modelled concentrations is towards the end of the year when the stream stops flowing these differences are mainly caused by the results from the water flow model small flow events are modelled in november see figs 3 and 4 while the data did not record any flow event therefore the measured outflow concentrations after early november are zero while the modelled concentrations are large because of the very low flow and the already increasing salinity due to the onset of evapotranspiration in spring september and october when combined with the water discharge figs 3 and 4 the modelled loads of solute discharged by the catchment are close to those estimated from data during the calibration 2011 inset of fig 6a while the model underestimated the annual discharge in the validation period 2012 inset of fig 6b fig 7 shows salt mobilization dynamics at a point near the catchment outlet for the duration of calibration top panel and validation bottom panel salinity is visualized using a color scale over the soil column along with rainfall and simulated actual et at this point this demonstrates the pronounced interactions between the groundwater and the unsaturated zone for both calibration and validation periods a rise in the top layer groundwater salinity is visible with the start of intensive rainfall events caused by a leaching of unsaturated storage of salt to the groundwater however thereafter groundwater concentration seems to experience a gradual decrease proportionate to discharge flow hence the solute transport rate as the water table falls below the ground surface moisture loss by evapotranspiration results in a capillary flow that is sustained by a subsequent replenishment of moisture from the water table at this point due to the proximity of the phreatic surface to the root zone and the high reference evapotranspiration rate salinization of the top soil occurs at the highest rate during the dry season when rainfall fluxes are not large enough to cause groundwater recharge in excess of soil moisture deficit and evapotranspiration rate transport remains limited to the unsaturated portion of the soil column reflected as evened out concentration profiles or localized dilution effects commonly observable before the start of diffuse recharge events around april may the model seems to be able to capture the dynamics of solute transport between the saturated and unsaturated zones with a general rise in unsaturated soil salinity in the dry season and in groundwater salinity in the wet season a similar pattern is also visible for total area affected by salinity which reduces during the wet season see appendix c the large depth of the top saturated zone discretization layer however seems to be responsible for some numerically induced dispersion which is recognizable from the larger concentrations in the first layer compared to the second layer and layers below it fig 7 it is nevertheless an inevitable requirement of coupling dhi 2014 for the top layer to include the phreatic surface 3 3 climate change impacts simulated results for future salinity in the catchment for three rcp scenarios and a baseline scenario are illustrated in fig 8 these results were obtained from the simulation of flow and transport using 56 years of climate projections fig 8a shows the cumulative salt output versus time the export rate of salts is consistently the largest under the baseline scenario for the entire simulation duration with a surge occurring near the 50th year corresponding to an increase in rainfall at the end of the millennium drought i e from 1996 to 2009 however all the rcp scenarios show a significant reduction in the export of salts by the 36th year which marks the start of a reproduced drought period in the projections scenario rcp 8 5 shows a total cessation of salt output from this point onward due to the drying out of the stream the drying out of the stream on the other hand seems to cause the average salt concentration in unsaturated soil to increase and is particularly pronounced for rcp 8 5 fig 8b it is also evident that the salinity of the unsaturated zone is increasing among all rcps prior to 10 years of simulation this is due to a fast increase in the salinity of shallow groundwater as a result of evaporative enrichment of transported salt from across the catchment to these low lying areas after around the 10th year a drop in the concentration of salt in the groundwater near the outlet will result in reducing salt concentration in the unsaturated zone above groundwater the decrease of soil salinity in the unsaturated zone for the baseline climate regime blue line in fig 8b is associated with the rate of salt output i e salt washed off which is highest for this scenario because of a larger recharge as salt leaves the catchment at a faster rate the overall concentration of both groundwater and top soil decreases faster in comparison the other scenarios experience an increase of et and a reduction in the precipitation amount table 3 these cause a lower soil water content and thus a higher soil salinity in addition the lower rainfall means a slower transport and consequently a slower depletion of salts which leads to a sustained groundwater salt concentration a combination of these two causes provides the obtained effect which varies in intensity across the scenarios historical depletion of groundwater salts due to an output to input ratio larger than one has been documented for the southern half of the murray darling basin the rate of this depletion has been shown to decrease with time jolly et al 2001 fig 8c shows the dynamics of the total area that is considered as salt affected i e with a soil salt concentration above 2000 mg l 1 the general pattern is decreasing among all rcps as well as for the baseline scenario no significant variation of results is noticeable among the rcps except during and after the drought period when rcp 8 5 shows a marked divergence from other rcps overall the three variables show considerably different projections across the climate scenarios scenario rcp 8 5 which is associated with extreme greenhouse gas emissions exhibits the utmost deviation from the baseline scenario with total output of salt at the end of this period reduced to nearly half compared to the baseline under all climate change scenarios average soil salinity remains relatively stable at a high value as opposed to an obvious decline for the baseline case while the total salt affected area is similar among rcps with a relatively constant offset visible throughout the period the results suggest a reduction in the rate of salt discharge and an increase in soil salinity with increasing severity of climate change and there is a marginal variation of results for rcps 4 5 and 6 0 4 conclusion this study provides a rare example of applying a physically based fully integrated numerical model to catchment scale water fluxes and salt transport in intermittent catchments mike she proved efficient in its application to an intermittent flow regime with water balance results comparable to similar models applied to the same catchment camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 it was shown that calibration of k j evapotranspiration parameters may lead to equifinality in water balance components and catchment wide water table configuration while the spatial distribution of et experiences significant variability across different calibrations therefore the availability of point estimates of et components would be useful to constrain the range of suitable solutions a salt balance model of the catchment was set up based on the advection dispersion solute transport solver of mike she and observed groundwater concentrations it was illustrated that catchment salt discharge could be reproduced by the model however concentration mismatch is observable for some flow events the model also demonstrates a reasonable performance in capturing transient salinity dynamics and solute mobilization between saturated and unsaturated zones with respect to wet and dry seasons projected changes in climatic data were used in a number of scenario simulations to estimate the potential impacts of future climate overall a decreasing trend in salt output rate with increasing concentration of greenhouse gas emissions is expected while on average the top soil will sustain relatively high salinity levels under the generally hotter and drier climate scenarios on the contrary under a no change scenario a steady drop in the soil salinity is conceivable as the catchment becomes depleted of salt this study is one of the first attempts to establish a physically based salinity model at the catchment scale in intermittent catchments more complex models are required to fully account for the contributions of salts to sodicity and thus possible alterations in soil physical properties the results could probably be further improved by implementing a crop salt stress model to account for reduction in et rates in saline areas this paper demonstrates an example of the application of mike she or other isshms as powerful numerical tools to the management of dryland salinity this provides insight into the potential spaces for improvement of these models for developers as well as directions for observation efforts towards better modelling of the issue it is worth citing that the results of this paper particularly regarding the long term climate change impacts are not meant for predicting the future but to help with the understanding of possible outcomes under the given scenarios declarations of interest none acknowledgments the experimental data were collected as part of a

6864,this paper presents a model of flow and solute transport of intermittent catchments in arid and semi arid regions highlighting challenges caused by the complex interactions between subsurface and surface flows a case study is used for the application of the integrated mike she model to investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of water and salinity in a small ephemeral catchment in southwestern victoria australia mike she was successfully calibrated and validated against experimental data of streamflow groundwater levels and salt discharged from the catchment projections of climatic conditions adopting representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 were used to infer how salinity discharge and concentrations might be affected across a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios with different severity the calibration of the water fluxes was solely based on parameters associated with the model of evapotranspiration with other parameters selected from field observations and literature the calibrated parameters for the salt transport were the longitudinal and lateral dispersivities the calibration and validation of streamflow series led to index of agreement ioa of 0 92 and 0 8 respectively while the simulation of groundwater levels was more challenging ioa ranging from 0 22 to 0 89 parameter equifinality was observed with different parameter sets achieving a good fit of streamflow and groundwater levels although leading to differing spatial patterns of evapotranspiration rates calibration and validation of the discharge concentrations appeared more difficult ioa of 0 35 for calibration and 0 44 for validation as they are affected by errors in the simulated flow climate projections rcp 8 5 suggested a reduction of salt discharge with consequent increased concentrations within the catchment the study showed the ability of mike she to be successfully applied to intermittent dry catchments to possibly support water and land

paid to mechanisms and repercussions of developing saline groundwater caused by land use change lambers 2003 marchesini et al 2017 mcfarlane et al 2016 with many experimental studies dealing with the impacts of restoring land use to deep rooted perennial pasture or tree plantation adelana et al 2015 brown et al 2005 dean et al 2016 because modelling of the water fluxes of catchments in arid and semi arid regions presents specific challenges such as the occurrence of substantial periods of no flow the rapid burst of streamflow following large storms and possibly the seasonality of runoff generation mechanisms pilgrim et al 1988 wheater et al 2007 the development of such models in arid and semi arid areas is not well established models of salt transport in these areas are even rarer and are often restricted to lumped models anderies 2005 suweis et al 2010 tuteja et al 2003 walker et al 2002 overall hydrological models in intermittent catchments are not very common with most applications relying on lumped descriptions of rainfall runoff processes croke et al 2008 ye et al 1997 1998 recently distributed models for surface and subsurface water fluxes have been applied to water flow in intermittent catchments camporese et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 niedda and pirastru 2014 with only a few also describing salinity and solute transport alaghmand et al 2014a b 2015 scudeler et al 2016 the development of hydrological models able to describe the main dynamics of subsurface surface water interaction in arid and semi arid areas where flow is intermittent and to simulate the relationships between a suite of stresses such as water limitations and catchment salinization is very valuable for catchment management projections of future conditions of water fluxes and stores as well as their implications for soil salinity and land productivity are important for water allocation and are especially challenging for arid environments with large climatic variability leblanc et al 2012 although projections of climatic trends are very common for atmospheric variables such as temperature and rainfall the translation of these projections to catchment hydrological conditions and salinization is still rare this study thus has two aims the main aim is to test the ability of a well established integrated surface subsurface hydrological model isshm i e mike she to simulate water and salt fluxes in intermittent catchments this is a challenging endeavor considering the complexity of intermittent catchments where both streamflow and groundwater levels need to be modelled appropriately to be able to reproduce flow periods and magnitudes as well as the associated salt dynamics the second aim is to show the application of the integrated model in future projections of water and salt balance at the catchment scale with potential applications to water and land management use of isshms for future projections is rare in the literature and the intent here is not to provide future prediction but to show that hydrological models that describe a series of complex processes can be effectively used as tools to support catchment management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data description the study site is a small catchment 0 48 km2 located at mirranatwa in southwest victoria australia the outlet of the catchment is located at an elevation of 254 m above the australian height datum ahd with the highest elevation of the catchment being about 305 m fig 1 the catchment is mainly used as rain fed pasture for grazing sheep with winter active grass cover the climate falls under cfb mediterranean maritime temperate in the koppen classification system with wet winters and springs and dry summers in the last 10 years the mean annual rainfall amounted to 638 mm while annual mean reference evapotranspiration was estimated at 1071 mm using the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 the ratio between these terms yields an aridity index barrow 1992 of 0 59 placing the area in the category of dry subhumid the upper regolith layer is composed of around 7 m of alluvial colluvial material underlain by granite which has decomposed to variable extents resulting in a decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth at 30 m depth the granite bedrock constitutes a relatively impermeable layer further details on the site can be found in dean et al 2016 and dresel et al 2018 catchment discharge was monitored at 30 min intervals using a triangular weir at the catchment outlet dean et al 2016 daily groundwater levels were calculated from levels in 8 bores fig 1 at 4 h intervals electrical conductivity ec of the discharge water was available from measurements by a conductivity cell installed at the base of the weir pool ec in μs cm 1 was internally compensated for temperature and multiplied by a constant factor of 0 6 to estimate total dissolved solids tds in 1 dedjtr 2017 groundwater salinity was available as the concentration of tds from a composition analysis of groundwater samples in 2010 and 2011 dean et al 2014 however to be consistent with the discharge measurements groundwater salinity was also estimated based on ec vapour pressure temperature and solar radiation data were taken from the queensland government silo spatially interpolated database http www longpaddock qld gov au silo daily rainfall data were from the bureau of meteorology bom weather station 089019 located 2 km to the south of the study area standardized reference evapotranspiration et o was obtained through a reduced set fao 56 method which requires wind speed as a long term average value estimations are available as monthly wind speed grids produced from bom s mesolaps pt125 model simulations climate projections were also obtained from the silo database available from the consistent climate scenarios project 2 2 model selection and description five commonly used physically based integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms were reviewed table 1 parflow is a parallel integrated hydrological model that simulates spatially distributed surface and subsurface flow as well as land surface processes including evapotranspiration and snow maxwell et al 2015 the process based adaptive watershed simulator paws shen and phanikumar 2010 describes major hydrologic processes e g surface subsurface flow river network wetlands vegetation and snowpack using an efficient surface subsurface coupling scheme these two models currently do not model surface and subsurface solute transport catchment hydrology cathy and hydrogeosphere hgs couple a three dimensional equation for subsurface flow to approximations of the saint venant equation for surface flow and they have been used for both water fluxes and solute transport alaghmand et al 2016 haaken et al 2017 liggett et al 2014 scudeler et al 2016 mike she is also capable of modelling water fluxes and solute transport e g hester et al 2016 long et al 2015 for surface flow all the models solve a 2d representation of surface flow except cathy which implements an algorithm to define a network of 1d flow paths camporese et al 2010 for the subsurface paws and mike she benefit from higher computational efficiency due to a lower dimensionality in the non linear richards equation the models are thus better applicable to catchment scale problems where lateral fluxes are small compared to vertical fluxes in the unsaturated zone kollet et al 2016 advection and diffusion are the main processes defining the transport of salt in both surface and subsurface these two are included in three of the models however some also implement other processes such as decay and sorption which are applicable to other solutes parflow could be coupled to the community land model clm oleson et al 2008 to provide evapotranspiration as well as other processes kollet and maxwell 2006 while mike she and hgs use the method developed by kristensen and jensen 1975 and cathy can implement either a boundary condition switching procedure or root water uptake formulations camporese et al 2015 a comparison of performance for these models can be found in maxwell et al 2014 and kollet et al 2016 mike she was selected for this study because it is designed for simulations of both water and solute fluxes at the catchment scale and uses a very computationally efficient coupling between the saturated and unsaturated zone models details of mike she are in dhi 2014 and a brief summary is provided here the subsurface model is composed of two separate modules for the saturated and unsaturated zones flow in the saturated zone is described by the three dimensional darcy equation while the flow in the unsaturated zone is described by the one dimensional richards equation richards 1931 the flow equation in the unsaturated zone is coupled to the saturated zone at the interface via a pressure boundary condition thereby allowing for larger times for the saturated flow surface runoff is modelled as a two dimensional sheet flow using the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equations and a strickler manning type law to relate flow depth to velocity chanson 2004 solute transport is modelled with an advection dispersion equation coupled to overland flow and the flow in the saturated and unsaturated zones in the subsurface dispersion is controlled by longitudinal and transverse dispersivities α l α t while in the overland flow there is no general relationship between the mean flow velocity and dispersion and thus the dispersion coefficient d needs to be specified directly the value of actual evapotranspiration is calculated at each grid cell dynamically described as the sum of three individual components namely actual transpiration e at evaporation from the soil surface e s and direct evaporation from vegetation canopy e can at each time step e at is calculated as a fraction of the reference evapotranspiration et o depending on soil moisture vegetation and other soil attributes kristensen and jensen 1975 e at is thus calculated from the root extinction depth as 1 e at f 1 lai f 2 θ f 3 a root z r et o where f 1 accounts for a reduction of root uptake depending on leaf area index lai f 2 limits the root uptake based on soil saturation θ and f 3 is the root distribution function rdf which is described in terms of a root shape factor a root and root extinction depth z r the equation for soil evaporation is 2 e s et o f 4 θ et o e at et o f 4 θ f 5 θ 1 f 1 lai where the first term on the right hand side et o f 4 θ describes multiple phases of a persistent evaporation from soil surface depending on soil moisture content and the second term describes soil evaporation when soil moisture approaches field capacity dhi 2014 kristensen and jensen 1975 the evaporation from vegetation canopy is obtained as 3 e can min i max et o δ t where δ t is the model time step and i max is the maximum canopy storage defined as 4 i max c int lai c int being the canopy interception coefficient 2 3 model set up 2 3 1 model parameters the average specific yield of the aquifer as well as values of some of the parameters characterizing the soil according to the van genuchten retention curve formulation van genuchten 1980 are calibrated values from a model presented in camporese et al 2014 and dean et al 2016 based on a grain size analysis reported in dean et al 2015 due to the small size of the catchment subsurface parameters were assumed constant across the catchment the saturated hydraulic conductivity was assumed to decrease with depth according to k s 1 01 10 5 z 0 27 camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 porosity θ s was given an average value of 0 40 and specific yield was assigned the mean value of measurements at 0 095 0 014 dean et al 2015 saturation at field capacity θ fc and water content at wilting point θ wp were calculated using the van genuchten curve at 0 3 and 0 05 corresponding to suction pressures of 0 0061 and 1 5538 mpa respectively specific storage coefficient s s was found to be an insensitive parameter therefore a value of 1 10 3 m 1 was assigned uniformly across the catchment the key parameters in the kristensen and jensen 1975 model are c 1 c 2 and lai acceptable ranges taken from the literature vazquez 2003 were used in an auto calibration procedure parameter c 3 was given the value of 20 mm day 1 while canopy storage was assigned a typical value of 0 2 mm as no sensitivity was observed for feasible values of this parameter to limit root water uptake to the first 20 cm of the soil column representing annual pasture grass a constant value of 1 m 1 was assigned as a root and root extinction depth was set equal to 1 m the solute transport model parameters α l and α t were obtained through model calibration while d in the surface flow was neglected due to insensitivity all parameters used in this study and their values are listed in table 2 2 3 2 discretization the model grid was constructed from a digital elevation model with a 20 m x 20 m cell resolution the vertical discretization for the unsaturated zone consisted of 16 layers of exponentially increasing thickness beginning from 0 05 m near the surface and ending at 2 m for the saturated zone an initial simulation using a single soil layer was first performed to approximately obtain the minimum water table levels required to minimize errors associated with the coupling of saturated and unsaturated zones dhi 2014 the elevation map of the minimum water table depths was then used to define the bottom slice of the first saturated layer while the remaining thickness up to the bottom model domain boundary was evenly divided to provide overall five saturated zone layers 2 3 3 boundary conditions based on a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity with depth an impermeable bottom boundary was assumed 10 m below the ground surface all the lateral boundaries of the catchment were also assumed impermeable dean et al 2016 and daily rainfall and evapotranspiration defined the flux boundary condition at the soil surface the boundary conditions for the solute transport equation were defined based on primary sources of salt and their measurements reported in dean et al 2014 one of these identified sources is dissolved salts in rainwater for which measurements indicate a mean value of 7 mg l 1 this value was used to impose a flux boundary condition at the soil surface where the mass input of salt is determined by the rainfall volume to obtain an estimation for the rate of salt input through decomposition of granite material which is another continuous source of salt the average annual salt input from rainfall was multiplied by the ratio between granite originated and rainfall originated solute concentrations the obtained value 0 64 tonne year 1 was then assigned as a prescribed salts flux boundary condition to the bottom layer 2 3 4 initial conditions a recursive simulation ajami et al 2015 showed that the shortest time for the system to reach a status not affected by the initial conditions is achieved when the warm up run starts from soil moisture at field capacity across the catchment to minimize model sensitivity to the initial conditions starting from soil moisture at field capacity 10 years of real precipitation solar radiation and minimum and maximum daily temperature data were used in a warm up run this includes the majority of the millennium drought period i e 1996 to 2009 van dijk et al 2013 to ensure that the modelled catchment conditions are physically consistent and properly reflect the history of the catchment the final catchment state resulting from this simulation was used as initial condition to start the calibration run the initial conditions for the solute transport model were defined based on the groundwater salinity measurements whose current levels are reported to be due to the deposition of salts from rainwater over time and decomposition of the bedrock prior to land use change dean et al 2014 for initial groundwater salt concentrations a raster map approximating salinity at each grid cell was required since the number of sampling bores was not adequate to perform interpolation this was achieved using an observed relationship between surface elevation and groundwater tds to this end observed salinities for the bores dean et al 2014 were plotted against the surface elevation at these bores samples from b77 and b80 see fig 1 were excluded in this relationship because b77 receives freshwater through preferential pathways along the granite fractures dean et al 2014 and b80 reaches the deep aquifer below the model domain a linear decrease in salinity with increasing ground surface elevation was observed with a coefficient of determination equal to 0 85 fig 2 the progressive addition of salt to groundwater from infiltration causes a gradual increase of groundwater salinity towards the lower parts of the catchment e g bennetts et al 2006 salt concentration measurements in the unsaturated zone were not available thus the model was used to infer their initial value in the unsaturated zone the model produced quick salinity levels in equilibrium with the groundwater the model was run for several years repeating climatic data from one year before the actual simulation period i e year 2010 with the observed concentrations of groundwater imposed as a constant concentration boundary condition in the saturated zone layers given the estimated distribution of groundwater salinity the salinity of the unsaturated zone approached a common value at the end of each year across the catchment indicating no sensitivity of the concentration distribution in the unsaturated zone to the number of initialization years therefore this common distribution was used as the initial concentration fig 2c any possible storage of salt in the deep regolith can be reasonably assumed to be immobile considering that the clearance of the native vegetation cover has occurred more than a century ago and hence the aquifer has been under recharge ever since white et al 2003 2 4 calibration and validation most of the model parameters were estimated from field measurements and previous modelling work of the water balance at the same catchment camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 vegetation specific parameters and diffusive transport parameters i e longitudinal and transverse dispersivities as well as surface flow dispersion coefficient were obtained through calibration table 2 a preliminary sensitivity analysis revealed that the determining parameters in controlling evapotranspiration are c 1 c 2 and lai therefore feasible ranges of these parameters were taken from the literature for an auto calibration procedure vazquez 2003 the population simplex evolution algorithm implemented in the autocal software madsen 2003 proved to be efficient and was thus used for auto calibration the period chosen for model calibration was the time interval of 15 02 2011 to 15 02 2012 while the subsequent year from 16 02 2012 to 15 02 2013 was chosen as the model validation period the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated values of streamflow was the calibration objective function other metrics such as the index of agreement ioa willmott 1981 and the coefficient of determination r2 were also used for the assessment of fit of groundwater levels as in camporese et al 2014 and dean et al 2016 the bores considered for the model performance are b76 b74 and b96 with the exception of b95 the other bores had groundwater levels below 10 m outside the model domain although b95 at the outlet has water levels within 10 m from the surface it is about 30 m deep and screened in the granite bedrock once the flow model results were validated the solute transport model was calibrated using an iterative trial and error method where in each iteration the performance of the solute transport model was evaluated by comparing ioa for simulated and the observed concentration values however only concentration of the catchment discharge water was used for calibration since recurrent measurements for groundwater concentration at various bores were not available 2 5 projections of climatic conditions the validated model was used to provide projections in the future status of catchment salinity over a predicted hotter and drier climate using daily weather data projections these weather projections represent three main greenhouse gas emission scenarios i e rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 simulated by a general circulation model gcm in terms of precipitation solar radiation minimum and maximum daily temperature for australia daily scaled projections using the change factor method cfm anandhi et al 2011 are available from the silo database this method calculated the arithmetic difference between daily temperature derived from a current baseline climate simulation and derived from a future climate scenario taken at the same gcm grid location this difference was added to historical local values to obtain the modeled future values of daily temperature for rainfall and solar radiation multiplicative change factors rather than arithmetic differences between the future and baseline gcm simulations were calculated and the historical values were multiplied by the change factor the duration of 1960 to 2015 defined the historical observed as well as the baseline gcm simulated period while 2050 was the future scenario year queensland department of science information technology and innovation 2015 projected rainfall timeseries were directly used in this study whereas the projections for other variables were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration according to the hargreaves samani method these projections are generated by the csiro mk36 which is among the gcms reported in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment deemed to be most reliable for the australian region suppiah et al 2007 a seasonal summary of these projections is given in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological model 3 1 1 model performance catchment discharge flow for the calibration period is shown in fig 3 with water table levels at three shallow bores near the drainage line where the water table is more dynamic fig 3 shows that for the catchment discharge series the model achieved a good fit ioa 0 92 through calibration of only et parameters the intermittent regime of flow and timing of events are accurately reproduced with magnitudes of individual events as well as cumulative discharge being also in good agreement with observations fig 3 inset low flow events in particular during the initial part of the year february april are well captured by the model indicating a good approximation of initial soil moisture during the warm up run water table fluctuations at b96 near the catchment outlet are in agreement with observations in terms of both magnitude and seasonal dynamics with slight over and under estimations during the dry and wet seasons water table levels at b74 follow the seasonal pattern of the observations r2 0 81 with an offset of about 2 m throughout the calibration period water table levels at b76 show acceptable consistency with observations during the wet season when the surface flow maintains the groundwater head at the ground surface similar to the calibration phase the model is also able to predict the period of flow and the dynamics of groundwater levels for the validation period fig 4 nevertheless the annual flow is underestimated and the sharp increase of the water table level near the outlet is modelled as a gradual groundwater rise it is rather difficult to find a set of parameters that work for an unusually wet year 2011 and a moderately dry year 2012 considering the challenging nature of arid and semi arid catchment modelling it is a good fit for a catchment with a ratio of discharge to rainfall as little as 3 the performance in both calibration and validation is comparable to previous modelling results in the same catchment camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 a summary of the model performance for calibration and validation is reported in appendix a 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis because three parameters were calibrated different sets of values of these parameters led to comparable results to understand how the model responds to these parameters the parameter sets obtained from auto calibration were sorted in a table based on rmse of catchment discharge see appendix b from these parameter sets those associated with the smallest rmse values and with little correlation among them were used in individual simulations for the assessment of their control for all these simulations equifinality of results was observed for the annual sum of et and its daily dynamics as well as the water table level in all observation bores however as expected variations were present for the proportionality between et components as well as the spatial distribution of annual et a quantification of these variations can be obtained by calculating sensitivities of annual e to t ratio e t and absolute annual et at the location of three observation bores in terms of standardized percentage change this index can be defined as the variation from the central value of each parameter range at each particular run divided by the total variation range of that parameter fig 5 shows sensitivities to c 2 and to the product of lai and c 1 the rationale for choosing this product is that the results show no sensitivity to each individual parameter this is because the product of these two parameters mostly appears in the k j kristensen and jensen 1975 formulations with the exception of evaporation from vegetation canopy this product will be referred to as the vegetation density factor fig 5 shows the sensitivity of e t ratio to c 2 and the vegetation density factor considering a similar range of variation for c 2 and the vegetation density factor 0 31 0 41 0 34 0 43 it is apparent that equal and opposite variations of the two parameters linearly change e t while the total annual et remains approximately constant the spatial distribution of annual et on the other hand is considerably affected and its sensitivity differs from point to point the parameters exhibit a strong complementary control on localized total et along the drainage line b76 being less influential at b74 and b96 fig 5 it is possible that the dynamics at b74 and b96 are influenced by the boundary conditions thereby reducing the effect of changes in the parameters therefore while the combination of multiple parameters lead to good model performance dynamics within the catchment can be very different 3 2 solute transport model the calibration of the transport model provided the values 5 m and 0 5 m for α l and α t respectively physically realistic values for d did not affect the transport simulation results and therefore this parameter was set to zero fig 6 shows the results of the transport model calibration and validation in terms of catchment discharge concentration for the calibration period the model is able to reproduce the pattern for individual rainfall events concentration match is particularly good for the high flow events between june and september when the pattern for concentration generally shows marked decreases with rainfall events the main difference in the measured and modelled concentrations is towards the end of the year when the stream stops flowing these differences are mainly caused by the results from the water flow model small flow events are modelled in november see figs 3 and 4 while the data did not record any flow event therefore the measured outflow concentrations after early november are zero while the modelled concentrations are large because of the very low flow and the already increasing salinity due to the onset of evapotranspiration in spring september and october when combined with the water discharge figs 3 and 4 the modelled loads of solute discharged by the catchment are close to those estimated from data during the calibration 2011 inset of fig 6a while the model underestimated the annual discharge in the validation period 2012 inset of fig 6b fig 7 shows salt mobilization dynamics at a point near the catchment outlet for the duration of calibration top panel and validation bottom panel salinity is visualized using a color scale over the soil column along with rainfall and simulated actual et at this point this demonstrates the pronounced interactions between the groundwater and the unsaturated zone for both calibration and validation periods a rise in the top layer groundwater salinity is visible with the start of intensive rainfall events caused by a leaching of unsaturated storage of salt to the groundwater however thereafter groundwater concentration seems to experience a gradual decrease proportionate to discharge flow hence the solute transport rate as the water table falls below the ground surface moisture loss by evapotranspiration results in a capillary flow that is sustained by a subsequent replenishment of moisture from the water table at this point due to the proximity of the phreatic surface to the root zone and the high reference evapotranspiration rate salinization of the top soil occurs at the highest rate during the dry season when rainfall fluxes are not large enough to cause groundwater recharge in excess of soil moisture deficit and evapotranspiration rate transport remains limited to the unsaturated portion of the soil column reflected as evened out concentration profiles or localized dilution effects commonly observable before the start of diffuse recharge events around april may the model seems to be able to capture the dynamics of solute transport between the saturated and unsaturated zones with a general rise in unsaturated soil salinity in the dry season and in groundwater salinity in the wet season a similar pattern is also visible for total area affected by salinity which reduces during the wet season see appendix c the large depth of the top saturated zone discretization layer however seems to be responsible for some numerically induced dispersion which is recognizable from the larger concentrations in the first layer compared to the second layer and layers below it fig 7 it is nevertheless an inevitable requirement of coupling dhi 2014 for the top layer to include the phreatic surface 3 3 climate change impacts simulated results for future salinity in the catchment for three rcp scenarios and a baseline scenario are illustrated in fig 8 these results were obtained from the simulation of flow and transport using 56 years of climate projections fig 8a shows the cumulative salt output versus time the export rate of salts is consistently the largest under the baseline scenario for the entire simulation duration with a surge occurring near the 50th year corresponding to an increase in rainfall at the end of the millennium drought i e from 1996 to 2009 however all the rcp scenarios show a significant reduction in the export of salts by the 36th year which marks the start of a reproduced drought period in the projections scenario rcp 8 5 shows a total cessation of salt output from this point onward due to the drying out of the stream the drying out of the stream on the other hand seems to cause the average salt concentration in unsaturated soil to increase and is particularly pronounced for rcp 8 5 fig 8b it is also evident that the salinity of the unsaturated zone is increasing among all rcps prior to 10 years of simulation this is due to a fast increase in the salinity of shallow groundwater as a result of evaporative enrichment of transported salt from across the catchment to these low lying areas after around the 10th year a drop in the concentration of salt in the groundwater near the outlet will result in reducing salt concentration in the unsaturated zone above groundwater the decrease of soil salinity in the unsaturated zone for the baseline climate regime blue line in fig 8b is associated with the rate of salt output i e salt washed off which is highest for this scenario because of a larger recharge as salt leaves the catchment at a faster rate the overall concentration of both groundwater and top soil decreases faster in comparison the other scenarios experience an increase of et and a reduction in the precipitation amount table 3 these cause a lower soil water content and thus a higher soil salinity in addition the lower rainfall means a slower transport and consequently a slower depletion of salts which leads to a sustained groundwater salt concentration a combination of these two causes provides the obtained effect which varies in intensity across the scenarios historical depletion of groundwater salts due to an output to input ratio larger than one has been documented for the southern half of the murray darling basin the rate of this depletion has been shown to decrease with time jolly et al 2001 fig 8c shows the dynamics of the total area that is considered as salt affected i e with a soil salt concentration above 2000 mg l 1 the general pattern is decreasing among all rcps as well as for the baseline scenario no significant variation of results is noticeable among the rcps except during and after the drought period when rcp 8 5 shows a marked divergence from other rcps overall the three variables show considerably different projections across the climate scenarios scenario rcp 8 5 which is associated with extreme greenhouse gas emissions exhibits the utmost deviation from the baseline scenario with total output of salt at the end of this period reduced to nearly half compared to the baseline under all climate change scenarios average soil salinity remains relatively stable at a high value as opposed to an obvious decline for the baseline case while the total salt affected area is similar among rcps with a relatively constant offset visible throughout the period the results suggest a reduction in the rate of salt discharge and an increase in soil salinity with increasing severity of climate change and there is a marginal variation of results for rcps 4 5 and 6 0 4 conclusion this study provides a rare example of applying a physically based fully integrated numerical model to catchment scale water fluxes and salt transport in intermittent catchments mike she proved efficient in its application to an intermittent flow regime with water balance results comparable to similar models applied to the same catchment camporese et al 2014 dean et al 2016 it was shown that calibration of k j evapotranspiration parameters may lead to equifinality in water balance components and catchment wide water table configuration while the spatial distribution of et experiences significant variability across different calibrations therefore the availability of point estimates of et components would be useful to constrain the range of suitable solutions a salt balance model of the catchment was set up based on the advection dispersion solute transport solver of mike she and observed groundwater concentrations it was illustrated that catchment salt discharge could be reproduced by the model however concentration mismatch is observable for some flow events the model also demonstrates a reasonable performance in capturing transient salinity dynamics and solute mobilization between saturated and unsaturated zones with respect to wet and dry seasons projected changes in climatic data were used in a number of scenario simulations to estimate the potential impacts of future climate overall a decreasing trend in salt output rate with increasing concentration of greenhouse gas emissions is expected while on average the top soil will sustain relatively high salinity levels under the generally hotter and drier climate scenarios on the contrary under a no change scenario a steady drop in the soil salinity is conceivable as the catchment becomes depleted of salt this study is one of the first attempts to establish a physically based salinity model at the catchment scale in intermittent catchments more complex models are required to fully account for the contributions of salts to sodicity and thus possible alterations in soil physical properties the results could probably be further improved by implementing a crop salt stress model to account for reduction in et rates in saline areas this paper demonstrates an example of the application of mike she or other isshms as powerful numerical tools to the management of dryland salinity this provides insight into the potential spaces for improvement of these models for developers as well as directions for observation efforts towards better modelling of the issue it is worth citing that the results of this paper particularly regarding the long term climate change impacts are not meant for predicting the future but to help with the understanding of possible outcomes under the given scenarios declarations of interest none acknowledgments the experimental data were collected as part of a
