24205,the purpose of this work is to study an interaction between the sugarcane borer and its parasitoids trichogramma galloi and cotesia flavipes the interaction between these populations is modeled by a host parasitoid system considering six ordinary differential equations the purpose of mathematical modeling is to answer two important issues is it possible to control the sugarcane pest only with the egg parasitoid or the larvae parasitoid or do you need both among the control methodologies analyzed in this work which could be the most appropriate for pest management three control methodologies are proposed continuous control impulsive control and the coupling of these two controls continuous and impulsive computer simulations are provided and their results discussed keywords sugarcane borer biological control parasitoids sdre impulsive control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the last decades economic interest in the production of sugarcane has grown significantly especially due to its importance for the production of sugar and ethanol the most important sugarcane pest is the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis it causes damage from the third month after planting where the cane is in the tillering stage and its population growth is also favored by high rainfall levels and high temperatures spring and summer the newborn larvae scrape the leaves and pierce the softer part of the sugarcane stalk building internal galleries causing direct damage that results in the death of the sprout dry leaves weight loss and atrophy as well as indirect damage when there is contamination by yeasts that cause rot in the stems decreasing the purity of the sugarcane juice and increasing the loss of industrial yield in the sugar and alcohol production process aya et al 2017 macedo and botelho 1988 parra et al 2002 vargas et al 2015 the only viable and efficient option to the control is biological control which consists of reducing the pest population using parasitoids it is impossible to use insecticides against the sugarcane borer in the larval stage as the larva is found inside the plant the wasp cotesia flavipes is the most important parasitoid of the sugarcane borer and in the egg stage the main parasitoid is the trichogramma galloi and both used in biological control in brazil parra et al 2002 parra and junior 2019 the wasps are reared in laboratories and are released on plantations infested with borers considering the biological control of the sugarcane borer the objective of this work was to answer two main questions is it possible to control the sugarcane borer only with the egg parasitoid or the larvae parasitoid or do you need both among the control methodologies analyzed which could be the most appropriate for pest management to answer these questions a mathematical modeling of pest control should be applied several host parasitoid discrete and continuous time models were reviewed in mills and getz 1996 the age structured model in which two parasitoid species attack different development all stages of a single host species was proposed in briggs 1993 due this model the host goes through three developmental stages an egg stage a larval stage and an adult stage there are two parasitoid species each having an immature and an adult stage both species exhibit a type i functional responses with constant attack rates independent of host or parasitoid densities each parasitized host becomes a single juvenile parasitoid a functional of type i was also considered in tonnang et al 2009 where the authors modeled the biological control of plutella xylostella using its exotic larval parasitoid diadegma semiclausum based on the statistical data a model like the above mentioned model was used in molnár et al 2016 in this case the host goes through two developmental stages an egg stage and a larval stage and there are two adult parasitoid species in rafikov et al 2022 was proposed an age structured model in which two parasitoid species the egg parasitoid t galloi and the larval parasitoid c flavipes attack the egg and larval development all the stages of the sugarcane borer d saccharalis respectively seasonal perturbations bezerra et al 2021 rinaldi et al 1993 wissinger 1989 zhang et al 2012 were also considered in the mathematical modeling and in the controlled system in biological control a certain number of parasitoids are released in an instant in control theory this control is called impulsive these releases can be periodic when they happen at equal intervals optimal control theory of continuous dynamic time systems operates with continuous control functions i e parasitoid releases must be performed at every moment three strategies are considered the first strategy using the state dependent riccati equation sdre method banks et al 2007 mracek and cloutier 1996 1998 we determine strategies in continuous form this strategy can become costly and impractical since it requires human labor to perform the tasks inherent to the control the second strategy is impulsive control are made weekly decisions or more than one week on the release of parasitoids the third strategy is impulsive and sdre control to use parasitoid release in amounts calculated by sdre only at times when pest density exceeds the level of economic damage comparisons are made between the results of the second and third control strategies based on the works of botelho et al 1999 and nava et al 2009 the purpose of this work is to control pests using the associated release of the parasitoid from the egg and the larvae when a large invasion of the sugarcane pest occurs the management with only a single parasitoid may not be enough to control the pests and minimize the economic injury hence the association of egg and larval parasitoids is recommended for the control of d saccharalis the pointwise controllability of the agroecosystem is analyzed and through the system pointwise controllability it is shown that in fact the population dynamics proposed in this work can only be controlled using two control functions computer simulations will be carried out to show the best answers to the questions formulated above and to show the results obtained from the proposed control methodologies the codes performed using the numeric computing platform matlab for the generation of figures in the manuscript are available in appendices a to d the work is organized as follows in section 2 the model for the interactions of the sugarcane pest with its two parasitoids is presented in section 3 the control modeling for the system is presented in section 4 the simulations for the system also involving system pointwise controllability and pest management are shown finally in section 5 the work is concluded 2 dynamical model of the sugarcane borer with two parasitoids in this section we consider the age structured model in which two parasitoid species the egg parasitoid t galloi and the larval parasitoid c flavipes attack the egg and larval developmental the stages of the sugarcane borer d saccharalis respectively the host the sugarcane borer d saccharalis goes through two developmental stages an egg stage and a larval stage the egg stage is divided in two populations the unparasitized egg population x 1 and the parasitized egg population x 2 the larval stage is divided in two populations the unparasitized larval population x 4 and the parasitized larval population x 5 there are two adult parasitoid species the egg parasitoid t galloi x 3 and the larval parasitoid c flavipes x 6 both parasitoid species exhibit a type i functional responses with constant attack rates independent of host or parasitoid densities each parasitized host becomes multiple parasitoids the continuous time mathematical model that describes the interactions between the six populations densities described above is given by rafikov et al 2022 d x 1 d t r x 1 1 x 1 k m 1 x 1 n 1 x 1 α x 1 x 3 d x 2 d t α x 1 x 3 m 2 x 2 n 2 x 2 d x 3 d t γ 1 n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 1 d x 4 d t n 1 x 1 m 4 x 4 n 3 x 4 β x 4 x 6 d x 5 d t β x 4 x 6 m 5 x 5 n 4 x 5 d x 6 d t γ 2 n 4 x 5 m 6 x 6 the biological meaning of the model parameters given in 1 are shown in the table 1 due the model 1 two parasitoid species exhibit a type i functional responses with constant attack rates of host or parasitoid densities the functional response is defined as the relationship between host density and the number of hosts parasitized per unit time by a single parasitoid pervez and omkar 2005 tazerouni et al 2019 the type i functional responses are linearly increasing we note that this type of functional responses has theoretical limitations especially at extreme values of host or parasitoid populations abrams and ginzburg 2000 holling 1959 malard et al 2020 tazerouni et al 2019 in most host parasitoid ecosystems the relationship between host density and the number of parasitized hosts is not linear at very high or very little host densities tazerouni et al 2019 in these cases the number of parasitized hosts given by the model with the type i response may be higher than it happens in the host parasitoid ecosystem we use the model 1 to find optimal control strategies that avoid the extreme values of hosts and parasitoids in rafikov et al 2022 five equilibrium points of system 1 were obtained as e 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 e 2 k r r m 1 n 1 0 0 k n 1 r m 1 n 1 r m 4 n 3 0 0 2 e 3 k r r m 1 n 1 0 0 p 4 p 5 p 6 e 4 x 1 x 2 x 3 q 0 0 e 5 x 1 x 2 x 3

stability of each equilibrium point were shown time seasonal variations will be released in system 1 which will change its stability and it will no longer be possible to consider the stability of equilibrium points in this way chaotic dynamics can appear in the system several environmental situations such as air temperature air humidity and rainfall dispersion can affect the populations behavior and change parameters values introducing seasonal variation in the parameters of system 1 if the fluctuations are periodic as considered in this work the parameters can be represented as periodic time functions we considered the intrinsic growth rate r in system 1 as a sinusoidal function representing these seasonal variations the parameter r will have its values defined by the following function altizer et al 2006 gakkhar and naji 2003 rinaldi et al 1993 3 r t r 0 1 r 1 sin 2 π t 365 where t is measured in days so r 0 is the average value of r over an integer number of years the parameter r 1 represents the degree of seasonality hence r 0 r 1 is the magnitude of the perturbation in r fig 1 shows the temporal variation of the growth rate r for r 0 0 19 and r 1 0 85 during the planting of the cane to the harvest it is possible to identify abundant rains the increase in temperature and hours of sunshine a day favorable conditions for the growth of the cane the borer and the larvae parasitoid with the decrease in rainfall and the arrival of winter the parasitism rate declines in a process of numbness with the arrival of spring the population growth and parasitism cycle is reestablished 3 control modeling in the ecosystem consider the nonlinear dynamical system given by 4 x f x b x u f 0 0 z c x x where x r n denotes the state z r s denotes the system output u r m the control and f x r n r n and b x r n r n m are differentiable in all arguments the goal of the control problem is to find the vector function u that drives the system 4 from an initial state to zero minimizing the following cost functional 5 j u 0 z t q x z u t r x u d t where the matrix q x c t x c x r s r s s is symmetric positive semidefinite and the matrix r x r n r m m is symmetric positive definite we are assuming the functions f x b x q x and r x sufficiently smooth the non linear system 4 can be present in a similar form to the linear one by using direct parametrization factorization with matrices dependent on state variables banks et al 2007 6 x a x x b x u z c x x where 7 f x a x x the system 6 is pointwise controllable and observable in the linear sense for a region in neighborhood ω about the origin mracek and cloutier 1996 1998 for controllability and observability from the autonomous problem x a x b u z c x in this neighborhood this mean full rank respectively for the matrices 8 m c b a b a n 1 b m o c c a c a n 1 as we are considering the state dependent riccati equations sdre technique the solutions to the control problem 4 5 consists of obtaining pointwise solutions i e solutions for small time interval evaluating the calculations of the control problem by the hamiltonian the non linear feedback control functions are obtained by 9 u r 1 x b t x p x x where the matrix p x is symmetric and positive definite to all the values of x and obtained from the solution of the riccati equation with state dependent matrices for initial system values 10 p x a x a t x p x p x b x r 1 x b t x p x q x 0 we notice that obtain the riccati solution analytically may not be possible due the complex invertibility of the matrices dependent on state variables therefore some numerical features are necessary which we describe in the following steps the sdre technique to obtain a suboptimal solution for the control problem 5 10 has the following procedure molter et al 2010 step 1 define the space state model in the state dependent coefficient form eqs 6 and 7 step 2 measure the state of the system x t i e define x 0 x 0 and choose the coefficients of weight matrices q x and r x step 3 solve the riccati eq 10 for the state x t considering pointwise solutions i e solve p a a t p p b r 1 b t p q 0 for each step step 4 calculate the control functions from 9 step 5 integrate the system 6 and update the state of the system x t with this results go to step 3 4 main results the management of the sugarcane pest in the field in our proposal is done by controlling the eggs and larvae of the d saccharalis therefore control functions will be introduced in system 1 according to the formulation 4 and 6 respectively in the equations of the two parasitoids t galloi population x 3 and c flavipes population x 6 the biological control strategy consists of releasing parasitoids based on the theory of optimal control the system 1 with control has the following form d x 1 d t r x 1 1 x 1 k m 1 x 1 n 1 x 1 α x 1 x 3 d x 2 d t α x 1 x 3 m 2 x 2 n 2 x 2 d x 3 d t γ 1 n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 u 1 11 d x 4 d t n 1 x 1 m 4 x 4 n 3 x

parasitoids let x 1 and x 4 be the value of the desired level of pests below the economic damage threshold the parameters of the desired equilibrium point that correspond to this value can be found from the system r x 1 1 x 1 k m 1 x 1 n 1 x 1 α x 1 x 3 0 α x 1 x 3 m 2 x 2 n 2 x 2 0 γ 1 n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 u 1 0 12 n 1 x 1 m 4 x 4 n 3 x 4 β x 4 x 6 0 β x 4 x 6 m 5 x 5 n 4 x 5 0 γ 2 n 4 x 5 m 6 x 6 u 2 0 considering the equilibrium eqs 12 the variables of system 11 can be written with deviations as x 1 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 x 3 y 3 x 3 x 4 y 4 x 4 13 x 5 y 5 x 5 x 6 y 6 x 6 u 1 u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 u 2 where y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 and y 6 are the variables with deviations u 1 and u 2 are the control that ensures the value of x 1 and x 4 u 1 and u 2 are the control that stabilizes the system at the desired equilibrium point substituting 13 into 11 and admitting 12 we get the following perturbed system 14 x x a x x b u a x x b u which results in the system in terms of y using the direct parametrization show in 6 as 15 y a y y b u s c y y in system 15 considering deviations 13 the matrices dependent on state variables a and c are see box i 16 c 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 note that the parametrization of matrix a is not unique other parameterizations can be used as long as the controllability of the system is guaranteed this form of matrix c means that only x 1 x 2 x 4 and x 5 are observable populations since they can be monitored on the field the t galloi and the c flavipes x 3 and x 6 respectively are flyers therefore they are not harvested considering the sdre control technique the weight coefficients q and r of the functional 5 can be choosing as state independent once the a b q and r matrices are determined the feedback control u for each state can be calculated as 17 u r 1 b t p y where the matrix p is symmetric and defined positive for all the values of state y and is obtained from the solution of the matrix algebraic riccati equation 18 p a a t p p b r 1 b t p q 0 system 11 is integrated and control u is obtained for each integration step in this way the solution for the controlled system 11 is obtained the simulations for the application of the optimal pest control strategy on the agroecosystem were carried out with the values of the parameters given in parra et al 2002 rafikov and de holanda limeira 2012 rafikov and silveira 2014 and

the equilibrium point of system 1 without seasonality is e 2 8553 0 0 47 352 0 0 the economic damage threshold edt of the sugarcane borer in the sugarcane crop is known and its value is 2500 larvae hectare molnár et al 2016 parra et al 2002 rafikov and silveira 2014 the system dynamics considers a sugarcane crop to be susceptible to pests which means that the stem of the plants must already be formed as shown in rafikov et al 2022 with the parameter values specified there without seasonality that is r 1 0 in 3 depending on the value of α 0 169 1 0 4 the attractor in the phase space can be an equilibrium point in this case the coexistence of populations e 5 or a limit cycle the addition of seasonality to the model through the population growth rate according to 3 induces a destabilizing effect and may even trigger chaotic behavior however the control will only be taken into account for the equilibrium point e 2 where there is a great invasion of pests in the crop time series of population density variation without seasonality are show in fig 2 the equilibrium point is e 2 and initial conditions are 1000 100 100 1000 100 300 fig 2 shows that after a short initial period below the economic damage threshold the sugarcane borer population remains above this threshold requiring application of control the addition of seasonality to the model through the population growth rate according to 3 show the considerable influence of seasonality on the dynamics of the agroecosystem fig 3 shows the dynamics of populations x 1 and x 4 considering seasonality which means the equilibrium point will no longer be e 2 since seasonality induces a destabilizing effect from fig 3 we can observe when considering seasonality there are periods in which sugarcane borer population exceeds the threshold of economic damage as time progresses after a year the invasion of pests in the crop becomes more intense therefore pest management must be carried out over a considerable period of sugarcane cultivation 4 1 system controllability in this section we will demonstrate that the system 1 cannot be controlled by only one control function u 1 or u 2 we consider the matrix a eq 16 of the system 15 in following form 19 a a 11 0 a 13 0 0 0 a 21 a 22 a 23 0 0 0 0 a 32 a 34 0 0 0 a 41 0 0 a 44 0 a 46 0 0 0 a 54 a 55 a 56 0 0 0 0 a 65 a 66 where the elements a i j contain the same values as matrix a in 16 first we consider the system 15 controlled only by u 1 in this case the matrix b is 20 b 0 0 1 0 0 0 t and the pointwise controllability matrix m c in 8 is obtained by 21 m c 0 a 13 b 1 c 1 d 1 e 1 0 a 23 b 2 c 2 d 2 e 2 1 a 33 b 3 c 3 d 3 e 3 0 0 b 4 c 4 d 4 e 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 where b 1 a 11 a 13 a 13 a 33 b 2 a 21 a 13 a 22 a 23 a 23 a 33 b 3 a 32 a 23 a 33 a 33 c 1 a 11 b 1 a 13 b 3 c 2 a 21 b 1 a 22 b 2 a 23 b 3 c 3 a 32 b 2 a 33 b 3 d 1 a 11 c 1 a 13 c 3 d 2 a 21 c 1 a 22 c 2 a 23 c 3 d 3 a 32 c 2 a 33 c 3 e 1 a 11 d 1 a 13 d 3 e 2 a 21 d 1 a 22 d 2 a 23 d

the system 15 cannot be controlled by only the control function u 1 now we consider the system 15 controlled only by u 2 in this case the matrix b is 22 b 0 0 0 0 0 1 t and the pointwise controllability matrix m c in 8 is obtained by 23 m c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 46 b 4 c 4 d 4 e 4 0 a 56 b 5 c 5 d 5 e 5 1 a 66 b 6 c 6 d 6 e 6 where b 4 a 44 a 46 a 46 a 66 b 5 a 54 a 46 a 55 a 56 a 56 a 66 b 6 a 65 a 56 a 66 a 66 c 4 a 44 b 4 a 46 b 6 c 5 a 54 b 4 a 55 b 5 a 56 b 6 c 6 a 65 b 5 a 66 b 6 d 4 a 44 c 4 a 46 c 6 d 5 a 54 c 4 a 55 c 5 a 56 c 6 d 6 a 65 c 5 a 66 c 6 e 4 a 44 d 4 a 46 d 6 e 5 a 54 d 4 a 55 d 5 a 56 d 6 e 6 a 65 d 5 a 66 d 6 from 23 we can conclude that the pointwise controllability matrix m c has not a full rank and the system 15 cannot be controlled by only the control function u 2 finally we consider the system 15 controlled by two control functions u 1 and u 2 in this case the matrix b get the following form 24 b 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t and the pointwise controllability matrix is obtained by 25 m c 0 0 a 13 0 b 1 0 c 1 0 d 1 0 e 1 0 0 0 a 23 0 b 2 0 c 2 0 d 2 0 e 2 0 1 0 a 33 0 b 3 0 c 3 0 d 3 0 e 3 0 0 0 0 a 46 b 4 b 4 c 4 c 4 d 4 d 4 e

has full rank and the system 15 can be controlled by the control functions u 1 and u 2 4 2 pest management through continuous sdre control in order to start the control before reaching the level of economic damage we chose x 4 2000 larvae hectare for the larvae density below economic damage however there is no known economic damage threshold to eggs also there is no way to calculate this level from the algebraic system 12 as there are more variables than equations for continuous control of system 1 without seasonality the equilibrium point e 2 will be analyzed at point e 2 there is a large invasion of pests according to the controllability analysis carried out in section 4 1 the system can only be controlled using the two control functions u 1 and u 2 the economic damage threshold to eggs x 1 is not known otherwise we are only interested in positive solutions of system 12 since all unknowns are population densities this means that it is possible to determine a range of values of x 1 that result in positive solutions for system 12 considering x 4 2000 and integer positive values for x 1 this range of values is 362 x 1 8552 therefore we choose x 1 400 eggs hectare and the other values of the desired equilibrium point calculated from the system 12 and taking only integer values are u 1 1530 t galloi hectare day u 2 4673 c flavipes hectare day x 2 169 parasitized eggs hectare x 3 6196 t galloi hectare x 5 75 parasitized larvae hectare and x 6 24 300 c flavipes hectare matrix r d i a g 1 0 1 using the two control functions u 1 and u 2 the time trajectories of the controlled system 11 without seasonality are shown in figs 4 and 5 the control functions variation u 1 t and u 2 t are shown in fig 6 for system 11 with seasonality time series of the controlled population density variation are similar to the one shown in figs 4 5 and 6 in this case pest invasions no longer appear the results presented in figs 4 6 are in agreement with those indicated in the works botelho et al 1999 and nava et al 2009 which indicate that when large invasion of the sugarcane pest occurs the management should be doing with the two parasitoids x 3 and x 6 to minimize the economic injury 4 3 pest management through impulsive control the pest control proposed for a sugarcane field in section 4 2 suggests a daily release of parasitoids this form of pest management can become expensive and impractical since it requires human labor to perform the tasks inherent to the control a possible application can be done through a weekly decision or more than one week on the release of parasitoids using impulsive control barclay et al 1970 rafikov et al 2012 tang and cheke 2008 if at the moment of decision making the pest density is below the decision level of economic damage a number of parasitoids are released throughout all the simulation period parasitoids are only released when the weekly pest harvesting shows a level of pest above the decision level taken as x 1 400 and x 4 2000 the same values used in continuous control the system equilibrium point is e 2 the growth of the populations x 1 t and x 4 t in a period of one week can quickly overcome the threshold of economic damage therefore x 4 2000 was chosen as the decision level when the pest population reaches the decision levels the artificial release of both parasitoids will be performed therefore the model for this control has the form x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x 2 t x 3 t x 3 t η 26 x 4 t x 4 t x 5 t x 5 t x 6 t x 6 t ν where x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t x 4 t x 5 t and x 6 t denote the populations after each application of biological control at time t and η 0 and ν 0 are the constant numbers of egg parasitoids and larvae parasitoids respectively released in time t once the pest population reaches the decision levels x 1 and x 4 t denotes the time from which the application of control occurs which can assume more than one value depending on the need to release parasitoids i e each time the pests reach x 1 and x 4 values note that an impulsive disturbance at time t in 26 is equivalent to an instantaneous change in the state x at time t there is an impulsive jump this change occurs only in the parasitoid populations with the addition of both populations η t galloi hectare and ν c flavipes hectare respectively the state then follows the trajectory with the new initial condition x t until the occurrence of the next transition time instant when the decision level is reached again computer simulations are now conducted considering impulsive control in pest management figs 7 and 8 show the time trajectories of system 1 without considering seasonality and using the impulsive control strategy 26 with the decision levels for the release of parasitoids x 1 400 x 4 2000 and release of parasitoids η 30 000 and ν 20 000 all values of η and ν were chosen so that there was no need to release parasitoids for periods of less than one week considering the possibility of weekly monitoring of pests as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 parasitoids are released for periods longer than one week considering the system 1 with seasonality and the impulsive control strategy 26 figs 9 and 10 show the time trajectories of each population for parasitoid release to be at least weekly the value of η must be greater than without seasonality therefore the values of η and ν are η 50 000 and ν 15 000 one can note in figs 9 and 10 that there is only t galloi release in the first weeks 4 4 pest management through impulsive and sdre control as discussed in bezerra et al 2021 it can be more expensive to carry out a daily parasitoid release program proposed in continuous control thus in the past subsection performed an impulsive control along with the fixed release of parasitoids in the previous section this release can be done using a weekly decision through the function u u u in which u is determined by eq 9 then if at the observation moment the pest densities are above the economic damage level a number of parasitoids calculated from control u is activated otherwise the system 11 is solved with u u 1 u 2 0 0 the decision levels are chosen as x 1 400 and x 4 2000 as the growth of the populations in a week can quickly overcome the economic damage level hence the control threshold has to be a bit below the economic damage level of 2500 larvae the weekly control process using sdre technique is summarized by these following steps 1 if x 1 x 1 and x 4 x 4 system 11 is solved with u 0 2 if x 1 x 1 or x 4 x 4 then the steps below are used 3 calculate the deviations from the desired regime y i x i x i i 1 2 6 eq 13 4 calculate matrix a eq 16 with the values of y found in step 3 5 use 18 to obtain matrix p 6 use 17 to calculate u 7 calculate the control value u u u 8 if x 1 400 then η u 1 otherwise η 0 if x 4 2000 then ν u 2 otherwise ν 0 9 solve the system 11 with the updated values from the previous step where x 1 x 2 x 3 η x 4 x 5 x 6 ν are the initial condition of the system in figs 11 and 12 the controlled populations are shown being below the economic damage threshold matrix r d i a g 0 0001 0 001 for the system without seasonality we notice that although not shown in this work other values of the matrix r were tested those with the best results were chosen on the other hand in bioeconomic models a more in depth discussion could be carried out on the influence of the values of the matrix r on the production costs of parasitoids which is not in the scope of this work the parasitoid release time to control the system without seasonality are shown in figs 13 and 14 the controlled system behavior with seasonality and the impulsive releases calculated by u u u are shown in figs 15 16 matrix r d i a g 0 001 0 1 the parasitoid release time to control the system with seasonality are shown in figs 17 and 18 the comparative results between impulsive control section 4 3 and impulsive control with sdre section 4 4 is outlined below here we consider the amount of parasitoids that were released through the control strategy over a period of 400 days for the system without seasonality and 800 days for the system with seasonality impulsive control without seasonality total of η 660 000 total of ν 90 000 impulsive control with seasonality total of η 1 450 000 total of ν 375 000 impulsive control without seasonality sdre total of u 1 649 960 total of u 2 173 320 impulsive control with seasonality sdre total of u 1 1 445 400 total of u 2 229 400 from these results one can observe that the amount of parasitoids released in the system to control the pest with the coupling control strategy impulsive and sdre is smaller as the parasitoids released only by impulsive control although this difference is relatively small 5 conclusions in this work are proposed strategies of the biological control of the main sugarcane pest d saccharalis using optimal control theory a continuous time mathematical model that describes the interactions between the sugarcane borer its egg and larval parasitoid considering six population densities was used a seasonal population dynamics was included in the mathematical model three control methodologies were proposed continuous control via sdre impulsive control with considering periodic pulses and the coupling of these two controls continuous and impulsive a study of the system pointwise controllability was carried out in which it was shown that there is only controllability using the two control functions u 1 and u 2 representing the egg and larvae parasitoids respectively this controllability result is general for this system since it does not depend on the values of the system parameters in field applications such as the works da silva miguel et al 2018 and nava et al 2009 impulsive release of parasitoids is indicated through the three control methodologies that were analyzed in this work from the simulations the pest management via impulsive control results was best since the smallest release of parasitoids occurs considering the amount of parasitoids released in the system the best result of the control was obtained by coupling the impulsive control and the sdre control the present results help understand the controlled dynamics of the six dimensional agroecological system with the seasonal forcing and considering the use of two parasitoids in the

24205,the purpose of this work is to study an interaction between the sugarcane borer and its parasitoids trichogramma galloi and cotesia flavipes the interaction between these populations is modeled by a host parasitoid system considering six ordinary differential equations the purpose of mathematical modeling is to answer two important issues is it possible to control the sugarcane pest only with the egg parasitoid or the larvae parasitoid or do you need both among the control methodologies analyzed in this work which could be the most appropriate for pest management three control methodologies are proposed continuous control impulsive control and the coupling of these two controls continuous and impulsive computer simulations are provided and their results discussed keywords sugarcane borer biological control parasitoids sdre impulsive control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the last decades economic interest in the production of sugarcane has grown significantly especially due to its importance for the production of sugar and ethanol the most important sugarcane pest is the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis it causes damage from the third month after planting where the cane is in the tillering stage and its population growth is also favored by high rainfall levels and high temperatures spring and summer the newborn larvae scrape the leaves and pierce the softer part of the sugarcane stalk building internal galleries causing direct damage that results in the death of the sprout dry leaves weight loss and atrophy as well as indirect damage when there is contamination by yeasts that cause rot in the stems decreasing the purity of the sugarcane juice and increasing the loss of industrial yield in the sugar and alcohol production process aya et al 2017 macedo and botelho 1988 parra et al 2002 vargas et al 2015 the only viable and efficient option to the control is biological control which consists of reducing the pest population using parasitoids it is impossible to use insecticides against the sugarcane borer in the larval stage as the larva is found inside the plant the wasp cotesia flavipes is the most important parasitoid of the sugarcane borer and in the egg stage the main parasitoid is the trichogramma galloi and both used in biological control in brazil parra et al 2002 parra and junior 2019 the wasps are reared in laboratories and are released on plantations infested with borers considering the biological control of the sugarcane borer the objective of this work was to answer two main questions is it possible to control the sugarcane borer only with the egg parasitoid or the larvae parasitoid or do you need both among the control methodologies analyzed which could be the most appropriate for pest management to answer these questions a mathematical modeling of pest control should be applied several host parasitoid discrete and continuous time models were reviewed in mills and getz 1996 the age structured model in which two parasitoid species attack different development all stages of a single host species was proposed in briggs 1993 due this model the host goes through three developmental stages an egg stage a larval stage and an adult stage there are two parasitoid species each having an immature and an adult stage both species exhibit a type i functional responses with constant attack rates independent of host or parasitoid densities each parasitized host becomes a single juvenile parasitoid a functional of type i was also considered in tonnang et al 2009 where the authors modeled the biological control of plutella xylostella using its exotic larval parasitoid diadegma semiclausum based on the statistical data a model like the above mentioned model was used in molnár et al 2016 in this case the host goes through two developmental stages an egg stage and a larval stage and there are two adult parasitoid species in rafikov et al 2022 was proposed an age structured model in which two parasitoid species the egg parasitoid t galloi and the larval parasitoid c flavipes attack the egg and larval development all the stages of the sugarcane borer d saccharalis respectively seasonal perturbations bezerra et al 2021 rinaldi et al 1993 wissinger 1989 zhang et al 2012 were also considered in the mathematical modeling and in the controlled system in biological control a certain number of parasitoids are released in an instant in control theory this control is called impulsive these releases can be periodic when they happen at equal intervals optimal control theory of continuous dynamic time systems operates with continuous control functions i e parasitoid releases must be performed at every moment three strategies are considered the first strategy using the state dependent riccati equation sdre method banks et al 2007 mracek and cloutier 1996 1998 we determine strategies in continuous form this strategy can become costly and impractical since it requires human labor to perform the tasks inherent to the control the second strategy is impulsive control are made weekly decisions or more than one week on the release of parasitoids the third strategy is impulsive and sdre control to use parasitoid release in amounts calculated by sdre only at times when pest density exceeds the level of economic damage comparisons are made between the results of the second and third control strategies based on the works of botelho et al 1999 and nava et al 2009 the purpose of this work is to control pests using the associated release of the parasitoid from the egg and the larvae when a large invasion of the sugarcane pest occurs the management with only a single parasitoid may not be enough to control the pests and minimize the economic injury hence the association of egg and larval parasitoids is recommended for the control of d saccharalis the pointwise controllability of the agroecosystem is analyzed and through the system pointwise controllability it is shown that in fact the population dynamics proposed in this work can only be controlled using two control functions computer simulations will be carried out to show the best answers to the questions formulated above and to show the results obtained from the proposed control methodologies the codes performed using the numeric computing platform matlab for the generation of figures in the manuscript are available in appendices a to d the work is organized as follows in section 2 the model for the interactions of the sugarcane pest with its two parasitoids is presented in section 3 the control modeling for the system is presented in section 4 the simulations for the system also involving system pointwise controllability and pest management are shown finally in section 5 the work is concluded 2 dynamical model of the sugarcane borer with two parasitoids in this section we consider the age structured model in which two parasitoid species the egg parasitoid t galloi and the larval parasitoid c flavipes attack the egg and larval developmental the stages of the sugarcane borer d saccharalis respectively the host the sugarcane borer d saccharalis goes through two developmental stages an egg stage and a larval stage the egg stage is divided in two populations the unparasitized egg population x 1 and the parasitized egg population x 2 the larval stage is divided in two populations the unparasitized larval population x 4 and the parasitized larval population x 5 there are two adult parasitoid species the egg parasitoid t galloi x 3 and the larval parasitoid c flavipes x 6 both parasitoid species exhibit a type i functional responses with constant attack rates independent of host or parasitoid densities each parasitized host becomes multiple parasitoids the continuous time mathematical model that describes the interactions between the six populations densities described above is given by rafikov et al 2022 d x 1 d t r x 1 1 x 1 k m 1 x 1 n 1 x 1 α x 1 x 3 d x 2 d t α x 1 x 3 m 2 x 2 n 2 x 2 d x 3 d t γ 1 n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 1 d x 4 d t n 1 x 1 m 4 x 4 n 3 x 4 β x 4 x 6 d x 5 d t β x 4 x 6 m 5 x 5 n 4 x 5 d x 6 d t γ 2 n 4 x 5 m 6 x 6 the biological meaning of the model parameters given in 1 are shown in the table 1 due the model 1 two parasitoid species exhibit a type i functional responses with constant attack rates of host or parasitoid densities the functional response is defined as the relationship between host density and the number of hosts parasitized per unit time by a single parasitoid pervez and omkar 2005 tazerouni et al 2019 the type i functional responses are linearly increasing we note that this type of functional responses has theoretical limitations especially at extreme values of host or parasitoid populations abrams and ginzburg 2000 holling 1959 malard et al 2020 tazerouni et al 2019 in most host parasitoid ecosystems the relationship between host density and the number of parasitized hosts is not linear at very high or very little host densities tazerouni et al 2019 in these cases the number of parasitized hosts given by the model with the type i response may be higher than it happens in the host parasitoid ecosystem we use the model 1 to find optimal control strategies that avoid the extreme values of hosts and parasitoids in rafikov et al 2022 five equilibrium points of system 1 were obtained as e 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 e 2 k r r m 1 n 1 0 0 k n 1 r m 1 n 1 r m 4 n 3 0 0 2 e 3 k r r m 1 n 1 0 0 p 4 p 5 p 6 e 4 x 1 x 2 x 3 q 0 0 e 5 x 1 x 2 x 3

extinction of the larvae parasitoid and parasitized larvae populations and coexistence of all populations the values with above are given as follows x 1 m 3 m 2 n 2 α γ 1 n 2 x 3 1 α r 1 m 3 m 2 n 2 α

stability of each equilibrium point were shown time seasonal variations will be released in system 1 which will change its stability and it will no longer be possible to consider the stability of equilibrium points in this way chaotic dynamics can appear in the system several environmental situations such as air temperature air humidity and rainfall dispersion can affect the populations behavior and change parameters values introducing seasonal variation in the parameters of system 1 if the fluctuations are periodic as considered in this work the parameters can be represented as periodic time functions we considered the intrinsic growth rate r in system 1 as a sinusoidal function representing these seasonal variations the parameter r will have its values defined by the following function altizer et al 2006 gakkhar and naji 2003 rinaldi et al 1993 3 r t r 0 1 r 1 sin 2 π t 365 where t is measured in days so r 0 is the average value of r over an integer number of years the parameter r 1 represents the degree of seasonality hence r 0 r 1 is the magnitude of the perturbation in r fig 1 shows the temporal variation of the growth rate r for r 0 0 19 and r 1 0 85 during the planting of the cane to the harvest it is possible to identify abundant rains the increase in temperature and hours of sunshine a day favorable conditions for the growth of the cane the borer and the larvae parasitoid with the decrease in rainfall and the arrival of winter the parasitism rate declines in a process of numbness with the arrival of spring the population growth and parasitism cycle is reestablished 3 control modeling in the ecosystem consider the nonlinear dynamical system given by 4 x f x b x u f 0 0 z c x x where x r n denotes the state z r s denotes the system output u r m the control and f x r n r n and b x r n r n m are differentiable in all arguments the goal of the control problem is to find the vector function u that drives the system 4 from an initial state to zero minimizing the following cost functional 5 j u 0 z t q x z u t r x u d t where the matrix q x c t x c x r s r s s is symmetric positive semidefinite and the matrix r x r n r m m is symmetric positive definite we are assuming the functions f x b x q x and r x sufficiently smooth the non linear system 4 can be present in a similar form to the linear one by using direct parametrization factorization with matrices dependent on state variables banks et al 2007 6 x a x x b x u z c x x where 7 f x a x x the system 6 is pointwise controllable and observable in the linear sense for a region in neighborhood ω about the origin mracek and cloutier 1996 1998 for controllability and observability from the autonomous problem x a x b u z c x in this neighborhood this mean full rank respectively for the matrices 8 m c b a b a n 1 b m o c c a c a n 1 as we are considering the state dependent riccati equations sdre technique the solutions to the control problem 4 5 consists of obtaining pointwise solutions i e solutions for small time interval evaluating the calculations of the control problem by the hamiltonian the non linear feedback control functions are obtained by 9 u r 1 x b t x p x x where the matrix p x is symmetric and positive definite to all the values of x and obtained from the solution of the riccati equation with state dependent matrices for initial system values 10 p x a x a t x p x p x b x r 1 x b t x p x q x 0 we notice that obtain the riccati solution analytically may not be possible due the complex invertibility of the matrices dependent on state variables therefore some numerical features are necessary which we describe in the following steps the sdre technique to obtain a suboptimal solution for the control problem 5 10 has the following procedure molter et al 2010 step 1 define the space state model in the state dependent coefficient form eqs 6 and 7 step 2 measure the state of the system x t i e define x 0 x 0 and choose the coefficients of weight matrices q x and r x step 3 solve the riccati eq 10 for the state x t considering pointwise solutions i e solve p a a t p p b r 1 b t p q 0 for each step step 4 calculate the control functions from 9 step 5 integrate the system 6 and update the state of the system x t with this results go to step 3 4 main results the management of the sugarcane pest in the field in our proposal is done by controlling the eggs and larvae of the d saccharalis therefore control functions will be introduced in system 1 according to the formulation 4 and 6 respectively in the equations of the two parasitoids t galloi population x 3 and c flavipes population x 6 the biological control strategy consists of releasing parasitoids based on the theory of optimal control the system 1 with control has the following form d x 1 d t r x 1 1 x 1 k m 1 x 1 n 1 x 1 α x 1 x 3 d x 2 d t α x 1 x 3 m 2 x 2 n 2 x 2 d x 3 d t γ 1 n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 u 1 11 d x 4 d t n 1 x 1 m 4 x 4 n 3 x

parasitoids let x 1 and x 4 be the value of the desired level of pests below the economic damage threshold the parameters of the desired equilibrium point that correspond to this value can be found from the system r x 1 1 x 1 k m 1 x 1 n 1 x 1 α x 1 x 3 0 α x 1 x 3 m 2 x 2 n 2 x 2 0 γ 1 n 2 x 2 m 3 x 3 u 1 0 12 n 1 x 1 m 4 x 4 n 3 x 4 β x 4 x 6 0 β x 4 x 6 m 5 x 5 n 4 x 5 0 γ 2 n 4 x 5 m 6 x 6 u 2 0 considering the equilibrium eqs 12 the variables of system 11 can be written with deviations as x 1 y 1 x 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 x 3 y 3 x 3 x 4 y 4 x 4 13 x 5 y 5 x 5 x 6 y 6 x 6 u 1 u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 u 2 where y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 and y 6 are the variables with deviations u 1 and u 2 are the control that ensures the value of x 1 and x 4 u 1 and u 2 are the control that stabilizes the system at the desired equilibrium point substituting 13 into 11 and admitting 12 we get the following perturbed system 14 x x a x x b u a x x b u which results in the system in terms of y using the direct parametrization show in 6 as 15 y a y y b u s c y y in system 15 considering deviations 13 the matrices dependent on state variables a and c are see box i 16 c 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 note that the parametrization of matrix a is not unique other parameterizations can be used as long as the controllability of the system is guaranteed this form of matrix c means that only x 1 x 2 x 4 and x 5 are observable populations since they can be monitored on the field the t galloi and the c flavipes x 3 and x 6 respectively are flyers therefore they are not harvested considering the sdre control technique the weight coefficients q and r of the functional 5 can be choosing as state independent once the a b q and r matrices are determined the feedback control u for each state can be calculated as 17 u r 1 b t p y where the matrix p is symmetric and defined positive for all the values of state y and is obtained from the solution of the matrix algebraic riccati equation 18 p a a t p p b r 1 b t p q 0 system 11 is integrated and control u is obtained for each integration step in this way the solution for the controlled system 11 is obtained the simulations for the application of the optimal pest control strategy on the agroecosystem were carried out with the values of the parameters given in parra et al 2002 rafikov and de holanda limeira 2012 rafikov and silveira 2014 and

the equilibrium point of system 1 without seasonality is e 2 8553 0 0 47 352 0 0 the economic damage threshold edt of the sugarcane borer in the sugarcane crop is known and its value is 2500 larvae hectare molnár et al 2016 parra et al 2002 rafikov and silveira 2014 the system dynamics considers a sugarcane crop to be susceptible to pests which means that the stem of the plants must already be formed as shown in rafikov et al 2022 with the parameter values specified there without seasonality that is r 1 0 in 3 depending on the value of α 0 169 1 0 4 the attractor in the phase space can be an equilibrium point in this case the coexistence of populations e 5 or a limit cycle the addition of seasonality to the model through the population growth rate according to 3 induces a destabilizing effect and may even trigger chaotic behavior however the control will only be taken into account for the equilibrium point e 2 where there is a great invasion of pests in the crop time series of population density variation without seasonality are show in fig 2 the equilibrium point is e 2 and initial conditions are 1000 100 100 1000 100 300 fig 2 shows that after a short initial period below the economic damage threshold the sugarcane borer population remains above this threshold requiring application of control the addition of seasonality to the model through the population growth rate according to 3 show the considerable influence of seasonality on the dynamics of the agroecosystem fig 3 shows the dynamics of populations x 1 and x 4 considering seasonality which means the equilibrium point will no longer be e 2 since seasonality induces a destabilizing effect from fig 3 we can observe when considering seasonality there are periods in which sugarcane borer population exceeds the threshold of economic damage as time progresses after a year the invasion of pests in the crop becomes more intense therefore pest management must be carried out over a considerable period of sugarcane cultivation 4 1 system controllability in this section we will demonstrate that the system 1 cannot be controlled by only one control function u 1 or u 2 we consider the matrix a eq 16 of the system 15 in following form 19 a a 11 0 a 13 0 0 0 a 21 a 22 a 23 0 0 0 0 a 32 a 34 0 0 0 a 41 0 0 a 44 0 a 46 0 0 0 a 54 a 55 a 56 0 0 0 0 a 65 a 66 where the elements a i j contain the same values as matrix a in 16 first we consider the system 15 controlled only by u 1 in this case the matrix b is 20 b 0 0 1 0 0 0 t and the pointwise controllability matrix m c in 8 is obtained by 21 m c 0 a 13 b 1 c 1 d 1 e 1 0 a 23 b 2 c 2 d 2 e 2 1 a 33 b 3 c 3 d 3 e 3 0 0 b 4 c 4 d 4 e 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 where b 1 a 11 a 13 a 13 a 33 b 2 a 21 a 13 a 22 a 23 a 23 a 33 b 3 a 32 a 23 a 33 a 33 c 1 a 11 b 1 a 13 b 3 c 2 a 21 b 1 a 22 b 2 a 23 b 3 c 3 a 32 b 2 a 33 b 3 d 1 a 11 c 1 a 13 c 3 d 2 a 21 c 1 a 22 c 2 a 23 c 3 d 3 a 32 c 2 a 33 c 3 e 1 a 11 d 1 a 13 d 3 e 2 a 21 d 1 a 22 d 2 a 23 d

the system 15 cannot be controlled by only the control function u 1 now we consider the system 15 controlled only by u 2 in this case the matrix b is 22 b 0 0 0 0 0 1 t and the pointwise controllability matrix m c in 8 is obtained by 23 m c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a 46 b 4 c 4 d 4 e 4 0 a 56 b 5 c 5 d 5 e 5 1 a 66 b 6 c 6 d 6 e 6 where b 4 a 44 a 46 a 46 a 66 b 5 a 54 a 46 a 55 a 56 a 56 a 66 b 6 a 65 a 56 a 66 a 66 c 4 a 44 b 4 a 46 b 6 c 5 a 54 b 4 a 55 b 5 a 56 b 6 c 6 a 65 b 5 a 66 b 6 d 4 a 44 c 4 a 46 c 6 d 5 a 54 c 4 a 55 c 5 a 56 c 6 d 6 a 65 c 5 a 66 c 6 e 4 a 44 d 4 a 46 d 6 e 5 a 54 d 4 a 55 d 5 a 56 d 6 e 6 a 65 d 5 a 66 d 6 from 23 we can conclude that the pointwise controllability matrix m c has not a full rank and the system 15 cannot be controlled by only the control function u 2 finally we consider the system 15 controlled by two control functions u 1 and u 2 in this case the matrix b get the following form 24 b 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t and the pointwise controllability matrix is obtained by 25 m c 0 0 a 13 0 b 1 0 c 1 0 d 1 0 e 1 0 0 0 a 23 0 b 2 0 c 2 0 d 2 0 e 2 0 1 0 a 33 0 b 3 0 c 3 0 d 3 0 e 3 0 0 0 0 a 46 b 4 b 4 c 4 c 4 d 4 d 4 e

has full rank and the system 15 can be controlled by the control functions u 1 and u 2 4 2 pest management through continuous sdre control in order to start the control before reaching the level of economic damage we chose x 4 2000 larvae hectare for the larvae density below economic damage however there is no known economic damage threshold to eggs also there is no way to calculate this level from the algebraic system 12 as there are more variables than equations for continuous control of system 1 without seasonality the equilibrium point e 2 will be analyzed at point e 2 there is a large invasion of pests according to the controllability analysis carried out in section 4 1 the system can only be controlled using the two control functions u 1 and u 2 the economic damage threshold to eggs x 1 is not known otherwise we are only interested in positive solutions of system 12 since all unknowns are population densities this means that it is possible to determine a range of values of x 1 that result in positive solutions for system 12 considering x 4 2000 and integer positive values for x 1 this range of values is 362 x 1 8552 therefore we choose x 1 400 eggs hectare and the other values of the desired equilibrium point calculated from the system 12 and taking only integer values are u 1 1530 t galloi hectare day u 2 4673 c flavipes hectare day x 2 169 parasitized eggs hectare x 3 6196 t galloi hectare x 5 75 parasitized larvae hectare and x 6 24 300 c flavipes hectare matrix r d i a g 1 0 1 using the two control functions u 1 and u 2 the time trajectories of the controlled system 11 without seasonality are shown in figs 4 and 5 the control functions variation u 1 t and u 2 t are shown in fig 6 for system 11 with seasonality time series of the controlled population density variation are similar to the one shown in figs 4 5 and 6 in this case pest invasions no longer appear the results presented in figs 4 6 are in agreement with those indicated in the works botelho et al 1999 and nava et al 2009 which indicate that when large invasion of the sugarcane pest occurs the management should be doing with the two parasitoids x 3 and x 6 to minimize the economic injury 4 3 pest management through impulsive control the pest control proposed for a sugarcane field in section 4 2 suggests a daily release of parasitoids this form of pest management can become expensive and impractical since it requires human labor to perform the tasks inherent to the control a possible application can be done through a weekly decision or more than one week on the release of parasitoids using impulsive control barclay et al 1970 rafikov et al 2012 tang and cheke 2008 if at the moment of decision making the pest density is below the decision level of economic damage a number of parasitoids are released throughout all the simulation period parasitoids are only released when the weekly pest harvesting shows a level of pest above the decision level taken as x 1 400 and x 4 2000 the same values used in continuous control the system equilibrium point is e 2 the growth of the populations x 1 t and x 4 t in a period of one week can quickly overcome the threshold of economic damage therefore x 4 2000 was chosen as the decision level when the pest population reaches the decision levels the artificial release of both parasitoids will be performed therefore the model for this control has the form x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x 2 t x 3 t x 3 t η 26 x 4 t x 4 t x 5 t x 5 t x 6 t x 6 t ν where x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t x 4 t x 5 t and x 6 t denote the populations after each application of biological control at time t and η 0 and ν 0 are the constant numbers of egg parasitoids and larvae parasitoids respectively released in time t once the pest population reaches the decision levels x 1 and x 4 t denotes the time from which the application of control occurs which can assume more than one value depending on the need to release parasitoids i e each time the pests reach x 1 and x 4 values note that an impulsive disturbance at time t in 26 is equivalent to an instantaneous change in the state x at time t there is an impulsive jump this change occurs only in the parasitoid populations with the addition of both populations η t galloi hectare and ν c flavipes hectare respectively the state then follows the trajectory with the new initial condition x t until the occurrence of the next transition time instant when the decision level is reached again computer simulations are now conducted considering impulsive control in pest management figs 7 and 8 show the time trajectories of system 1 without considering seasonality and using the impulsive control strategy 26 with the decision levels for the release of parasitoids x 1 400 x 4 2000 and release of parasitoids η 30 000 and ν 20 000 all values of η and ν were chosen so that there was no need to release parasitoids for periods of less than one week considering the possibility of weekly monitoring of pests as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 parasitoids are released for periods longer than one week considering the system 1 with seasonality and the impulsive control strategy 26 figs 9 and 10 show the time trajectories of each population for parasitoid release to be at least weekly the value of η must be greater than without seasonality therefore the values of η and ν are η 50 000 and ν 15 000 one can note in figs 9 and 10 that there is only t galloi release in the first weeks 4 4 pest management through impulsive and sdre control as discussed in bezerra et al 2021 it can be more expensive to carry out a daily parasitoid release program proposed in continuous control thus in the past subsection performed an impulsive control along with the fixed release of parasitoids in the previous section this release can be done using a weekly decision through the function u u u in which u is determined by eq 9 then if at the observation moment the pest densities are above the economic damage level a number of parasitoids calculated from control u is activated otherwise the system 11 is solved with u u 1 u 2 0 0 the decision levels are chosen as x 1 400 and x 4 2000 as the growth of the populations in a week can quickly overcome the economic damage level hence the control threshold has to be a bit below the economic damage level of 2500 larvae the weekly control process using sdre technique is summarized by these following steps 1 if x 1 x 1 and x 4 x 4 system 11 is solved with u 0 2 if x 1 x 1 or x 4 x 4 then the steps below are used 3 calculate the deviations from the desired regime y i x i x i i 1 2 6 eq 13 4 calculate matrix a eq 16 with the values of y found in step 3 5 use 18 to obtain matrix p 6 use 17 to calculate u 7 calculate the control value u u u 8 if x 1 400 then η u 1 otherwise η 0 if x 4 2000 then ν u 2 otherwise ν 0 9 solve the system 11 with the updated values from the previous step where x 1 x 2 x 3 η x 4 x 5 x 6 ν are the initial condition of the system in figs 11 and 12 the controlled populations are shown being below the economic damage threshold matrix r d i a g 0 0001 0 001 for the system without seasonality we notice that although not shown in this work other values of the matrix r were tested those with the best results were chosen on the other hand in bioeconomic models a more in depth discussion could be carried out on the influence of the values of the matrix r on the production costs of parasitoids which is not in the scope of this work the parasitoid release time to control the system without seasonality are shown in figs 13 and 14 the controlled system behavior with seasonality and the impulsive releases calculated by u u u are shown in figs 15 16 matrix r d i a g 0 001 0 1 the parasitoid release time to control the system with seasonality are shown in figs 17 and 18 the comparative results between impulsive control section 4 3 and impulsive control with sdre section 4 4 is outlined below here we consider the amount of parasitoids that were released through the control strategy over a period of 400 days for the system without seasonality and 800 days for the system with seasonality impulsive control without seasonality total of η 660 000 total of ν 90 000 impulsive control with seasonality total of η 1 450 000 total of ν 375 000 impulsive control without seasonality sdre total of u 1 649 960 total of u 2 173 320 impulsive control with seasonality sdre total of u 1 1 445 400 total of u 2 229 400 from these results one can observe that the amount of parasitoids released in the system to control the pest with the coupling control strategy impulsive and sdre is smaller as the parasitoids released only by impulsive control although this difference is relatively small 5 conclusions in this work are proposed strategies of the biological control of the main sugarcane pest d saccharalis using optimal control theory a continuous time mathematical model that describes the interactions between the sugarcane borer its egg and larval parasitoid considering six population densities was used a seasonal population dynamics was included in the mathematical model three control methodologies were proposed continuous control via sdre impulsive control with considering periodic pulses and the coupling of these two controls continuous and impulsive a study of the system pointwise controllability was carried out in which it was shown that there is only controllability using the two control functions u 1 and u 2 representing the egg and larvae parasitoids respectively this controllability result is general for this system since it does not depend on the values of the system parameters in field applications such as the works da silva miguel et al 2018 and nava et al 2009 impulsive release of parasitoids is indicated through the three control methodologies that were analyzed in this work from the simulations the pest management via impulsive control results was best since the smallest release of parasitoids occurs considering the amount of parasitoids released in the system the best result of the control was obtained by coupling the impulsive control and the sdre control the present results help understand the controlled dynamics of the six dimensional agroecological system with the seasonal forcing and considering the use of two parasitoids in the

24206,a species entering a novel landscape must overcome several obstacles that inhibit invasion which often leads invaders to go extinct while populations are still small and made up of relatively young individuals here we investigate a theoretical model of invader population dynamics to explore the effects of demographic structure on invader success to do so we extended the classic levins metapopulation model by allowing mortality to vary across individual life stages such that smaller individuals have a higher chance of dying we also allow size to vary across individuals using an application of the gillespie algorithm thus unlike in the classic levins model for which successful invasions occur deterministically whenever colonisation exceeds the background mortality rate invasion success in our model depends on the distribution of sizes found across individuals in the population nevertheless the resulting likelihood of successful invasion can be estimated as a function of just two parameters the colonisation rate and a derived index representing the time averaged mortality rate this time averaged mortality can be expressed analytically as a function of individual level growth rates the initial size of individuals and of the impact of disturbances while demographic stochasticity also contributes to some invasion failures in our model we find that these effects are rare except when landscapes and initial fraction of occupied sites are both small our results demonstrate that invasion success in a complex stochastic model with explicit demographic structure can be predicted using a relatively simple analytically tractable function applications of these results may therefore be particularly useful for studying general patterns of invasion success among sessile organisms with size dependant mortality such as terrestrial plants 1 introduction 1 1 concept of invasion and ecological impact one of the most important lessons of the last century of invasion ecology has been that it is much easier to prevent an invasion than it is to extirpate a species once it has become established harvey and mazzotti 2021 nie and li 2020 a primary goal of invasion ecologists therefore is to identify species that are likely to become successful invaders catford et al 2016 so that their invasions can be pre empted cassey et al 2018 curiously out of the enormous number of potential introduction events that occur every year e g due to human travel trade and intentional introductions hulme 2009 only a small fraction of species are ever able to successfully establish themselves jeschke 2014 williamson and fitter 1996 a major challenge is that the precise attributes and traits that lead a species to be a successful invader vary greatly across space time and ecological context courchamp et al 2017 1 2 modelling basis and history invasions fail when average mortality rates exceed the rate at which individuals of a species disperse and establish in new sites however generating a priori predictions of these rates can be challenging as they are affected by many different traits and attributes of species and individuals holt 1972 sullivan et al 2018 the effects on both rates can also vary greatly with context including community composition environmental conditions and even the species individual s size abundance elton 2020 and personality types blanchard et al 2021 likely as a consequence of this complex interplay of factors invasion success is rarely predictable based on just a single trait or measurement and even complex multivariate models are typically only valid within a narrow range of sites and systems plard et al 2019 young et al 2017 given these challenges a pioneering model introduced by levins 1969 suggested a potentially more tractable strategy directly measuring colonisation and extinction rates in situ and then using a model to extrapolate their net effects on invasion success levins metapopulation model was initially designed to study invasion patterns of insects across agricultural fields applying time scale separation to focus on the rate at which populations spread among habitat patches while ignoring faster and more difficult to observe local scale dynamics due to this patch based focus the model has since become a popular tool for studying invasion dynamics of sessile organisms with a particular focus on terrestrial plants extensions of the model have been applied to study competitive interactions among multiple species tilman 1994 species packing kinzig et al 1999 evolution lehman 2000 mutualism klausmeyer 2001 metapopulation capacity with variable colonisation rate ovaskainen and hanski 2001 habitat suitability muller landau 2010 stochastic birth death processes etienne and hemerik 2005 and trade offs in resource competitive ability clark et al 2018 similar models have also been applied to study conservation strategies with a particular focus on effects of habitat destruction tilman et al 1997 1994 and rescue effects first introduced by brown and kodric brown 1977 and popularised by hanski 1982 comprehensive overviews of metapopulation model extensions can be found in gotelli 1991 etienne 2002 and hanski and gilpin 1991 a general lesson from the levins model and its variants has been that even small and subtle changes in mortality and colonisation rates can have major impacts on the probability of invasion success and on the long term average abundance of successful invaders 1 3 goals and hypothesis despite its popularity as a tool for studying invasions the time scale separation applied by levins means that most implementations of the model do not account for local scale dynamics in particular the classic model treats all patches and all individuals as identical regardless of their size or age however these kinds of demographic effects can have an enormous impact on invasion success when a species enters a new landscape its population is usually small and dominated by young individuals iles et al 2016 these initial populations are also particularly susceptible to extinction both due to the effects of demographic stochasticity and generally high mortality rates due to small or young individuals lande et al 2003 melbourne 2012 melbourne and hastings 2008 shoemaker et al 2020 the primary goal of this study is therefore to investigate the impacts of these omitted size specific effects on the levins theoretical framework following the structure used in most terrestrial plant focused extensions of the levins model tilman 1994 we imagine a population made up of individuals each of which occupies a single site within a larger landscape however unlike in the classic levins model we specifically track the growth of each individual over time and assume that mortality is higher among smaller individuals as is often the case in real world plant populations comita et al 2010 wesselingh et al 1997 thus mortality rates vary across individuals in our model and time averaged mortality rates are influenced by a number of different life history processes including basal size independent mortality rates the rate at which individuals grow and the maximum size that they can achieve we expected that adding these additional local scale dynamics to the classic levins model would lead to high rates of invasion failure early on in model dynamics as young small individuals are subject to high mortality rates furthermore we hypothesised that this reduction in invasion success would be ameliorated by parameter combinations that allow individuals to escape the effects of size dependant mortality such as faster growth or lower susceptibility to disturbances nevertheless our goal was to implement these effects into the model while retaining an analytically tractable structure from which general insights about relationships between model parameters and invasion success could be gained in our extension of the levins model we find that invasion success and the ultimate population size obtained by successful invaders both increase for species where individuals grow quickly are born with a large initial size and reach a large maximum size importantly however we also show that the net effects of these terms can be summarised in an analytically tractable function that quantifies the time averaged mean mortality of individuals within the model m mean i e the average mortality rate experienced by individuals over their lifetimes we find that this rate is analogous to the fixed mortality rate in the classic levins model in that probability of invasion success and the equilibrium size of successful invaders is determined by the difference between the colonisation rate c and the time averaged mortality rate m mean we refer to this difference as invasion projection δ and use it as a general index of invasion success though our results are purely theoretical they accord with some findings from terrestrial plant communities e g that reducing average patch level biomass can be more effective at preventing invasions than intensive eradication campaigns our model extension is also the first to our knowledge that investigates stochastic effects of demographic structure on invasions in the levins framework 2 methods 2 1 theoretical framework as we discuss below the addition of size dependant mortality to the levins model is by no means trivial as it necessitates tracking individual level demography and thus shifts the focus from a fully mixed dynamical systems model to an individual focused stochastic dynamical systems framework to do so we begin with tilman s 1994 single species interpretation of the levins model in which the landscape is comprised of a large number of distinct sites each of which can be occupied by exactly one individual of the species the total population is therefore made up of the sum of individuals across the all sites individuals propagate asexually with a constant per capita rate over time hereafter described as the colonisation rate c new individuals can only be born if they disperse into a vacant site and cannot displace individuals already occupying a site thus as the landscape fills up fewer and fewer vacant sites remain and the likelihood that a colonisation event will be successful drops tilman et al 1997 the invading species can therefore only persist in a landscape in the long term if individuals spread to new sites faster than they die out in occupied sites in the classic levins model this is equivalent to the spatially implicit condition that the colonisation rate must be greater than the per capita mortality rate hastings 1980 our extension of this model consists of two parts first at the local scale i e one distinct site within the landscape we describe dynamics by the change in size of the single occupying individual over time note that this interpretation breaks from the classic levins model which does not consider patch level dynamics second at the regional scale i e the entire landscape our model tracks the dynamics of many different individuals over time as part of an interconnected metapopulation as in the classic levins model at the local scale the size of an individual at time ti varies following a logistic growth equation hence individuals grow asymptotically to their mature size which is analogous to e g herbaceous plants or trees approaching some maximum height over time further individuals in our model are subject to a time varying mortality rate mvar which declines as a function of individual size note that over time mortality rates therefore change depending on species individual level growth rate r their initial size at birth b 0 and their maximum size k all parameter definitions are provided in box 1 at the regional scale the landscape is composed of m distinct sites hereafter also called landscape size each site can be colonised and occupied by at most one single individual following levins and tilman landscape level abundance is typically reported as fraction of occupied sites p which we refer to as the frequency p hereafter given n as the number of individuals in the landscape p is therefore defined as p n m in the context of the classic levins model the fraction of populated sites p is determined by a the rate at which individuals disperse to new vacant sites at constant per capita colonisation rate c and b the rate at which individuals die releasing an occupied site at constant per capita mortality rate m in our model the variable mortality rate m var depends on the size of each individual j at time ti bj ti dynamics at the population level can then formally be described by the equation 1 d p d t c p 1 p j 1 n m v a r b j t i n p while this function is not efficient for simulating the system our more efficient implementation is described below it is helpful for illustrating how dynamics proceed in this nevertheless eq 1 shows that in this model new individuals are produced in proportion to the fraction of occupied sites p times the per capita colonisation rate c and disperse randomly to all empty sites i e multiplication by 1 p jointly these terms describe the density dependant colonisation rate in contrast mortality described by the variable size dependant rate mvar occurs only within the fraction of occupied sites p and represents a population size independent rate at which sites are cleared i e m var p the balance of individuals being recruited at colonisation rate c and individuals dying at mortality rate m var determines whether a species successfully establishes and spreads within a landscape to implement these two scales of model dynamics we draw on methods from stochastic dynamical systems theory specifically gillespie s method which allows us to separately track age size and mortality rate for each individual in the population while still maintaining the continuous time structure of the levins model wilkinson 2019 as a result we model colonisation and mortality as discrete events with waiting times between events drawn from a random exponential distribution this particular structure is used in gillespie s method because it allows model dynamics to converge to that of a classic dynamical systems equation for large numbers of individuals gillespie 1976 note that unlike in the classic dynamical systems framework of levins 1969 for which populations can only ever asymptotically approach zero our approach allows populations to go extinct in finite time if stochastic events drive the number of individuals to zero wilkinson 2019 2 2 local scale dynamics time varying mortality rates to implement individual level growth dynamics we model patch level individual size following a logistic growth function which is one of the most commonly applied models of biological growth loreau 2010 in the logistic model per capita growth rate decreases linearly with size and the size of individual j at ti time units after its birth bj ti can be calculated as 2 b j t i k 1 b 0 e r t i where r denotes the intrinsic growth rate and k represents the maximum size that can be approached for large ti fig 1 a as an index of total growth over time which we will use to summarise model dynamics below we also introduce a scaled parameter b 0 k b 0 b 0 which describes the relative growth necessary to increase from initial size b 0 e g size of the seedling to maximum size k tilman 2004 note that by applying eq 2 we can track the size of each individual over time at every site in the landscape next we model variable mortality rates as a function of individual level size our main motivation is to mimic the effects of disturbances on individuals over the course of their entire life cycle following first principles and biological evidence from studies of plant growth comita et al 2010 wesselingh et al 1997 we assume that smaller individuals have a higher probability of dying due to disturbances while larger individuals eventually approach a fixed minimum background mortality rate that is independent of size fig 1a to achieve this pattern of variable mortality while maintaining analytical tractability for our model we assume that size variable mortality rates are driven by external disturbances that cause changes in individual level biomass and that if disturbances are large enough to drive individuals to a biomass of zero the individual is killed to integrate these disturbances into our model we make two strong assumptions first disturbances in our model vary in intensity over time with the relative strength of disturbances proportional to a distribution defined by a concave down quadratic function centred at zero with cut offs at 1 and 1 fig 1a see appendix b 1 eq b 1 in the supplement this function achieves a relatively natural distribution of disturbances i e their impact on biomass can be positive or negative e g dry vs we years and extreme events are rarer than minor events clark et al 2021 typically the distribution of disturbance sizes is assumed to be gaussian we use a quadratic kernel because it achieves almost the same shape but greatly facilitated derivation of the analytical solution for mean mortality below second rather than explicitly simulating the effects of individual disturbance events which would slow computational analysis and inhibit the derivation of an analytical solution to our model we assume that individual level variable mortality is determined by the relative frequency of disturbance events that are large enough to drive individual level biomass to zero i e the fraction of the distributions in fig 1a and eq b 1 that are extreme enough to drive individual size to the zero line or lower conceptually this assumption mimics the outcome of a large number of trials across many individuals i e the resulting size dependant mortality rate is equivalent to the long term average that would have been observed across many individuals had each individual been exposed to a regime of individual disturbance events drawn from the quadratic kernel described above assuming that disturbances are slow relative to individual s growth rates mathematically this variable mortality rate is expressed as the total integral of the quadratic kernel that falls below the zero line when the kernel is centred at the current size of the individual bj ti 3 m m o r t j t i 1 b t 0 3 4 x b j t i 2 1 d x 1 4 b j t i 3 3 4 b j t i 1 2 to derive our variable mortality rate m var this mortality rate is then combined with a size independent basal mortality rate m 0 which is included to prevent very large individuals from becoming immortal see appendix b 1 eq b 4 in the supplement for details yielding 4 m v a r b j t i m 0 1 m m o r t b j t i m m o r t b j t i for practical purposes the outcome of these functions is that individuals with size near the initial value b 0 e g close to the zero line are more often driven to zero abundance i e local extinction by disturbances than individuals with size far from the initial value b 0 e g close to the maximum size thus individuals experience high mortality rates at small sizes i e early life stages followed by a gradual decline that reduces the chance of dying at larger sizes i e at later stages and finally dropping to a minimum rate of m 0 for k 1 for very large individuals fig 1b to simplify model interpretation we also rescale the units for biomass in terms of the maximum disturbance size possible under the quadratic kernel described above k can therefore be interpreted as the maximum size of an individual relative to the largest possible effect that a disturbance can have on an individual thus k 1 implies that individuals can grow sufficiently large that they can no longer be killed by disturbance events and that they are only subject to the background mortality rate m 0 note that we implicitly make two additional assumptions in this model of disturbance effects first that disturbances do not impact the maximum size that individuals can achieve excluding the scaling used to set the units for k and second that disturbance impacts decline monotonically as a function of size while there are biologically relevant cases that would require relaxing both of these assumptions e g disturbance regimes that reduce maximum plant size as is commonly seen near the timberline in alpine regions or disturbance events that disproportionately damage large individuals such as windstorms that topple tall emergent trees these cases would require significantly more complex models to address and are beyond the scope of this paper 2 3 regional scale switch to the event based simulation of stochastic dynamics next to model dynamics at the regional scale we must integrate the size varying mortality rate into levins framework to do so we must derive an expression for the temporally averaged mortality rate experienced by an individual over a fixed timespan formally we do so by solving eq 5 see appendix b 2 conceptually however we can obtain the same result by tracking mortality across a large cohort of individuals imagine a hypothetical landscape beginning at t 0 0 where all individuals start at the same age and initial size b 0 if we track survival across just this cohort of individuals i e ignoring colonisation by new individuals we can calculate the rate at which individuals in the cohort grow old and die as 5 d p c d t m v a r b j t i p c where pc is the surviving fraction of the original cohort by substituting eq 4 for m var and solving for pc we can derive a function for the dynamics of pc over time t as 6 p c p 0 exp t 0 0 t i m v a r b j t d t where p 0 is the initial fraction of the landscape occupied by the cohort note that if we only wish to estimate the fraction of surviving individuals at a fixed point in the future ti i e not the precise dynamics that led to that end point we can substitute the integral in the exponent of eq 6 with a constant average mortality rate m mean ti by applying the mean value theorem for definite integrals see next section appendix b 2 eqs b 6 to b 8 7 p c p 0 exp m m e a n t i t i thus we can apply eq 7 to estimate the expected surviving fraction of individuals in the cohort or equivalently the probability that any given individual will survive up until time ti as pc p 0 importantly it is possible to derive an analytically tractable expression for m mean though it is a somewhat long and unwieldy polynomial see appendix b 2 eq b 7 we can use this expression to rapidly and efficiently calculate time varying mortality rates for individuals in our model to integrate this size varying mortality rate into our regional scale model we must update the classic levins framework to one that tracks the dynamics of discrete individuals over continuous time we do so by applying a stochastic dynamical systems modelling framework via gillespie s method gillespie 1977 2007 wilkinson 2019 in which births and deaths occur as discrete events with waiting times between events drawn from a random exponential distribution with waiting times c and the time varying distribution defined by m var respectively wilkinson 2019 this stochastic dynamical systems approach offers several advantages first the framework allows us to implement individual level differences in vital rates such that the time varying mean mortality rate m mean varies across small vs large individuals second this approach necessarily introduces demographic stochasticity into the model i e stochastic fluctuations driven by random birth and death events which allows unsuccessful invaders to go fully extinct in finite time unlike in the classic levins model where population sizes can only asymptotically approach zero melbourne 2012 arguably this approach is also a more realistic portrayal of real world dynamics in which population size changes by discrete jumps that occur at variable moments in time e g as individuals are born and die shoemaker et al 2020 wilkinson 2019 lastly a useful feature of gillespie s method is that for large population sizes it reduces to a classic dynamical systems model which greatly facilitates checking for errors in computer code by comparing simulation results to analytical expectations wilkinson 2019 in our model we simulate the birth and death events for every individual separately based on their own size varying mortality rate following from m mean in eq 7 and eq b 8 hence after initialisation the time evolution follows a continuous time markov process where the state of the system is made up of two pieces of information the total number of individuals n and the age of each of those individuals ti following the gillespie method each individual is assigned two events at birth representing the waiting time until their next colonisation event and waiting time until mortality respectively if the mortality waiting time is shorter than the colonisation waiting time then the individual dies without reproducing otherwise the individual produces a new offspring which disperses to a randomly chosen site in the landscape where it establishes itself if the site is vacant and the parent individual is then assigned a new waiting time until the next colonisation event time in the model then proceeds event by event in order of waiting time across all individuals with time increments following the waiting times between events fig 2 recall that for colonisation waiting times are drawn from a random exponential distribution with rate parameter c for all individuals for mortality events waiting times are drawn from an exponential distribution with a time varying rate wilkinson 2019 see fig 2c the mechanics of drawing a waiting time from such a distribution are somewhat complicated lehman and keen 2012 though in practice the result is that for any given individual of age ti the total accumulated probability of mortality over its life up to that point is equal to that experienced by an individual with fixed mortality rate m mean ti as defined in eq b 8 to do so we calculate the distribution of the variable morality rate via integration of the exponent in eq 6 using the corresponding inverse function a uniform random draw is then mapped onto the corresponding time ti which is assigned as the time of death t d of the individual see fig 2c fig 2 shows an example of how the simulation process under the gillespie algorithm proceeds and the general algorithm implementation is shown below in pseudo code algorithm 1 for the full annotated source code for conducting our simulation routine see the section data management 2 4 the invasion projection index model simulations on successful invasions and their prediction to characterise model dynamics across a wide range of potential behaviours we choose to vary every input parameter of our model i e the individual s growth rate r colonisation rate c the individual s starting size b 0 and the maximum size scaled by the maximum impact of disturbances k our main interest lies on investigating the relation between the colonisation rate and the mean mortality rate under a range of different disturbance magnitudes in comparison to outcomes of the classic levins model to do so we derived an invasion projection index which we defined as the difference between colonisation and time averaged mortality rate 8 δ c m mean c m mean as in the classic levins model this quantity provides a simple measure for predicting invasion success if colonisation events occur on average more frequently than mortality events then invasions will also on average be successful although the index defined in eq 8 can be calculated without any simulations based on the analytically derived expression appendix b 2 eq b 8 we performed extensive model simulations with varied input parameters to underpin and validate our analytical results hence we created sets of random parameter combination from the following intervals the individual s growth rate r 0 1 2 colonisation rate c 0 1 2 the individual s starting size b 0 0 001 0 1 and the maximum size k 0 5 1 we drew the values randomly from a uniform distribution additionally we randomly chose the landscape size i e number of sites m from seven possible values m 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000 and sampled the starting fraction of populated sites p 0 from an integer list starting at one and ranging to the fifth of the total number of sites p 0 1 m 5 m note that for a given p 0 the initial number of individuals therefore depends on m overall 6 input parameters were varied from which 3200 unique parameter set combinations were created each parameter set was simulated 20 times the maximum simulation runtime was set to t max 100 which was selected because it allowed for at least one full turnover of the initial cohort of individuals following from the interval the base mortality rate of m 0 0 01 0 1 was drawn from uniformly 3 results our analyses yielded an analytically tractable estimate of invasion success for a demographically structured extension of the classic levins model in accordance with our expectations we found a strong link between increased time varying mortality rate and decreased invasion success in particular both the likelihood of invaders surviving to the end of the simulation and the fraction of sites occupied by successful invaders at the end of the simulation increased as a function of our invasion projection index δ c m mean i e the difference between the colonisation rate and the time averaged mortality rate fig 3 when this index was negative i e when the average mortality rate exceeded the colonisation rate invasions were never successful and always led to local extinction fig 3a see vertical blue dashed line in contrast and unlike in the classic levins model levins 1969 tilman 1994 demographic stochasticity in our model led to a non zero probability of extinction even when δ c m mean was positive fig 3b thus the larger the difference between colonisation rates and mean mortality rates for invaders in our model the higher their probability of successful establishment and the higher their post invasion abundance but even very large differences do not completely guarantee that an invader will be successful in all cases interestingly our simulations show that the relationship between the probability of invasion success vs the invasion projection index δ c m mean closely follows a power function fig 3b additionally as expected our results show that the difference between colonisation and mean mortality rates and thus the overall success of an invader increased for parameter combinations that led to fast individual level growth i e high r large initial individual size i e large b 0 and large maximum size relative to the impact of disturbances i e high k fig 4 impacts were largest for changes in k as well as initial increases in r up to about a value of 0 5 in contrast for larger values of r and for most values of b 0 increases in parameter values led to only modest decreases in mean mortality rates recall however that in our model individual level biomass is scaled relative to the maximum size of disturbances such that low values of b 0 and k can imply either small individual sizes or large disturbances if we instead focus on the scaled relative growth size index b 0 k b 0 b 0 which summarises the relative size increase needed for an individual to grow from its initial size to its maximum size a different pattern emerges fig 4 d h here we find a sharp initial decline in m mean with initial increases of b 0 followed by a slow increase in m mean for higher values of b 0 another interesting finding resulting from the demographic stochasticity in our model is the varying influence of the initial abundance p 0 and system size m on the invasion dynamic on the one hand once a species successfully establishes itself in a new habitat these quantities do not have much of an impact on final number of sites occupied by a successful invader see fig 5 a on the other hand small system sizes in combination with low initial abundances yielded a lower overall survival probability due to a higher probability of stochastic drift forwards extinction see fig 5b note however that as expected for effects of demographic stochasticity may 1973 these effects quickly diminished as the initial number of individuals grew large system sizes of m 100 patches and population sizes of p 0 0 04 in our model 4 discussion by extending the classic levins model to include a size varying mortality rate our results reveal five primary theoretical findings 1 we were able to derive an analytically tractable function for the time averaged variable mortality rate m mean depending only on model input parameters i e growth rate r impacts of disturbances relative to maximum size k and initial size b 0 2 as hypothesised we found that the time averaged mortality rate increased as growth rates grew slower and as maximum size and initial size grew smaller 3 we defined a simple function the invasion projection index δ c m mean which can be used to characterise invasion success based only on the colonisation rate c and the time averaged mortality rate 4 in accordance with the classic levins model we identified a threshold below which our analytically tractable expression guarantees that the invader species will die out i e c m mean and 5 above that threshold we found that likelihood of successful invasion was closely related to the invasion projection index δ c m mean following a power function given how elusive accurate predictions of invasion outcomes can be in the real world catford et al 2016 it is encouraging that our model permits an analytically tractable invasion success that can be related to measurable individual level life history parameters though we stress that our results are purely theoretical they suggest that similar time averaged estimates of vital rates might be a fruitful and tractable way forward critically as in the classic levins model hastings 1980 levins 1969 outcomes in our model primarily boil down to whether or not on average colonisation events occur faster than mortality events not only can these rates in theory be directly measured in empirical systems but we can also use them to link the outcomes of our simulation tests directly to the analytically tractable formula for the time averaged mortality rate 4 1 event based framework our implementation of gillespie s method allowed us to directly model individual level birth and death processes which was necessary for incorporating size dependant differences in mortality rates an unavoidable side effect of this framework is that it introduced demographic stochasticity into our model wilkinson 2019 as already discussed this approach brings with it several advantages including the emergence of true extinction events in our model rather than the typical asymptotic drift towards extinction seen in the classic levins model appendix d fig d 1 this feature allows us to investigate invasion failure rates without e g needing to introduce a synthetic lower boundary to population size see meyer 2019 for a more thorough discussion of this approach additionally in comparison to other individual level frameworks gillespie s method has the enormous advantage of being directly relatable to a closed form continuous time dynamical systems model when simulated for very large populations gillespie 1976 this feature is particularly important for our study both because it allows us to more quickly and generally characterise model results in the absence of demographic stochasticity based on the analytically tractable relationship between c and m mean and because it allows robust validation of the simulation model against theoretical expectations appendix c fig c 5 wilkinson 2019 in contrast most other individual level frameworks discretise not just individual level abundances but also implement discrete time steps which do not allow for such clean analytical links to occur durrett and levin 1994 comparisons of our results with other stochastic levins implementations is difficult as most studies do not track effects of demographic structure at the individual level in particular as discussed below these demographic effects are the primary drivers of the relationships between the mean time varying mortality rate m mean and the other model parameters especially the increases in m mean for smaller values of starting size b 0 and maximum individual size k to our knowledge these effects have not yet been investigated in other studies nevertheless our general results largely accord with existing findings from other stochastic levins model implementations i e that invasion success declines with slower colonisation rates higher mortality rates smaller initial fraction of sites occupied and smaller overall landscape sizes kinzig et al 1999 especially these latter two results i e that demographic stochasticity leads to higher extinction rates for small initial population sizes and small overall landscape sizes have been found in many studies of other stochastic modelling frameworks and are to be expected from first principles lande et al 1998 lewis and pacala 2000 may 1973 ovaskainen and meerson 2010 4 2 the invasion projection index as in the classic levins framework hastings 1980 for any fixed colonisation rate smaller than the mean mortality rate c m mean a deterministically driven extinction event will always occur in our model we summarise this difference between colonisation and mean mortality rates in the invasion projection δ c m mean successful invasions in our model are therefore possible if and only if this index is positive this index is one of the primary results of our study because it can be calculated directly from the other model parameters the index allows deterministic outcomes in our model to be predicted from a closed form analytically tractable equation see appendix b 2 eq b 8 however unlike in the classic levins model positive δ c m mean values in our implementation i e c m mean do not guarantee that an invasion will be successful due to the effects of demographic stochasticity for example fig 3 shows that even when the colonisation rate c is much larger than average mortality rates m mean extinction events still occur though as expected from first principles may 1974 analyses in fig 5b show that the frequency of stochastic extinction events declines as a function of overall population size i e with higher initial fraction of occupied sites p 0 and higher overall landscape size m shaffer 1981 in general deriving closed form solutions for the impacts of demographic stochasticity on demographically structured populations is not possible and consequently model outcomes must be investigated via simulation tilman 2004 vindenes et al 2012 however for our model we find that invasion success is related to our invasion projection index δ c m mean following a strong highly conserved power function fig 3b this relationship suggests a practical approach for estimating the probability of successful invasion in two steps first one can use the chosen model parameters as input for eq b 8 to calculate m mean and then second one can use the linearized relationship in fig 3b to directly calculate the invasion probability for an event at least for the simplified scenario considered in our model although the linearized relationship would likely need to be re parameterised following any changes to model structure e g removing background mortality m 0 or inclusion of local dispersal this procedure would allow simulation results to be used to make efficient predictions of model outcomes for other parameter combinations ovaskainen and meerson 2010 and potentially even for some real world systems moreover a particularly useful feature is that so long as an invader is able to establish final frequency of occupied sites is relatively independent of the effects of demographic stochasticity in our model fig 5a thus in most cases the closed form solutions presented here should be sufficient for forecasting the abundance of successful invaders in our model 4 3 transient vs static impacts on the average mortality rate parameters in our model exhibit two distinct kinds of impacts on individual level mortality rates first transient impacts are driven by the growth rate r and initial size b 0 though these parameters influence average mortality they do so primally early on in an individual s development by controlling the time needed to grow fig 4a to b the more quickly an individual can become large e g faster growth rate r or larger initial size b 0 the lower its size dependant mortality rate becomes if the relative impacts of disturbances are small enough then following eq 3 high r and b 0 can lead individuals to quickly overcome size dependant morality entirely leaving just the basal mortality rate for fully grown individuals fig 1b and thus leading to an overall decrease in the mean mortality rate m mean interestingly the slight decrease that we find in m mean as a function of initial size b 0 fig 4b and f implies that species in our model are subject to something akin to an individual level allee like effect formally an allee effect is the positive association between individual level survival and population size allee et al 1949 odum and allee 1954 stephens et al 1999 and implies that there is some critical abundance below which the population will be driven deterministically extinct courchamp et al 1999 in our model this effect acts at the level of individuals that is if propagules do not exceed a minimum necessary size then size dependant mortality effects can be so high as to drive the invasion projection index δ c m mean negative and thus prevent any successful invasions because low b 0 also increases the length of time needed before individuals reach their full size this deterministic allee like effect also interacts with extinction events driven by demographic stochasticity indeed a recent study by dennis et al 2016 has likewise shown that stochasticity enhances the risk of allee effects to our knowledge these kinds of allee like behaviour have not been previously reported for other extensions of the levins model the second kind of impacts of parameters on mortality rates are static impacts i e those that last throughout the entire life cycle of an individual these impacts are controlled through the basal size independent mortality rate m 0 and the maximum individual size relative to the impact of disturbances k for very low values of k i e k 1 implying that impacts of disturbances on individuals are large relative to their maximum size the variable mortality rate never reduces to zero regardless of individual size or age and always contributes to the total mortality in contrast when k is large disturbance impacts become smaller relative to maximum individual size leading to lower average mortality rates fig 4c note that overall mean mortality rate is therefore determined by an interplay between transient and static impacts these joint effects are illustrated in our index parameter b 0 which describes the relative change needed for individuals to grow from their initial size at birth to their maximum size somewhat counter intuitively for the parameter ranges that we consider mean mortality rate is lowest for intermediate values of b 0 this pattern suggests something of a trade off for the parameter range that we investigated if b 0 is too large then individuals must grow for a long time before reaching maximum size and thus experience increased mortality while in smaller stages of development however if b 0 is too small then even though individuals can reach their maximum size quickly this maximum size is not large enough to avoid severe impacts of disturbances 4 4 empirical evidence and caveats although our results are theoretical there are several biological systems in which similar patterns can be observed in particular impacts of initial size b 0 on invasion success relate closely to empirical findings related to propagule size which have been especially well studied for terrestrial plants in general species with larger propagules also tend to be more effective invaders pyšek and richardson 2008 for terrestrial plants larger seeds tend to be more resistant to stresses moles and westoby 2006 muller landau 2010 meaning they have higher probability of establishing in new sites and surviving long enough to grow large similarly species with fast growth or dispersal rates tend to be more ruderal meaning that they can quickly establish grow large and form stable populations even in relatively disturbed sites grime 1974 isbell et al 2015 and tend to be more successful invaders colautti et al 2006 these trends accord with our results that higher r and higher b 0 tends to lead to greater invasion success nevertheless there are a number of important caveats to these interpretations of empirical data first over longer timescales fast growing invaders are often displaced by more competitive slower growing species catford et al 2019 this pattern is particularly pronounced in grassland plant communities where species often transition from distinct fast growing early successional communities to slow growing late successional communities clark et al 2019 grime 1974 tilman 1994 thus results predicted by our model may only be indicative of short term invasion success which could ultimately be reversed through slower acting interactions with other species another caveat is that while larger propagules may increase establishment success they can also inhibit other aspects of invasion such as dispersal ability or the total number of propagules produced sullivan et al 2018 depending on the system context and observational scale propagule size can therefore be associated with either increases or decreases in invasion rates clark et al 2017 similar trade offs exist for vegetative growth rates although fast growth can help species establish and spread quickly both individual level and population level growth rates that are too fast can destabilise populations leading to fluctuating or chaotic dynamics may 1974 tilman and wedin 1991 or preventing species from matching their spatial distributions to those of favourable environmental conditions wang et al 2015 thus although our model implies simple monotonic relationships between r b 0 m mean and invasion success long term patterns in real world systems are likely to be more complex one final but important caveat is that our model makes very strong assumptions about how disturbance strength interacts with individual size in our model disturbance impacts and thus size dependant mortality rates decline monotonically with individual size and maximum individual size k remains constant over time these assumptions allow us to generate a closed form solution for the mean time varying mortality rate m mean however in empirical systems patterns are not always this straightforward for example for trees harsh climate conditions at higher elevations lead both to a decline in population density and to the average size of individual trees körner 1998 similarly disturbances such as windstorms or harvesting can lead to higher rates of mortality among larger individuals bromley 1939 fenberg and roy 2008 more generally older individuals often experience senescence meaning that they become more prone to the effects of disturbances with age quarles and roach 2018 thus while integrating processes such as feedbacks between the disturbance regime and k or non monotonic relationships between size and m var would surely yield a more realistic model we caution that doing so would come at the cost of analytical tractability 4 5 potential empirical applications results from our model have several important implications for invasion and invasion control in order to suppress invasions our model suggests that reducing growth rates i e reducing r or site specific initial sizes or abundances across the landscape i e reducing b 0 can be particularly effective control measures in contrast after an invader has become successfully established changes to landscape size and initial abundance do not have much of an impact on its long term abundance see fig 5a these results suggest that once a species is established small scale eradication efforts or protecting subregions from invasion i e reducing m will not be very effective control measures instead our model suggests that successful eradication of an established invader requires system wide efforts to e g reduce individual level growth rates i e reduce r selectively remove large individuals i e reduce k or decrease average initial size i e reduce b 0 this prediction accords with some empirical results e g showing that suppression of the growth and spread of invading individuals can help reduce invasion success andrew and ustin 2010 whereas targeted local efforts usually fail to prevent invasion in the long term hill and sowards 2015 these insights have been successfully applied in some systems e g in eradication campaigns of the european buckthorn rhamnus cathartica in north america where it was found that control efforts that were aimed at reducing overall seed production were more effective than those that simply reduced the number of adult individuals delanoy and archibold 2007 note that these predictions are also similar to general expectations from the theory of island biology macarthur and wilson 1967 simberloff et al 2013 i e that reductions in colonisation rate or increases in the mortality rate will lead to declines in the survival and persistence of individual species from a practical perspective our model s predictions also have some relevance for land use and land management decisions especially for systems dominated by sessile plant communities for example in many world regions land abandonment is usually followed by natural succession first with invasion by herbaceous plants then shrubs and lastly trees which often come to dominate the system in the long term hobbs and walker 2007 pickett et al 2009 prach and walker 2011 growth rates of herbaceous plants are generally higher than those for woody plants and frequent disturbances e g in terms of management regimes such as mowing or burning are often the most effective way to prevent invasion by woody species sprugel 1991 these results accord with expectations from our model i e that more intense disturbance regimes and frequent reductions in individual size would favour fast growing grasses or herbs over slowing growing shrubs and trees as discussed above however disturbances in real world systems have many different kinds of effects on many different biological parameters for example although climate change impacts are often viewed as negative it has been identified as a positive impact on invasion success for some species leading them to extend their range of distribution buckland et al 2001 similarly some empirical studies show that management strategies such as burning in order to promote native grasses can also result in the opposite undesired direction of an invasion by non native species reed et al 2005 thus direct extrapolations from our model to empirical systems should be made with caution 4 6 future directions in addition to addressing the caveats discussed above there are a number of potential additions to the model that we present here which could help extend its scope in future studies first our version of the model considers only the dynamics of a single species however multispecies versions of the levins model have also been developed usually in combination with a competitive hierarchy that allows propagules of some species to replace adults of other species tilman 1994 integrating these effects into our model may help better address the impacts of species interactions on invasion success second in our conceptualisation of the model each site is occupied by at most a single individual and we consequently do not consider local scale interactions among individuals while this implementation is consistent with that from tilman 1994 it is worth noting that the original levins model actually treated each patch as a local population rather than a single individual levins 1969 similarly individual level dynamics in our model could be reinterpreted as the growth of individual populations across a metapopulation e g with r as local population growth rate k as maximum local population size etc doing so would allow us to model interactions among species at both the local and the regional levels e g allowing for more complex interaction frameworks such as resource competition similar models have been developed for some aspects of the levins model though not with size dependant interactions klausmeier 2001 lehman 2000 lastly although the power relationship that we find between the probability of a successful invasion and the invasion projection index δ c m mean can in theory be calibrated for any updated model by running simulations across a wide range of parameter values it would be particularly useful if the power relationship could be estimated directly from model parameters deriving such a relationship would therefore be a highly fruitful goal for future studies though it is currently unclear whether such a solution is even theoretically possible vindenes et al 2012 5 conclusion here we present a demographically structured invasion model based on the classic levins metapopulation framework as in the classic levins model we find that invasion success requires colonisation rates to exceed average mortality rates however unlike classic versions of the model mortality rates in our model vary as a function of the size of individuals our core results include the derivation of an analytically tractable invasion projection index δ c m mean which compares the difference between the rate at which individuals produce successful propagules versus the average rate at which they die additionally we identify a simple power function which can be used to predict the likelihood of successful invasion based on the invasion projection index jointly these results show that successful invaders tend to have higher individual level growth rates higher initial sizes at birth are better able to grow sufficiently large sizes to escape the effects of size dependant mortality data management data and code are permanently archived and

24206,a species entering a novel landscape must overcome several obstacles that inhibit invasion which often leads invaders to go extinct while populations are still small and made up of relatively young individuals here we investigate a theoretical model of invader population dynamics to explore the effects of demographic structure on invader success to do so we extended the classic levins metapopulation model by allowing mortality to vary across individual life stages such that smaller individuals have a higher chance of dying we also allow size to vary across individuals using an application of the gillespie algorithm thus unlike in the classic levins model for which successful invasions occur deterministically whenever colonisation exceeds the background mortality rate invasion success in our model depends on the distribution of sizes found across individuals in the population nevertheless the resulting likelihood of successful invasion can be estimated as a function of just two parameters the colonisation rate and a derived index representing the time averaged mortality rate this time averaged mortality can be expressed analytically as a function of individual level growth rates the initial size of individuals and of the impact of disturbances while demographic stochasticity also contributes to some invasion failures in our model we find that these effects are rare except when landscapes and initial fraction of occupied sites are both small our results demonstrate that invasion success in a complex stochastic model with explicit demographic structure can be predicted using a relatively simple analytically tractable function applications of these results may therefore be particularly useful for studying general patterns of invasion success among sessile organisms with size dependant mortality such as terrestrial plants 1 introduction 1 1 concept of invasion and ecological impact one of the most important lessons of the last century of invasion ecology has been that it is much easier to prevent an invasion than it is to extirpate a species once it has become established harvey and mazzotti 2021 nie and li 2020 a primary goal of invasion ecologists therefore is to identify species that are likely to become successful invaders catford et al 2016 so that their invasions can be pre empted cassey et al 2018 curiously out of the enormous number of potential introduction events that occur every year e g due to human travel trade and intentional introductions hulme 2009 only a small fraction of species are ever able to successfully establish themselves jeschke 2014 williamson and fitter 1996 a major challenge is that the precise attributes and traits that lead a species to be a successful invader vary greatly across space time and ecological context courchamp et al 2017 1 2 modelling basis and history invasions fail when average mortality rates exceed the rate at which individuals of a species disperse and establish in new sites however generating a priori predictions of these rates can be challenging as they are affected by many different traits and attributes of species and individuals holt 1972 sullivan et al 2018 the effects on both rates can also vary greatly with context including community composition environmental conditions and even the species individual s size abundance elton 2020 and personality types blanchard et al 2021 likely as a consequence of this complex interplay of factors invasion success is rarely predictable based on just a single trait or measurement and even complex multivariate models are typically only valid within a narrow range of sites and systems plard et al 2019 young et al 2017 given these challenges a pioneering model introduced by levins 1969 suggested a potentially more tractable strategy directly measuring colonisation and extinction rates in situ and then using a model to extrapolate their net effects on invasion success levins metapopulation model was initially designed to study invasion patterns of insects across agricultural fields applying time scale separation to focus on the rate at which populations spread among habitat patches while ignoring faster and more difficult to observe local scale dynamics due to this patch based focus the model has since become a popular tool for studying invasion dynamics of sessile organisms with a particular focus on terrestrial plants extensions of the model have been applied to study competitive interactions among multiple species tilman 1994 species packing kinzig et al 1999 evolution lehman 2000 mutualism klausmeyer 2001 metapopulation capacity with variable colonisation rate ovaskainen and hanski 2001 habitat suitability muller landau 2010 stochastic birth death processes etienne and hemerik 2005 and trade offs in resource competitive ability clark et al 2018 similar models have also been applied to study conservation strategies with a particular focus on effects of habitat destruction tilman et al 1997 1994 and rescue effects first introduced by brown and kodric brown 1977 and popularised by hanski 1982 comprehensive overviews of metapopulation model extensions can be found in gotelli 1991 etienne 2002 and hanski and gilpin 1991 a general lesson from the levins model and its variants has been that even small and subtle changes in mortality and colonisation rates can have major impacts on the probability of invasion success and on the long term average abundance of successful invaders 1 3 goals and hypothesis despite its popularity as a tool for studying invasions the time scale separation applied by levins means that most implementations of the model do not account for local scale dynamics in particular the classic model treats all patches and all individuals as identical regardless of their size or age however these kinds of demographic effects can have an enormous impact on invasion success when a species enters a new landscape its population is usually small and dominated by young individuals iles et al 2016 these initial populations are also particularly susceptible to extinction both due to the effects of demographic stochasticity and generally high mortality rates due to small or young individuals lande et al 2003 melbourne 2012 melbourne and hastings 2008 shoemaker et al 2020 the primary goal of this study is therefore to investigate the impacts of these omitted size specific effects on the levins theoretical framework following the structure used in most terrestrial plant focused extensions of the levins model tilman 1994 we imagine a population made up of individuals each of which occupies a single site within a larger landscape however unlike in the classic levins model we specifically track the growth of each individual over time and assume that mortality is higher among smaller individuals as is often the case in real world plant populations comita et al 2010 wesselingh et al 1997 thus mortality rates vary across individuals in our model and time averaged mortality rates are influenced by a number of different life history processes including basal size independent mortality rates the rate at which individuals grow and the maximum size that they can achieve we expected that adding these additional local scale dynamics to the classic levins model would lead to high rates of invasion failure early on in model dynamics as young small individuals are subject to high mortality rates furthermore we hypothesised that this reduction in invasion success would be ameliorated by parameter combinations that allow individuals to escape the effects of size dependant mortality such as faster growth or lower susceptibility to disturbances nevertheless our goal was to implement these effects into the model while retaining an analytically tractable structure from which general insights about relationships between model parameters and invasion success could be gained in our extension of the levins model we find that invasion success and the ultimate population size obtained by successful invaders both increase for species where individuals grow quickly are born with a large initial size and reach a large maximum size importantly however we also show that the net effects of these terms can be summarised in an analytically tractable function that quantifies the time averaged mean mortality of individuals within the model m mean i e the average mortality rate experienced by individuals over their lifetimes we find that this rate is analogous to the fixed mortality rate in the classic levins model in that probability of invasion success and the equilibrium size of successful invaders is determined by the difference between the colonisation rate c and the time averaged mortality rate m mean we refer to this difference as invasion projection δ and use it as a general index of invasion success though our results are purely theoretical they accord with some findings from terrestrial plant communities e g that reducing average patch level biomass can be more effective at preventing invasions than intensive eradication campaigns our model extension is also the first to our knowledge that investigates stochastic effects of demographic structure on invasions in the levins framework 2 methods 2 1 theoretical framework as we discuss below the addition of size dependant mortality to the levins model is by no means trivial as it necessitates tracking individual level demography and thus shifts the focus from a fully mixed dynamical systems model to an individual focused stochastic dynamical systems framework to do so we begin with tilman s 1994 single species interpretation of the levins model in which the landscape is comprised of a large number of distinct sites each of which can be occupied by exactly one individual of the species the total population is therefore made up of the sum of individuals across the all sites individuals propagate asexually with a constant per capita rate over time hereafter described as the colonisation rate c new individuals can only be born if they disperse into a vacant site and cannot displace individuals already occupying a site thus as the landscape fills up fewer and fewer vacant sites remain and the likelihood that a colonisation event will be successful drops tilman et al 1997 the invading species can therefore only persist in a landscape in the long term if individuals spread to new sites faster than they die out in occupied sites in the classic levins model this is equivalent to the spatially implicit condition that the colonisation rate must be greater than the per capita mortality rate hastings 1980 our extension of this model consists of two parts first at the local scale i e one distinct site within the landscape we describe dynamics by the change in size of the single occupying individual over time note that this interpretation breaks from the classic levins model which does not consider patch level dynamics second at the regional scale i e the entire landscape our model tracks the dynamics of many different individuals over time as part of an interconnected metapopulation as in the classic levins model at the local scale the size of an individual at time ti varies following a logistic growth equation hence individuals grow asymptotically to their mature size which is analogous to e g herbaceous plants or trees approaching some maximum height over time further individuals in our model are subject to a time varying mortality rate mvar which declines as a function of individual size note that over time mortality rates therefore change depending on species individual level growth rate r their initial size at birth b 0 and their maximum size k all parameter definitions are provided in box 1 at the regional scale the landscape is composed of m distinct sites hereafter also called landscape size each site can be colonised and occupied by at most one single individual following levins and tilman landscape level abundance is typically reported as fraction of occupied sites p which we refer to as the frequency p hereafter given n as the number of individuals in the landscape p is therefore defined as p n m in the context of the classic levins model the fraction of populated sites p is determined by a the rate at which individuals disperse to new vacant sites at constant per capita colonisation rate c and b the rate at which individuals die releasing an occupied site at constant per capita mortality rate m in our model the variable mortality rate m var depends on the size of each individual j at time ti bj ti dynamics at the population level can then formally be described by the equation 1 d p d t c p 1 p j 1 n m v a r b j t i n p while this function is not efficient for simulating the system our more efficient implementation is described below it is helpful for illustrating how dynamics proceed in this nevertheless eq 1 shows that in this model new individuals are produced in proportion to the fraction of occupied sites p times the per capita colonisation rate c and disperse randomly to all empty sites i e multiplication by 1 p jointly these terms describe the density dependant colonisation rate in contrast mortality described by the variable size dependant rate mvar occurs only within the fraction of occupied sites p and represents a population size independent rate at which sites are cleared i e m var p the balance of individuals being recruited at colonisation rate c and individuals dying at mortality rate m var determines whether a species successfully establishes and spreads within a landscape to implement these two scales of model dynamics we draw on methods from stochastic dynamical systems theory specifically gillespie s method which allows us to separately track age size and mortality rate for each individual in the population while still maintaining the continuous time structure of the levins model wilkinson 2019 as a result we model colonisation and mortality as discrete events with waiting times between events drawn from a random exponential distribution this particular structure is used in gillespie s method because it allows model dynamics to converge to that of a classic dynamical systems equation for large numbers of individuals gillespie 1976 note that unlike in the classic dynamical systems framework of levins 1969 for which populations can only ever asymptotically approach zero our approach allows populations to go extinct in finite time if stochastic events drive the number of individuals to zero wilkinson 2019 2 2 local scale dynamics time varying mortality rates to implement individual level growth dynamics we model patch level individual size following a logistic growth function which is one of the most commonly applied models of biological growth loreau 2010 in the logistic model per capita growth rate decreases linearly with size and the size of individual j at ti time units after its birth bj ti can be calculated as 2 b j t i k 1 b 0 e r t i where r denotes the intrinsic growth rate and k represents the maximum size that can be approached for large ti fig 1 a as an index of total growth over time which we will use to summarise model dynamics below we also introduce a scaled parameter b 0 k b 0 b 0 which describes the relative growth necessary to increase from initial size b 0 e g size of the seedling to maximum size k tilman 2004 note that by applying eq 2 we can track the size of each individual over time at every site in the landscape next we model variable mortality rates as a function of individual level size our main motivation is to mimic the effects of disturbances on individuals over the course of their entire life cycle following first principles and biological evidence from studies of plant growth comita et al 2010 wesselingh et al 1997 we assume that smaller individuals have a higher probability of dying due to disturbances while larger individuals eventually approach a fixed minimum background mortality rate that is independent of size fig 1a to achieve this pattern of variable mortality while maintaining analytical tractability for our model we assume that size variable mortality rates are driven by external disturbances that cause changes in individual level biomass and that if disturbances are large enough to drive individuals to a biomass of zero the individual is killed to integrate these disturbances into our model we make two strong assumptions first disturbances in our model vary in intensity over time with the relative strength of disturbances proportional to a distribution defined by a concave down quadratic function centred at zero with cut offs at 1 and 1 fig 1a see appendix b 1 eq b 1 in the supplement this function achieves a relatively natural distribution of disturbances i e their impact on biomass can be positive or negative e g dry vs we years and extreme events are rarer than minor events clark et al 2021 typically the distribution of disturbance sizes is assumed to be gaussian we use a quadratic kernel because it achieves almost the same shape but greatly facilitated derivation of the analytical solution for mean mortality below second rather than explicitly simulating the effects of individual disturbance events which would slow computational analysis and inhibit the derivation of an analytical solution to our model we assume that individual level variable mortality is determined by the relative frequency of disturbance events that are large enough to drive individual level biomass to zero i e the fraction of the distributions in fig 1a and eq b 1 that are extreme enough to drive individual size to the zero line or lower conceptually this assumption mimics the outcome of a large number of trials across many individuals i e the resulting size dependant mortality rate is equivalent to the long term average that would have been observed across many individuals had each individual been exposed to a regime of individual disturbance events drawn from the quadratic kernel described above assuming that disturbances are slow relative to individual s growth rates mathematically this variable mortality rate is expressed as the total integral of the quadratic kernel that falls below the zero line when the kernel is centred at the current size of the individual bj ti 3 m m o r t j t i 1 b t 0 3 4 x b j t i 2 1 d x 1 4 b j t i 3 3 4 b j t i 1 2 to derive our variable mortality rate m var this mortality rate is then combined with a size independent basal mortality rate m 0 which is included to prevent very large individuals from becoming immortal see appendix b 1 eq b 4 in the supplement for details yielding 4 m v a r b j t i m 0 1 m m o r t b j t i m m o r t b j t i for practical purposes the outcome of these functions is that individuals with size near the initial value b 0 e g close to the zero line are more often driven to zero abundance i e local extinction by disturbances than individuals with size far from the initial value b 0 e g close to the maximum size thus individuals experience high mortality rates at small sizes i e early life stages followed by a gradual decline that reduces the chance of dying at larger sizes i e at later stages and finally dropping to a minimum rate of m 0 for k 1 for very large individuals fig 1b to simplify model interpretation we also rescale the units for biomass in terms of the maximum disturbance size possible under the quadratic kernel described above k can therefore be interpreted as the maximum size of an individual relative to the largest possible effect that a disturbance can have on an individual thus k 1 implies that individuals can grow sufficiently large that they can no longer be killed by disturbance events and that they are only subject to the background mortality rate m 0 note that we implicitly make two additional assumptions in this model of disturbance effects first that disturbances do not impact the maximum size that individuals can achieve excluding the scaling used to set the units for k and second that disturbance impacts decline monotonically as a function of size while there are biologically relevant cases that would require relaxing both of these assumptions e g disturbance regimes that reduce maximum plant size as is commonly seen near the timberline in alpine regions or disturbance events that disproportionately damage large individuals such as windstorms that topple tall emergent trees these cases would require significantly more complex models to address and are beyond the scope of this paper 2 3 regional scale switch to the event based simulation of stochastic dynamics next to model dynamics at the regional scale we must integrate the size varying mortality rate into levins framework to do so we must derive an expression for the temporally averaged mortality rate experienced by an individual over a fixed timespan formally we do so by solving eq 5 see appendix b 2 conceptually however we can obtain the same result by tracking mortality across a large cohort of individuals imagine a hypothetical landscape beginning at t 0 0 where all individuals start at the same age and initial size b 0 if we track survival across just this cohort of individuals i e ignoring colonisation by new individuals we can calculate the rate at which individuals in the cohort grow old and die as 5 d p c d t m v a r b j t i p c where pc is the surviving fraction of the original cohort by substituting eq 4 for m var and solving for pc we can derive a function for the dynamics of pc over time t as 6 p c p 0 exp t 0 0 t i m v a r b j t d t where p 0 is the initial fraction of the landscape occupied by the cohort note that if we only wish to estimate the fraction of surviving individuals at a fixed point in the future ti i e not the precise dynamics that led to that end point we can substitute the integral in the exponent of eq 6 with a constant average mortality rate m mean ti by applying the mean value theorem for definite integrals see next section appendix b 2 eqs b 6 to b 8 7 p c p 0 exp m m e a n t i t i thus we can apply eq 7 to estimate the expected surviving fraction of individuals in the cohort or equivalently the probability that any given individual will survive up until time ti as pc p 0 importantly it is possible to derive an analytically tractable expression for m mean though it is a somewhat long and unwieldy polynomial see appendix b 2 eq b 7 we can use this expression to rapidly and efficiently calculate time varying mortality rates for individuals in our model to integrate this size varying mortality rate into our regional scale model we must update the classic levins framework to one that tracks the dynamics of discrete individuals over continuous time we do so by applying a stochastic dynamical systems modelling framework via gillespie s method gillespie 1977 2007 wilkinson 2019 in which births and deaths occur as discrete events with waiting times between events drawn from a random exponential distribution with waiting times c and the time varying distribution defined by m var respectively wilkinson 2019 this stochastic dynamical systems approach offers several advantages first the framework allows us to implement individual level differences in vital rates such that the time varying mean mortality rate m mean varies across small vs large individuals second this approach necessarily introduces demographic stochasticity into the model i e stochastic fluctuations driven by random birth and death events which allows unsuccessful invaders to go fully extinct in finite time unlike in the classic levins model where population sizes can only asymptotically approach zero melbourne 2012 arguably this approach is also a more realistic portrayal of real world dynamics in which population size changes by discrete jumps that occur at variable moments in time e g as individuals are born and die shoemaker et al 2020 wilkinson 2019 lastly a useful feature of gillespie s method is that for large population sizes it reduces to a classic dynamical systems model which greatly facilitates checking for errors in computer code by comparing simulation results to analytical expectations wilkinson 2019 in our model we simulate the birth and death events for every individual separately based on their own size varying mortality rate following from m mean in eq 7 and eq b 8 hence after initialisation the time evolution follows a continuous time markov process where the state of the system is made up of two pieces of information the total number of individuals n and the age of each of those individuals ti following the gillespie method each individual is assigned two events at birth representing the waiting time until their next colonisation event and waiting time until mortality respectively if the mortality waiting time is shorter than the colonisation waiting time then the individual dies without reproducing otherwise the individual produces a new offspring which disperses to a randomly chosen site in the landscape where it establishes itself if the site is vacant and the parent individual is then assigned a new waiting time until the next colonisation event time in the model then proceeds event by event in order of waiting time across all individuals with time increments following the waiting times between events fig 2 recall that for colonisation waiting times are drawn from a random exponential distribution with rate parameter c for all individuals for mortality events waiting times are drawn from an exponential distribution with a time varying rate wilkinson 2019 see fig 2c the mechanics of drawing a waiting time from such a distribution are somewhat complicated lehman and keen 2012 though in practice the result is that for any given individual of age ti the total accumulated probability of mortality over its life up to that point is equal to that experienced by an individual with fixed mortality rate m mean ti as defined in eq b 8 to do so we calculate the distribution of the variable morality rate via integration of the exponent in eq 6 using the corresponding inverse function a uniform random draw is then mapped onto the corresponding time ti which is assigned as the time of death t d of the individual see fig 2c fig 2 shows an example of how the simulation process under the gillespie algorithm proceeds and the general algorithm implementation is shown below in pseudo code algorithm 1 for the full annotated source code for conducting our simulation routine see the section data management 2 4 the invasion projection index model simulations on successful invasions and their prediction to characterise model dynamics across a wide range of potential behaviours we choose to vary every input parameter of our model i e the individual s growth rate r colonisation rate c the individual s starting size b 0 and the maximum size scaled by the maximum impact of disturbances k our main interest lies on investigating the relation between the colonisation rate and the mean mortality rate under a range of different disturbance magnitudes in comparison to outcomes of the classic levins model to do so we derived an invasion projection index which we defined as the difference between colonisation and time averaged mortality rate 8 δ c m mean c m mean as in the classic levins model this quantity provides a simple measure for predicting invasion success if colonisation events occur on average more frequently than mortality events then invasions will also on average be successful although the index defined in eq 8 can be calculated without any simulations based on the analytically derived expression appendix b 2 eq b 8 we performed extensive model simulations with varied input parameters to underpin and validate our analytical results hence we created sets of random parameter combination from the following intervals the individual s growth rate r 0 1 2 colonisation rate c 0 1 2 the individual s starting size b 0 0 001 0 1 and the maximum size k 0 5 1 we drew the values randomly from a uniform distribution additionally we randomly chose the landscape size i e number of sites m from seven possible values m 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000 and sampled the starting fraction of populated sites p 0 from an integer list starting at one and ranging to the fifth of the total number of sites p 0 1 m 5 m note that for a given p 0 the initial number of individuals therefore depends on m overall 6 input parameters were varied from which 3200 unique parameter set combinations were created each parameter set was simulated 20 times the maximum simulation runtime was set to t max 100 which was selected because it allowed for at least one full turnover of the initial cohort of individuals following from the interval the base mortality rate of m 0 0 01 0 1 was drawn from uniformly 3 results our analyses yielded an analytically tractable estimate of invasion success for a demographically structured extension of the classic levins model in accordance with our expectations we found a strong link between increased time varying mortality rate and decreased invasion success in particular both the likelihood of invaders surviving to the end of the simulation and the fraction of sites occupied by successful invaders at the end of the simulation increased as a function of our invasion projection index δ c m mean i e the difference between the colonisation rate and the time averaged mortality rate fig 3 when this index was negative i e when the average mortality rate exceeded the colonisation rate invasions were never successful and always led to local extinction fig 3a see vertical blue dashed line in contrast and unlike in the classic levins model levins 1969 tilman 1994 demographic stochasticity in our model led to a non zero probability of extinction even when δ c m mean was positive fig 3b thus the larger the difference between colonisation rates and mean mortality rates for invaders in our model the higher their probability of successful establishment and the higher their post invasion abundance but even very large differences do not completely guarantee that an invader will be successful in all cases interestingly our simulations show that the relationship between the probability of invasion success vs the invasion projection index δ c m mean closely follows a power function fig 3b additionally as expected our results show that the difference between colonisation and mean mortality rates and thus the overall success of an invader increased for parameter combinations that led to fast individual level growth i e high r large initial individual size i e large b 0 and large maximum size relative to the impact of disturbances i e high k fig 4 impacts were largest for changes in k as well as initial increases in r up to about a value of 0 5 in contrast for larger values of r and for most values of b 0 increases in parameter values led to only modest decreases in mean mortality rates recall however that in our model individual level biomass is scaled relative to the maximum size of disturbances such that low values of b 0 and k can imply either small individual sizes or large disturbances if we instead focus on the scaled relative growth size index b 0 k b 0 b 0 which summarises the relative size increase needed for an individual to grow from its initial size to its maximum size a different pattern emerges fig 4 d h here we find a sharp initial decline in m mean with initial increases of b 0 followed by a slow increase in m mean for higher values of b 0 another interesting finding resulting from the demographic stochasticity in our model is the varying influence of the initial abundance p 0 and system size m on the invasion dynamic on the one hand once a species successfully establishes itself in a new habitat these quantities do not have much of an impact on final number of sites occupied by a successful invader see fig 5 a on the other hand small system sizes in combination with low initial abundances yielded a lower overall survival probability due to a higher probability of stochastic drift forwards extinction see fig 5b note however that as expected for effects of demographic stochasticity may 1973 these effects quickly diminished as the initial number of individuals grew large system sizes of m 100 patches and population sizes of p 0 0 04 in our model 4 discussion by extending the classic levins model to include a size varying mortality rate our results reveal five primary theoretical findings 1 we were able to derive an analytically tractable function for the time averaged variable mortality rate m mean depending only on model input parameters i e growth rate r impacts of disturbances relative to maximum size k and initial size b 0 2 as hypothesised we found that the time averaged mortality rate increased as growth rates grew slower and as maximum size and initial size grew smaller 3 we defined a simple function the invasion projection index δ c m mean which can be used to characterise invasion success based only on the colonisation rate c and the time averaged mortality rate 4 in accordance with the classic levins model we identified a threshold below which our analytically tractable expression guarantees that the invader species will die out i e c m mean and 5 above that threshold we found that likelihood of successful invasion was closely related to the invasion projection index δ c m mean following a power function given how elusive accurate predictions of invasion outcomes can be in the real world catford et al 2016 it is encouraging that our model permits an analytically tractable invasion success that can be related to measurable individual level life history parameters though we stress that our results are purely theoretical they suggest that similar time averaged estimates of vital rates might be a fruitful and tractable way forward critically as in the classic levins model hastings 1980 levins 1969 outcomes in our model primarily boil down to whether or not on average colonisation events occur faster than mortality events not only can these rates in theory be directly measured in empirical systems but we can also use them to link the outcomes of our simulation tests directly to the analytically tractable formula for the time averaged mortality rate 4 1 event based framework our implementation of gillespie s method allowed us to directly model individual level birth and death processes which was necessary for incorporating size dependant differences in mortality rates an unavoidable side effect of this framework is that it introduced demographic stochasticity into our model wilkinson 2019 as already discussed this approach brings with it several advantages including the emergence of true extinction events in our model rather than the typical asymptotic drift towards extinction seen in the classic levins model appendix d fig d 1 this feature allows us to investigate invasion failure rates without e g needing to introduce a synthetic lower boundary to population size see meyer 2019 for a more thorough discussion of this approach additionally in comparison to other individual level frameworks gillespie s method has the enormous advantage of being directly relatable to a closed form continuous time dynamical systems model when simulated for very large populations gillespie 1976 this feature is particularly important for our study both because it allows us to more quickly and generally characterise model results in the absence of demographic stochasticity based on the analytically tractable relationship between c and m mean and because it allows robust validation of the simulation model against theoretical expectations appendix c fig c 5 wilkinson 2019 in contrast most other individual level frameworks discretise not just individual level abundances but also implement discrete time steps which do not allow for such clean analytical links to occur durrett and levin 1994 comparisons of our results with other stochastic levins implementations is difficult as most studies do not track effects of demographic structure at the individual level in particular as discussed below these demographic effects are the primary drivers of the relationships between the mean time varying mortality rate m mean and the other model parameters especially the increases in m mean for smaller values of starting size b 0 and maximum individual size k to our knowledge these effects have not yet been investigated in other studies nevertheless our general results largely accord with existing findings from other stochastic levins model implementations i e that invasion success declines with slower colonisation rates higher mortality rates smaller initial fraction of sites occupied and smaller overall landscape sizes kinzig et al 1999 especially these latter two results i e that demographic stochasticity leads to higher extinction rates for small initial population sizes and small overall landscape sizes have been found in many studies of other stochastic modelling frameworks and are to be expected from first principles lande et al 1998 lewis and pacala 2000 may 1973 ovaskainen and meerson 2010 4 2 the invasion projection index as in the classic levins framework hastings 1980 for any fixed colonisation rate smaller than the mean mortality rate c m mean a deterministically driven extinction event will always occur in our model we summarise this difference between colonisation and mean mortality rates in the invasion projection δ c m mean successful invasions in our model are therefore possible if and only if this index is positive this index is one of the primary results of our study because it can be calculated directly from the other model parameters the index allows deterministic outcomes in our model to be predicted from a closed form analytically tractable equation see appendix b 2 eq b 8 however unlike in the classic levins model positive δ c m mean values in our implementation i e c m mean do not guarantee that an invasion will be successful due to the effects of demographic stochasticity for example fig 3 shows that even when the colonisation rate c is much larger than average mortality rates m mean extinction events still occur though as expected from first principles may 1974 analyses in fig 5b show that the frequency of stochastic extinction events declines as a function of overall population size i e with higher initial fraction of occupied sites p 0 and higher overall landscape size m shaffer 1981 in general deriving closed form solutions for the impacts of demographic stochasticity on demographically structured populations is not possible and consequently model outcomes must be investigated via simulation tilman 2004 vindenes et al 2012 however for our model we find that invasion success is related to our invasion projection index δ c m mean following a strong highly conserved power function fig 3b this relationship suggests a practical approach for estimating the probability of successful invasion in two steps first one can use the chosen model parameters as input for eq b 8 to calculate m mean and then second one can use the linearized relationship in fig 3b to directly calculate the invasion probability for an event at least for the simplified scenario considered in our model although the linearized relationship would likely need to be re parameterised following any changes to model structure e g removing background mortality m 0 or inclusion of local dispersal this procedure would allow simulation results to be used to make efficient predictions of model outcomes for other parameter combinations ovaskainen and meerson 2010 and potentially even for some real world systems moreover a particularly useful feature is that so long as an invader is able to establish final frequency of occupied sites is relatively independent of the effects of demographic stochasticity in our model fig 5a thus in most cases the closed form solutions presented here should be sufficient for forecasting the abundance of successful invaders in our model 4 3 transient vs static impacts on the average mortality rate parameters in our model exhibit two distinct kinds of impacts on individual level mortality rates first transient impacts are driven by the growth rate r and initial size b 0 though these parameters influence average mortality they do so primally early on in an individual s development by controlling the time needed to grow fig 4a to b the more quickly an individual can become large e g faster growth rate r or larger initial size b 0 the lower its size dependant mortality rate becomes if the relative impacts of disturbances are small enough then following eq 3 high r and b 0 can lead individuals to quickly overcome size dependant morality entirely leaving just the basal mortality rate for fully grown individuals fig 1b and thus leading to an overall decrease in the mean mortality rate m mean interestingly the slight decrease that we find in m mean as a function of initial size b 0 fig 4b and f implies that species in our model are subject to something akin to an individual level allee like effect formally an allee effect is the positive association between individual level survival and population size allee et al 1949 odum and allee 1954 stephens et al 1999 and implies that there is some critical abundance below which the population will be driven deterministically extinct courchamp et al 1999 in our model this effect acts at the level of individuals that is if propagules do not exceed a minimum necessary size then size dependant mortality effects can be so high as to drive the invasion projection index δ c m mean negative and thus prevent any successful invasions because low b 0 also increases the length of time needed before individuals reach their full size this deterministic allee like effect also interacts with extinction events driven by demographic stochasticity indeed a recent study by dennis et al 2016 has likewise shown that stochasticity enhances the risk of allee effects to our knowledge these kinds of allee like behaviour have not been previously reported for other extensions of the levins model the second kind of impacts of parameters on mortality rates are static impacts i e those that last throughout the entire life cycle of an individual these impacts are controlled through the basal size independent mortality rate m 0 and the maximum individual size relative to the impact of disturbances k for very low values of k i e k 1 implying that impacts of disturbances on individuals are large relative to their maximum size the variable mortality rate never reduces to zero regardless of individual size or age and always contributes to the total mortality in contrast when k is large disturbance impacts become smaller relative to maximum individual size leading to lower average mortality rates fig 4c note that overall mean mortality rate is therefore determined by an interplay between transient and static impacts these joint effects are illustrated in our index parameter b 0 which describes the relative change needed for individuals to grow from their initial size at birth to their maximum size somewhat counter intuitively for the parameter ranges that we consider mean mortality rate is lowest for intermediate values of b 0 this pattern suggests something of a trade off for the parameter range that we investigated if b 0 is too large then individuals must grow for a long time before reaching maximum size and thus experience increased mortality while in smaller stages of development however if b 0 is too small then even though individuals can reach their maximum size quickly this maximum size is not large enough to avoid severe impacts of disturbances 4 4 empirical evidence and caveats although our results are theoretical there are several biological systems in which similar patterns can be observed in particular impacts of initial size b 0 on invasion success relate closely to empirical findings related to propagule size which have been especially well studied for terrestrial plants in general species with larger propagules also tend to be more effective invaders pyšek and richardson 2008 for terrestrial plants larger seeds tend to be more resistant to stresses moles and westoby 2006 muller landau 2010 meaning they have higher probability of establishing in new sites and surviving long enough to grow large similarly species with fast growth or dispersal rates tend to be more ruderal meaning that they can quickly establish grow large and form stable populations even in relatively disturbed sites grime 1974 isbell et al 2015 and tend to be more successful invaders colautti et al 2006 these trends accord with our results that higher r and higher b 0 tends to lead to greater invasion success nevertheless there are a number of important caveats to these interpretations of empirical data first over longer timescales fast growing invaders are often displaced by more competitive slower growing species catford et al 2019 this pattern is particularly pronounced in grassland plant communities where species often transition from distinct fast growing early successional communities to slow growing late successional communities clark et al 2019 grime 1974 tilman 1994 thus results predicted by our model may only be indicative of short term invasion success which could ultimately be reversed through slower acting interactions with other species another caveat is that while larger propagules may increase establishment success they can also inhibit other aspects of invasion such as dispersal ability or the total number of propagules produced sullivan et al 2018 depending on the system context and observational scale propagule size can therefore be associated with either increases or decreases in invasion rates clark et al 2017 similar trade offs exist for vegetative growth rates although fast growth can help species establish and spread quickly both individual level and population level growth rates that are too fast can destabilise populations leading to fluctuating or chaotic dynamics may 1974 tilman and wedin 1991 or preventing species from matching their spatial distributions to those of favourable environmental conditions wang et al 2015 thus although our model implies simple monotonic relationships between r b 0 m mean and invasion success long term patterns in real world systems are likely to be more complex one final but important caveat is that our model makes very strong assumptions about how disturbance strength interacts with individual size in our model disturbance impacts and thus size dependant mortality rates decline monotonically with individual size and maximum individual size k remains constant over time these assumptions allow us to generate a closed form solution for the mean time varying mortality rate m mean however in empirical systems patterns are not always this straightforward for example for trees harsh climate conditions at higher elevations lead both to a decline in population density and to the average size of individual trees körner 1998 similarly disturbances such as windstorms or harvesting can lead to higher rates of mortality among larger individuals bromley 1939 fenberg and roy 2008 more generally older individuals often experience senescence meaning that they become more prone to the effects of disturbances with age quarles and roach 2018 thus while integrating processes such as feedbacks between the disturbance regime and k or non monotonic relationships between size and m var would surely yield a more realistic model we caution that doing so would come at the cost of analytical tractability 4 5 potential empirical applications results from our model have several important implications for invasion and invasion control in order to suppress invasions our model suggests that reducing growth rates i e reducing r or site specific initial sizes or abundances across the landscape i e reducing b 0 can be particularly effective control measures in contrast after an invader has become successfully established changes to landscape size and initial abundance do not have much of an impact on its long term abundance see fig 5a these results suggest that once a species is established small scale eradication efforts or protecting subregions from invasion i e reducing m will not be very effective control measures instead our model suggests that successful eradication of an established invader requires system wide efforts to e g reduce individual level growth rates i e reduce r selectively remove large individuals i e reduce k or decrease average initial size i e reduce b 0 this prediction accords with some empirical results e g showing that suppression of the growth and spread of invading individuals can help reduce invasion success andrew and ustin 2010 whereas targeted local efforts usually fail to prevent invasion in the long term hill and sowards 2015 these insights have been successfully applied in some systems e g in eradication campaigns of the european buckthorn rhamnus cathartica in north america where it was found that control efforts that were aimed at reducing overall seed production were more effective than those that simply reduced the number of adult individuals delanoy and archibold 2007 note that these predictions are also similar to general expectations from the theory of island biology macarthur and wilson 1967 simberloff et al 2013 i e that reductions in colonisation rate or increases in the mortality rate will lead to declines in the survival and persistence of individual species from a practical perspective our model s predictions also have some relevance for land use and land management decisions especially for systems dominated by sessile plant communities for example in many world regions land abandonment is usually followed by natural succession first with invasion by herbaceous plants then shrubs and lastly trees which often come to dominate the system in the long term hobbs and walker 2007 pickett et al 2009 prach and walker 2011 growth rates of herbaceous plants are generally higher than those for woody plants and frequent disturbances e g in terms of management regimes such as mowing or burning are often the most effective way to prevent invasion by woody species sprugel 1991 these results accord with expectations from our model i e that more intense disturbance regimes and frequent reductions in individual size would favour fast growing grasses or herbs over slowing growing shrubs and trees as discussed above however disturbances in real world systems have many different kinds of effects on many different biological parameters for example although climate change impacts are often viewed as negative it has been identified as a positive impact on invasion success for some species leading them to extend their range of distribution buckland et al 2001 similarly some empirical studies show that management strategies such as burning in order to promote native grasses can also result in the opposite undesired direction of an invasion by non native species reed et al 2005 thus direct extrapolations from our model to empirical systems should be made with caution 4 6 future directions in addition to addressing the caveats discussed above there are a number of potential additions to the model that we present here which could help extend its scope in future studies first our version of the model considers only the dynamics of a single species however multispecies versions of the levins model have also been developed usually in combination with a competitive hierarchy that allows propagules of some species to replace adults of other species tilman 1994 integrating these effects into our model may help better address the impacts of species interactions on invasion success second in our conceptualisation of the model each site is occupied by at most a single individual and we consequently do not consider local scale interactions among individuals while this implementation is consistent with that from tilman 1994 it is worth noting that the original levins model actually treated each patch as a local population rather than a single individual levins 1969 similarly individual level dynamics in our model could be reinterpreted as the growth of individual populations across a metapopulation e g with r as local population growth rate k as maximum local population size etc doing so would allow us to model interactions among species at both the local and the regional levels e g allowing for more complex interaction frameworks such as resource competition similar models have been developed for some aspects of the levins model though not with size dependant interactions klausmeier 2001 lehman 2000 lastly although the power relationship that we find between the probability of a successful invasion and the invasion projection index δ c m mean can in theory be calibrated for any updated model by running simulations across a wide range of parameter values it would be particularly useful if the power relationship could be estimated directly from model parameters deriving such a relationship would therefore be a highly fruitful goal for future studies though it is currently unclear whether such a solution is even theoretically possible vindenes et al 2012 5 conclusion here we present a demographically structured invasion model based on the classic levins metapopulation framework as in the classic levins model we find that invasion success requires colonisation rates to exceed average mortality rates however unlike classic versions of the model mortality rates in our model vary as a function of the size of individuals our core results include the derivation of an analytically tractable invasion projection index δ c m mean which compares the difference between the rate at which individuals produce successful propagules versus the average rate at which they die additionally we identify a simple power function which can be used to predict the likelihood of successful invasion based on the invasion projection index jointly these results show that successful invaders tend to have higher individual level growth rates higher initial sizes at birth are better able to grow sufficiently large sizes to escape the effects of size dependant mortality data management data and code are permanently archived and

24207,integrated aquaculture systems combining macroalgae with traditional fish and shellfish production represent an ecologically sound and economically attractive solution for farmers to evaluate the potential of growing sugar kelp saccharina latissima at existing oyster crassostrea virginica farms in narragansett bay nb rhode island u s we developed an ecosystem model based on individual dynamic energy budget models for kelp and oysters forced offline by a coupled 3d hydrodynamic water quality model kelp growth during the cold winter months provides ecosystem services through the removal of nutrients in the bay as well as serving as an additional source of revenue for farmers locations with the most nutrient rich waters at the northern end of the bay seem most suitable for kelp aquaculture with oyster growth also reaching maxima at the same locations predictions of kelp biomass grown on lines ranged from 0 97 kgww m 1 at the easternmost site at the bay entrance to 2 03 kgww m 1 at the northernmost site in the upper bay or 1 6 and 3 4 tons ha 1 on 6 m spaced line farms respectively for denser production in 1 5 m spaced line farms estimates ranged between 6 5 and 13 5 tons ha 1 depending on the different farm setups we estimated the potential profits based on delivered cost for consumer product at 4 468 for a 6 m spaced line farm of 1 ha and 17 872 for a 1 5 m spaced line farm the n and c fixation of kelp ranged depending on spacing of longlines and time of harvest but reached maximum values of 1117 and 6184 kg ha 1 respectively these estimates offer valuable information that should help producers and managers in their decision to direct efforts and investments into this developing activity in the u s keywords imta macroalgae bivalve dynamic energy budget nitrogen uptake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuarine and coastal ecosystems provide essential goods and services including provision of fisheries foraging and nursery habitat filtration and detoxification barbier et al 2011 however they are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities through eutrophication overfishing pollution and habitat degradation lotze et al 2006 worm et al 2006 barbier et al 2011 this has led to increasing investments in coastal restoration as well as motivating coastal communities to search for alternative solutions to sustain livelihoods in this context aquaculture has become the fastest growing form of aquatic food production and now represents more than half of all seafood production globally fao 2020 unfortunately the rapid development of aquaculture has led to some negative social ecological impacts particularly from large scale fish farms bostock et al 2010 culture of lower trophic level species are generally far less damaging to the environment and can even improve the health of ecosystems gallardi 2014 although great efforts have been undertaken to mitigate the negative impacts from aquaculture different approaches are needed that deliver aquatic food within ecological limits while conserving and or restoring ecosystem goods and services integrated aquaculture i e raising multiple species of different trophic levels to recreate natural ecosystem dynamics has been practiced by many societies throughout history shellfish and seaweeds provide a range of valuable ecosystem goods and services cabral et al 2016 smaal et al 2019 and similar functions can be ascribed to their commercial cultivation those functions include provision of food grant and strand 2019 fao 2020 wildlife habitat for fish and mobile invertebrate species tallman and forrester 2007 theuerkauf et al 2021 water quality regulation chopin et al 1999 gallardi 2014 smaal et al 2019 coastal protection jackson and winant 1983 ysebaert et al 2019 and carbon sequestration tang et al 2011 in the last decade an increasing body of literature has highlighted and promoted these approaches to offer solutions that ensure sustainable ecological social and economic objectives e g chopin et al 1999 holdt and edwards 2014 as a result shellfish and seaweed aquaculture is increasingly considered as a solution to mitigate negative anthropogenic impacts in aquatic environments while also providing a wide array of ecosystem goods and services european commission 2012 froehlich et al 2017 while the u s ranks among the world leaders in fisheries production aquaculture remains a modest industry with little growth shellfish production has been at a relatively constant level since 2014 although it still leads u s aquaculture production in value nmfs 2021 most of the growth in u s aquaculture comes from new seaweed cultivation especially in new england kim et al 2019 and alaska noaa alaska fisheries science center 2022 seaweed aquaculture can maintain its momentum by emphasizing its environmental benefits the diversification of its products and the cultivation of a variety of native species moreover the combination of shellfish with seaweed aquaculture could also be a diversification opportunity for shellfish farmers towards economic stability in an industry where success is deeply conditioned by the increasing variability of environmental factors and markets smith 2019 stankus 2021 however complex permitting processes and social resistance to aquaculture are often cited as barriers to expansion knapp and rubino 2016 for example empirical research from rhode island shows that public support for farms is positively associated with societal impacts rather than those associated with environmental impacts dalton and jin 2018 another impediment to aquaculture growth is uncertainty surrounding the growth potential of organisms which affects the economic potential of farms gibbs 2009 little is known regarding suitable conditions for seaweed and shellfish integrated aquaculture in the u s and spatially explicit estimates are needed to assist in site selection a better understanding of the production potential of the surrounding ecosystem could help managers and farmers choose the right kind of aquaculture to grow a marketable product while also decreasing potential negative environmental impacts and maximizing ecosystem services ecosystem modeling is an important tool for aquaculture that can generate valuable information for planning and predicting ecological and economic suitability ferreira et al 2007 scenario building allows the exploration of management strategies and environmental risks to both the farming industry and the natural environment where it is implemented most ecosystem models integrate time and space to understand complex physical chemical and ecological dynamics particularly in coastal areas where most shellfish and seaweed aquaculture facilities are located e g dowd 2005 cranford et al 2013 the complexity of coastal ecosystems imposes a common trade off between the generality and replicability or simplicity of a model and its realism or precision matthewson and weisberg 2009 kellner et al 2011 one modeling approach often used is individual based modeling in which the growth of an organism finfish shellfish or seaweed is predicted based on experienced environmental conditions combined with a detailed formulation of physical variables to ensure realism and a mechanistic implementation of individual bioenergetics to ensure generality guyondet et al 2015 lavaud et al 2020 this approach allows for a quantitative assessment of temporal dynamics which is needed to evaluate the benefits of integrated aquaculture barrett et al 2022 in this study we build an ecosystem model to investigate the production potential and spatial variability of kelp and oyster growth in integrated aquaculture settings across the narragansett bay ecosystem rhode island u s existing models for the individual bioenergetics of sugar kelp saccharina latissima and eastern oyster crassostrea virginica were combined with a coupled hydrodynamics water quality model to evaluate the influence of biogeophysical processes on the growth potential of kelp and oysters at existing shellfish leases in narragansett bay specifically we used model simulations to identify optimal geographic locations and harvest timing for kelp farming this ecosystem model provides new estimates of kelp and oyster growth potential that should help inform farmers and local managers in their decision to adopt integrated kelp and oyster aquaculture in rhode island and elsewhere where their growth is feasible 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the ecosystem model presented in this study was developed for narragansett bay nb a 381 km2 estuarine system along the northeast coast of the u s fig 1 a where oyster farming is well developed most of the farming is conducted using on bottom rack and bag systems but this can be variable and include floating bags for this study we only focus on on bottom culture and divide the oyster farm sites in nb into several sub areas that roughly correspond with the local geography and which lie along the dominant north south hydrographic gradient fig 1b from north to south the salinity generally increases from the upper bay through the mid and lower bay sub areas and is highest at the bay entrance sites nutrient concentrations e g nitrate exhibit a reversed gradient with highest values in the upper bay and lowest values in the bay entrance sub area the sakonnet sub area in the easternmost portion of nb is somewhat isolated geographically from the rest of the bay by the narrow entrance at its northern end but is significantly influenced by freshwater discharge from the taunton river the easternmost river entering nb shown in fig 1a hydrographically the sakonnet sub area is like the mid bay sub area the oyster farm sites in the sakonnet sub area are somewhat shallower than elsewhere in the bay 2 2 ecosystem model the ecosystem model is composed of three models a coupled hydrodynamics water quality model osom cosine and two individual bioenergetic dynamic energy budget deb models one for kelp and one for oysters fig 2 the osom cosine model consists of a 3d hydrodynamics module simulating the circulation and hydrography temperature and salinity and a biogeochemical module computing the lower trophic level ecology of nb to provide concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and plankton photosynthetically active radiation par was derived from radiative forcing from the north american regional reanalysis venolia et al 2020 temperature par and nutrient concentrations were used as forcing variables for the kelp model to predict blade growth blade length cm temperature and plankton concentration were used as forcing variables for the oyster model to predict shell and tissue growth shell height cm 2 3 hydrodynamics water quality model the three dimensional hydrodynamics of nb were computed using the ocean state ocean model osom sane et al 2020 which is an application of the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the model domain extends from the upper reaches of nb to the mid shelf off the southern new england coast fig 1a the spatial grid consists of 1000 1100 cells with a curvilinear varying horizontal resolution of approximately 85 m near the head of nb and 475 m at the southern boundary there are 15 terrain following vertical levels other model properties including vertical and horizontal viscosity and diffusivity bottom drag open boundaries forcing and tidal forcing are described in detail by sane et al 2020 the model was forced with spatially and temporally variable winds from the north american mesoscale analyses https www ncei noaa gov data north american mesoscale model access historical analysis surface heat fluxes except for upward longwave radiative flux which was computed from the model surface temperature were assumed to be spatially uniform but still temporally variable net shortwave flux and downward longwave fluxes were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis model http www emc ncep noaa gov mmb rreanl at the grid point located in the ocean just south of the nb mouth meteorological variables needed to compute sensible and latent heat fluxes were obtained from local ports stations http www co ops nos noaa gov and from t f green airport located along upper nb and these fluxes as well as surface momentum fluxes were computed using the coare bulk formulae fairall et al 2003 freshwater volume fluxes into the osom model domain from rivers and wastewater treatment facilities were applied as point sources at the locations shown in fig 1b for most rivers measured fluxes were obtained from united states geological survey usgs gaging stations and these values were adjusted to account for the ungauged drainage area between the gaging stations and the model input locations ullman et al 2019 the discharge of ungauged rivers was estimated from nearby gauged rivers using regression techniques as described in ullman et al 2019 the salinity of inflowing river water was set to zero while the daily water temperature was specified using an empirical regression using air temperature and water temperature from the prior day ullman et al 2019 nutrient concentrations in river water were specified using linear interpolation of observations from the narragansett bay commission and the u s geological survey volume fluxes as well as nutrient concentrations for the discharges from the three main wastewater treatment facilities into nb were obtained from the plant operators the lower trophic level pelagic ecology of nb was simulated using the carbon silicate and nitrogen ecosystem cosine model chai et al 2002 xiu and chai 2011 zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2018 cosine is fully coupled with the realistically forced osom hydrodynamics model the model state variables include four nutrients nitrate ammonium phosphate and silicate two phytoplankton classes small phytoplankton and diatoms two zooplankton classes micro and meso zooplankton two detritus classes nitrogenous and silicious detritus as well as dissolved oxygen total inorganic carbon and total alkalinity details of the model formulations are described in chai et al 2002 and liu et al 2018 nutrient regeneration in the cosine model involves water column processes only because inputs from riverine and wastewater treatment facilities dominate nutrient dynamics in this system nixon et al 1995 benthic regeneration processes can be neglected the sum of the biomasses of small phytoplankton diatoms microzooplankton and nitrogenous detritus mmol n m 3 was used as the food input in the oyster deb model the coupled osom cosine model was run with a time step of 15 s model results were output at 0 5 h intervals and were averaged to the hourly or daily values needed for the kelp or oyster models respectively 2 4 kelp and oyster deb models the individual bioenergetic models used for kelp and oyster are based on dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 although applied to extremely different organisms the deb models for kelp and oyster rely on the same basic principles energy contained in a substrate in the form of dic and nitrate for kelp or the summed food variable described above for oysters is assimilated into reserves one for each substrate reserves are then used to fuel metabolic processes such as maintenance somatic growth development and reproduction all parameters and equations for these models are available in tables s1 and s2 the kelp deb model was developed and calibrated by venolia et al 2020 and the same set of parameters and initial conditions were used the model was run on an hourly time step from 1st november 2017 to 23rd april 2018 i e the winter period which represents a standard growth season for kelp aquaculture in the area at the end of which algae are harvested and new seed lines deployed the next fall the kelp blade growth was modelled for an individual grown 1 m underwater at all selected farm site across nb fig 1 simulations started with a seedling of 50 mg with initial state variables for nitrogen reserve m e n and carbon reserve m e c set at 2 mmol molv 1 i e moles of carbon per mole of structure v and 10 mmol molv 1 respectively par was estimated based on the method described by venolia et al 2020 using the same shortwave radiation forcing as was used for the osom cosine model runs at each location we calculated the expected wet biomass in kgww m 1 that could be harvested on a 1 ha farm using weight outputs from the model in gdw ind 1 a seeding density of 87 ind m 1 mean of 24 samples collected in may 2019 standard deviation 32 table s5 and a dry weight to wet weight ratio of 0 10 mean of 34 samples collected in april 2018 standard deviation 0 03 for a farm equipped with 100 m lines spaced by 1 5 or 6 m as experimented on southern new england farms by yarish et al 2017 the oyster deb model was developed and validated by lavaud et al 2017 the same set of parameters was used except for the functional response to food availability x k which was calibrated for this study based on field growth data from two oyster farms wickford and rome point fig 1b in lower narragansett bay and chlorophyll a concentration measurements obtained from the nearby university of rhode island graduate school of oceanography s long term phytoplankton sampling site station gso phyto in fig 1b near surface and near bottom chlorophyll a at this site was obtained from seawater samples processed for immediate extraction and quantified by fluorometry as described by graff and rynearson 2011 the model was run at the same locations as the kelp model on a daily time step from 1st may 2017 to 31st december 2018 oysters are usually harvested in their second year of growth simulations of oyster shell growth were initiated uniformly across locations with a shell height of 1 cm half of the maximum reserve density e m p a m v and an empty reproduction buffer the osom cosine model outputs for the sum of small phytoplankton diatoms microzooplankton and detritus expressed in mmol n m 3 was transformed into chlorophyll a concentration assuming a conversion coefficient of unity marra et al 1990 dugdale et al 2012 and used as food source in the oyster deb model all parameters and equations for these models are available in tables s3 and s4 2 5 revenue analysis of farm scale operations potential biomass was then converted to a monetary value using an average farm gate price of 1 32 kg 1 or 0 60 lb 1 fresh for farmed seaweed in maine which is the most recent average price available at the time of writing maine department of marine resources 2020 mckinley research group 2021 predicted revenue pr reported in ha 1 was calculated as p r b i o m a s s d e n s i t y l i n e l e n g t h s p a c e p r i c e where b i o m a s s is the deb model derived individual biomass at harvest kgww ind 1 d e n s i t y is the seeding density ind m 1 see 2 3 l i n e l e n g t h is the length of a seeding line 100 m s p a c e is the space between lines 1 5 or 6 m as experimented on southern new england farms by yarish et al 2017 and p r i c e is the average farm gate price market size for oysters is 3 in 7 4 cm and they usually reach this threshold during their second year in connecticut u s however the u s oyster market is generally based on unit prices independent of oyster size since the present model does not represent a population but a generalized individual we did not calculate the value of produced oysters in this study 2 6 ecosystem services kelp uses some elements present in the water such as nitrogen taken up by the algae as no3 no2 or nh4 and carbon dioxide to grow the removal of n and c contributes to the mitigation of nutrient runoff and carbon emissions and as such constitutes ecosystem services that can be quantified through the bioenergetic deb model potential n and c net uptake kg n c ha 1 from kelp was output from the deb model at each location for an average individual and scaled up to a farm setting using the equation u p t a k e w d e n s i t y l i n e l e n g t h s p a c e where w is the mass of total n or c in an individual algal thallus kg ind 1 because the contribution of reserves in c and n to w may vary through time we report the value of n and c net uptake both at the time of harvest i e at the end of the simulation as well as the maximum through time this distinction may indicate that harvest should occur earlier to maximize the nutrient removal service provided by kelp growth 3 results 3 1 osom cosine model outputs the temporal dynamics of environmental variables outputted from the osom cosine model followed a seasonal pattern more pronounced at the sub surface where kelp is grown than near bottom where most oysters grow figs 3 4 near surface temperature reached a minimum in early january before slowly rising again fig 3a near bottom temperatures were also lowest in early january and reached a maximum in early august fig 4a near surface nitrate concentration was highest in early november maximum values within regions ranging between 5 9 and 16 4 µmol n l 1 and lowest in april minimum values 1 µmol n l 1 at all sites with values between 2 and 11 µmol n l 1 also observed in all sites except at the bay entrance in january march fig 3b near bottom oyster food concentration showed high variability with peaks throughout the end of spring and the summer with maximum values up to 12 to 16 µmol n l 1 fig 4b par which is not an output from the model also varied according to the time of the year with minimum average values in december and maximum values at the end of the study period in april fig 3c outputs from osom cosine model were used to force the kelp and oyster models over different time periods for 6 months nov 2017 apr 2018 for kelp and for 20 months may 2017 dec 2018 for oysters to illustrate the spatial variability of forcing variables for each model near surface temperature and nitrate for kelp and near bottom temperature and food concentration for oysters the mean values of the osom cosine output variables were computed over the different model time periods for kelp growing mostly during winter months near surface temperatures were coldest at the shallow sites along the western side of the bay and in the sakonnet river and highest in the deeper areas of the mid and lower bay fig 3d mean near surface nitrate concentrations were highest in the upper bay 7 5 µmol n l 1 and lowest at the bay entrance 2 2 0 1 µmol n l 1 fig 3e during the nearly 2 year oyster period mean near bottom temperatures were highest 15 c in the upper bay and in the shallow areas in the western mid bay and the sakonnet river and lowest in the eastern lower bay and at the bay entrance fig 4c mean near bottom oyster food concentration exhibited a similar north south gradient with higher values in the upper bay and decreasing southward fig 4d 3 2 kelp and oyster growth potential mean predicted kelp blade length at the end of the cultivation period in april varied from 50 1 cm at bay entrance sites to 74 5 cm at the upper bay sites fig 5 a final mean predicted length at the sakonnet sites 62 3 cm was between that of the lower bay 58 1 cm and mid bay sites 73 2 cm overlapping with upper bay site in fig 5a predicted kelp growth slowed greatly in the last month at sites near the entrance of nb while moderate to high growth rates were still simulated in other parts of the bay model predictions of kelp mass ranged from 0 97 kgww m 1 at the easternmost site of bay entrance to 2 03 kgww m 1 at the northernmost site in upper bay or 1 6 tons ha 1 and 3 4 tons ha 1 on 6 m spaced line farms respectively figure 6a 6 5 tons ha 1 and 13 5 tons ha 1 with 1 5 m spaced line farms the averages for the entire bay amount to 1 45 0 05 kgww m 1 or 9 6 0 3 tons ha 1 2 4 0 1 tons ha 1 with 1 5 m spaced line farms mean predicted oyster height at the end of the cultivation period in november varied from 6 5 0 3 cm in sites at the bay entrance to 7 8 0 3 cm in the upper bay sites figs 5b 6 b as for kelp simulations predicted growth of oysters in sakonnet sites 7 4 0 0 cm was between that of oysters growing in lower bay 7 1 0 1 cm and mid bay sites 7 5 0 1 cm figs 5b 6b because this study focuses on the integration of kelp production to existing oyster farms simulations for oysters ended during their second year of growth extrapolation of simulations assuming a repetition of environmental conditions from 2018 in 2019 indicate that all oysters except those at the bay entrance sites easily reach market size in their third year of growth data not shown 3 3 production value potential average minimum of 6 7 0 3 tons ha 1 at bay entrance farms average maximum of 12 1 4 tons ha 1 at upper bay sites table 1 these estimated yields at the bay entrance and in the upper bay would translate to 2222 and 3998 for 6 m spaced line farms and to 8887 and 15 991 for 1 5 m spaced line farms respectively maximum revenue at one site in upper bay was estimated at 17 872 for a 1 5 m spaced line farm while the minimum estimate at the bay entrance was 2138 for a 6 m spaced line farm 3 4 ecosystem services a gradient in n uptake from kelp was predicted by the model from the bay entrance to the upper bay locations with values ranging from 10 0 kg n ha 1 at harvest time in a 6 m spaced line farm from the bay entrance to 1117 332 kg n ha 1 at maximum in a 1 5 m spaced line farm from the upper bay table 2 the difference between values at harvest time and at maximum reflect the decrease in n reserves observed toward the end of simulations fig 7 predicted c uptake from kelp through photosynthesis ranged from 1185 161 kg c ha 1 in a 6 m spaced line farm from the mid bay region to 6184 157 kg c ha 1 in a 1 5 m spaced line farm from the lower bay table 2 4 discussion model simulations indicated that both farmed kelp and oysters should grow well across wide swaths of nb although not as well as some nearby observations and that the timing for harvest is critical for maximized growth predicted kelp blade length ranged between 50 and 74 cm and biomass between 0 97 and 2 03 kgww m 1 over the cultivation season which stands at the lower range of observations of 0 2 to 7 8 kg m 1 table s5 yarish et al 2017 also obtained higher yields in a pilot study in long island sound and southeastern new england 1 6 to 14 8 kg m 1 these authors report however that growth was limited in their rhode island and massachusetts sites at the time of harvest in our study apical frond loss can become common in nb which has been correlated with temperature stress and wave action krumhansl et al 2014 mechanical stress of biofouling brown et al 1997 and overall blade length sjotun 1993 additionally the limit on growth could be a result of a reduction in n reserves toward the end of the season see figure s4a in link with a decrease in n concentration in the water fig 3b indicating an n shortage for growth while increases in light flux and temperature in the spring favor c assimilation in kelps the basic somatic maintenance costs are also expected to increase figure s4b but with a limited supply of n the growth rate of algae starts to decrease another factor potentially affecting our kelp growth estimates is competition with microalgae in upper bay sites as the coupling of the roms cosine model to the kelp and oyster deb models was operated offline no feedback interaction from kelps or oysters on the 3d model occurred the filtration activity of oysters feeding on phytoplankton and the competition for light and nutrients between macro and microalgae could positively influence the actual availability of essential substrates for kelp growth the lower kelp biomass predicted by the model compared to available data could also be due to the average seeding density of 87 ind m 1 used in our calculations which is lower than values reported in a case study in norway by forbord et al 2020 it is very likely that not all seeded kelp develops into fully grown thalli especially at high densities yarish et al 2017 reported farm scale biomass production values of 1 0 tons ha 1 on 6 m spaced line farms and 4 4 tons ha 1 on 1 5 m spaced line farms which is within our estimates that ranged between 1 7 0 1 and 12 1 4 tons ha 1 note that the different line spacing scenarios used in our simulations represent a simple scale up of individual dynamics and not different model runs moreover the depth at which the growing lines are set is another factor that can impact kelp harvest biomass through light availability we assumed that algae were grown at a depth of 1 m at all growing sites like forbord et al 2020 who used depth of 1 to 2 m while yarish et al 2017 did not specify this information as for many organisms inter individual variability in physiological traits can be important and accounting for this pattern could lead to more accurate predictions and remove the need for rule of thumb estimates koch and de schamphelaere 2020 we started simulations with uniform oyster height across stations sites 1 cm which does not account for the environmental history that individual oysters would have experienced while growing at these different locations since their deployment usually around 3 4 mm this starting size was based on data collected for the calibration of the half saturation coefficient figure s3 but more variation should be expected additionally different oyster culture practices e g line raft would also likely influence growth compared to traditional on bottom culture modeled in this study with possible impacts on light availability and nutrient circulation and availability for kelp strohmeier et al 2005 the highest growth rates for farmed kelp and oysters were predicted in the upper bay sites where both organisms benefited from higher concentrations of nitrate and near bottom concentrations of phytoplankton respectively the elevated nitrate concentration predicted in this area which is consistent with observations e g oviatt et al 2017 is due to the location of three large wastewater treatment facilities and two of the largest tributary rivers at the northern end of the bay fig 1 freshwater runoff could however pose a limit to growth because sugar kelps prefer high salinity waters particularly at lower latitudes monteiro et al 2021 salinity is not currently included in the kelp deb model but could be added as a forcing variable as has been done for other organisms living in environments subjected to high salinity variations lavaud et al 2017 oyster farms located at the bay entrance appear to be the least suited for kelp cultivation as suggested by the smaller simulated blade lengths fig 5a lower phytoplankton concentration in more open waters has been used to explain reduced growth rates in bivalves in studies on offshore aquaculture palmer et al 2021 farms located further south of nb would also involve higher operation costs due to the distance to site and the exposure to wave action potentially involving heavier gear to secure lines with production potential yielding about half of the value expected at upper bay locations table 2 the development of kelp aquaculture at the entrance of nb might be limited according to model outputs although kelp has been successfully grown along southern new england shorelines including connecticut and massachusetts kim et al 2019 heidkamp et al 2022 one factor that may compensate lower growth is the density of farm lines which previous studies suggested could provide high yield in tightly spaced 1 5 m lines yarish et al 2017 umanzor et al 2021 however most experimental studies conducted on existing farms generally adopt wider separation about 5 6 m between lines e g tabassum et al 2017 grebe et al 2021 and feedback from farmers is needed to evaluate the practicality of working and maintaining such a design in a more exposed environment such as the nb entrance our ecosystem model demonstrates significant quantities of n are removed from the system via kelp growth table 2 however the bio extraction capacity estimated between 10 and 1117 kg n ha 1 showed high variability depending on the location in nb and line spacing the estimated range encompasses values of 19 to 176 kg n ha 1 calculated by grebe et al 2021 in a recent study on kelp aquaculture potential in maine and those of 10 to 139 kg n ha 1 obtained by kim et al 2015 as for biomass production which n uptake is directly linked to various assumptions regarding farm characteristics may explain the higher range of n removed by kelp in our study including line spacing initial seeding density duration of growing season and harvest date as shown in table 2 maximum blade length does not necessarily mean maximum n removal through harvest as n availability tends to decrease later in the growing season with more uptake from both macro and micro algae due to higher biomass and a reduction in runoff the predicted drop in n content in kelp tissue at the end of the simulated period may be surprising considering the capacity of sugar kelp to store nitrogen stekoll et al 2021 however other studies also showed reductions in n content in kelp tissues particularly at the end of the growth season kim et al 2015 stekoll et al 2021 more data on the temporal dynamics of n in kelp tissue could be used to refine model parameters related to the mobilization of n reserves and the needs for structural n maintenance the development of macroalgae cultivation is also seen as a mitigation tool for c emissions from land based activities doumeizel et al 2020 park et al 2021 although these impacts are limited when macroalgae are harvested vs buried in the deep ocean dolliver and o connor 2022 similarly it should be possible to evaluate the c removal potential from oysters through biocalcification this can be achieved within the deb framework as bio calcified products can be computed as a weighted sum of mineral fluxes resulting from metabolic processes see pecquerie et al 2012 or galli et al 2016 for examples of biocalcification in deb the current model for s latissima still requires upgrades to account for dark respiration and produce net estimates of c uptake venolia et al 2020 but the structure of the model could be transferred to any macroalgal or microalgal species with the offline coupling of the hydrodynamic model to bioenergetic models for kelp and oysters the present work constitutes a first step in evaluating the production potential for integrated aquaculture in nb further developments including the budgeting of nutrients within the system would allow the quantification of n fluxes using the current modeling approach such an analysis based on individual deb models was recently undertaken in eastern canada to evaluate the relationship between opportunistic macroalgae growth mussel aquaculture and natural bivalve species lavaud et al 2021 and could be applied in future studies in nb as kelp competes for nutrients with phytoplankton which constitute the main food source of oysters the indirect effect of kelp on oysters could be assessed to maximize production efficiency nevertheless such impacts are likely minimal because 1 optimal growth periods for kelp and phytoplankton are temporally decoupled until mid late spring and 2 the scale of kelp deployment in existing farms is relatively small compared to the rest of the bay our model could also be used in forecasting mode to mechanistically predict the system production potential based on future climate predictions jiang et al 2022 our ecosystem model simulations provide estimates of the growth potential for kelp at existing eastern oyster farms across nb results demonstrate there are potentially significant ecological and economic benefits of such operations these predictions offer a promising outlook and should help producers and managers in their decision making process for this relatively new industry in the u s following assumptions from yarish et al 2017 who conducted an analysis of the kelp production industry in northeastern u s we showed that kelp farming in nb would generate economically sustainable yields in the upper and middle sections of the bay combined with existing oyster farming operations several operational costs would likely be reduced due to similar technologies being used gear and operation tools like boats mooring processing facilities would be used for both species varying yields due to forcing parameters controlling kelp growth n load temperature par would likely have an impact on handling time at harvest and during processing which is hard to quantify at this stage without additional work on economic and environmental condition scenarios we have described how the time of harvest impacted the bio extraction capacity of n from the system the timing of harvest would also have important economic effects because as the season progresses and seawater warms up apical frond loss increases sjøtun 1993 krumhansl et al 2014 using real time monitoring of environmental conditions at a particular site would allow precise determination of when harvest should occur this capacity and the availability of data has been greatly increased in recent years with the deployment of monitoring stations through federal or state programs finally the farming of another product grown on the same aquaculture lease can constitute a means of diversification with the added benefit of decoupled growth through time oysters primarily grow during summer months while kelp grows and is farmed only during winter months the present study provides quantitative estimates of the potential for integrated kelp and oyster aquaculture that will be useful for the development of this type of industry credit authorship contribution statement romain lavaud conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original

24207,integrated aquaculture systems combining macroalgae with traditional fish and shellfish production represent an ecologically sound and economically attractive solution for farmers to evaluate the potential of growing sugar kelp saccharina latissima at existing oyster crassostrea virginica farms in narragansett bay nb rhode island u s we developed an ecosystem model based on individual dynamic energy budget models for kelp and oysters forced offline by a coupled 3d hydrodynamic water quality model kelp growth during the cold winter months provides ecosystem services through the removal of nutrients in the bay as well as serving as an additional source of revenue for farmers locations with the most nutrient rich waters at the northern end of the bay seem most suitable for kelp aquaculture with oyster growth also reaching maxima at the same locations predictions of kelp biomass grown on lines ranged from 0 97 kgww m 1 at the easternmost site at the bay entrance to 2 03 kgww m 1 at the northernmost site in the upper bay or 1 6 and 3 4 tons ha 1 on 6 m spaced line farms respectively for denser production in 1 5 m spaced line farms estimates ranged between 6 5 and 13 5 tons ha 1 depending on the different farm setups we estimated the potential profits based on delivered cost for consumer product at 4 468 for a 6 m spaced line farm of 1 ha and 17 872 for a 1 5 m spaced line farm the n and c fixation of kelp ranged depending on spacing of longlines and time of harvest but reached maximum values of 1117 and 6184 kg ha 1 respectively these estimates offer valuable information that should help producers and managers in their decision to direct efforts and investments into this developing activity in the u s keywords imta macroalgae bivalve dynamic energy budget nitrogen uptake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuarine and coastal ecosystems provide essential goods and services including provision of fisheries foraging and nursery habitat filtration and detoxification barbier et al 2011 however they are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities through eutrophication overfishing pollution and habitat degradation lotze et al 2006 worm et al 2006 barbier et al 2011 this has led to increasing investments in coastal restoration as well as motivating coastal communities to search for alternative solutions to sustain livelihoods in this context aquaculture has become the fastest growing form of aquatic food production and now represents more than half of all seafood production globally fao 2020 unfortunately the rapid development of aquaculture has led to some negative social ecological impacts particularly from large scale fish farms bostock et al 2010 culture of lower trophic level species are generally far less damaging to the environment and can even improve the health of ecosystems gallardi 2014 although great efforts have been undertaken to mitigate the negative impacts from aquaculture different approaches are needed that deliver aquatic food within ecological limits while conserving and or restoring ecosystem goods and services integrated aquaculture i e raising multiple species of different trophic levels to recreate natural ecosystem dynamics has been practiced by many societies throughout history shellfish and seaweeds provide a range of valuable ecosystem goods and services cabral et al 2016 smaal et al 2019 and similar functions can be ascribed to their commercial cultivation those functions include provision of food grant and strand 2019 fao 2020 wildlife habitat for fish and mobile invertebrate species tallman and forrester 2007 theuerkauf et al 2021 water quality regulation chopin et al 1999 gallardi 2014 smaal et al 2019 coastal protection jackson and winant 1983 ysebaert et al 2019 and carbon sequestration tang et al 2011 in the last decade an increasing body of literature has highlighted and promoted these approaches to offer solutions that ensure sustainable ecological social and economic objectives e g chopin et al 1999 holdt and edwards 2014 as a result shellfish and seaweed aquaculture is increasingly considered as a solution to mitigate negative anthropogenic impacts in aquatic environments while also providing a wide array of ecosystem goods and services european commission 2012 froehlich et al 2017 while the u s ranks among the world leaders in fisheries production aquaculture remains a modest industry with little growth shellfish production has been at a relatively constant level since 2014 although it still leads u s aquaculture production in value nmfs 2021 most of the growth in u s aquaculture comes from new seaweed cultivation especially in new england kim et al 2019 and alaska noaa alaska fisheries science center 2022 seaweed aquaculture can maintain its momentum by emphasizing its environmental benefits the diversification of its products and the cultivation of a variety of native species moreover the combination of shellfish with seaweed aquaculture could also be a diversification opportunity for shellfish farmers towards economic stability in an industry where success is deeply conditioned by the increasing variability of environmental factors and markets smith 2019 stankus 2021 however complex permitting processes and social resistance to aquaculture are often cited as barriers to expansion knapp and rubino 2016 for example empirical research from rhode island shows that public support for farms is positively associated with societal impacts rather than those associated with environmental impacts dalton and jin 2018 another impediment to aquaculture growth is uncertainty surrounding the growth potential of organisms which affects the economic potential of farms gibbs 2009 little is known regarding suitable conditions for seaweed and shellfish integrated aquaculture in the u s and spatially explicit estimates are needed to assist in site selection a better understanding of the production potential of the surrounding ecosystem could help managers and farmers choose the right kind of aquaculture to grow a marketable product while also decreasing potential negative environmental impacts and maximizing ecosystem services ecosystem modeling is an important tool for aquaculture that can generate valuable information for planning and predicting ecological and economic suitability ferreira et al 2007 scenario building allows the exploration of management strategies and environmental risks to both the farming industry and the natural environment where it is implemented most ecosystem models integrate time and space to understand complex physical chemical and ecological dynamics particularly in coastal areas where most shellfish and seaweed aquaculture facilities are located e g dowd 2005 cranford et al 2013 the complexity of coastal ecosystems imposes a common trade off between the generality and replicability or simplicity of a model and its realism or precision matthewson and weisberg 2009 kellner et al 2011 one modeling approach often used is individual based modeling in which the growth of an organism finfish shellfish or seaweed is predicted based on experienced environmental conditions combined with a detailed formulation of physical variables to ensure realism and a mechanistic implementation of individual bioenergetics to ensure generality guyondet et al 2015 lavaud et al 2020 this approach allows for a quantitative assessment of temporal dynamics which is needed to evaluate the benefits of integrated aquaculture barrett et al 2022 in this study we build an ecosystem model to investigate the production potential and spatial variability of kelp and oyster growth in integrated aquaculture settings across the narragansett bay ecosystem rhode island u s existing models for the individual bioenergetics of sugar kelp saccharina latissima and eastern oyster crassostrea virginica were combined with a coupled hydrodynamics water quality model to evaluate the influence of biogeophysical processes on the growth potential of kelp and oysters at existing shellfish leases in narragansett bay specifically we used model simulations to identify optimal geographic locations and harvest timing for kelp farming this ecosystem model provides new estimates of kelp and oyster growth potential that should help inform farmers and local managers in their decision to adopt integrated kelp and oyster aquaculture in rhode island and elsewhere where their growth is feasible 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the ecosystem model presented in this study was developed for narragansett bay nb a 381 km2 estuarine system along the northeast coast of the u s fig 1 a where oyster farming is well developed most of the farming is conducted using on bottom rack and bag systems but this can be variable and include floating bags for this study we only focus on on bottom culture and divide the oyster farm sites in nb into several sub areas that roughly correspond with the local geography and which lie along the dominant north south hydrographic gradient fig 1b from north to south the salinity generally increases from the upper bay through the mid and lower bay sub areas and is highest at the bay entrance sites nutrient concentrations e g nitrate exhibit a reversed gradient with highest values in the upper bay and lowest values in the bay entrance sub area the sakonnet sub area in the easternmost portion of nb is somewhat isolated geographically from the rest of the bay by the narrow entrance at its northern end but is significantly influenced by freshwater discharge from the taunton river the easternmost river entering nb shown in fig 1a hydrographically the sakonnet sub area is like the mid bay sub area the oyster farm sites in the sakonnet sub area are somewhat shallower than elsewhere in the bay 2 2 ecosystem model the ecosystem model is composed of three models a coupled hydrodynamics water quality model osom cosine and two individual bioenergetic dynamic energy budget deb models one for kelp and one for oysters fig 2 the osom cosine model consists of a 3d hydrodynamics module simulating the circulation and hydrography temperature and salinity and a biogeochemical module computing the lower trophic level ecology of nb to provide concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and plankton photosynthetically active radiation par was derived from radiative forcing from the north american regional reanalysis venolia et al 2020 temperature par and nutrient concentrations were used as forcing variables for the kelp model to predict blade growth blade length cm temperature and plankton concentration were used as forcing variables for the oyster model to predict shell and tissue growth shell height cm 2 3 hydrodynamics water quality model the three dimensional hydrodynamics of nb were computed using the ocean state ocean model osom sane et al 2020 which is an application of the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the model domain extends from the upper reaches of nb to the mid shelf off the southern new england coast fig 1a the spatial grid consists of 1000 1100 cells with a curvilinear varying horizontal resolution of approximately 85 m near the head of nb and 475 m at the southern boundary there are 15 terrain following vertical levels other model properties including vertical and horizontal viscosity and diffusivity bottom drag open boundaries forcing and tidal forcing are described in detail by sane et al 2020 the model was forced with spatially and temporally variable winds from the north american mesoscale analyses https www ncei noaa gov data north american mesoscale model access historical analysis surface heat fluxes except for upward longwave radiative flux which was computed from the model surface temperature were assumed to be spatially uniform but still temporally variable net shortwave flux and downward longwave fluxes were obtained from the north american regional reanalysis model http www emc ncep noaa gov mmb rreanl at the grid point located in the ocean just south of the nb mouth meteorological variables needed to compute sensible and latent heat fluxes were obtained from local ports stations http www co ops nos noaa gov and from t f green airport located along upper nb and these fluxes as well as surface momentum fluxes were computed using the coare bulk formulae fairall et al 2003 freshwater volume fluxes into the osom model domain from rivers and wastewater treatment facilities were applied as point sources at the locations shown in fig 1b for most rivers measured fluxes were obtained from united states geological survey usgs gaging stations and these values were adjusted to account for the ungauged drainage area between the gaging stations and the model input locations ullman et al 2019 the discharge of ungauged rivers was estimated from nearby gauged rivers using regression techniques as described in ullman et al 2019 the salinity of inflowing river water was set to zero while the daily water temperature was specified using an empirical regression using air temperature and water temperature from the prior day ullman et al 2019 nutrient concentrations in river water were specified using linear interpolation of observations from the narragansett bay commission and the u s geological survey volume fluxes as well as nutrient concentrations for the discharges from the three main wastewater treatment facilities into nb were obtained from the plant operators the lower trophic level pelagic ecology of nb was simulated using the carbon silicate and nitrogen ecosystem cosine model chai et al 2002 xiu and chai 2011 zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2018 cosine is fully coupled with the realistically forced osom hydrodynamics model the model state variables include four nutrients nitrate ammonium phosphate and silicate two phytoplankton classes small phytoplankton and diatoms two zooplankton classes micro and meso zooplankton two detritus classes nitrogenous and silicious detritus as well as dissolved oxygen total inorganic carbon and total alkalinity details of the model formulations are described in chai et al 2002 and liu et al 2018 nutrient regeneration in the cosine model involves water column processes only because inputs from riverine and wastewater treatment facilities dominate nutrient dynamics in this system nixon et al 1995 benthic regeneration processes can be neglected the sum of the biomasses of small phytoplankton diatoms microzooplankton and nitrogenous detritus mmol n m 3 was used as the food input in the oyster deb model the coupled osom cosine model was run with a time step of 15 s model results were output at 0 5 h intervals and were averaged to the hourly or daily values needed for the kelp or oyster models respectively 2 4 kelp and oyster deb models the individual bioenergetic models used for kelp and oyster are based on dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 although applied to extremely different organisms the deb models for kelp and oyster rely on the same basic principles energy contained in a substrate in the form of dic and nitrate for kelp or the summed food variable described above for oysters is assimilated into reserves one for each substrate reserves are then used to fuel metabolic processes such as maintenance somatic growth development and reproduction all parameters and equations for these models are available in tables s1 and s2 the kelp deb model was developed and calibrated by venolia et al 2020 and the same set of parameters and initial conditions were used the model was run on an hourly time step from 1st november 2017 to 23rd april 2018 i e the winter period which represents a standard growth season for kelp aquaculture in the area at the end of which algae are harvested and new seed lines deployed the next fall the kelp blade growth was modelled for an individual grown 1 m underwater at all selected farm site across nb fig 1 simulations started with a seedling of 50 mg with initial state variables for nitrogen reserve m e n and carbon reserve m e c set at 2 mmol molv 1 i e moles of carbon per mole of structure v and 10 mmol molv 1 respectively par was estimated based on the method described by venolia et al 2020 using the same shortwave radiation forcing as was used for the osom cosine model runs at each location we calculated the expected wet biomass in kgww m 1 that could be harvested on a 1 ha farm using weight outputs from the model in gdw ind 1 a seeding density of 87 ind m 1 mean of 24 samples collected in may 2019 standard deviation 32 table s5 and a dry weight to wet weight ratio of 0 10 mean of 34 samples collected in april 2018 standard deviation 0 03 for a farm equipped with 100 m lines spaced by 1 5 or 6 m as experimented on southern new england farms by yarish et al 2017 the oyster deb model was developed and validated by lavaud et al 2017 the same set of parameters was used except for the functional response to food availability x k which was calibrated for this study based on field growth data from two oyster farms wickford and rome point fig 1b in lower narragansett bay and chlorophyll a concentration measurements obtained from the nearby university of rhode island graduate school of oceanography s long term phytoplankton sampling site station gso phyto in fig 1b near surface and near bottom chlorophyll a at this site was obtained from seawater samples processed for immediate extraction and quantified by fluorometry as described by graff and rynearson 2011 the model was run at the same locations as the kelp model on a daily time step from 1st may 2017 to 31st december 2018 oysters are usually harvested in their second year of growth simulations of oyster shell growth were initiated uniformly across locations with a shell height of 1 cm half of the maximum reserve density e m p a m v and an empty reproduction buffer the osom cosine model outputs for the sum of small phytoplankton diatoms microzooplankton and detritus expressed in mmol n m 3 was transformed into chlorophyll a concentration assuming a conversion coefficient of unity marra et al 1990 dugdale et al 2012 and used as food source in the oyster deb model all parameters and equations for these models are available in tables s3 and s4 2 5 revenue analysis of farm scale operations potential biomass was then converted to a monetary value using an average farm gate price of 1 32 kg 1 or 0 60 lb 1 fresh for farmed seaweed in maine which is the most recent average price available at the time of writing maine department of marine resources 2020 mckinley research group 2021 predicted revenue pr reported in ha 1 was calculated as p r b i o m a s s d e n s i t y l i n e l e n g t h s p a c e p r i c e where b i o m a s s is the deb model derived individual biomass at harvest kgww ind 1 d e n s i t y is the seeding density ind m 1 see 2 3 l i n e l e n g t h is the length of a seeding line 100 m s p a c e is the space between lines 1 5 or 6 m as experimented on southern new england farms by yarish et al 2017 and p r i c e is the average farm gate price market size for oysters is 3 in 7 4 cm and they usually reach this threshold during their second year in connecticut u s however the u s oyster market is generally based on unit prices independent of oyster size since the present model does not represent a population but a generalized individual we did not calculate the value of produced oysters in this study 2 6 ecosystem services kelp uses some elements present in the water such as nitrogen taken up by the algae as no3 no2 or nh4 and carbon dioxide to grow the removal of n and c contributes to the mitigation of nutrient runoff and carbon emissions and as such constitutes ecosystem services that can be quantified through the bioenergetic deb model potential n and c net uptake kg n c ha 1 from kelp was output from the deb model at each location for an average individual and scaled up to a farm setting using the equation u p t a k e w d e n s i t y l i n e l e n g t h s p a c e where w is the mass of total n or c in an individual algal thallus kg ind 1 because the contribution of reserves in c and n to w may vary through time we report the value of n and c net uptake both at the time of harvest i e at the end of the simulation as well as the maximum through time this distinction may indicate that harvest should occur earlier to maximize the nutrient removal service provided by kelp growth 3 results 3 1 osom cosine model outputs the temporal dynamics of environmental variables outputted from the osom cosine model followed a seasonal pattern more pronounced at the sub surface where kelp is grown than near bottom where most oysters grow figs 3 4 near surface temperature reached a minimum in early january before slowly rising again fig 3a near bottom temperatures were also lowest in early january and reached a maximum in early august fig 4a near surface nitrate concentration was highest in early november maximum values within regions ranging between 5 9 and 16 4 µmol n l 1 and lowest in april minimum values 1 µmol n l 1 at all sites with values between 2 and 11 µmol n l 1 also observed in all sites except at the bay entrance in january march fig 3b near bottom oyster food concentration showed high variability with peaks throughout the end of spring and the summer with maximum values up to 12 to 16 µmol n l 1 fig 4b par which is not an output from the model also varied according to the time of the year with minimum average values in december and maximum values at the end of the study period in april fig 3c outputs from osom cosine model were used to force the kelp and oyster models over different time periods for 6 months nov 2017 apr 2018 for kelp and for 20 months may 2017 dec 2018 for oysters to illustrate the spatial variability of forcing variables for each model near surface temperature and nitrate for kelp and near bottom temperature and food concentration for oysters the mean values of the osom cosine output variables were computed over the different model time periods for kelp growing mostly during winter months near surface temperatures were coldest at the shallow sites along the western side of the bay and in the sakonnet river and highest in the deeper areas of the mid and lower bay fig 3d mean near surface nitrate concentrations were highest in the upper bay 7 5 µmol n l 1 and lowest at the bay entrance 2 2 0 1 µmol n l 1 fig 3e during the nearly 2 year oyster period mean near bottom temperatures were highest 15 c in the upper bay and in the shallow areas in the western mid bay and the sakonnet river and lowest in the eastern lower bay and at the bay entrance fig 4c mean near bottom oyster food concentration exhibited a similar north south gradient with higher values in the upper bay and decreasing southward fig 4d 3 2 kelp and oyster growth potential mean predicted kelp blade length at the end of the cultivation period in april varied from 50 1 cm at bay entrance sites to 74 5 cm at the upper bay sites fig 5 a final mean predicted length at the sakonnet sites 62 3 cm was between that of the lower bay 58 1 cm and mid bay sites 73 2 cm overlapping with upper bay site in fig 5a predicted kelp growth slowed greatly in the last month at sites near the entrance of nb while moderate to high growth rates were still simulated in other parts of the bay model predictions of kelp mass ranged from 0 97 kgww m 1 at the easternmost site of bay entrance to 2 03 kgww m 1 at the northernmost site in upper bay or 1 6 tons ha 1 and 3 4 tons ha 1 on 6 m spaced line farms respectively figure 6a 6 5 tons ha 1 and 13 5 tons ha 1 with 1 5 m spaced line farms the averages for the entire bay amount to 1 45 0 05 kgww m 1 or 9 6 0 3 tons ha 1 2 4 0 1 tons ha 1 with 1 5 m spaced line farms mean predicted oyster height at the end of the cultivation period in november varied from 6 5 0 3 cm in sites at the bay entrance to 7 8 0 3 cm in the upper bay sites figs 5b 6 b as for kelp simulations predicted growth of oysters in sakonnet sites 7 4 0 0 cm was between that of oysters growing in lower bay 7 1 0 1 cm and mid bay sites 7 5 0 1 cm figs 5b 6b because this study focuses on the integration of kelp production to existing oyster farms simulations for oysters ended during their second year of growth extrapolation of simulations assuming a repetition of environmental conditions from 2018 in 2019 indicate that all oysters except those at the bay entrance sites easily reach market size in their third year of growth data not shown 3 3 production value potential average minimum of 6 7 0 3 tons ha 1 at bay entrance farms average maximum of 12 1 4 tons ha 1 at upper bay sites table 1 these estimated yields at the bay entrance and in the upper bay would translate to 2222 and 3998 for 6 m spaced line farms and to 8887 and 15 991 for 1 5 m spaced line farms respectively maximum revenue at one site in upper bay was estimated at 17 872 for a 1 5 m spaced line farm while the minimum estimate at the bay entrance was 2138 for a 6 m spaced line farm 3 4 ecosystem services a gradient in n uptake from kelp was predicted by the model from the bay entrance to the upper bay locations with values ranging from 10 0 kg n ha 1 at harvest time in a 6 m spaced line farm from the bay entrance to 1117 332 kg n ha 1 at maximum in a 1 5 m spaced line farm from the upper bay table 2 the difference between values at harvest time and at maximum reflect the decrease in n reserves observed toward the end of simulations fig 7 predicted c uptake from kelp through photosynthesis ranged from 1185 161 kg c ha 1 in a 6 m spaced line farm from the mid bay region to 6184 157 kg c ha 1 in a 1 5 m spaced line farm from the lower bay table 2 4 discussion model simulations indicated that both farmed kelp and oysters should grow well across wide swaths of nb although not as well as some nearby observations and that the timing for harvest is critical for maximized growth predicted kelp blade length ranged between 50 and 74 cm and biomass between 0 97 and 2 03 kgww m 1 over the cultivation season which stands at the lower range of observations of 0 2 to 7 8 kg m 1 table s5 yarish et al 2017 also obtained higher yields in a pilot study in long island sound and southeastern new england 1 6 to 14 8 kg m 1 these authors report however that growth was limited in their rhode island and massachusetts sites at the time of harvest in our study apical frond loss can become common in nb which has been correlated with temperature stress and wave action krumhansl et al 2014 mechanical stress of biofouling brown et al 1997 and overall blade length sjotun 1993 additionally the limit on growth could be a result of a reduction in n reserves toward the end of the season see figure s4a in link with a decrease in n concentration in the water fig 3b indicating an n shortage for growth while increases in light flux and temperature in the spring favor c assimilation in kelps the basic somatic maintenance costs are also expected to increase figure s4b but with a limited supply of n the growth rate of algae starts to decrease another factor potentially affecting our kelp growth estimates is competition with microalgae in upper bay sites as the coupling of the roms cosine model to the kelp and oyster deb models was operated offline no feedback interaction from kelps or oysters on the 3d model occurred the filtration activity of oysters feeding on phytoplankton and the competition for light and nutrients between macro and microalgae could positively influence the actual availability of essential substrates for kelp growth the lower kelp biomass predicted by the model compared to available data could also be due to the average seeding density of 87 ind m 1 used in our calculations which is lower than values reported in a case study in norway by forbord et al 2020 it is very likely that not all seeded kelp develops into fully grown thalli especially at high densities yarish et al 2017 reported farm scale biomass production values of 1 0 tons ha 1 on 6 m spaced line farms and 4 4 tons ha 1 on 1 5 m spaced line farms which is within our estimates that ranged between 1 7 0 1 and 12 1 4 tons ha 1 note that the different line spacing scenarios used in our simulations represent a simple scale up of individual dynamics and not different model runs moreover the depth at which the growing lines are set is another factor that can impact kelp harvest biomass through light availability we assumed that algae were grown at a depth of 1 m at all growing sites like forbord et al 2020 who used depth of 1 to 2 m while yarish et al 2017 did not specify this information as for many organisms inter individual variability in physiological traits can be important and accounting for this pattern could lead to more accurate predictions and remove the need for rule of thumb estimates koch and de schamphelaere 2020 we started simulations with uniform oyster height across stations sites 1 cm which does not account for the environmental history that individual oysters would have experienced while growing at these different locations since their deployment usually around 3 4 mm this starting size was based on data collected for the calibration of the half saturation coefficient figure s3 but more variation should be expected additionally different oyster culture practices e g line raft would also likely influence growth compared to traditional on bottom culture modeled in this study with possible impacts on light availability and nutrient circulation and availability for kelp strohmeier et al 2005 the highest growth rates for farmed kelp and oysters were predicted in the upper bay sites where both organisms benefited from higher concentrations of nitrate and near bottom concentrations of phytoplankton respectively the elevated nitrate concentration predicted in this area which is consistent with observations e g oviatt et al 2017 is due to the location of three large wastewater treatment facilities and two of the largest tributary rivers at the northern end of the bay fig 1 freshwater runoff could however pose a limit to growth because sugar kelps prefer high salinity waters particularly at lower latitudes monteiro et al 2021 salinity is not currently included in the kelp deb model but could be added as a forcing variable as has been done for other organisms living in environments subjected to high salinity variations lavaud et al 2017 oyster farms located at the bay entrance appear to be the least suited for kelp cultivation as suggested by the smaller simulated blade lengths fig 5a lower phytoplankton concentration in more open waters has been used to explain reduced growth rates in bivalves in studies on offshore aquaculture palmer et al 2021 farms located further south of nb would also involve higher operation costs due to the distance to site and the exposure to wave action potentially involving heavier gear to secure lines with production potential yielding about half of the value expected at upper bay locations table 2 the development of kelp aquaculture at the entrance of nb might be limited according to model outputs although kelp has been successfully grown along southern new england shorelines including connecticut and massachusetts kim et al 2019 heidkamp et al 2022 one factor that may compensate lower growth is the density of farm lines which previous studies suggested could provide high yield in tightly spaced 1 5 m lines yarish et al 2017 umanzor et al 2021 however most experimental studies conducted on existing farms generally adopt wider separation about 5 6 m between lines e g tabassum et al 2017 grebe et al 2021 and feedback from farmers is needed to evaluate the practicality of working and maintaining such a design in a more exposed environment such as the nb entrance our ecosystem model demonstrates significant quantities of n are removed from the system via kelp growth table 2 however the bio extraction capacity estimated between 10 and 1117 kg n ha 1 showed high variability depending on the location in nb and line spacing the estimated range encompasses values of 19 to 176 kg n ha 1 calculated by grebe et al 2021 in a recent study on kelp aquaculture potential in maine and those of 10 to 139 kg n ha 1 obtained by kim et al 2015 as for biomass production which n uptake is directly linked to various assumptions regarding farm characteristics may explain the higher range of n removed by kelp in our study including line spacing initial seeding density duration of growing season and harvest date as shown in table 2 maximum blade length does not necessarily mean maximum n removal through harvest as n availability tends to decrease later in the growing season with more uptake from both macro and micro algae due to higher biomass and a reduction in runoff the predicted drop in n content in kelp tissue at the end of the simulated period may be surprising considering the capacity of sugar kelp to store nitrogen stekoll et al 2021 however other studies also showed reductions in n content in kelp tissues particularly at the end of the growth season kim et al 2015 stekoll et al 2021 more data on the temporal dynamics of n in kelp tissue could be used to refine model parameters related to the mobilization of n reserves and the needs for structural n maintenance the development of macroalgae cultivation is also seen as a mitigation tool for c emissions from land based activities doumeizel et al 2020 park et al 2021 although these impacts are limited when macroalgae are harvested vs buried in the deep ocean dolliver and o connor 2022 similarly it should be possible to evaluate the c removal potential from oysters through biocalcification this can be achieved within the deb framework as bio calcified products can be computed as a weighted sum of mineral fluxes resulting from metabolic processes see pecquerie et al 2012 or galli et al 2016 for examples of biocalcification in deb the current model for s latissima still requires upgrades to account for dark respiration and produce net estimates of c uptake venolia et al 2020 but the structure of the model could be transferred to any macroalgal or microalgal species with the offline coupling of the hydrodynamic model to bioenergetic models for kelp and oysters the present work constitutes a first step in evaluating the production potential for integrated aquaculture in nb further developments including the budgeting of nutrients within the system would allow the quantification of n fluxes using the current modeling approach such an analysis based on individual deb models was recently undertaken in eastern canada to evaluate the relationship between opportunistic macroalgae growth mussel aquaculture and natural bivalve species lavaud et al 2021 and could be applied in future studies in nb as kelp competes for nutrients with phytoplankton which constitute the main food source of oysters the indirect effect of kelp on oysters could be assessed to maximize production efficiency nevertheless such impacts are likely minimal because 1 optimal growth periods for kelp and phytoplankton are temporally decoupled until mid late spring and 2 the scale of kelp deployment in existing farms is relatively small compared to the rest of the bay our model could also be used in forecasting mode to mechanistically predict the system production potential based on future climate predictions jiang et al 2022 our ecosystem model simulations provide estimates of the growth potential for kelp at existing eastern oyster farms across nb results demonstrate there are potentially significant ecological and economic benefits of such operations these predictions offer a promising outlook and should help producers and managers in their decision making process for this relatively new industry in the u s following assumptions from yarish et al 2017 who conducted an analysis of the kelp production industry in northeastern u s we showed that kelp farming in nb would generate economically sustainable yields in the upper and middle sections of the bay combined with existing oyster farming operations several operational costs would likely be reduced due to similar technologies being used gear and operation tools like boats mooring processing facilities would be used for both species varying yields due to forcing parameters controlling kelp growth n load temperature par would likely have an impact on handling time at harvest and during processing which is hard to quantify at this stage without additional work on economic and environmental condition scenarios we have described how the time of harvest impacted the bio extraction capacity of n from the system the timing of harvest would also have important economic effects because as the season progresses and seawater warms up apical frond loss increases sjøtun 1993 krumhansl et al 2014 using real time monitoring of environmental conditions at a particular site would allow precise determination of when harvest should occur this capacity and the availability of data has been greatly increased in recent years with the deployment of monitoring stations through federal or state programs finally the farming of another product grown on the same aquaculture lease can constitute a means of diversification with the added benefit of decoupled growth through time oysters primarily grow during summer months while kelp grows and is farmed only during winter months the present study provides quantitative estimates of the potential for integrated kelp and oyster aquaculture that will be useful for the development of this type of industry credit authorship contribution statement romain lavaud conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original

24208,the aim of this study is to develop a geospatial model for the assessment and mapping of carbon stock cs of date palms dp in abu dhabi at three age stages mature medium and young the approach relied on the use of correlated remote sensing predictors tested and derived from landsat 8 imagery over the study period to estimate cs multiple predictors including single bands vegetation indices vis and their combination were used in linear and non linear regression models to identify the best performing predictors and regression models for dp mature dp older than 10 years attained the most significant correlation when using a second order polynomial model with the tasseled cap for wetness as a predictor yielding r² of 0 7643 for non mature dp less than 10 years the exponential regression model using renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi as a predictor provided the most significant correlation for agb estimation with r2 of 0 4987 the study demonstrated that moderate resolution landsat 8 oli imagery has the potential to estimate the cs in dp of drylands at different age stages this is the first attempt to estimate cs in dp using geospatial technologies with minimal fieldwork hence expanding our approach to other remote and less studied drylands keywords climate change landsat remote sensing predictors spatial modeller stepwise multiple regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation in arid lands provides important ecosystem services contributing substantially to the global carbon cycle lal 2004 furthermore biomass constitutes a fundamental parameter that describes vegetation composition and purpose li et al 2019 for instance it contains the bulk of carbon sequestered terrestrially through the process of capturing and storing co2 in the stems roots and soil estimating biomass plays a vital role in determining the storage balance and cycling of carbon locally as well as globally a large number of studies describing various approaches for estimating biomass and carbon in forests and plantations have been published dahy et al 2020 issa et al 2020a araujo et al 2023 however regardless of their high sensitivity to climate alteration and the major role they play in their societies arid lands have received little attention in these studies compared to other ecosystem regions such as humid and tropical regions above ground biomass agb represents the biggest component of the total living biomass in the vegetation cover and does not present major logistical problems in the field work making its estimating easier ipcc 2007 agb estimation has received considerable attention because of its role in carbon cycle processes combined with the increased awareness of climate change furthermore agb can be used to estimate biomass amount stored in the root system below ground biomass generally around 20 of agb mokany et al 2006 it can also be used to predict dead wood litter biomass generally estimated at 10 20 of agb houghton et al 2009 three main approaches are used to estimate and predict forest agb process based models field measurements and remotely sensed data combined with forest inventory safari et al 2017 the field measurement methods are the most accurate however their lack of spatial and temporal coverage make them labor intensive and impractical for extended areas and time periods h nguyen et al 2020 the remote sensing based methods have been used in the last decades through modeling of forest parameters based on measured spectral variables dahy et al 2020 2019 issa et al 2020a chang et al 2023 several vegetation parameters can be predicted from the reflected remote sensing region including vis e g normalized difference vegetation index enhanced vegetation index etc leaf area index absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar and different image transformations duarte et al 2018 habib and al ghamdi 2021 images acquired by multispectral sensors are used to derive spectral information that can be correlated with forest inventory agb data kumar et al 2015 abbas et al 2020 commonly used variables include spectral bands vis image transformations and texture images kelsey and neff 2014 zhu and liu 2015 the landsat program was the first to provide scientists worldwide with a long record of space based consistent data of the land surface at moderate spatial resolution free of charge the landsat data time series 1972 present has provided ecosystem monitoring systems with two important elements the spatial and temporal coverages that lacked in the field measurement approach it is worth noting that the spatial dimension of this dataset allows the detection and assessing of both environmental and human effects in the study area while its temporal dimension enables historical change analysis over more than four decades the free data policy introduced by the landsat program in 2008 has revolutionized forest studies and monitoring in general and for estimating agb specifically particularly important to our research is the process of estimating the amount of carbon stock in date palms dp believed to have substantial capability of sequestering terrestrial carbon in both vegetation and soil compartments betemariyam and kefalew 2022 dp phoenix dactylifera l major crop in arid lands are resilient productive and have multiuse benefits jaradat and zaid 2004 particularly in the united arab emirates uae dp have been a vital component of the agricultural system the records show that the number of dp in the world exceed 120 million distributed across 30 different countries faostat 2013 they produce about 7 5 million tons of dates annually 70 of which come from middle east and north africa region mena uae alone contributes to more than 50 of mena date production the topic of this study was carefully chosen for many reasons not the least are the abundance of dp in the study area which has numerous socioeconomic benefits making it a valuable resource to the local population use of geospatial technologies to estimate and model cs in dp for the first time in the region apply and use the outcomes of the study as a quick and reliable input in support of a long term strategy for land resources management which is especially important given the uae government s significant investment in greening the country finally the cs by these dp was a plus not planned for when deciding to green the country half a century ago the main objective of the current study is to build a rs based biomass model to predict and map cs distribution in dp of the arid lands of abu dhabi uae at three age stages mature medium and young dp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the whole emirate of abu dhabi the largest of the seven emirates composing uae it is bounded by 22 55 to 24 48 n and 51 30 e to 56 00 e and extends over a land area of 67 340 km2 sand dunes make up about 2 3 of the study area with nearly 5 million hectares fig 1 the emirate which hosts the capital city of abu dhabi has undergone extensive land conversions supported and subsidized by substantial oil revenues to become an urbanized modern state besides local authorities have extensively engaged in large greening projects to the extent that by the end of 2017 more than 540 afforested areas covering an estimated surface of 242 000 ha and mainly planted with dp have been realized issa et al 2019 the geographic and environmental settings of the study area are summarized in table 1 2 2 methods the flowchart of the methodology used to develop and validate the rs based biomass model is presented in fig 2 it shows the main components of the model 1 identification of rs predictors that can be used to estimate agb 2 selection of sample plots representing different age classes of dp mature medium and young 3 collection of field data necessary to estimate agb using the dp specific biomass allometric equations 4 building the rs based biomass estimation model using various regression methods and validating it by using different statistical metrics and 5 producing a map showing cs distribution throughout the emirate by creating the agb distribution map first then converting it into cs distribution map our model was developed and implemented using erdas imagine 2020 and arcgis 10 7 software packages 2 2 1 field data collection dp plantations in the study area were classified according to their age into three classes mature date palm mdp more than 10 years medium date palm medp 5 10 years and young date palm ydp less than 5 years two extensive field visits were conducted at the end of summer and during winter of 2018 targeting farms with different age stages plantations to collect data from sample units representing the three dp age stages the first visit took place from 10th to 18th september and the second from 14th to 6th december in all 54 plots of dp plantations were selected using a randomized probability sampling design stratified random design according to their age stage mdp medp and ydp the plot survey included 17 representing mdp 19 representing medp and 18 representing ydp the dimension of the plots were 40 m 40 m to ensure that one landsat 30 30 meter pixel fell within each plot fig 3 issa et al 2019 the coordinates of the plot s center and the number of dp in each of the 54 plots were recorded the mean values of these variables single bands and vis for all plots were calculated using a 3 3 window centered over each plot and consequently used in the model development 3 3 window was used to reduce the uncertainties in rs data resulting from plot positioning errors that could be created because of the mismatching of sample plots with the image pixels introduced when the x and y coordinates of sample plots were located using gps fig 3 trunk height ht and crown diameter cd for each palm were measured and subsequently used to calculate its crown area ca assuming a spherical palm crown ca π cd2 4 it is worth mentioning that we initially selected 83 field plots for surveying but had to exclude 29 of them leaving 54 only the reasons for exclusion were 1 sparse distribution of dp per plot 20 palm per plot 2 suffering of dp from abiotic stresses e g drought direct observation in the field or and through discussion with the farmers as some dp were deliberately not irrigated to get rid of them and 3 the large level of heterogeneity not representing accurately the age stage class mature medium and young 2 2 2 field estimation of agb and its carbon content the agb at the plot level was estimated by using dp biomass allometric equations previously developed specifically for dp of abu dhabi under arid land ecosystem conditions issa et al 2018 issa et al 2020b agb for each dp was first estimated by adding crown biomass cb and trunk biomass tb using the equations presented in table 2 agb at the plot level was then predicted by summing the agb for all palms in the plot and converting the results to biomass density in tons per hectare t ha 1 where cb is crown biomass tb is trunk biomass agb cb tb is the above ground biomass ca is crown area m2 ht is trunk height r2 is coefficient of determination 2 2 3 identifying rs variables predictors atmospherically corrected level 2 landsat 8 oli scenes were used to build the rs based model the data which comprised different types of dp plantations were geo registered to the utm coordinate system zone 40 wgs 84 seven bands were selected stacked and stored using erdas software package table 3 a combination of individual reflective bands and vis were used as remote sensing predictors to estimate agb both reflective bands listed in table 3 and modified vis listed in table 4 were tested where sr is the simple ratio rvi is the ratio vegetation index dvi is the difference vegetation index ndgi is the normalized difference greenness index ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index tvi is the transformed vegetation index gndvi is the green normalized difference vegetation index rdvi is the renormalized difference vegetation index savi is the soil adjusted vegetation index msavi is the modified soil adjusted vegetation index tcg is the tasseled cap transformation index for greenness tcb for brightness and tcw for wetness 2 2 4 building the rs based model for agb estimation different regression types linear and non linear were considered to evaluate the relationships between rs predictors and agb values for each plot predicted from ground measurements and allometric equations table 2 linear regression model was first tested and their performance assessed based on their coefficients of determination r2 and significance p value 0 05 a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis involving several single bands and vis was subsequently applied to achieve improved correlation 2 2 5 model evaluation the agb estimation model was assessed using cross validation for each plot root mean square error rmse rmse and the systematic prediction error sper s were estimated in percentage after randomly splitting the plot measurements dataset into a calibration dataset 80 and a validation dataset 20 the rmse rmse and sper were estimated using the eqs 1 2 and 3 1 rmse y i y i 2 n 2 rmse 100 rmse y 3 sper y i y where ŷ i is the predicted aĝb of the ith plot y i is the observed agb of the ith plot y i is the mean of predicted aĝb and y is the mean observed agb 2 2 6 applying the rs based biomass model to estimate agb of dp at different age stages maps of dp plantations created in a previously published study dahy et al 2021 were used in the model to delineate the location of dp at different age stages the reported accuracy of these maps was significantly high with overall classification accuracy of 94 5 and a kappa coefficient of 0 888 they showed that dp plantations covered an area of about 7588 04 hectares 22 69 for ydp 22 04 for medp and 55 27 for mdp subsets of landsat 8 oli images table 3 corresponding to dp plantations as defined in the dp maps were extracted using erdas imagine and used as input to the rs based biomass model the spatial model that estimates the amount of agb t ha 1 for each landsat pixel was implemented and run in the spatial model editor within erdas imagine fig 5 to estimate and create an agb map of the study area the produced map was subsequently used as input to estimate the density of above ground carbon aĝc for each pixel according to eq 4 based on a previously published carbon content to agb ratio of 53 87 issa et al 2020b 4 aĝc t ha 1 0 5387 aĝb t ha 1 to estimate agb and agc content in ton aĝb and aĝc density values t ha 1 produced by the model for each pixel were multiplied by the pixel size using the attribute table function in erdas imagine aĝb in ton was subsequently used to estimate the other carbon components involving biomass as described in section 2 2 7 2 2 7 cs estimation from the five components of the dp the total amount of cs was estimated as the sum of the carbon content of each of the following five biomass components agb below ground biomass bgb litter woody debris and soil organic matter som eggleston et al 2006 bgb litter and debris were predicted from the estimated agb value sections 2 2 7 1 and 2 2 7 2 the soil organic carbon soc was deduced from the som amount which was estimated as 91 38 section 2 2 7 3 2 2 7 1 below ground biomass bgb bgb is generally estimated at 20 of the agb in several published studies cairns et al 1997 koala et al 2017 mokany et al 2006 niether et al 2019 however we found different ratios among different dp age stages with averages of 0 332 0 925 and 0 496 for ydp medp and mdp respectively issa et al 2020b therefore the following eqs 5 6 and 7 were developed to estimate bgb of dp 5 bĝbmdp t aĝb t 0 496 6 bĝbmedp t aĝb t 0 925 7 bĝbydp t aĝb t 0 332 on the other hand the percentage of carbon content in the root system of dp bgb was found to be 51 27 issa et al 2020b which is slightly lower than the carbon content in the agb therefore below ground carbon bĝc was estimated in tons by multiplying the resulting values from eqs 5 6 or 7 by a factor of 0 5127 eq 8 8 bĝc t 0 5127 bĝb t 2 2 7 2 litters and woody debris carbon content of dead wood or litter and woody debris were assumed to be between 10 and 20 of the agb gibbs et al 2007 houghton et al 2009 issa et al 2020a the borders between dead biomass and litter and between dead biomass and som are rather subjective houghton et al 2009 based on extensive field visits to dp farms at different age stages it was observed that litter and debris ratio to agb of dp varied depending on the palm age stage the more the palm matures the more it produces litter and debris the researchers adopted the following percentages to be applied to predict litter and debris in ton from aĝb in ton for dp plantations 10 for ydp 15 for medp and 20 for mdp 2 2 7 3 soil organic carbon soc the dps contribute about 22 26 tons of soc per hectare in plantations issa et al 2020b this number was calculated by performing the combustion method for 4 h at 550 c on soil samples taken at top soil 10 cm from underneath the dp canopy and then deriving of the som and the soc furthermore the soc in ton of dp for the three age stages were calculated as per eq 9 9 soc area 22 26 t ha 1 where the total areas of mdp medp and ydp in the study area were estimated to be 4193 86 ha 1672 14 ha and 1722 05 ha respectively dahy et al 2021 finally erdas spatial modeling tools were used to produce the agb map for the whole study area utilizing the selected model built from the rs variables as estimated by the results of our analyses agc map fig 6 was then created by multiplying the estimated agb by 0 5387 as per the eq 4 section 2 2 6 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics of the assessed field variables structural variables of 2063 palms included in the 54 plots were measured in the field statistics about these measurements including the number of dp for each age stage class average ca ht and densities of dp per hectare are summarized in table 5 the average palm ca in meter and its standard error se of the mdp medp and ydp plots were 36 1 64 22 51 1 22 and 6 65 0 67 m2 respectively the average palm ht s of the mdp medp and ydp plots were 2 89 0 22 1 07 0 08 and 0 15 0 03 m respectively it is obvious that the increase in dp age results in an increase in ca and ht the averages of dp number per plot of mdp medp and ydp were 41 38 and 35 respectively which based on a plot area of 1600 m2 amounts to around 258 238 and 221 palm ha 1 respectively where mdp is mature date palm medp is medium date palm and ydp is young date palm the numbers in the parenthesis represent the minimum and maximum values 3 2 agb estimating of field data and the estimation of its carbon content aĝb was estimated from the field measurement in all 54 plots table 6 shows the average and range of aĝb in t ha 1 for dp at the three age stages the largest ĉb was found in mdp plots while the lowest ĉb was found in ydp plots these outcomes were affected by the average ca of the plots table 5 similarly t b was affected by the ht average table 5 the averages of aĝb in tons per hectare se of mdp medp and ydp were estimated at 59 39 7 8 23 33 2 5 and 6 15 0 5 t ha 1 respectively the agc in t ha 1 was estimated by multiplying the average aĝb in tons per hectare by 0 5387 see eq 4 therefore the averages aĝc se for mdp medp and ydp plots were estimated at 31 99 4 2 12 57 1 4 and 3 31 0 3 t ha 1 where mdp is mature date palm medp is medium date palm ydp is young date palm and aĝb is the estimated above ground biomass the numbers in the parenthesis represent the minimum and maximum values 3 3 model development and rs variables importance as the dp age has an important role in their biomass table 6 the regression analysis linking the field variables with the rs predictors was conducted according to the dp age stages defined earlier 3 3 1 date palm mature in mdp plots 17 plots the linear correlation between agb and single bands was only significant for swir bands at the same time it was significant for all tested vis except tcb and tcg the highest correlation was for swir1 and swir2 bands with r2 values of 0 302 and 0 290 respectively while for vis ndgi and sr showed the highest correlation with r2 values of 0 609 and 0 545 respectively on the other hand tcw showed the strongest correlation to agb using a second order polynomial model additionally stepwise multiple regression analysis on agb of the mdp revealed that a grouping of single bands or of vis did not improve the r2 therefore the second order polynomial model that uses only tcw as rs predictor was found to be the strongest model to estimate the biomass of mdp with r² equal 0 7643 and p value equal of 0 007 eq 10 and fig 4 10 agbmdp t ha 1 0 00006 x tcw 2 0 1212 x tcw 96 708 3 3 2 date palm non mature it was found that r2 could be improved by considering medium and young dp as one age class the non mature class non mdp section 2 2 running the regression analysis for non mdp 37 plots the combination of medp and ydp resulted in a stronger correlation between agb and rs predictors all of landsat 8 oli single bands with the exception of b g and nir and all the vis except ngvi exhibited significant correlation with agb the stepwise regression analysis on agb of the non mdp revealed that a grouping of single bands or vis did not improve the r2 the exponential regression model using rdvi yielded the strongest correlation with an r2 value of 0 4987 and p value equals 0 00002 eq 11 and fig 4 11 agbnon mdp t ha 1 0 8257 x e0 1469 rdvi 3 4 model validation field measurements and the statistical accuracy assessment were used to validate the developed agb model the accuracy statistics included rmse rmse and sper as detailed in section 2 2 5 table 7 summarizes the selected regression models for the estimation of the agb from landsat 8 oli single bands and vis 3 5 creation of the agb map of dp and estimation of total cs in the study area the final agb map was created using the regression models shown in table 7 the two sub models that use twc for mdp and rdvi for non mdp are depicted in fig 5 the map of agc shown in fig 6 is predicted from agb map using eq 4 table 8 summarizes the results of the cs analysis we found that the overall cs by dp plantations in abu dhabi was 2447 856 87 tons 4 discussion the main purpose of the current study is to build a geospatial model for the estimation of carbon stock cs of date palms dp and mapping its geographical distribution in the emirate of abu dhabi uae at three age stages mature medium and young it is worth noting that parts of our findings have already been published however the novelty in the current study is reflected in many aspects including the scope and objectives the sample sizes the datasets used the model built and the results and visualization indeed the current study has been extended to cover the whole emirate involving larger sample sizes and comprising most cultivars of uae s date palms the integration between the finer resolution wv 2 scenes which served at depicting and mapping all dp plantations at different age stages dahy et al 2021 with landsat level 2 dataset to identify and measure more accurate rs predictors allowed to build our final improved model another novelty of the current research is that the generally adopted ratio of bgb estimated at 20 of the agb in several published studies cairns et al 1997 koala et al 2017 mokany et al 2006 niether et al 2019 was not valid for our model instead our results showed different ratios among different dp age stages with averages of 0 332 0 925 and 0 496 for ydp medp and mdp respectively issa et al 2020b therefore eqs 5 6 and 7 were developed and implemented to estimate bgb of dp instead on the other hand the percentage of carbon content in the root system of dp bgb was found to be 51 27 issa et al 2020b which is slightly lower than the carbon content in the agb therefore below ground carbon bĝc was estimated in tons by multiplying the resulting values from eqs 5 6 or 7 by a factor of 0 5127 eq 8 furthermore carbon content of dead wood or litter and woody debris are usually assumed to be between 10 and 20 of the agb gibbs et al 2007 houghton et al 2009 issa et al 2020a however based on extensive field visits to dp farms at different age stages it was observed that litter and debris ratio to agb of dp varied depending on the palm age stage the more the palm matures the more it produces litter and debris the researchers adopted the following percentages to be applied to predict litter and debris in ton from aĝb in ton for dp plantations 10 for ydp 15 for medp and 20 for mdp three models were initially built to estimate agb for the three age stages mature medium and young however the large contribution of background reflectance in the study area reduced the accuracy of separating the young and medium dp this in turn weakened the statistical relationship between agb of medium and young dp with rs variables derived from landsat 8 oli subsequently young and medium dp classes were merged to form one non mature dp non mdp class substantially improving the statistical relationship between agb and rs variables therefore we opted for the creation of two sub models only one for non mdp and another for mdp our study showed that when using single band to predict agb the swir bands of landsat oli produced the highest and most significant correlation for both mdp and non mdp plantations these results were in line with findings from a previous study in tajikistan where the authors found that swir1 2 of landsat 8 were convenient in detecting arid land s vegetation zandler et al 2015 while our work on agb of the mdp showed that a grouping of single bands or vis does not improve the r2 it was noticed that vis provided better predictors of agb than single bands our results were also consistent with other studies that used landsat imagery to estimate biomass in different regions such as the study reported in günlü et al 2014 the decision of selecting the effectively performing vis is function of the type of ecosystem environmental conditions and spectral characteristics of the sensor spectral band saturation for instance is a well recognized problem and can affect vi performance and lead to inaccurate estimation of agb zhao et al 2016 however this was not a major factor in our study region observed structural differences in dp plantations influenced the calculation of agb indeed varied palms spacing were found in some plots while sparse distribution of dp with no regular spacing caused by human interferences were found in others it was also noted that regardless of the dp age other factors affected date palm s ca and ht and consequently the palm s capacity to accumulate biomass and sequester carbon cultivar and land management practices are examples of such factors the largest average of dp density was found on mdp plots in two cases of mdp plots the number of dp reached 88 and 96 palms per plot which corresponds to around 550 and 600 palm ha 1 respectively this could be attributed to the old farming systems where mdp were planted irregularly in the farm with short spacing among palms to benefit from the traditional irrigation systems e g aflaj irrigation systems nowadays the palms are distributed in a more organized manner with wider spacing among them 7 m 7 m 8 m 8 m and 9 m 9 m leading to lower densities allowing agricultural tractors and machinery to navigate more easily it is noticeable that an overlap between the crown area ranges of mdp and medp is found in some cases this is due to regular pruning of dp fronds practiced in new plantations the pruning process aims to keep a specific number of fronds in the palm allowing more carbohydrates to go to the fruits dates than the fronds it is rare to find ht of dp taller than 5 m in modern dp farms as the farmers tend to remove tall palms reaching certain height as they are more difficult to maintain and manage however during field measurement the researchers observed some dp that exceeded 5 m and some were extremely tall with very high ht reached up to 15 2 m especially in the oases in contrast it was found that most ydp had ht equal to zero and some of them had ca equal 0 07 m2 since their fronds were attached by cord with no trunk these structural variations impacted the performance of spectral bands and vis as predictors affected the estimation of agb and influenced the choice of estimation model the approach implemented aimed at selecting the most appropriate regression model among the tested models to estimate agb of dp at multiple age stages it considered the use of linear and non linear regression models with multiple single band single vis and stepwise multivariate regression to estimate the most appropriate model from the tested models based on correlation significance and rmse the model that provided the best estimate of agb in the case of mdp consisted in the use of a second order polynomial where tcw served as the only rs predictor this model yielded the strongest correlation and significance with r² equal to 0 7643 and a p value equal to 0 007 with rmse of 6 322 tha 1 for non mdp an exponential model that uses rdvi as rs predictor provided the strongest estimate of biomass with r² equal to 0 4987 and p value equal to 0 00002 while the model validation showed rmse of 8 040 tha 1 these results were consistent with published literature for other species and study areas where landsat 8 was used for mapping and predicting agb in woodlands karlson et al 2015 the dp age stage class derived from the wv 2 data was processed to select the proper model from the tested models to use when estimating agb the resulting map was an emirate wide map of agb that was subsequently used to predict cs this step highlights the strength and uniqueness of our approach where rs based model once calibrated enabled the creation of cs maps from remote sensing data without the need for additional field measurements the accurate total carbon stock estimation of dp plantations in abu dhabi depends on the accurate estimation of its biomass specifically agb that is predicted by using biomass allometric equations therefore one source of uncertainty could come from the equations themselves to overcome this issue the authors used published allometric equations developed from represented field samples of dp considering the different varieties as well as the three different age stages in the study area the other source of uncertainty for the estimation of the biomass of dp hence their carbon stock could come from rs models that were built during the current study the authors identified and selected a number of plot samples representing homogenous dp plantations with strict criteria excluding the plots that have a sparse distribution of dp plot stressed dp large level of heterogeneity and not representing the age stage class see section 2 2 1 the plot design with 40 m 40 m dimension ensured that the area on the ground occupied at least one full pixel of landsat 8 oli image with a 30 m pixel resolution issa et al 2019 landsat 8 oli spectral variables mean values for all the plots were extracted for a 3 3 window centered over each plot to reduce the uncertainties in rs data resulting from plot positioning errors that could be created because of the mismatching of sample plots with the image pixels introduced when the x and y coordinates of sample plots were located using gps d lu et al 2002 the rs models for estimating dp biomass were estimated from level 2 product of landsat to identify and measure more accurate rs predictors however landsat with moderate spatial resolution was not able to differentiate and map dp at all age stages therefore we used accurate maps of dp at all age stages derived from fine resolution wv 2 scenes as input to our final biomass models dahy et al 2021 hence we succeeded in predicting and visualizing the amounts of cs in all dp plantations in the whole study area 5 conclusion recommendations a geospatial model of carbon stock assessment of date palm at different age stages was developed allometric equations previously developed and published by the authors were utilized to design calibrate and implement the model to predict the amounts of agb and agc in dp different types of regression analysis single and multiple were tested to create relationships linking the agb to rs predictors using an expanded number of 54 field plots showed that tcw has the most significant correlation estimated using a second order polynomial model to estimate the biomass of mdp with r² equal to 0 7643 and p value equal to 0 007 on the other hand the exponential regression model that used rdvi as rs predictor provided the strongest correlation with agb of non mdp with an r2 value of 0 4987 and a p value of 0 00002 the development of a remote sensing based biomass and carbon estimation model enabled the prediction and visualization of cs over extended areas with minimum fieldwork using previously produced dp age classification maps the rs based model was applied to landsat 8 imagery to map and predict the cs of dp in abu dhabi the total cs in dp plantations was estimated as the sum of the estimated cs in the five components agb bgb litter debris and soc the overall cs by dp plantations in abu dhabi predicted from this map amounted to 2447 856 87 tons the main limitation is related to the use of moderate spatial resolution rs product to estimate the biomass and cs amounts landsat with moderate spatial resolution was not able to accurately differentiate and map dp at all age stages therefore we used accurate maps of dp at all age stages derived from fine resolution wv 2 scenes as input to our final biomass models consequently a weak statistical relationship between agb of medium and young dp with rs variables derived from landsat 8 oli was observed subsequently young and medium dp classes were merged to form one non mature dp non mdp class to overcome this challenge one suggested solution is to use finer spatial resolution of satellite imagery for the building the dp biomass model finally our applied methods used in this project can be generalized to other areas in the gulf region with minimal cost it can also be modified to use other publicly available moderate resolution imagery such as sentinel 2 rs based biomass estimating model for dp were built for a quick and reliable method for the creation and visualization of a standard dp cs map for the emirate of abu dhabi thus it can be further employed to boost the decision taking process on durable and sustainable management of cs

24208,the aim of this study is to develop a geospatial model for the assessment and mapping of carbon stock cs of date palms dp in abu dhabi at three age stages mature medium and young the approach relied on the use of correlated remote sensing predictors tested and derived from landsat 8 imagery over the study period to estimate cs multiple predictors including single bands vegetation indices vis and their combination were used in linear and non linear regression models to identify the best performing predictors and regression models for dp mature dp older than 10 years attained the most significant correlation when using a second order polynomial model with the tasseled cap for wetness as a predictor yielding r² of 0 7643 for non mature dp less than 10 years the exponential regression model using renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi as a predictor provided the most significant correlation for agb estimation with r2 of 0 4987 the study demonstrated that moderate resolution landsat 8 oli imagery has the potential to estimate the cs in dp of drylands at different age stages this is the first attempt to estimate cs in dp using geospatial technologies with minimal fieldwork hence expanding our approach to other remote and less studied drylands keywords climate change landsat remote sensing predictors spatial modeller stepwise multiple regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation in arid lands provides important ecosystem services contributing substantially to the global carbon cycle lal 2004 furthermore biomass constitutes a fundamental parameter that describes vegetation composition and purpose li et al 2019 for instance it contains the bulk of carbon sequestered terrestrially through the process of capturing and storing co2 in the stems roots and soil estimating biomass plays a vital role in determining the storage balance and cycling of carbon locally as well as globally a large number of studies describing various approaches for estimating biomass and carbon in forests and plantations have been published dahy et al 2020 issa et al 2020a araujo et al 2023 however regardless of their high sensitivity to climate alteration and the major role they play in their societies arid lands have received little attention in these studies compared to other ecosystem regions such as humid and tropical regions above ground biomass agb represents the biggest component of the total living biomass in the vegetation cover and does not present major logistical problems in the field work making its estimating easier ipcc 2007 agb estimation has received considerable attention because of its role in carbon cycle processes combined with the increased awareness of climate change furthermore agb can be used to estimate biomass amount stored in the root system below ground biomass generally around 20 of agb mokany et al 2006 it can also be used to predict dead wood litter biomass generally estimated at 10 20 of agb houghton et al 2009 three main approaches are used to estimate and predict forest agb process based models field measurements and remotely sensed data combined with forest inventory safari et al 2017 the field measurement methods are the most accurate however their lack of spatial and temporal coverage make them labor intensive and impractical for extended areas and time periods h nguyen et al 2020 the remote sensing based methods have been used in the last decades through modeling of forest parameters based on measured spectral variables dahy et al 2020 2019 issa et al 2020a chang et al 2023 several vegetation parameters can be predicted from the reflected remote sensing region including vis e g normalized difference vegetation index enhanced vegetation index etc leaf area index absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar and different image transformations duarte et al 2018 habib and al ghamdi 2021 images acquired by multispectral sensors are used to derive spectral information that can be correlated with forest inventory agb data kumar et al 2015 abbas et al 2020 commonly used variables include spectral bands vis image transformations and texture images kelsey and neff 2014 zhu and liu 2015 the landsat program was the first to provide scientists worldwide with a long record of space based consistent data of the land surface at moderate spatial resolution free of charge the landsat data time series 1972 present has provided ecosystem monitoring systems with two important elements the spatial and temporal coverages that lacked in the field measurement approach it is worth noting that the spatial dimension of this dataset allows the detection and assessing of both environmental and human effects in the study area while its temporal dimension enables historical change analysis over more than four decades the free data policy introduced by the landsat program in 2008 has revolutionized forest studies and monitoring in general and for estimating agb specifically particularly important to our research is the process of estimating the amount of carbon stock in date palms dp believed to have substantial capability of sequestering terrestrial carbon in both vegetation and soil compartments betemariyam and kefalew 2022 dp phoenix dactylifera l major crop in arid lands are resilient productive and have multiuse benefits jaradat and zaid 2004 particularly in the united arab emirates uae dp have been a vital component of the agricultural system the records show that the number of dp in the world exceed 120 million distributed across 30 different countries faostat 2013 they produce about 7 5 million tons of dates annually 70 of which come from middle east and north africa region mena uae alone contributes to more than 50 of mena date production the topic of this study was carefully chosen for many reasons not the least are the abundance of dp in the study area which has numerous socioeconomic benefits making it a valuable resource to the local population use of geospatial technologies to estimate and model cs in dp for the first time in the region apply and use the outcomes of the study as a quick and reliable input in support of a long term strategy for land resources management which is especially important given the uae government s significant investment in greening the country finally the cs by these dp was a plus not planned for when deciding to green the country half a century ago the main objective of the current study is to build a rs based biomass model to predict and map cs distribution in dp of the arid lands of abu dhabi uae at three age stages mature medium and young dp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses the whole emirate of abu dhabi the largest of the seven emirates composing uae it is bounded by 22 55 to 24 48 n and 51 30 e to 56 00 e and extends over a land area of 67 340 km2 sand dunes make up about 2 3 of the study area with nearly 5 million hectares fig 1 the emirate which hosts the capital city of abu dhabi has undergone extensive land conversions supported and subsidized by substantial oil revenues to become an urbanized modern state besides local authorities have extensively engaged in large greening projects to the extent that by the end of 2017 more than 540 afforested areas covering an estimated surface of 242 000 ha and mainly planted with dp have been realized issa et al 2019 the geographic and environmental settings of the study area are summarized in table 1 2 2 methods the flowchart of the methodology used to develop and validate the rs based biomass model is presented in fig 2 it shows the main components of the model 1 identification of rs predictors that can be used to estimate agb 2 selection of sample plots representing different age classes of dp mature medium and young 3 collection of field data necessary to estimate agb using the dp specific biomass allometric equations 4 building the rs based biomass estimation model using various regression methods and validating it by using different statistical metrics and 5 producing a map showing cs distribution throughout the emirate by creating the agb distribution map first then converting it into cs distribution map our model was developed and implemented using erdas imagine 2020 and arcgis 10 7 software packages 2 2 1 field data collection dp plantations in the study area were classified according to their age into three classes mature date palm mdp more than 10 years medium date palm medp 5 10 years and young date palm ydp less than 5 years two extensive field visits were conducted at the end of summer and during winter of 2018 targeting farms with different age stages plantations to collect data from sample units representing the three dp age stages the first visit took place from 10th to 18th september and the second from 14th to 6th december in all 54 plots of dp plantations were selected using a randomized probability sampling design stratified random design according to their age stage mdp medp and ydp the plot survey included 17 representing mdp 19 representing medp and 18 representing ydp the dimension of the plots were 40 m 40 m to ensure that one landsat 30 30 meter pixel fell within each plot fig 3 issa et al 2019 the coordinates of the plot s center and the number of dp in each of the 54 plots were recorded the mean values of these variables single bands and vis for all plots were calculated using a 3 3 window centered over each plot and consequently used in the model development 3 3 window was used to reduce the uncertainties in rs data resulting from plot positioning errors that could be created because of the mismatching of sample plots with the image pixels introduced when the x and y coordinates of sample plots were located using gps fig 3 trunk height ht and crown diameter cd for each palm were measured and subsequently used to calculate its crown area ca assuming a spherical palm crown ca π cd2 4 it is worth mentioning that we initially selected 83 field plots for surveying but had to exclude 29 of them leaving 54 only the reasons for exclusion were 1 sparse distribution of dp per plot 20 palm per plot 2 suffering of dp from abiotic stresses e g drought direct observation in the field or and through discussion with the farmers as some dp were deliberately not irrigated to get rid of them and 3 the large level of heterogeneity not representing accurately the age stage class mature medium and young 2 2 2 field estimation of agb and its carbon content the agb at the plot level was estimated by using dp biomass allometric equations previously developed specifically for dp of abu dhabi under arid land ecosystem conditions issa et al 2018 issa et al 2020b agb for each dp was first estimated by adding crown biomass cb and trunk biomass tb using the equations presented in table 2 agb at the plot level was then predicted by summing the agb for all palms in the plot and converting the results to biomass density in tons per hectare t ha 1 where cb is crown biomass tb is trunk biomass agb cb tb is the above ground biomass ca is crown area m2 ht is trunk height r2 is coefficient of determination 2 2 3 identifying rs variables predictors atmospherically corrected level 2 landsat 8 oli scenes were used to build the rs based model the data which comprised different types of dp plantations were geo registered to the utm coordinate system zone 40 wgs 84 seven bands were selected stacked and stored using erdas software package table 3 a combination of individual reflective bands and vis were used as remote sensing predictors to estimate agb both reflective bands listed in table 3 and modified vis listed in table 4 were tested where sr is the simple ratio rvi is the ratio vegetation index dvi is the difference vegetation index ndgi is the normalized difference greenness index ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index tvi is the transformed vegetation index gndvi is the green normalized difference vegetation index rdvi is the renormalized difference vegetation index savi is the soil adjusted vegetation index msavi is the modified soil adjusted vegetation index tcg is the tasseled cap transformation index for greenness tcb for brightness and tcw for wetness 2 2 4 building the rs based model for agb estimation different regression types linear and non linear were considered to evaluate the relationships between rs predictors and agb values for each plot predicted from ground measurements and allometric equations table 2 linear regression model was first tested and their performance assessed based on their coefficients of determination r2 and significance p value 0 05 a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis involving several single bands and vis was subsequently applied to achieve improved correlation 2 2 5 model evaluation the agb estimation model was assessed using cross validation for each plot root mean square error rmse rmse and the systematic prediction error sper s were estimated in percentage after randomly splitting the plot measurements dataset into a calibration dataset 80 and a validation dataset 20 the rmse rmse and sper were estimated using the eqs 1 2 and 3 1 rmse y i y i 2 n 2 rmse 100 rmse y 3 sper y i y where ŷ i is the predicted aĝb of the ith plot y i is the observed agb of the ith plot y i is the mean of predicted aĝb and y is the mean observed agb 2 2 6 applying the rs based biomass model to estimate agb of dp at different age stages maps of dp plantations created in a previously published study dahy et al 2021 were used in the model to delineate the location of dp at different age stages the reported accuracy of these maps was significantly high with overall classification accuracy of 94 5 and a kappa coefficient of 0 888 they showed that dp plantations covered an area of about 7588 04 hectares 22 69 for ydp 22 04 for medp and 55 27 for mdp subsets of landsat 8 oli images table 3 corresponding to dp plantations as defined in the dp maps were extracted using erdas imagine and used as input to the rs based biomass model the spatial model that estimates the amount of agb t ha 1 for each landsat pixel was implemented and run in the spatial model editor within erdas imagine fig 5 to estimate and create an agb map of the study area the produced map was subsequently used as input to estimate the density of above ground carbon aĝc for each pixel according to eq 4 based on a previously published carbon content to agb ratio of 53 87 issa et al 2020b 4 aĝc t ha 1 0 5387 aĝb t ha 1 to estimate agb and agc content in ton aĝb and aĝc density values t ha 1 produced by the model for each pixel were multiplied by the pixel size using the attribute table function in erdas imagine aĝb in ton was subsequently used to estimate the other carbon components involving biomass as described in section 2 2 7 2 2 7 cs estimation from the five components of the dp the total amount of cs was estimated as the sum of the carbon content of each of the following five biomass components agb below ground biomass bgb litter woody debris and soil organic matter som eggleston et al 2006 bgb litter and debris were predicted from the estimated agb value sections 2 2 7 1 and 2 2 7 2 the soil organic carbon soc was deduced from the som amount which was estimated as 91 38 section 2 2 7 3 2 2 7 1 below ground biomass bgb bgb is generally estimated at 20 of the agb in several published studies cairns et al 1997 koala et al 2017 mokany et al 2006 niether et al 2019 however we found different ratios among different dp age stages with averages of 0 332 0 925 and 0 496 for ydp medp and mdp respectively issa et al 2020b therefore the following eqs 5 6 and 7 were developed to estimate bgb of dp 5 bĝbmdp t aĝb t 0 496 6 bĝbmedp t aĝb t 0 925 7 bĝbydp t aĝb t 0 332 on the other hand the percentage of carbon content in the root system of dp bgb was found to be 51 27 issa et al 2020b which is slightly lower than the carbon content in the agb therefore below ground carbon bĝc was estimated in tons by multiplying the resulting values from eqs 5 6 or 7 by a factor of 0 5127 eq 8 8 bĝc t 0 5127 bĝb t 2 2 7 2 litters and woody debris carbon content of dead wood or litter and woody debris were assumed to be between 10 and 20 of the agb gibbs et al 2007 houghton et al 2009 issa et al 2020a the borders between dead biomass and litter and between dead biomass and som are rather subjective houghton et al 2009 based on extensive field visits to dp farms at different age stages it was observed that litter and debris ratio to agb of dp varied depending on the palm age stage the more the palm matures the more it produces litter and debris the researchers adopted the following percentages to be applied to predict litter and debris in ton from aĝb in ton for dp plantations 10 for ydp 15 for medp and 20 for mdp 2 2 7 3 soil organic carbon soc the dps contribute about 22 26 tons of soc per hectare in plantations issa et al 2020b this number was calculated by performing the combustion method for 4 h at 550 c on soil samples taken at top soil 10 cm from underneath the dp canopy and then deriving of the som and the soc furthermore the soc in ton of dp for the three age stages were calculated as per eq 9 9 soc area 22 26 t ha 1 where the total areas of mdp medp and ydp in the study area were estimated to be 4193 86 ha 1672 14 ha and 1722 05 ha respectively dahy et al 2021 finally erdas spatial modeling tools were used to produce the agb map for the whole study area utilizing the selected model built from the rs variables as estimated by the results of our analyses agc map fig 6 was then created by multiplying the estimated agb by 0 5387 as per the eq 4 section 2 2 6 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics of the assessed field variables structural variables of 2063 palms included in the 54 plots were measured in the field statistics about these measurements including the number of dp for each age stage class average ca ht and densities of dp per hectare are summarized in table 5 the average palm ca in meter and its standard error se of the mdp medp and ydp plots were 36 1 64 22 51 1 22 and 6 65 0 67 m2 respectively the average palm ht s of the mdp medp and ydp plots were 2 89 0 22 1 07 0 08 and 0 15 0 03 m respectively it is obvious that the increase in dp age results in an increase in ca and ht the averages of dp number per plot of mdp medp and ydp were 41 38 and 35 respectively which based on a plot area of 1600 m2 amounts to around 258 238 and 221 palm ha 1 respectively where mdp is mature date palm medp is medium date palm and ydp is young date palm the numbers in the parenthesis represent the minimum and maximum values 3 2 agb estimating of field data and the estimation of its carbon content aĝb was estimated from the field measurement in all 54 plots table 6 shows the average and range of aĝb in t ha 1 for dp at the three age stages the largest ĉb was found in mdp plots while the lowest ĉb was found in ydp plots these outcomes were affected by the average ca of the plots table 5 similarly t b was affected by the ht average table 5 the averages of aĝb in tons per hectare se of mdp medp and ydp were estimated at 59 39 7 8 23 33 2 5 and 6 15 0 5 t ha 1 respectively the agc in t ha 1 was estimated by multiplying the average aĝb in tons per hectare by 0 5387 see eq 4 therefore the averages aĝc se for mdp medp and ydp plots were estimated at 31 99 4 2 12 57 1 4 and 3 31 0 3 t ha 1 where mdp is mature date palm medp is medium date palm ydp is young date palm and aĝb is the estimated above ground biomass the numbers in the parenthesis represent the minimum and maximum values 3 3 model development and rs variables importance as the dp age has an important role in their biomass table 6 the regression analysis linking the field variables with the rs predictors was conducted according to the dp age stages defined earlier 3 3 1 date palm mature in mdp plots 17 plots the linear correlation between agb and single bands was only significant for swir bands at the same time it was significant for all tested vis except tcb and tcg the highest correlation was for swir1 and swir2 bands with r2 values of 0 302 and 0 290 respectively while for vis ndgi and sr showed the highest correlation with r2 values of 0 609 and 0 545 respectively on the other hand tcw showed the strongest correlation to agb using a second order polynomial model additionally stepwise multiple regression analysis on agb of the mdp revealed that a grouping of single bands or of vis did not improve the r2 therefore the second order polynomial model that uses only tcw as rs predictor was found to be the strongest model to estimate the biomass of mdp with r² equal 0 7643 and p value equal of 0 007 eq 10 and fig 4 10 agbmdp t ha 1 0 00006 x tcw 2 0 1212 x tcw 96 708 3 3 2 date palm non mature it was found that r2 could be improved by considering medium and young dp as one age class the non mature class non mdp section 2 2 running the regression analysis for non mdp 37 plots the combination of medp and ydp resulted in a stronger correlation between agb and rs predictors all of landsat 8 oli single bands with the exception of b g and nir and all the vis except ngvi exhibited significant correlation with agb the stepwise regression analysis on agb of the non mdp revealed that a grouping of single bands or vis did not improve the r2 the exponential regression model using rdvi yielded the strongest correlation with an r2 value of 0 4987 and p value equals 0 00002 eq 11 and fig 4 11 agbnon mdp t ha 1 0 8257 x e0 1469 rdvi 3 4 model validation field measurements and the statistical accuracy assessment were used to validate the developed agb model the accuracy statistics included rmse rmse and sper as detailed in section 2 2 5 table 7 summarizes the selected regression models for the estimation of the agb from landsat 8 oli single bands and vis 3 5 creation of the agb map of dp and estimation of total cs in the study area the final agb map was created using the regression models shown in table 7 the two sub models that use twc for mdp and rdvi for non mdp are depicted in fig 5 the map of agc shown in fig 6 is predicted from agb map using eq 4 table 8 summarizes the results of the cs analysis we found that the overall cs by dp plantations in abu dhabi was 2447 856 87 tons 4 discussion the main purpose of the current study is to build a geospatial model for the estimation of carbon stock cs of date palms dp and mapping its geographical distribution in the emirate of abu dhabi uae at three age stages mature medium and young it is worth noting that parts of our findings have already been published however the novelty in the current study is reflected in many aspects including the scope and objectives the sample sizes the datasets used the model built and the results and visualization indeed the current study has been extended to cover the whole emirate involving larger sample sizes and comprising most cultivars of uae s date palms the integration between the finer resolution wv 2 scenes which served at depicting and mapping all dp plantations at different age stages dahy et al 2021 with landsat level 2 dataset to identify and measure more accurate rs predictors allowed to build our final improved model another novelty of the current research is that the generally adopted ratio of bgb estimated at 20 of the agb in several published studies cairns et al 1997 koala et al 2017 mokany et al 2006 niether et al 2019 was not valid for our model instead our results showed different ratios among different dp age stages with averages of 0 332 0 925 and 0 496 for ydp medp and mdp respectively issa et al 2020b therefore eqs 5 6 and 7 were developed and implemented to estimate bgb of dp instead on the other hand the percentage of carbon content in the root system of dp bgb was found to be 51 27 issa et al 2020b which is slightly lower than the carbon content in the agb therefore below ground carbon bĝc was estimated in tons by multiplying the resulting values from eqs 5 6 or 7 by a factor of 0 5127 eq 8 furthermore carbon content of dead wood or litter and woody debris are usually assumed to be between 10 and 20 of the agb gibbs et al 2007 houghton et al 2009 issa et al 2020a however based on extensive field visits to dp farms at different age stages it was observed that litter and debris ratio to agb of dp varied depending on the palm age stage the more the palm matures the more it produces litter and debris the researchers adopted the following percentages to be applied to predict litter and debris in ton from aĝb in ton for dp plantations 10 for ydp 15 for medp and 20 for mdp three models were initially built to estimate agb for the three age stages mature medium and young however the large contribution of background reflectance in the study area reduced the accuracy of separating the young and medium dp this in turn weakened the statistical relationship between agb of medium and young dp with rs variables derived from landsat 8 oli subsequently young and medium dp classes were merged to form one non mature dp non mdp class substantially improving the statistical relationship between agb and rs variables therefore we opted for the creation of two sub models only one for non mdp and another for mdp our study showed that when using single band to predict agb the swir bands of landsat oli produced the highest and most significant correlation for both mdp and non mdp plantations these results were in line with findings from a previous study in tajikistan where the authors found that swir1 2 of landsat 8 were convenient in detecting arid land s vegetation zandler et al 2015 while our work on agb of the mdp showed that a grouping of single bands or vis does not improve the r2 it was noticed that vis provided better predictors of agb than single bands our results were also consistent with other studies that used landsat imagery to estimate biomass in different regions such as the study reported in günlü et al 2014 the decision of selecting the effectively performing vis is function of the type of ecosystem environmental conditions and spectral characteristics of the sensor spectral band saturation for instance is a well recognized problem and can affect vi performance and lead to inaccurate estimation of agb zhao et al 2016 however this was not a major factor in our study region observed structural differences in dp plantations influenced the calculation of agb indeed varied palms spacing were found in some plots while sparse distribution of dp with no regular spacing caused by human interferences were found in others it was also noted that regardless of the dp age other factors affected date palm s ca and ht and consequently the palm s capacity to accumulate biomass and sequester carbon cultivar and land management practices are examples of such factors the largest average of dp density was found on mdp plots in two cases of mdp plots the number of dp reached 88 and 96 palms per plot which corresponds to around 550 and 600 palm ha 1 respectively this could be attributed to the old farming systems where mdp were planted irregularly in the farm with short spacing among palms to benefit from the traditional irrigation systems e g aflaj irrigation systems nowadays the palms are distributed in a more organized manner with wider spacing among them 7 m 7 m 8 m 8 m and 9 m 9 m leading to lower densities allowing agricultural tractors and machinery to navigate more easily it is noticeable that an overlap between the crown area ranges of mdp and medp is found in some cases this is due to regular pruning of dp fronds practiced in new plantations the pruning process aims to keep a specific number of fronds in the palm allowing more carbohydrates to go to the fruits dates than the fronds it is rare to find ht of dp taller than 5 m in modern dp farms as the farmers tend to remove tall palms reaching certain height as they are more difficult to maintain and manage however during field measurement the researchers observed some dp that exceeded 5 m and some were extremely tall with very high ht reached up to 15 2 m especially in the oases in contrast it was found that most ydp had ht equal to zero and some of them had ca equal 0 07 m2 since their fronds were attached by cord with no trunk these structural variations impacted the performance of spectral bands and vis as predictors affected the estimation of agb and influenced the choice of estimation model the approach implemented aimed at selecting the most appropriate regression model among the tested models to estimate agb of dp at multiple age stages it considered the use of linear and non linear regression models with multiple single band single vis and stepwise multivariate regression to estimate the most appropriate model from the tested models based on correlation significance and rmse the model that provided the best estimate of agb in the case of mdp consisted in the use of a second order polynomial where tcw served as the only rs predictor this model yielded the strongest correlation and significance with r² equal to 0 7643 and a p value equal to 0 007 with rmse of 6 322 tha 1 for non mdp an exponential model that uses rdvi as rs predictor provided the strongest estimate of biomass with r² equal to 0 4987 and p value equal to 0 00002 while the model validation showed rmse of 8 040 tha 1 these results were consistent with published literature for other species and study areas where landsat 8 was used for mapping and predicting agb in woodlands karlson et al 2015 the dp age stage class derived from the wv 2 data was processed to select the proper model from the tested models to use when estimating agb the resulting map was an emirate wide map of agb that was subsequently used to predict cs this step highlights the strength and uniqueness of our approach where rs based model once calibrated enabled the creation of cs maps from remote sensing data without the need for additional field measurements the accurate total carbon stock estimation of dp plantations in abu dhabi depends on the accurate estimation of its biomass specifically agb that is predicted by using biomass allometric equations therefore one source of uncertainty could come from the equations themselves to overcome this issue the authors used published allometric equations developed from represented field samples of dp considering the different varieties as well as the three different age stages in the study area the other source of uncertainty for the estimation of the biomass of dp hence their carbon stock could come from rs models that were built during the current study the authors identified and selected a number of plot samples representing homogenous dp plantations with strict criteria excluding the plots that have a sparse distribution of dp plot stressed dp large level of heterogeneity and not representing the age stage class see section 2 2 1 the plot design with 40 m 40 m dimension ensured that the area on the ground occupied at least one full pixel of landsat 8 oli image with a 30 m pixel resolution issa et al 2019 landsat 8 oli spectral variables mean values for all the plots were extracted for a 3 3 window centered over each plot to reduce the uncertainties in rs data resulting from plot positioning errors that could be created because of the mismatching of sample plots with the image pixels introduced when the x and y coordinates of sample plots were located using gps d lu et al 2002 the rs models for estimating dp biomass were estimated from level 2 product of landsat to identify and measure more accurate rs predictors however landsat with moderate spatial resolution was not able to differentiate and map dp at all age stages therefore we used accurate maps of dp at all age stages derived from fine resolution wv 2 scenes as input to our final biomass models dahy et al 2021 hence we succeeded in predicting and visualizing the amounts of cs in all dp plantations in the whole study area 5 conclusion recommendations a geospatial model of carbon stock assessment of date palm at different age stages was developed allometric equations previously developed and published by the authors were utilized to design calibrate and implement the model to predict the amounts of agb and agc in dp different types of regression analysis single and multiple were tested to create relationships linking the agb to rs predictors using an expanded number of 54 field plots showed that tcw has the most significant correlation estimated using a second order polynomial model to estimate the biomass of mdp with r² equal to 0 7643 and p value equal to 0 007 on the other hand the exponential regression model that used rdvi as rs predictor provided the strongest correlation with agb of non mdp with an r2 value of 0 4987 and a p value of 0 00002 the development of a remote sensing based biomass and carbon estimation model enabled the prediction and visualization of cs over extended areas with minimum fieldwork using previously produced dp age classification maps the rs based model was applied to landsat 8 imagery to map and predict the cs of dp in abu dhabi the total cs in dp plantations was estimated as the sum of the estimated cs in the five components agb bgb litter debris and soc the overall cs by dp plantations in abu dhabi predicted from this map amounted to 2447 856 87 tons the main limitation is related to the use of moderate spatial resolution rs product to estimate the biomass and cs amounts landsat with moderate spatial resolution was not able to accurately differentiate and map dp at all age stages therefore we used accurate maps of dp at all age stages derived from fine resolution wv 2 scenes as input to our final biomass models consequently a weak statistical relationship between agb of medium and young dp with rs variables derived from landsat 8 oli was observed subsequently young and medium dp classes were merged to form one non mature dp non mdp class to overcome this challenge one suggested solution is to use finer spatial resolution of satellite imagery for the building the dp biomass model finally our applied methods used in this project can be generalized to other areas in the gulf region with minimal cost it can also be modified to use other publicly available moderate resolution imagery such as sentinel 2 rs based biomass estimating model for dp were built for a quick and reliable method for the creation and visualization of a standard dp cs map for the emirate of abu dhabi thus it can be further employed to boost the decision taking process on durable and sustainable management of cs

24209,diatoms are an extraordinarily diverse evolutionarily successful and ecologically important group of single cell algae diatoms of the group of the pennates are particularly important in estuarine sedimentary habitats where they form highly productive microphytobenthos communities that cover extensive areas of intertidal flats the pennates are capable of directed motility an evolutionary and unique trait amongst diatoms which has long been hypothesized to confer a critical adaptive advantage by enabling these cells to vertically migrate within the photic zone of the sediment and behaviorally regulate light exposure this study investigated the role of diatom motility on the active regulation of light exposure by developing a model to quantitatively characterize and compare the experienced light environment of individual cells of two life forms of pennate diatoms that inhabit intertidal estuarine sediments epipelic species motile cells dominant in fine sediments and epipsammic species non motile or slowly motile cells that colonize coarser sediments the conceptual framework of the model was based on the identification and parameterization of the main controlling factors of the light regime perceived by cells inhabiting the two types of sedimentary environments i solar irradiance incident at the sediment surface determined by the superimposition of the tidal cycle on the day night cycle ii light attenuation within the sediment iii sediment mixing by tidal currents or bioturbation repositioning the cells in the sediment column iv cell velocity as a function of light intensity and of the photoacclimation state of the cells that determines their photosynthetic light preferences the model was run for realistic scenarios based on published ecological photophysiological and cellular motility data light attenuation mixing depth photosynthesis light response curves cell velocity simulating i the variation in the vertical position of a diatom cell due to vertical migration and ii the irradiance level to which it is exposed at each moment the results confirm the hypothesis that epipelic and epipsammic diatoms experience a significantly different light environment vertical migration enables motile species to experience a much less variable light regime with increased mean daily light doses received in contrast non motile species experience a much more unstable light environment including the frequent exposure to supersaturating light levels and to periods of prolonged darkness these results have important ecological significance as they support the adaptive value of light driven motility as a form of optimizing photosynthesis and growth and they identify vertical migration as a niche construction

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction diatoms are single cell photoautotrophic eukaryotic microalgae renowned for their unique silica based cell walls ubiquitous in virtually all marine and freshwater habitats living in suspension in the water column or attached to substrata armbrust 2009 diatoms form an extremely diverse evolutionarily successful and ecologically important group of algae their photosynthesis captures 40 of the total carbon fixed by marine ecosystems the equivalent to 20 25 of the earth s global carbon fixation an amount comparable to that fixed by all the terrestrial rainforests combined field et al 1998 particularly in coastal and estuarine ecosystems the primary production carried out by diatoms represents a key source of carbon for trophic webs supporting a range of animal populations from small crustacean to commercially valuable fishes seabirds and marine mammals benoiston et al 2017 in estuaries and shallow coastal zones diatoms are the dominant group of primary producers both in the water column phytoplankton and in the sediment and other benthic habitats microphytobenthos diatoms are particularly important in sedimentary habitats where they largely dominate the microphytobenthic communities forming highly productive biofilms that cover extensive areas of intertidal flats or shallow subtidal sediments underwood and kromkamp 1999 the microphytobenthos plays key roles in the functioning of estuarine and coastal ecosystems hope et al 2019 its productivity ranks among the highest in marine ecosystems and in tidal estuaries it acts as a major carbon sink in some cases surpassing the ecosystem level primary production of the phytoplankton frankenbach et al 2020 it further mediates nutrient cycling hochard et al 2010 and the fluxes across the water air sediment interface eyre et al 2011 promotes sediment biostabilization paterson et al 2018 and through resuspension to the water column contributes to the planktonic primary productivity brito et al 2012 the diatom species that form sedimentary microphytobenthic communities belong predominantly to the group of the raphid pennate diatoms simultaneously the most evolutionarily recent having appeared only ca 30 million years ago and presently the largest group of diatoms armbrust 2009 kooistra et al 2007 in contrast with their planktonic ancestors raphid pennates are capable of directed motility a unique trait amongst diatoms made possible by the appearance of the raphe a longitudinal thin and long slit through the surface of the cell wall nakov et al 2018 most commonly diatoms move through gliding a form of locomotion consisting in movements parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cell when in close contact with hard surfaces and involving the adhesive extrusion of mucilaginous extracellular polymeric substances through the raphe edgar and pickett heaps 1984 directed motility has been hypothesized to have conferred a critical adaptive advantage to pennate diatoms explaining their evolutionary success and their fast evolution cohn et al 2015 nakov et al 2018 it is seen as a key adaptation to the sedimentary environment allowing cells to colonize new niches and to rapidly respond to environmental physical and chemical microgradients uv and visible light gravity temperature salinity desiccation ph nutrients carbon and pheromones and to actively exploit resource heterogeneity while avoiding unfavorable regions of the microhabitat serôdio 2021 in sedimentary microphytobenthos diatom motility is mostly manifested by the synchronized vertical movement of massive numbers of cells to and from the surface of the sediment coelho et al 2011 palmer and round 1967 vertical migration follows well defined patterns including the upward movement towards the surface at the beginning of daytime periods of low tide followed by the downward migration in anticipation of tidal flood or night consalvey et al 2004 serôdio 2021 this vertical migratory behavior is considered as a critical trait and a key adaptation to the sedimentary environment as it affects several aspects of the biology and ecology of sediment inhabiting pennate diatoms serôdio et al 2001 it regulates and enhances photosynthetic activity and carbon assimilation determines nutrient uptake and sexual reproduction saburova and polikarpov 2003 and is controlled by an endogenous biological clock palmer and round 1967 a longstanding idea is that raphid pennates use vertical migration to adjust their vertical position in the sediment to regulate light exposure admiraal 1984 serôdio et al 2001 in the nutrient rich conditions of estuarine sediments light is argued to be the most important limiting factor for photosynthesis and growth and the ability to regulate light exposure is key to cope with the conditions of the intertidal sedimentary environment due to the strong light attenuation in sediments and to the frequent remixing of the sediment by tidal currents and bioturbation diatom cells may be displaced to deep layers where light levels are too low to support growth or be directly exposed to sunlight at the surface frankenbach et al 2019 morelle et al 2021 on the other hand diatoms can be deposited at the surface where exposure to high light levels can cause photoinhibition a major factor limiting of photosynthesis raven 2011 especially if exacerbated by the stressful conditions common in the intertidal environment laviale et al 2015 in this context vertical migration has been hypothesized to confer the two fold possibility of avoiding dark or low light regions of the sediment and of escaping photoinhibitory light levels near the surface overall optimizing photosynthesis and growth admiraal 1984 consalvey et al 2004 this behavioral photoprotection hypothesis is supported by diverse experimental evidence frankenbach et al 2018 strong support comes from the observation that vertical migration is regulated by light intensity following a well defined biphasic light response pattern comprising upward migration under low light positive phototaxis and downward migration under high light negative phototaxis with the rate of descend depending on light intensity du et al 2010 laviale et al 2016 serôdio et al 2006 further evidence supporting that vertical migration may be effective in regulating light exposure comes from the comparable scales of the photic zone of the sediment 500 µm cartaxana et al 2011 kromkamp et al 1998 serôdio et al 2001 and of the size of most pennate diatom cells 10 70 µm jesus et al 2009 considering the velocities attainable by pennate diatom cells it appears plausible that vertical migration can be fast enough to allow cells to traverse the whole photic zone corresponding a few cell lengths in a short period cohn et al 2015 consalvey et al 2004 serôdio et al 2001 the role of motility on the physiology and productivity of microphytobenthos communities has been often addressed by the comparative study of two life forms of pennate diatom species taxonomically closely related and occurring virtually sympatrically e g same tidal flat of the same estuary but with distinct motility capacity ribeiro 2000 sabbe 1997 epipelic forms motile species dominant in fine sediments where they glide freely between the sediment particles and epipsammic non motile or slowly motile species inhabiting coarser sediments where they live attached to sediment particles barnett et al 2015 cartaxana et al 2011 frankenbach et al 2018 jesus et al 2009 juneau et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2013 the rationale underlying the comparative study of epipelic and epipsammic forms is the assumption that motility determines not only the light levels to which the cells are exposed but also and critically the variability of the light regime experienced by the two types of life forms in their corresponding sedimentary habitats having the capacity to adjust their position along the vertical light gradient as incident light changes across the day epipelic cells are expected to experience a less variable light environment than epipsammic ones not able to move these cells will be exposed to whatever light levels reach the depths where they happen to be located experiencing a much more variable and possibly extreme light environment barnett et al 2015 this assumption although seeming plausible has not been verified and to our knowledge no attempts have been made to quantify the consequences of motility on the light regime perceived by sediment inhabiting diatoms the migratory behavior of diatoms has been the subject of modeling studies but not explicitly considering the control by light cao et al 2013 marques da silva et al 2020 the present study addresses this question by developing a model to quantify the effects of diatom motility on the experienced light exposure of individual cells inhabiting intertidal estuarine sediments the general conceptual framework of the model is based on the main controlling factors of the light regime to which cells inhabiting a intertidal sedimentary environment are exposed to i solar irradiance incident at the sediment surface considering the interference of the tidal cycle on the day night cycle ii light attenuation withing the sediment dependent on its granulometry iii sediment mixing due to tidal currents or bioturbation iv diatom cell velocity as a function of light intensity and time of day numerical simulations were run for realistic scenarios based on published ecological photophysiological and cellular motility data in order to characterize and compare the light environment perceived by epipelic motile and epipsammic immotile and slowly motile life forms both in terms of mean hourly and daily light dose received and of its variability across hourly and daily time scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptualization the model developed in this study aimed to quantify the effects of diatom motility on the experienced light exposure of individual cells inhabiting intertidal estuarine sediments effects of cellular directed motility were addressed by modeling two main contrasting scenarios diatom communities dominated by motile epipelic species colonizing fine sediments thereafter referred to as epl table 1 and diatom communities dominated by slowly motile or immotile epipsammic species thereafter referred to as epm conceptually the model considered four main factors forcing the exposure of cells to light fig 1 i variation of solar irradiance incident at surface of the sediment parameterized as e 0 t which was considered identical for the epl and the epm scenarios fig 1a b ii light attenuation within the sediment determining the vertical distribution of light and the depth of the sedimentary photic zone parameterized by the attenuation coefficient k e in sediments composed by finer particles epipelic cells are exposed to a steeper vertical light gradient and a shallower photic zone due to a higher light attenuation than the epipsammic ones inhabiting coarser sediments fig 1c d iii mixing depth z mix determining the vertical position of cells z cell at the beginning of each light period the coarser sediment particles in the epm scenario allow for a deeper mixing than in the epl scenario fig 1c d iv cell velocity determining the capacity to behaviorally regulate the experienced light exposure by escaping the aphotic layers of the sediment and reaching the photic zone and by migrating downwards under excess light intensities parameterized as v e zcell t t reflecting the dependency of light intensity and time of day t in the case of epipsammic communities two scenarios were considered epipsammic motile species epm m slowly moving cells fig 1d and epipsammic non motile species epm nm for which v 0 two other processes were also considered first the semi lunar fortnight variability in light exposure conditions determined by the delay of the low tide exposure from day to day four scenarios fig 2 second the photoacclimation state of epipelic and epipsammic cells parameterized by photosynthetic light response curves including the photoacclimation parameter e k used to define the ranges of light intensities corresponding to light limiting e e k and excessive super saturating light conditions e e k fig 1a b 2 2 validation of model parameters most of the values and range of variation of the parameters of the model were based on laboratory and field observations and ecological data collected over almost two decades on epipelic and epipsammic communities and their sedimentary habitats on two intertidal sites of the ria de aveiro a tidal estuarine ecosystem in the west coast of portugal bueno pardo et al 2018 these data include table 2 hourly variation of solar irradiance and semi lunar variation of tidal exposure frankenbach et al 2020 serôdio et al 2008 sediment granulometry and associated light attenuation frankenbach et al 2020 serôdio et al 2007 diatom photophysiology including detailed data on photoacclimation and photosynthetic light response frankenbach et al 2018 serôdio et al 2007 epipelic and epipsammic species composition frankenbach et al 2018 serôdio et al 2007 and diatom photobehavior namely light induced and endogenously controlled vertical migration coelho et al 2011 laviale et al 2016 serôdio et al 2006 the exceptions refer to data on diatom velocity light response that were based on published data concerning diatoms grown in culture cohn et al 2003 consalvey et al 2004 mclachlan et al 2009 serôdio 2021 as most observations refer to the same epipelic and epipsammic communities and habitats within the same ecosystem the model parameters were validated by a consistent and coherent data set 2 3 model outline in summary the model simulates i the changes in the vertical position depth below the sediment surface of a diatom cell due to vertical migration during the course of the diurnal low tide periods occurring for one day and ii the irradiance level to which it is exposed at each moment at the beginning of each light period the cell depth is reset being determined by a random value within the mixing zone simulating the effects of tidal currents and bioturbation the velocity magnitude and vertical direction of the cell at each depth is determined by the light available at that depth and on the cell s photosynthetic light preferences by running the model for multiple days see below the light regime perceived by the cells can be characterized both in terms of location and of variability in the daily light dose received the modeling workflow is summarized in fig 3 to assess the impact of cellular motility on the perceived light regime the model was run for various scenarios firstly using realistic parameter values for epipelic epipsammic motile epm m scenario and epipsammic non motile epm nm scenario communities and their sedimentary habitat table 2 secondly by systematically varying the parameters characterizing cell velocity and mixing depth to evaluate the relative impact of these main factors 2 3 1 solar irradiance at surface the hourly variation of irradiance incident at the surface of the sediment e 0 t was simulated by a gaussian curve guo 2017 1 e 0 t e m e t t n 2 c where t n is the time of solar noon e m is the maximum irradiance occurring when t t n and c is the steepness of the curve measuring the rate of change of instantaneous solar irradiance over time for simplicity the values of e m and t n corresponding to the solar zenith were set to 2000 µmol quanta m 2 s 1 and 12 00 respectively fig 2 and c was estimated from fitted eqn 1 to in situ data measured in the ria de aveiro during a clear sky summer day serôdio et al 2008 the semi lunar variation of available light associated to the progression of the tide from one day to the next was considered by simulating four different scenarios approximately as observed in the ria de aveiro serôdio et al 2008 2007 low tide in the middle of the day occurring during spring tides st high tide in the middle of the day and low tide during the morning and afternoon occurring during neap tides nt intermediate situations st nt and nt st fig 2 for each of these scenarios it was assumed that no light is available for the cells during high tide periods either due to submersion in turbid water or due to downward vertical migration during submersion 2 3 2 light attenuation in the sediment the vertical variation of light available within the photic zone of the sediment at each moment of the day e z t was described by an negative exponential function based on irradiance data measured with detailed sub millimeter vertical resolution on two types of sediment of the ria de aveiro colonized by epipelic and epipsammic diatom communities frankenbach et al 2020 light penetration was quantified by the light attenuation coefficient k e which was higher for the epl scenario finer sediment k e 9 0 mm 1 table 2 and lower for the epm scenario coarser sediment k e 6 1 mm 1 to calculate the light available at the cell depth e zcell t 2 e z c e l l t e 0 t e k e z c e l l it was assumed that light attenuation was constant over time and not affected by cell self shading 2 2 3 sediment mixing to simulate the effects of the mixing of the upper layers of the sediment by tidal currents especially during ebb and flood or due to bioturbation during high tide cover the vertical position of the cell was newly defined at set at the start of each new low tide light period due to the lack of data on the impact of sediment mixing on the redistribution of cells with depth this process was modelled by attributing to z cell a random value between z 0 and z z mix for each mixing event it was assumed a complete homogenization of the sediment across the whole mixing zone meaning that all depths between 0 and z mix were equally probable for defining z cell uniform distribution because fine sediments colonized by epipelic diatoms tend to be much more cohesive then the coarser sediments colonized by epipsammic diatoms ubertini et al 2015 z mix was considered to be smaller for the former zmix 2 mm than for the later zmix 10 mm fig 1c d table 2 2 2 4 cell light preferences and photoacclimation state a key feature of this model is the explicit dependency of cell behavior velocity and vertical direction on light intensity however the motility response of the cells is not considered to depend on light levels per se but on the light levels when compared to the cell light preferences determined by its photosynthetic light response see below the rationale is that cells will migrate vertically trying to optimize photosynthesis avoiding dark or limiting light levels as well as super saturating intensities the range of intensities that are considered too low and too high is determined by the photoacclimation state of the cells typically characterized by light response curves of photosynthesis and in particular by the light acclimation parameter e k ezequiel et al 2015 here the model used data referring to light response curves of retr the relative electron transport rate of photosystem ii psii an established proxy of diatom photosynthetic rates barranguet and kromkamp 2000 morelle and claquin 2018 serôdio et al 2007 measured on epipelic and epipsammic communities of the ria de aveiro frankenbach et al 2018 table 2 fig 4 a the light response curves of retr were characterized by the initial slope of the curve α the maximum retr level retrm and e k 2 2 5 cell velocity the variation of cell velocity with depth and light intensity was modelled to ensure i a light dependency functionally identical to the relationship experimentally documented by mclachlan et al 2009 and ii positive velocity upward migration for light limiting levels e e k and negative velocity downward migration for super saturating levels e e k the variation of cell velocity as a function of light v e was based on the normalized rate of variation of retr with e δretr δe 3 v e v m δ r e t r δ e e δ r e t r δ e e k max δ r e t r δ e e where v m is the maximum cell velocity to ensure that v e 0 for e e k normalization was done separately for e e k and e e k the relationship between cell velocity with light intensity and the photosynthetic light response retr vs e curves is shown in fig 4 eq 3 displays the main features of the observations of mclachlan et al 2009 i cell velocity decreases with light intensity with maximum velocity being observed for very low light or dark ii under low light cells move towards the light source and under high light they move away from light eq 3 was applied to the epl and epm m scenarios while for the epm nm scenario cell velocity was considered as zero for epipelic cells the value of v m was considered as the mean value of published vertical diatom gliding speeds compiled in serôdio 2021 table 2 considering the inexistence of data for cell velocity of epipsammic motile diatoms v m was defined as 10 times smaller than the values for used for the epipelic the cell position at each new time t i 1 δt t i 1 t i was calculated from cell velocity and the depth at the previous time t i 4 z c e l l t i 1 z c e l l t i v e z c e l l δ t the model also considers another well known and critical aspect of the motility behavior of sediment inhabiting pennate diatoms the endogenously controlled gravity driven and light independent vertical migration before the start upward migration before sunrise or before end of high tide cover and the end downward migration before sunset or incoming high tide of light exposure periods based on detailed data for the epipelic communities of the ria de aveiro coelho et al 2011 frankenbach et al 2014 the model considers that cells start migrating upwards 30 min before start of diurnal low tide periods and start migrating downwards 30 min before high tide and 2 h before sunset if during low tide fig 2 the model also considers another important feature of diatom gliding the reversal autonomous rhythm wenderoth and rhiel 2004 which consists in the continuous back and forth movement of the cells causing directed progression to depend on the relative time between reversal of the direction of the movement serôdio 2021 this aspect was included in the model by considering cell velocity to be given by a random number from a normal distribution with mean v e t and standard deviation σv e t based on the observations of cohn et al 2003 σv was set to 10 of the value of v table 2 2 2 6 model implementation and outputs for each day the model was run with a time step δt 5 min computing the total daily light dose to which the cell is exposed ld given by the cumulative product of incident light at depth z cell and the time step 5 l d t i e z c e l l t i δ t and the exposure to excess light e ek given by the number of hours that the cells were expose to e e k for each scenario the model was run for 1000 days to obtain a frequency distribution of ld which was characterized in terms of central tendency mean ld ld and dispersion coefficient of variability of ld cvld as well as the proportion of days the cells did not receive any light ld0 table 3 3 results 3 1 general comparison between epl and epm scenarios fig 5 illustrates individual runs of the model showing the trajectories of cells starting from two depths 0 5 and 2 0 mm for the three scenarios epl epm m and epm nm considering a full photoperiod not interrupted by submersion by high tide epipelic cells are fast enough to be able to reach the photic zone during the early parts of the day fig 5d cells starting at the deeper layer z cell 2 0 mm reach the uppers layers of the sediment only 2 3 h later although not compromising the exposure to high light levels for most of the day fig 5a it is noticeable a slight downward migration during the middle of the day when solar irradiance incident the surface and upper layers attains supersaturating levels in the epm m scenario the slower cell velocity implies that only cells starting at shallower depths are able to reach the photic zone during the course of the day fig 5b e cells starting at deeper layers as in the example of z cell 2 0 mm may only reach the lower regions of the photic zone and be exposed for very low light levels fig 5b in contrast the light exposure of immotile cells epm nm scenario is completely dependent on the depth where cells are deposited fig 5c f non motile epipsammic cells that happen to be close enough to the surface e g z cell 0 5 mm may be exposed to relevant light levels although not being able to explore the light gradient and regulate light exposure non motile cells may stay all day under low light limiting levels or on the contrary experience supersaturating light levels cases not shown fig 5 also illustrates the endogenously controlled behavior of epipelic cells and to a lesser extent also motile epipsammic cells reflected in upward migration before sunrise and downward migration before the end of the light period running the model for a large number of days 1000 allowed to compare the three scenarios regarding the light regime perceived by the cells characterized in terms of mean values and variability of received daily light dose fig 6 the most evident result is the clear difference between epl and both epm scenarios with the former showing a much higher mean and a lower variability in ld values indicating how cell motility effectively contributes to lower the inter day variability in experienced daily light dose for the epl scenario ld reached around 335 mmol quanta m 2 and a cvld was below 3 fig 6b while for the epm scenarios ld remained below 52 mmol quanta m 2 and cvld reached much higher values above 217 and 364 for epm m and epm nm respectively fig 6d f also significant is the difference in the shape of the frequency distribution of ld very symmetrical in the epl scenario while highly positively skewed in epm with a large proportion of days with very low of no light received by the cells fig 6d f in contrast with the epl scenario for which cells are exposed to light in all simulated days in the epm scenarios cells are expected to experience continuous darkness for the majority of the days ld0 around 60 and 70 for epm m and epm nm respectively 3 2 variation along the spring neap tidal cycle figs 5 and 6 served to illustrate the main features of the model and to exemplify a situation with no changes in light availability associated to the interference of submersion in high tide as would occur for example in shallow subtidal habitats the inclusion in the model of tidal submersion periods and their progression along the day during the spring neap cycle confirmed the main overall differences between the epl and epm scenarios described above but also revealed a larger complexity and diversity in the perceived light regime fig 7 shows examples of epipelic cell trajectories for the four scenarios of tidal submersion described above a common aspect of all cases contrasting with the previous simulations fig 5 6 is the shorter periods of light exposure the most extreme situation being the case of neap tides nt when diurnal low tide is restricted to early morning and late afternoon fig 7c g the effective period of light exposure is even shorter as cells take some time to reach the photic zone during the beginning of the light periods and migrate downwards before high tide or night as a consequence when light period starts at middle of the day st st nt cells may reach the photic zone later than in days when exposure periods start before sunrise nt st these aspects become more apparent when running the model for multiple days fig 8 as seen for the case of no tidal interference the consideration of tides also led to much higher ld values and much lower cvld for the epl than for the epms scenarios for all tidal conditions for the epl scenarios the frequency distributions of ld are overall symmetrical although now showing a tendency to be negatively skewed especially for the cases of st and nt caused by a higher frequency of days with low ld when cells start from deep layers when light at the surface is already high middle of the day in contrast in the case of nt st the distribution is more symmetrical as cell upward migration starts with sunrise and cells reach the surface when light still relatively low as before the frequency distributions for the epm scenarios are in all tidal cases very positively skewed due to a large fraction of days of no light exposure ld0 varying between 25 1 and 79 2 a novel type of distribution appears for the epm nt scenarios characterized by two large peaks one corresponding to days with very low or null light exposure as seen before and a second corresponding to the days when cells experience relevant light exposure in one of the two diurnal low tide periods 3 3 generalized effects of mixing depth and cell velocity while the previous results refer to particular values of zmix 0 5 and 2 mm and cell velocities 0 225 and 0 023 µm s 1 respectively for the epl and epm m scenarios the results presented in fig 9 expand the results of the simulations carried out for particular values of mixing depth and cell velocity shown above ld cvld ld0 and e ek were calculated for a large range of mixing depths 0 12 mm and cell velocities 0 113 0 459 µm s 1 in general terms the increase in z mix causes for the same cell velocity a decrease in ld and e ek fig 9a c and an increase in cvld and ld0 fig 9b d the decrease in ld and e ek and the increase in cvld and ld0 become less important as cell velocities increase in the case of ld fig 9a the effect of z mix is due to the fact that cells deposited in deeper layers tend to take more time to reach the photic zone thus decreasing the amount of time of exposure to high light levels however this effect tends to become less significant for faster cells as higher cell velocities may compensate for deeper z cell t 0 and make the cell depth at the start of the day less critical a similar situation occurs with e ek fig 9c the chances of exposure to supersaturating light decrease with the increase in mixing depth and cell velocity both contributing to lower the time spent in layers of sediment close to the surface when incident light is very high this overall pattern is however inverted for very low mixing depths in which case the cells are positioned close to the surface and the slower ones will be exposed to supersaturating light for longer periods the effects of mixing depth on the variability of the perceived light regime cvld fig 9b are directly due to the fact that higher z mix cause a larger distribution of z cell t0 values and thus of the variation in light received along the day as for ld this effect may be largely attenuated by an increase in cell velocity as faster cells will reach more quickly the same optimal light levels the increased variability in ld that follows the increase in z mix is also responsible for the dependence of ld0 fig 9d higher z mix increase the probability that cells are moved to deeper layers of the sediment taking more time to reach the photic zone during the course of the day again faster cells will tend to overcome this effect and experience a lower number of days without any light exposure 4 discussion 4 1 epipelic and epipsammic diatoms differ in their experienced light environment vertical migration has long been recognized to be an important aspect of microphytobenthos ecology admiraal 1984 macintyre et al 1996 underwood and kromkamp 1999 by enabling diatom cells to exploit the heterogeneities of the sedimentary microenvironment at the sub millimeter scale it contributes to enhance photosynthesis of the biofilm and the primary productivity of the intertidal flats at the ecosystem level pinckney and zingmark 1993 serôdio and catarino 2000 this study further shows that vertical migration can be expected to substantially affect the effective light environment experienced by motile diatoms both in terms of mean values and of variability of daily light dose received including the frequency of the exposure to supersaturating light levels and of prolonged darkness periods overall the results of the study confirm the common assumption that epipelic and epipsammic diatoms likely experience a significantly different light regime with motile epipelic diatoms effectively experiencing to a much less variable light environment with increased mean daily light doses when compared to immotile and slowly motile life forms due to their lack of motility to counteract their repositioning in the sediment column by external factors tide bioturbation epipsammic cells can be expected to undergo continuous periods of several consecutive days in the dark a situation unlikely to occur for epipelic species a key factor justifying the difference in results produced for the epl and epm scenarios is naturally cell velocity however cell velocity is only meaningful when considered in relation to the distances needed to be covered by cells to significantly change their light exposure within the photic zone or when starting from deeper layers to reach the photic zone by identifying and evaluating the relative importance of the various endogenous cell motility photoacclimation state and exogeneous light incident and attenuation factors this study highlights that what is critical for the effectiveness of motility in determining the light environment experienced by the cells is the relationship between cell velocity and the depths of the photic zone and of the mixing zone in the case of cells within the photic zone it is the relationship between v and k e that mostly determines the capacity to regulate light exposure a steeper light gradient higher light attenuation k e corresponds to a shallower photic zone and to shorter distances need to be covered by the cells to experience a significant change in received light inversely for the same light attenuation higher cell velocities enable cells to cover a larger range of light intensities in a short time high cell velocities also favor coping with high frequency variability in incident light such as due to passing clouds or sun flecks for submerged sites considering realistic combinations of values for v and k e this study shows that vertical migration by epipelic diatoms may be effective in helping cells regulate absorbed light supporting the hypothesis that diatom motility is a key functional trait with high adaptive value the effectiveness of vertical migration to regulate light exposure is benefited in the sedimentary environment since a linear vertical displacement is expected to correspond to an exponential variation in received light intensity laviale et al 2016 which may favor the detection and sensing of light gradients also the relationship between v and z mix appears crucial in conditioning the role of vertical migration in regulating experienced light when the mixing depth is deeper than the photic zone cells can be displaced to dark layers of the sediment in which case gravity driven motility is especially important to regain access to illuminated layers in this context cell velocity becomes critical to enable cells to escape the aphotic layers and reach the photic zone escape velocity as it determines the distance possible to cover before the next mixing event deeper mixing higher z mix especially if combined with a thin photic zone high k e requires higher cell velocities to compensate for the longer distance to cover as cell velocity is biologically limited to a certain maximum value deep mixing and high light attenuation conditions are expected to increase the inter day variability in light dose received and the frequency of days in permanent darkness 4 2 vertical migration constructs a light niche a major result of this study is that vertical migration does not only cause epipelic diatoms to experience higher mean light levels but also a substantially lower variability in the received light this result has an important ecological significance as it identifies cell motility as a form of counteracting the environmental stochasticity introduced by sediment mixing supporting its adaptive value in the sedimentary intertidal environment the reduction of experienced variability in light exposure appears especially relevant in the intertidal environment because it does not only contribute to avoid extreme light levels but also minimize the synergistic effects of high light in conjunction with other extreme conditions occurring during low tide such as desiccation coelho et al 2009 or extreme salinities or temperatures high or low frankenbach et al 2020 laviale et al 2015 the ecological significance of diatom motility can be further considered in the light of the niche construction theory being defined in generic terms as the effects of the activity of organisms on their environment the idea of niche construction is commonly associated to the modification of habitats by the behavior of animal species laland et al 1999 post and palkovacs 2009 the enhanced stability in light exposure conditions promoted by diatom vertical migration is defining of one of the expected consequences of niche construction which is the buffering of perceived environmental variability laland et al 2017 the behavioral regulation of light exposure can be thus seen as a niche construction activity as it results in the modification of the environment perceived by the cells making it more consistent and predictable and within a narrower range of favorable conditions in the case of motile diatoms however niche construction takes place not as in the more common sense of organisms modifying their environment but through the process of habitat selection also recognized as a mean by which organisms regulate the environment they experience clark et al 2020 it functions by the selection of a particular sub set of microhabitats from the range of available environments and is expected to increase the fitness of the organisms by promoting a match between their traits and the experienced environmental conditions edelaar and bolnick 2019 epipelic diatoms use light directed motility to select a limited range of light conditions characterized by high light and low variability that can thus be defined as a constructed light niche it may happen however that the selection of light conditions through vertical migration may result in the concurrent limitation of the range of exposure to other environmental factors that vary vertically in the sediment this is the case of oxygen and ph brotas et al 2003 cook and røy 2006 serôdio et al 2007 but also likely carbon and nutrients hochard et al 2010 vieira et al 2016 all directly affected by diatom photosynthetic activity and varying along the microscale of the photic zone of the sediment this may result in the construction of an ecological niche characterized not just by a limited set of light conditions but of other ecological factors 4 3 implications for productivity and photoacclimation the predictions of the model in relation to experienced average daily light dose and its variability also have implications regarding photosynthetic rates and productivity for the case of the epl scenario the consistent exposure of the cells to high light levels but not exceeding e k substantially or for prolonged periods is expected to result in higher hourly and daily photosynthetic rates of individual cells by predicting that motile cells spend most of their time under optimal light conditions around e k biofilm level primary productivity can thus be expected to be maximized in contrast non motile or slowly motile cells under the epm scenario the inability to optimize light exposure through vertical migration may be expected other things being equal to result in lower productivity rates these characteristics of the light environment are critical for determining the photosynthesis carried out at the pre defined photophysiological state of the cells however they may in turn be expected to have consequences back to the niche construction activity that cause them one major prediction of the niche construction theory is the possibility of a feedback loop between the modified environment and the organisms resulting in a self reinforced process laland et al 2017 one way through which this may occur is by a reduction in adaptive phenotypic plasticity of organisms involved in niche construction because of the reduction in perceived environmental variability functional traits associated to the modified environmental conditions are expected to show a reduced phenotypic variation edelaar and bolnick 2019 laland et al 2017 in the case of epipelic diatoms such a process can be expected to take place regarding photoacclimation involving the functional traits associated to the photophysiological use and response to changes in light intensity under the relatively invariable perceived light environment created because of vertical migration epipelic cells may have less need to change their photoacclimation state and because the selected light conditions are defined by their photoacclimation state in the first place this particular state will tend to be maintained through a self reinforcing feedback loop being able to select light levels of the sediment column that match the light levels to which they are acclimated their photoacclimation state will only be reinforced as no advantages come from changing it in contrast epipsammic diatoms are subjected to a much variable light environment in which case they may frequently undergo short term changes in photoacclimation state it is thus expectable that in comparison with the epipelic species epipsammic diatoms may be selected for a larger photoacclimation capacity another prediction of niche construction theory is that the feedback from niche construction activities and the environment may result in the reduction of the variability of the selective environmental gradients making natural selection more stable directed and consistent laland et al 2017 environment buffering niche construction may thus gain an adaptive nature modifying the selection for ecophysiological or behavioral traits and their associated gene frequencies clark et al 2020 in the case of epipelic diatoms niche construction through vertical migration could have adaptive consequences for example by reinforcing through the type of positive feedback described above the selection for traits that favor the match between photophysiological traits and the selected light microenvironment if vertical migration enables exposure to high light levels with the potential to promote higher photosynthetic rates and growth then the selection for traits that enable to cope with high light such as higher light saturated photosynthetic rates e g enhanced functioning of the calvin cycle or more efficient photoprotection e g more efficient xanthophyll cycle and photosystem ii repair may be expected to increase furthermore this may occur not just by the selection of traits that match the experienced environmental conditions but also by reinforcing systematic and directed natural selection for the functional traits that enable cells to reach those conditions considering that the constructed light regime promotes more stable and optimal conditions for photosynthesis and growth faster and more responsive species have an advantage over slower or immotile ones which can increase the evolutionary pressure for motility enhancing traits e g frustule and raphe morphology eps production and composition on the other hand living under more stable light conditions may decrease the capacity to deal with variable light further increasing the advantages in the ability to search for less variable light conditions again favoring the selection for higher cellular motility motility may be advantageous and likely selected for in fine sediments where the movement of cells between sediment particles is possible however in coarser sedimentary environments characterized by large interstitial spaces and low organic matter content favoring the attachment of cells to the sediment particles to avoid being washed away the selection for motility no longer exists and diatom communities are dominated by epipsammic non motile forms 4 4 model assumptions this study represents the first attempt to quantify how diatom motility affects their experienced light environment numerous studies have addressed the motility of diatoms but only a few provided estimates of distances covered by moving cells based on cell velocity serôdio 2021 to our knowledge none considered diatom motility in the context of the light gradients of the sediment photic zone in a quantitative manner likely due to the difficulty in studying experimentally cell light exposure in micrometer scale light gradients this study addressed this question by developing and running a model based on available ecological data allowing to construct realistic scenarios representative of the contrasting characteristics of epipelic and epipsammic diatom communities and their habitat nevertheless a number of assumptions had to be considered i the model was run only for a clear sky scenario not considering the common situation of passing clouds that would introduce a larger variability in the outputs of the model this option was made as the study was intended to focus on characteristics inherent to the sedimentary system to better investigate the differences between the epl and epm scenarios the use of natural time series of incident sunlight would obscure the underlying patterns resulting from the main factors under study ii the model assumed that during submersion by high tide no light is available to the diatoms even if at the surface of the sediment this is a common assumption daggers et al 2018 frankenbach et al 2020 serôdio and catarino 2000 justified by the high turbidity of shallow estuarine water and the downward migration away from surface of diatoms before tidal flood iii although the exponential vertical attenuation of light is supported by extensive experimental data the model did not consider two other factors that are expected to affect the light microenvironment available to the cells self shading due to light attenuation by other cells k e was assumed constant over depth and time and changes in light spectrum due to spectrally biased absorption by photosynthetic pigments this option was chosen for simplicity and because of the lack of detailed data however although there is evidence that coarser sediments may be more homogeneous and with less microalgal biomass than finer ones morelle et al 2020 the main conclusions of the study would likely not be substantially affected considering the very large differences observed between the epl and epm scenarios iv sediment mixing was modelled by considering a complete homogenization from surface to z mix the resulting uniform distribution between z 0 and z z mix and the discrete separation between the mixed and the unmixed regions below is certainly a major simplification but was justified for simplicity and by the lack of data nevertheless the assumption that the mixture depth is larger than the photic zone seems very plausible especially for fine sediments epl scenario considering the very thin photic zone also a deeper mixing depth for coarser sediments epm scenario is reasonable to expect considering that these sediments are less cohesive ubertini et al 2015 the existing uncertainty on the values for z mix was overcome by quantitatively comparing a wide range of mixing depths in combination with various cell velocities another assumption of this study was to consider mixing events for every day while it is conceivable that significant mixing events may not occur for several days and cells may stay at the same depth from one day to the next v cell velocity was modeled as a function of light intensity based on the assumption that cells behave independently of each other when it is conceivable that for dense biofilms cells closer to the surface will affect the light intensity and quality of the light reaching the cells positioned below self shading see above the model also did not consider the well studied differential light and spectral sensitivity of the regions of the same diatom cell cohn et al 2016 a factor that might help guide the cells in the heterogeneous light microenvironment formed within the sediment particles vi the responses of pennate diatoms to environmental factors are known to vary markedly between species species specific responses have been documented for factors relevant for the modeling of diatom photobehavior such as cell velocity bertrand 1990 cohn and weitzell 1996 du et al 2012 and the response to light intensity cohn et al 2004 2015 cohn and weitzell 1996 du et al 2012 and spectrum cohn and weitzell 1996 mclachlan et al 2009 while this study considered the effects of cell velocity by running the model for a wide range of values it did not address the effects of different light preferences both in terms of motility and photosynthesis nor consider how this diversity of responses might coexist in the same biofilm considering the large variation in the light response between species it is conceivable thar each species constructs its own light niche resulting in a species specific use of the light gradients the complexity introduced by species specific responses might even be augmented due to the fact that diatom motility responses can be modulated by the presence of cells of a second species cohn et al 2015 2003 5 conclusions the results of this study support the often assumed hypothesis that motility enables epipelic diatom forms to experience a significantly different light environment than their epipsammic counterparts considering realistic values for cell velocity light penetration and mixing depth the study shows that vertical migration may be expected to effectively enable epipelic diatoms to experience a much more stable light regime with higher daily light doses than non motile or slowly motile epipsammic forms these in turn can be expected to experience a light regime characterized by the exposure to supersaturating light levels and to prolonged periods of darkness the modeling approach here used allowed to identify the relationship between cell velocity and sediment light attenuation as the main factor determining the capacity of the diatom cells to behaviorally regulate light exposure these results have important ecological significance as they highlight the adaptive value of light driven motility as a form of counteracting the high variability of the estuarine intertidal environmental and as a niche construction activity allowing epipelic diatoms to regulate the environment they experience through a process of habitat selection credit authorship contribution statement joão serôdio

24209,diatoms are an extraordinarily diverse evolutionarily successful and ecologically important group of single cell algae diatoms of the group of the pennates are particularly important in estuarine sedimentary habitats where they form highly productive microphytobenthos communities that cover extensive areas of intertidal flats the pennates are capable of directed motility an evolutionary and unique trait amongst diatoms which has long been hypothesized to confer a critical adaptive advantage by enabling these cells to vertically migrate within the photic zone of the sediment and behaviorally regulate light exposure this study investigated the role of diatom motility on the active regulation of light exposure by developing a model to quantitatively characterize and compare the experienced light environment of individual cells of two life forms of pennate diatoms that inhabit intertidal estuarine sediments epipelic species motile cells dominant in fine sediments and epipsammic species non motile or slowly motile cells that colonize coarser sediments the conceptual framework of the model was based on the identification and parameterization of the main controlling factors of the light regime perceived by cells inhabiting the two types of sedimentary environments i solar irradiance incident at the sediment surface determined by the superimposition of the tidal cycle on the day night cycle ii light attenuation within the sediment iii sediment mixing by tidal currents or bioturbation repositioning the cells in the sediment column iv cell velocity as a function of light intensity and of the photoacclimation state of the cells that determines their photosynthetic light preferences the model was run for realistic scenarios based on published ecological photophysiological and cellular motility data light attenuation mixing depth photosynthesis light response curves cell velocity simulating i the variation in the vertical position of a diatom cell due to vertical migration and ii the irradiance level to which it is exposed at each moment the results confirm the hypothesis that epipelic and epipsammic diatoms experience a significantly different light environment vertical migration enables motile species to experience a much less variable light regime with increased mean daily light doses received in contrast non motile species experience a much more unstable light environment including the frequent exposure to supersaturating light levels and to periods of prolonged darkness these results have important ecological significance as they support the adaptive value of light driven motility as a form of optimizing photosynthesis and growth and they identify vertical migration as a niche construction

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction diatoms are single cell photoautotrophic eukaryotic microalgae renowned for their unique silica based cell walls ubiquitous in virtually all marine and freshwater habitats living in suspension in the water column or attached to substrata armbrust 2009 diatoms form an extremely diverse evolutionarily successful and ecologically important group of algae their photosynthesis captures 40 of the total carbon fixed by marine ecosystems the equivalent to 20 25 of the earth s global carbon fixation an amount comparable to that fixed by all the terrestrial rainforests combined field et al 1998 particularly in coastal and estuarine ecosystems the primary production carried out by diatoms represents a key source of carbon for trophic webs supporting a range of animal populations from small crustacean to commercially valuable fishes seabirds and marine mammals benoiston et al 2017 in estuaries and shallow coastal zones diatoms are the dominant group of primary producers both in the water column phytoplankton and in the sediment and other benthic habitats microphytobenthos diatoms are particularly important in sedimentary habitats where they largely dominate the microphytobenthic communities forming highly productive biofilms that cover extensive areas of intertidal flats or shallow subtidal sediments underwood and kromkamp 1999 the microphytobenthos plays key roles in the functioning of estuarine and coastal ecosystems hope et al 2019 its productivity ranks among the highest in marine ecosystems and in tidal estuaries it acts as a major carbon sink in some cases surpassing the ecosystem level primary production of the phytoplankton frankenbach et al 2020 it further mediates nutrient cycling hochard et al 2010 and the fluxes across the water air sediment interface eyre et al 2011 promotes sediment biostabilization paterson et al 2018 and through resuspension to the water column contributes to the planktonic primary productivity brito et al 2012 the diatom species that form sedimentary microphytobenthic communities belong predominantly to the group of the raphid pennate diatoms simultaneously the most evolutionarily recent having appeared only ca 30 million years ago and presently the largest group of diatoms armbrust 2009 kooistra et al 2007 in contrast with their planktonic ancestors raphid pennates are capable of directed motility a unique trait amongst diatoms made possible by the appearance of the raphe a longitudinal thin and long slit through the surface of the cell wall nakov et al 2018 most commonly diatoms move through gliding a form of locomotion consisting in movements parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cell when in close contact with hard surfaces and involving the adhesive extrusion of mucilaginous extracellular polymeric substances through the raphe edgar and pickett heaps 1984 directed motility has been hypothesized to have conferred a critical adaptive advantage to pennate diatoms explaining their evolutionary success and their fast evolution cohn et al 2015 nakov et al 2018 it is seen as a key adaptation to the sedimentary environment allowing cells to colonize new niches and to rapidly respond to environmental physical and chemical microgradients uv and visible light gravity temperature salinity desiccation ph nutrients carbon and pheromones and to actively exploit resource heterogeneity while avoiding unfavorable regions of the microhabitat serôdio 2021 in sedimentary microphytobenthos diatom motility is mostly manifested by the synchronized vertical movement of massive numbers of cells to and from the surface of the sediment coelho et al 2011 palmer and round 1967 vertical migration follows well defined patterns including the upward movement towards the surface at the beginning of daytime periods of low tide followed by the downward migration in anticipation of tidal flood or night consalvey et al 2004 serôdio 2021 this vertical migratory behavior is considered as a critical trait and a key adaptation to the sedimentary environment as it affects several aspects of the biology and ecology of sediment inhabiting pennate diatoms serôdio et al 2001 it regulates and enhances photosynthetic activity and carbon assimilation determines nutrient uptake and sexual reproduction saburova and polikarpov 2003 and is controlled by an endogenous biological clock palmer and round 1967 a longstanding idea is that raphid pennates use vertical migration to adjust their vertical position in the sediment to regulate light exposure admiraal 1984 serôdio et al 2001 in the nutrient rich conditions of estuarine sediments light is argued to be the most important limiting factor for photosynthesis and growth and the ability to regulate light exposure is key to cope with the conditions of the intertidal sedimentary environment due to the strong light attenuation in sediments and to the frequent remixing of the sediment by tidal currents and bioturbation diatom cells may be displaced to deep layers where light levels are too low to support growth or be directly exposed to sunlight at the surface frankenbach et al 2019 morelle et al 2021 on the other hand diatoms can be deposited at the surface where exposure to high light levels can cause photoinhibition a major factor limiting of photosynthesis raven 2011 especially if exacerbated by the stressful conditions common in the intertidal environment laviale et al 2015 in this context vertical migration has been hypothesized to confer the two fold possibility of avoiding dark or low light regions of the sediment and of escaping photoinhibitory light levels near the surface overall optimizing photosynthesis and growth admiraal 1984 consalvey et al 2004 this behavioral photoprotection hypothesis is supported by diverse experimental evidence frankenbach et al 2018 strong support comes from the observation that vertical migration is regulated by light intensity following a well defined biphasic light response pattern comprising upward migration under low light positive phototaxis and downward migration under high light negative phototaxis with the rate of descend depending on light intensity du et al 2010 laviale et al 2016 serôdio et al 2006 further evidence supporting that vertical migration may be effective in regulating light exposure comes from the comparable scales of the photic zone of the sediment 500 µm cartaxana et al 2011 kromkamp et al 1998 serôdio et al 2001 and of the size of most pennate diatom cells 10 70 µm jesus et al 2009 considering the velocities attainable by pennate diatom cells it appears plausible that vertical migration can be fast enough to allow cells to traverse the whole photic zone corresponding a few cell lengths in a short period cohn et al 2015 consalvey et al 2004 serôdio et al 2001 the role of motility on the physiology and productivity of microphytobenthos communities has been often addressed by the comparative study of two life forms of pennate diatom species taxonomically closely related and occurring virtually sympatrically e g same tidal flat of the same estuary but with distinct motility capacity ribeiro 2000 sabbe 1997 epipelic forms motile species dominant in fine sediments where they glide freely between the sediment particles and epipsammic non motile or slowly motile species inhabiting coarser sediments where they live attached to sediment particles barnett et al 2015 cartaxana et al 2011 frankenbach et al 2018 jesus et al 2009 juneau et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2013 the rationale underlying the comparative study of epipelic and epipsammic forms is the assumption that motility determines not only the light levels to which the cells are exposed but also and critically the variability of the light regime experienced by the two types of life forms in their corresponding sedimentary habitats having the capacity to adjust their position along the vertical light gradient as incident light changes across the day epipelic cells are expected to experience a less variable light environment than epipsammic ones not able to move these cells will be exposed to whatever light levels reach the depths where they happen to be located experiencing a much more variable and possibly extreme light environment barnett et al 2015 this assumption although seeming plausible has not been verified and to our knowledge no attempts have been made to quantify the consequences of motility on the light regime perceived by sediment inhabiting diatoms the migratory behavior of diatoms has been the subject of modeling studies but not explicitly considering the control by light cao et al 2013 marques da silva et al 2020 the present study addresses this question by developing a model to quantify the effects of diatom motility on the experienced light exposure of individual cells inhabiting intertidal estuarine sediments the general conceptual framework of the model is based on the main controlling factors of the light regime to which cells inhabiting a intertidal sedimentary environment are exposed to i solar irradiance incident at the sediment surface considering the interference of the tidal cycle on the day night cycle ii light attenuation withing the sediment dependent on its granulometry iii sediment mixing due to tidal currents or bioturbation iv diatom cell velocity as a function of light intensity and time of day numerical simulations were run for realistic scenarios based on published ecological photophysiological and cellular motility data in order to characterize and compare the light environment perceived by epipelic motile and epipsammic immotile and slowly motile life forms both in terms of mean hourly and daily light dose received and of its variability across hourly and daily time scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptualization the model developed in this study aimed to quantify the effects of diatom motility on the experienced light exposure of individual cells inhabiting intertidal estuarine sediments effects of cellular directed motility were addressed by modeling two main contrasting scenarios diatom communities dominated by motile epipelic species colonizing fine sediments thereafter referred to as epl table 1 and diatom communities dominated by slowly motile or immotile epipsammic species thereafter referred to as epm conceptually the model considered four main factors forcing the exposure of cells to light fig 1 i variation of solar irradiance incident at surface of the sediment parameterized as e 0 t which was considered identical for the epl and the epm scenarios fig 1a b ii light attenuation within the sediment determining the vertical distribution of light and the depth of the sedimentary photic zone parameterized by the attenuation coefficient k e in sediments composed by finer particles epipelic

observations and ecological data collected over almost two decades on epipelic and epipsammic communities and their sedimentary habitats on two intertidal sites of the ria de aveiro a tidal estuarine ecosystem in the west coast of portugal bueno pardo et al 2018 these data include table 2 hourly variation of solar irradiance and semi lunar variation of tidal exposure frankenbach et al 2020 serôdio

response frankenbach et al 2018 serôdio et al 2007 epipelic and epipsammic species composition frankenbach et al 2018 serôdio et al 2007 and diatom photobehavior namely light induced and endogenously controlled vertical migration coelho et al 2011 laviale et al 2016 serôdio et al 2006 the exceptions refer to data on diatom velocity light response that were based on published data concerning diatoms grown in culture cohn et al 2003 consalvey et al 2004 mclachlan et al 2009 serôdio 2021 as most observations refer to the same epipelic and epipsammic communities and habitats within the same ecosystem the model parameters were validated by a consistent and coherent data set 2 3 model outline in summary the model simulates i the changes in the vertical position depth below the sediment surface of a diatom cell due to vertical migration during the course of the diurnal low tide periods occurring for one day and ii the irradiance level to which it is exposed at each moment at the beginning of each light period the cell depth is reset being determined by a random value within the mixing zone simulating the effects of tidal currents and bioturbation the velocity magnitude and vertical direction of the cell at each depth is determined by the light available at that depth and on the cell s photosynthetic light preferences by running the model for multiple days see below the light regime perceived by the cells can be characterized both in terms of location and of variability in the daily light dose received the modeling workflow is summarized in fig 3 to assess the impact of cellular motility on the perceived light regime the model was run for various scenarios firstly using realistic parameter values for epipelic epipsammic motile epm m scenario and epipsammic non motile epm nm scenario communities and their sedimentary habitat table 2 secondly by systematically varying the parameters characterizing cell velocity and mixing depth to evaluate the relative impact of these main factors 2 3 1 solar irradiance at surface the hourly variation of irradiance incident at the surface of the sediment e 0 t was simulated by a gaussian curve guo 2017 1 e 0 t e m e t t n 2 c where t n is the time of solar noon e m is the maximum irradiance occurring when t t n and c is the steepness of the curve measuring the rate of change of instantaneous solar irradiance over time for simplicity the values of e m and t n corresponding to the solar zenith were set to 2000 µmol quanta m 2 s 1 and 12 00 respectively fig 2 and c was estimated from fitted eqn 1 to in situ data measured in the ria de aveiro during a clear sky summer day serôdio et al 2008 the semi lunar variation of available light associated to the progression of the tide from one day to the next was considered by simulating four different scenarios approximately as observed in the ria de aveiro serôdio et al 2008 2007 low tide in the middle of the day occurring during spring tides st high tide in the middle of the day and low tide during the morning and afternoon occurring during neap tides nt intermediate situations st nt and nt st fig 2 for each of these scenarios it was assumed that no light is available for the cells during high tide periods either due to submersion in turbid water or due to downward vertical migration during submersion 2 3 2 light attenuation in the sediment the vertical variation of light available within the photic zone of the sediment at each moment of the day e z t was described by an negative exponential function based on irradiance data measured with detailed sub millimeter vertical resolution on two types of sediment of the ria de aveiro colonized by epipelic and epipsammic diatom communities frankenbach et al 2020 light penetration was quantified by the light attenuation coefficient k e which was higher for the epl scenario finer sediment k e 9 0 mm 1 table 2 and lower for the epm scenario coarser sediment k e 6 1 mm 1 to calculate the light available at the cell depth e zcell t 2 e z c e l l t e 0 t e k e z c e l l it was assumed that light attenuation was constant over time and not affected by cell self shading 2 2 3 sediment mixing to simulate the effects of the mixing of the upper layers of the sediment by tidal currents especially during ebb and flood or due to bioturbation during high tide cover the vertical position of the cell was newly defined at set at the start of each new low tide light period due to the lack of data on the impact of sediment mixing on the redistribution of cells with depth this process was modelled by attributing to z cell a random value between z 0 and z z mix for each mixing event it was assumed a complete homogenization of the sediment across the whole mixing zone meaning that all depths between 0 and z mix were equally probable for defining z cell uniform distribution because fine sediments colonized by epipelic diatoms tend to be much more cohesive then the coarser sediments colonized by epipsammic diatoms ubertini et al 2015 z mix was considered to be smaller for the former zmix 2 mm than for the later zmix 10 mm fig 1c d table 2 2 2 4 cell light preferences and photoacclimation state a key feature of this model is the explicit dependency of cell behavior velocity and vertical direction on light intensity however the motility response of the cells is not considered to depend on light levels per se but on the light levels when compared to the cell light preferences determined by its photosynthetic light response see below the rationale is that cells will migrate vertically trying to optimize photosynthesis avoiding dark or limiting light levels as well as super saturating intensities the range of intensities that are considered too low and too high is determined by the photoacclimation state of the cells typically characterized by light response curves of photosynthesis and in particular by the light acclimation parameter e k ezequiel et al 2015 here the model used data referring to light response curves of retr the relative electron transport rate of photosystem ii psii an established proxy of diatom photosynthetic rates barranguet and kromkamp 2000 morelle and claquin 2018 serôdio et al 2007 measured on epipelic and epipsammic communities of the ria de aveiro frankenbach et al 2018 table 2 fig 4 a the light response curves of retr were characterized by the initial slope of the curve α the maximum retr level retrm and e k 2 2 5 cell velocity the variation of cell velocity with depth and light intensity was modelled to ensure i a light dependency functionally identical to the relationship experimentally documented by mclachlan et al 2009 and ii positive velocity upward migration for light limiting levels e e k and negative velocity downward migration for super saturating levels e e k the variation of cell velocity as a function of light v e was based on the normalized rate of variation of retr with e δretr δe 3 v e v m δ r e t r δ e e δ r e t r δ e e k max δ r e t r δ e e where v m is the maximum cell velocity to ensure that v e 0 for e e k normalization was done separately for e e k and e e k the relationship between cell velocity with light intensity and the photosynthetic light response retr vs e curves is shown in fig 4 eq 3 displays the main features of the observations of mclachlan et al 2009 i cell velocity decreases with light intensity with maximum velocity being observed for very low light or dark ii under low light cells move towards the light source and under high light they move away from light eq 3 was applied to the epl and epm m scenarios while for the epm nm scenario cell velocity was considered as zero for epipelic cells the value of v m was considered as the mean value of published vertical diatom gliding speeds compiled in serôdio 2021 table 2 considering the inexistence of data for cell velocity of epipsammic motile diatoms v m was defined as 10 times smaller than the values for used for the epipelic the cell position at each new time t i 1 δt t i 1 t i was calculated from cell velocity and the depth at the previous time t i 4 z c e l l t i 1 z c e l l t i v e z c e l l δ t the model also considers another well known and critical aspect of the motility behavior of sediment inhabiting pennate diatoms the endogenously controlled gravity driven and light independent vertical migration before the start upward migration before sunrise or before end of high tide cover and the end downward migration before sunset or incoming high tide of light exposure periods based on detailed data for the epipelic communities of the ria de aveiro coelho et al 2011 frankenbach et al 2014 the model considers that cells start migrating upwards 30 min before start of diurnal low tide periods and start migrating downwards 30 min before high tide and 2 h before sunset if during low tide fig 2 the model also considers another important feature of diatom gliding the reversal autonomous rhythm wenderoth and rhiel 2004 which consists in the continuous back and forth movement of the cells causing directed progression to depend on the relative time between reversal of the direction of the movement serôdio 2021 this aspect was included in the model by considering cell velocity to be given by a random number from a normal distribution with mean v e t and standard deviation σv e t based on the observations of cohn et al 2003 σv was set to 10 of the value of v table 2 2 2 6 model implementation and outputs for each day the model was run with a time step δt 5 min computing the total daily light dose to which the cell is exposed ld given by the cumulative product of incident light at depth z cell and the time step 5 l d t i e z c e l l t i δ t and the exposure to excess light e ek given by the number of hours that the cells were expose to e e k for each scenario the model was run for 1000 days to obtain a frequency distribution of ld which was characterized in terms of central tendency mean ld ld and dispersion coefficient of variability of ld cvld as well as the proportion of days the cells did not receive any light ld0 table 3 3 results 3 1 general comparison between epl and epm scenarios fig 5 illustrates individual runs of the model showing the trajectories of cells starting from two depths 0 5 and 2 0 mm for the three scenarios epl epm m and epm nm considering a full photoperiod not interrupted by submersion by high tide epipelic cells are fast enough to be able to reach the photic zone during the early parts of the day fig 5d cells starting at the deeper layer z cell 2 0 mm reach the uppers layers of the sediment only 2 3 h later although not compromising the exposure to high light levels for most of the day fig 5a it is noticeable a slight downward migration during the middle of the day when solar irradiance incident the surface and upper layers attains supersaturating levels in the epm m scenario the slower cell velocity implies that only cells starting at shallower depths are able to reach the photic zone during the course of the day fig 5b e cells starting at deeper layers as in the example of z cell 2 0 mm may only reach the lower regions of the photic zone and be exposed for very low light levels fig 5b in contrast the light exposure of immotile cells epm nm scenario is completely dependent on the depth where cells are deposited fig 5c f non motile epipsammic cells that happen to be close enough to the surface e g z cell 0 5 mm may be exposed to relevant light levels although not being able to explore the light gradient and regulate light exposure non motile cells may stay all day under low light limiting levels or on the contrary experience supersaturating light levels cases not shown fig 5 also illustrates the endogenously controlled behavior of epipelic cells and to a lesser extent also motile epipsammic cells reflected in upward migration before sunrise and downward migration before the end of the light period running the model for a large number of days 1000 allowed to compare the three scenarios regarding the light regime perceived by the cells characterized in terms of mean values and variability of received daily light dose fig 6 the most evident result is the clear difference between epl and both epm scenarios with the former showing a much higher mean and a lower variability in ld values indicating how cell motility effectively contributes to lower the inter day variability in experienced daily light dose for the epl scenario ld reached around 335 mmol quanta m 2 and a cvld was below 3 fig 6b while for the epm scenarios ld remained below 52 mmol quanta m 2 and cvld reached much higher values above 217 and 364 for epm m and epm nm respectively fig 6d f also significant is the difference in the shape of the frequency distribution of ld very symmetrical in the epl scenario while highly positively skewed in epm with a large proportion of days with very low of no light received by the cells fig 6d f in contrast with the epl scenario for which cells are exposed to light in all simulated days in the epm scenarios cells are expected to experience continuous darkness for the majority of the days ld0 around 60 and 70 for epm m and epm nm respectively 3 2 variation along the spring neap tidal cycle figs 5 and 6 served to illustrate the main features of the model and to exemplify a situation with no changes in light availability associated to the interference of submersion in high tide as would occur for example in shallow subtidal habitats the inclusion in the model of tidal submersion periods and their progression along the day during the spring neap cycle confirmed the main overall differences between the epl and epm scenarios described above but also revealed a larger complexity and diversity in the perceived light regime fig 7 shows examples of epipelic cell trajectories for the four scenarios of tidal submersion described above a common aspect of all cases contrasting with the previous simulations fig 5 6 is the shorter periods of light exposure the most extreme situation being the case of neap tides nt when diurnal low tide is restricted to early morning and late afternoon fig 7c g the effective period of light exposure is even shorter as cells take some time to reach the photic zone during the beginning of the light periods and migrate downwards before high tide or night as a consequence when light period starts at middle of the day st st nt cells may reach the photic zone later than in days when exposure periods start before sunrise nt st these aspects become more apparent when running the model for multiple days fig 8 as seen for the case of no tidal interference the consideration of tides also led to much higher ld values and much lower cvld for the epl than for the epms scenarios for all tidal conditions for the epl scenarios the frequency distributions of ld are overall symmetrical although now showing a tendency to be negatively skewed especially for the cases of st and nt caused by a higher frequency of days with low ld when cells start from deep layers when light at the surface is already high middle of the day in contrast in the case of nt st the distribution is more symmetrical as cell upward migration starts with sunrise and cells reach the surface when light still relatively low as before the frequency distributions for the epm scenarios are in all tidal cases very positively skewed due to a large fraction of days of no light exposure ld0 varying between 25 1 and 79 2 a novel type of distribution appears for the epm nt scenarios characterized by two large peaks one corresponding to days with very low or null light exposure as seen before and a second corresponding to the days when cells experience relevant light exposure in one of the two diurnal low tide periods 3 3 generalized effects of mixing depth and cell velocity while the previous results refer to particular values of zmix 0 5 and 2 mm and cell velocities 0 225 and 0 023 µm s 1 respectively for the epl and epm m scenarios the results presented in fig 9 expand the results of the simulations carried out for particular values of mixing depth and cell velocity shown above ld cvld ld0 and e ek were calculated for a large range of mixing depths 0 12 mm and cell velocities 0 113 0 459 µm s 1 in general terms the increase in z mix causes for the same cell velocity a decrease in ld and e ek fig 9a c and an increase in cvld and ld0 fig 9b d the decrease in ld and e ek and the increase in cvld and ld0 become less important as cell velocities increase in the case of ld fig 9a the effect of z mix is due to the fact that cells deposited in deeper layers tend to take more time to reach the photic zone thus decreasing the amount of time of exposure to high light levels however this effect tends to become less significant for faster cells as higher cell velocities may compensate for deeper z cell t 0 and make the cell depth at the start of the day less critical a similar situation occurs with e ek fig 9c the chances of exposure to supersaturating light decrease with the increase in mixing depth and cell velocity both contributing to lower the time spent in layers of sediment close to the surface when incident light is very high this overall pattern is however inverted for very low mixing depths in which case the cells are positioned close to the surface and the slower ones will be exposed to supersaturating light for longer periods the effects of mixing depth on the variability of the perceived light regime cvld fig 9b are directly due to the fact that higher z mix cause a larger distribution of z cell t0 values and thus of the variation in light received along the day as for ld this effect may be largely attenuated by an increase in cell velocity as faster cells will reach more quickly the same optimal light levels the increased variability in ld that follows the increase in z mix is also responsible for the dependence of ld0 fig 9d higher z mix increase the probability that cells are moved to deeper layers of the sediment taking more time to reach the photic zone during the course of the day again faster cells will tend to overcome this effect and experience a lower number of days without any light exposure 4 discussion 4 1 epipelic and epipsammic diatoms differ in their experienced light environment vertical migration has long been recognized to be an important aspect of microphytobenthos ecology admiraal 1984 macintyre et al 1996 underwood and kromkamp 1999 by enabling diatom cells to exploit the heterogeneities of the sedimentary microenvironment at the sub millimeter scale it contributes to enhance photosynthesis of the biofilm and the primary productivity of the intertidal flats at the ecosystem level pinckney and zingmark 1993 serôdio and catarino 2000 this study further shows that vertical migration can be expected to substantially affect the effective light environment experienced by motile diatoms both in terms of mean values and of variability of daily light dose received including the frequency of the exposure to supersaturating light levels and of prolonged darkness periods overall the results of the study confirm the common assumption that epipelic and epipsammic diatoms likely experience a significantly different light regime with motile epipelic diatoms effectively experiencing to a much less variable light environment with increased mean daily light doses when compared to immotile and slowly motile life forms due to their lack of motility to counteract their repositioning in the sediment column by external factors tide bioturbation epipsammic cells can be expected to undergo continuous periods of several consecutive days in the dark a situation unlikely to occur for epipelic species a key factor justifying the difference in results produced for the epl and epm scenarios is naturally cell velocity however cell velocity is only meaningful when considered in relation to the distances needed to be covered by cells to significantly change their light exposure within the photic zone or when starting from deeper layers to reach the photic zone by identifying and evaluating the relative importance of the various endogenous cell motility photoacclimation state and exogeneous light incident and attenuation factors this study highlights that what is critical for the effectiveness of motility in determining the light environment experienced by the cells is the relationship between cell velocity and the depths of the photic zone and of the mixing zone in the case of cells within the photic zone it is the relationship between v and k e that mostly determines the capacity to regulate light exposure a steeper light gradient higher light attenuation k e corresponds to a shallower photic zone and to shorter distances need to be covered by the cells to experience a significant change in received light inversely for the same light attenuation higher cell velocities enable cells to cover a larger range of light intensities in a short time high cell velocities also favor coping with high frequency variability in incident light such as due to passing clouds or sun flecks for submerged sites considering realistic combinations of values for v and k e this study shows that vertical migration by epipelic diatoms may be effective in helping cells regulate absorbed light supporting the hypothesis that diatom motility is a key functional trait with high adaptive value the effectiveness of vertical migration to regulate light exposure is benefited in the sedimentary environment since a linear vertical displacement is expected to correspond to an exponential variation in received light intensity laviale et al 2016 which may favor the detection and sensing of light gradients also the relationship between v and z mix appears crucial in conditioning the role of vertical migration in regulating experienced light when the mixing depth is deeper than the photic zone cells can be displaced to dark layers of the sediment in which case gravity driven motility is especially important to regain access to illuminated layers in this context cell velocity becomes critical to enable cells to escape the aphotic layers and reach the photic zone escape velocity as it determines the distance possible to cover before the next mixing event deeper mixing higher z mix especially if combined with a thin photic zone high k e requires higher cell velocities to compensate for the longer distance to cover as cell velocity is biologically limited to a certain maximum value deep mixing and high light attenuation conditions are expected to increase the inter day variability in light dose received and the frequency of days in permanent darkness 4 2 vertical migration constructs a light niche a major result of this study is that vertical migration does not only cause epipelic diatoms to experience higher mean light levels but also a substantially lower variability in the received light this result has an important ecological significance as it identifies cell motility as a form of counteracting the environmental stochasticity introduced by sediment mixing supporting its adaptive value in the sedimentary intertidal environment the reduction of experienced variability in light exposure appears especially relevant in the intertidal environment because it does not only contribute to avoid extreme light levels but also minimize the synergistic effects of high light in conjunction with other extreme conditions occurring during low tide such as desiccation coelho et al 2009 or extreme salinities or temperatures high or low frankenbach et al 2020 laviale et al 2015 the ecological significance of diatom motility can be further considered in the light of the niche construction theory being defined in generic terms as the effects of the activity of organisms on their environment the idea of niche construction is commonly associated to the modification of habitats by the behavior of animal species laland et al 1999 post and palkovacs 2009 the enhanced stability in light exposure conditions promoted by diatom vertical migration is defining of one of the expected consequences of niche construction which is the buffering of perceived environmental variability laland et al 2017 the behavioral regulation of light exposure can be thus seen as a niche construction activity as it results in the modification of the environment perceived by the cells making it more consistent and predictable and within a narrower range of favorable conditions in the case of motile diatoms however niche construction takes place not as in the more common sense of organisms modifying their environment but through the process of habitat selection also recognized as a mean by which organisms regulate the environment they experience clark et al 2020 it functions by the selection of a particular sub set of microhabitats from the range of available environments and is expected to increase the fitness of the organisms by promoting a match between their traits and the experienced environmental conditions edelaar and bolnick 2019 epipelic diatoms use light directed motility to select a limited range of light conditions characterized by high light and low variability that can thus be defined as a constructed light niche it may happen however that the selection of light conditions through vertical migration may result in the concurrent limitation of the range of exposure to other environmental factors that vary vertically in the sediment this is the case of oxygen and ph brotas et al 2003 cook and røy 2006 serôdio et al 2007 but also likely carbon and nutrients hochard et al 2010 vieira et al 2016 all directly affected by diatom photosynthetic activity and varying along the microscale of the photic zone of the sediment this may result in the construction of an ecological niche characterized not just by a limited set of light conditions but of other ecological factors 4 3 implications for productivity and photoacclimation the predictions of the model in relation to experienced average daily light dose and its variability also have implications regarding photosynthetic rates and productivity for the case of the epl scenario the consistent exposure of the cells to high light levels but not exceeding e k substantially or for prolonged periods is expected to result in higher hourly and daily photosynthetic rates of individual cells by predicting that motile cells spend most of their time under optimal light conditions around e k biofilm level primary productivity can thus be expected to be maximized in contrast non motile or slowly motile cells under the epm scenario the inability to optimize light exposure through vertical migration may be expected other things being equal to result in lower productivity rates these characteristics of the light environment are critical for determining the photosynthesis carried out at the pre defined photophysiological state of the cells however they may in turn be expected to have consequences back to the niche construction activity that cause them one major prediction of the niche construction theory is the possibility of a feedback loop between the modified environment and the organisms resulting in a self reinforced process laland et al 2017 one way through which this may occur is by a reduction in adaptive phenotypic plasticity of organisms involved in niche construction because of the reduction in perceived environmental variability functional traits associated to the modified environmental conditions are expected to show a reduced phenotypic variation edelaar and bolnick 2019 laland et al 2017 in the case of epipelic diatoms such a process can be expected to take place regarding photoacclimation involving the functional traits associated to the photophysiological use and response to changes in light intensity under the relatively invariable perceived light environment created because of vertical migration epipelic cells may have less need to change their photoacclimation state and because the selected light conditions are defined by their photoacclimation state in the first place this particular state will tend to be maintained through a self reinforcing feedback loop being able to select light levels of the sediment column that match the light levels to which they are acclimated their photoacclimation state will only be reinforced as no advantages come from changing it in contrast epipsammic diatoms are subjected to a much variable light environment in which case they may frequently undergo short term changes in photoacclimation state it is thus expectable that in comparison with the epipelic species epipsammic diatoms may be selected for a larger photoacclimation capacity another prediction of niche construction theory is that the feedback from niche construction activities and the environment may result in the reduction of the variability of the selective environmental gradients making natural selection more stable directed and consistent laland et al 2017 environment buffering niche construction may thus gain an adaptive nature modifying the selection for ecophysiological or behavioral traits and their associated gene frequencies clark et al 2020 in the case of epipelic diatoms niche construction through vertical migration could have adaptive consequences for example by reinforcing through the type of positive feedback described above the selection for traits that favor the match between photophysiological traits and the selected light microenvironment if vertical migration enables exposure to high light levels with the potential to promote higher photosynthetic rates and growth then the selection for traits that enable to cope with high light such as higher light saturated photosynthetic rates e g enhanced functioning of the calvin cycle or more efficient photoprotection e g more efficient xanthophyll cycle and photosystem ii repair may be expected to increase furthermore this may occur not just by the selection of traits that match the experienced environmental conditions but also by reinforcing systematic and directed natural selection for the functional traits that enable cells to reach those conditions considering that the constructed light regime promotes more stable and optimal conditions for photosynthesis and growth faster and more responsive species have an advantage over slower or immotile ones which can increase the evolutionary pressure for motility enhancing traits e g frustule and raphe morphology eps production and composition on the other hand living under more stable light conditions may decrease the capacity to deal with variable light further increasing the advantages in the ability to search for less variable light conditions again favoring the selection for higher cellular motility motility may be advantageous and likely selected for in fine sediments where the movement of cells between sediment particles is possible however in coarser sedimentary environments characterized by large interstitial spaces and low organic matter content favoring the attachment of cells to the sediment particles to avoid being washed away the selection for motility no longer exists and diatom communities are dominated by epipsammic non motile forms 4 4 model assumptions this study represents the first attempt to quantify how diatom motility affects their experienced light environment numerous studies have addressed the motility of diatoms but only a few provided estimates of distances covered by moving cells based on cell velocity serôdio 2021 to our knowledge none considered diatom motility in the context of the light gradients of the sediment photic zone in a quantitative manner likely due to the difficulty in studying experimentally cell light exposure in micrometer scale light gradients this study addressed this question by developing and running a model based on available ecological data allowing to construct realistic scenarios representative of the contrasting characteristics of epipelic and epipsammic diatom communities and their habitat nevertheless a number of assumptions had to be considered i the model was run only for a clear sky scenario not considering the common situation of passing clouds that would introduce a larger variability in the outputs of the model this option was made as the study was intended to focus on characteristics inherent to the sedimentary system to better investigate the differences between the epl and epm scenarios the use of natural time series of incident sunlight would obscure the underlying patterns resulting from the main factors under study ii the model assumed that during submersion by high tide no light is available to the diatoms even if at the surface of the sediment this is a common assumption daggers et al 2018 frankenbach et al 2020 serôdio and catarino 2000 justified by the high turbidity of shallow estuarine water and the downward migration away from surface of diatoms before tidal flood iii although the exponential vertical attenuation of light is supported by extensive experimental data the model did not consider two other factors that are expected to affect the light microenvironment available to the cells self shading due to light attenuation by other cells k e was assumed constant over depth and time and changes in light spectrum due to spectrally biased absorption by photosynthetic pigments this option was chosen for simplicity and because of the lack of detailed data however although there is evidence that coarser sediments may be more homogeneous and with less microalgal biomass than finer ones morelle et al 2020 the main conclusions of the study would likely not be substantially affected considering the very large differences observed between the epl and epm scenarios iv sediment mixing was modelled by considering a complete homogenization from surface to z mix the resulting uniform distribution between z 0 and z z mix and the discrete separation between the mixed and the unmixed regions below is certainly a major simplification but was justified for simplicity and by the lack of data nevertheless the assumption that the mixture depth is larger than the photic zone seems very plausible especially for fine sediments epl scenario considering the very thin photic zone also a deeper mixing depth for coarser sediments epm scenario is reasonable to expect considering that these sediments are less cohesive ubertini et al 2015 the existing uncertainty on the values for z mix was overcome by quantitatively comparing a wide range of mixing depths in combination with various cell velocities another assumption of this study was to consider mixing events for every day while it is conceivable that significant mixing events may not occur for several days and cells may stay at the same depth from one day to the next v cell velocity was modeled as a function of light intensity based on the assumption that cells behave independently of each other when it is conceivable that for dense biofilms cells closer to the surface will affect the light intensity and quality of the light reaching the cells positioned below self shading see above the model also did not consider the well studied differential light and spectral sensitivity of the regions of the same diatom cell cohn et al 2016 a factor that might help guide the cells in the heterogeneous light microenvironment formed within the sediment particles vi the responses of pennate diatoms to environmental factors are known to vary markedly between species species specific responses have been documented for factors relevant for the modeling of diatom photobehavior such as cell velocity bertrand 1990 cohn and weitzell 1996 du et al 2012 and the response to light intensity cohn et al 2004 2015 cohn and weitzell 1996 du et al 2012 and spectrum cohn and weitzell 1996 mclachlan et al 2009 while this study considered the effects of cell velocity by running the model for a wide range of values it did not address the effects of different light preferences both in terms of motility and photosynthesis nor consider how this diversity of responses might coexist in the same biofilm considering the large variation in the light response between species it is conceivable thar each species constructs its own light niche resulting in a species specific use of the light gradients the complexity introduced by species specific responses might even be augmented due to the fact that diatom motility responses can be modulated by the presence of cells of a second species cohn et al 2015 2003 5 conclusions the results of this study support the often assumed hypothesis that motility enables epipelic diatom forms to experience a significantly different light environment than their epipsammic counterparts considering realistic values for cell velocity light penetration and mixing depth the study shows that vertical migration may be expected to effectively enable epipelic diatoms to experience a much more stable light regime with higher daily light doses than non motile or slowly motile epipsammic forms these in turn can be expected to experience a light regime characterized by the exposure to supersaturating light levels and to prolonged periods of darkness the modeling approach here used allowed to identify the relationship between cell velocity and sediment light attenuation as the main factor determining the capacity of the diatom cells to behaviorally regulate light exposure these results have important ecological significance as they highlight the adaptive value of light driven motility as a form of counteracting the high variability of the estuarine intertidal environmental and as a niche construction activity allowing epipelic diatoms to regulate the environment they experience through a process of habitat selection credit authorship contribution statement joão serôdio
