14845,in the present study a single well push pull swpp test was conducted with multi component tracers including inert gas sf6 and kr and uranine conservative to understand the volatile semi volatile component transport characteristics in the groundwater system in an swpp test it is essential to obtain an initial breakthrough curve btc of the inert gas concentration at the beginning of the pulling stage to analyze the hydraulic properties of the groundwater system as a result of the swpp test using a proposed method in this study physicochemical parameters of the groundwater and btc of gas tracers and uranine were acquired simultaneously and successfully in addition on site measurements of uranine pco2 and water quality data such as electrical conductivity ec temperature ph and dissolved oxygen were undertaken modification of an existing pco2 measuring system allowed the gas samples to be collected transported and analyzed for inert gas components within a few hours as a result reliable and interpretable data with a recovery ratio of 26 85 and 95 for sf6 kr and uranine respectively were obtained the differences in the recovery ratio were utilized to identify the environmental system whether it contains gas inside the isolated system closed or not open and to understand plume behavior characteristics in the experimental zone by applying a two dimensional advection dispersion model to the acquired tracer test data and comparing the observed and computed tracer concentrations helpful information was obtained on the hydraulic and transport characteristics of the targeted zone this method can be extended to the design of dissolved co2 transport monitoring of an aquifer above a ccs site graphical abstrcat image graphical abstract keywords

khaledialidusti and kleppe 2017 shook et al 2004 wang et al 2020 in addition the swpp test has been variously applied for each purpose of research such as for establishing the role of radionuclide migration for safety assessment predicting a potential risk of deleterious mass release near radioactive waste repositories and evaluating dissolved co2 plume migration through porous or fractured media when the co2 leakage occurs löfgren et al 2007 mickler et al 2013 moreno and crawford 2009 nordqvist et al 2012 olsson and winberg 1997 rillard et al 2014 yang et al 2013 to estimate the groundwater flow tracers normally used in swpp tests include sodium chloride salt uranine fluorescent property and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δd in the target area matsumoto et al 2020 in addition the chemical impact of co2 leakage on potable groundwater has been investigated and understood near a carbon capture and storage ccs site through swpp tests performed by artificially injecting the dissolved or gas phase co2 with the tracers mickler et al 2013 yang et al 2013 furthermore non reactive gasses such as sf6 kr ar and he have been mainly used in several studies on the transport mechanisms of co2 intrusion into aquifer systems ballentine et al 2002 holland and gilfillan 2013 gilfillan et al 2009 györe et al 2015 györe et al 2017 and a detailed case study based on a lab scale experiment has verified the usefulness of the noble gas as a precursor tracer when co2 leakage events occur kilgallon et al 2018 a combination of a reactive and a non reactive conservative tracer has regularly been used in conventional swpp tests as it provides additional information about the chemical physical and biological properties of the subsurface environment hillebrand et al 2015 knapp et al 2017 maier et al 2015 schaffer et al 2016 in particular the breakthrough curve btc of the conservative tracer has been utilized as a criterion curve for the caracterization of the plume paths and distribution of the target species acquired btcs facilitate obtaining the most representative properties of the aquifer such as flow velocity or porosity cao et al 2020 gelhar and collins 1971 hall et al 1991 paradis et al 2018 schroth and istok 2006 while minimizing disturbance to the surrounding environment and the target species plume when compared with reactive tracers using multiple tracers with similar physical and chemical properties e g gas liquid and free phase to the contaminant would provide more representative information on the characteristics of the formed plume chatton 2017 cao et al 2020 for instance plume migration of the dissolved co2 or ch4 could be better represented by a gas tracer such as sf6 kr ar etc than a non gaseous tracer such as salt or uranine because generally the dissolved gasses could reveal the degassing and re dissolving characteristics depending on the pressure p and temperature t of the plume migration path liu et al 2021 in addition the physicochemical properties of tracers can vary according to the solvent solute combination reid et al 1987 and evaluating the behavior of the gas dissolved plume using the gas tracers would enhance understanding of behavior reflecting gas properties györe et al 2015 2017 however our knowledge of dissolved plume behavior remains poor furthermore there is a lack of awareness of the need to use inert gases instead of solute tracers when investigating dissolved gas plume behavior hoffmann et al 2020 such as in landfill projects e g co2 ch4 napl non aqueous phase liquid remediation projects e g betx pce tce and ccs projects the application of some sampling methods for noble gas may be challenging if a swpp test is conducted at a site where dissolved gas concentrations may be very high e g co2 controlled release test bed lee et al 2017 the atlantis ii deep area anschutz and blanc 1996 spring water site do et al 2020 in addition gas bubbles may form inside the pumped water pipe e g polyethylene due to depressurization oldenburg 2006 as dissolved gas can partition into the free gas phase beyerle et al 2000 the bubbles produced like this make the sampling more arduous and time consuming an in situ sampling technique involving sealing the water sample isolated at in situ conditions was developed to sample the water where bubbles can occur winckler et al 2000 however this method is unsuitable for the swpp test requiring a high sampling frequency an alternative sampling method could be applied to the swpp test to obtain the desired data if the purpose of a study is focused on obtaining reasonable criteria for comparison with a highly soluble and reactive gas such as co2 unless studies measure low concentrations in nature sano and fischer 2013 suggested an alternative method to detect gas tracers with a heavy molecular weight and a high concentration in the groundwater by generating bubbles in a specific water sample volume similarly a commercialized instrument e g rad7 sarad with a bubbling system is generally used to measure radon rn concentration in groundwater kitto and kuhland 1995 the principle of this method can be applied in various ways for analyzing target tracers by controlling the water air volume and gas bubbling rate in addition a portable instrument such as ge mims gas equilibrium membrane inlet mass spectrometers developed by brennwald et al 2016 can be used to obtain continuous data with high resolution for various gas species brennwald et al 2022 chatton et al 2017 brennwald et al 2022 recommended the bubble free gas labeling method because bubbles could hamper identifying the composition of gas tracers that can be used to estimate the groundwater mixing ratio and diluting factor these two techniques could be suggested as applicable methods for the swpp tests if a way to modify and supplement is supported to conduct the test in a high gas saturated site such as a landfill co2 control release test or geyser this study aims to perform the swpp test using inert gas tracers and with the acquired data to understand how the gas dissolved plumes behave in the subsurface environment hydraulic and transport characteristics of the gas dissolved plumes of the swpp test zone are to be estimated for this purpose gas tracers such as co2 sf6 and kr were used and an approach for sampling gas tracers in time and cost effectively during the swpp test was introduced an on site instrument called open loop and air purging olap developed by ha et al 2020a to detect pco2 concentration in the groundwater was modified and applied to the swpp test directly to collect the data for all gas tracers simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and target borehole for the swpp test the swpp test was performed at the korea co2 storage environmental management k cosem research site approximately 78 km southeast of seoul in chungcheongbuk do korea fig 1 the geological structures can be represented by four formations each of which has different depths and thicknesses including consolidated biotite granite weathered biotite granite weathered soil and silty sand layers in order from the bottom layer as shown in fig 2 the weathered biotite granite layer and the weathered soil layer with the silty sand layer are sequentially covered with a thickness of 41 to 61 m above sea level a s l and 61 to 92 m a s l respectively the average surface elevation is 92 5 m a s l and the average range of the groundwater elevation is 75 6 3 75 59 m a s l between two boreholes near the main test well r4 piezometers b1 to b10 presented with blank circle marks in fig 1 have a 2 inch diameter these are used to monitor the shallow aquifer system and r1 to r4 and h4 boreholes blue color circle have a 3 inch diameter and are penetrated through the bedrock 25 m a s l as illustrated in fig 1 the r4 borehole was selected for conducting the dissolved gas tracer swpp test test in the present study the well r4 as far away as possible from the surrounding clustered boreholes was used this distribution of the boreholes excluded the possibility of degassing if the tracer plume reached a preferential pathway connected with other boreholes the r4 borehole penetrated the entire section from 0 to 120 m below the ground surface bgs to prevent collapse and contamination silty sand and weathered soil sections and weathered biotite granite sections were secured with pvc pipe casing and gravel packing and the rest of the exposed biotite granite parts that were remained perforated the depth of a 6 m interval 76 73 82 73 m bgs was selected as an appropriate depth among the candidate intervals for performing the swpp test based on borehole imagery a double inflatable packer was installed at both ends of the section an electric impeller driven pump mp1 grundfos denmark was also installed in the center of the test interval so that groundwater could be injected during the pushing stage or extracted during the pulling stage therefore the pump a double inflatable packer and a 120 m long pipeline were connected in a row and installed in the borehole as shown in fig 2 a after inserting all the necessary equipment in the r4 borehole pure n2 gas 99 99 was injected to inflate both packers water level data loggers levelogger model 3001 solinst ltd canada were installed above and between the double inflatable packers to check the groundwater pressure before during and after the test before the main swpp test preliminary tests were performed using the installed pump and the flowmeter by extracting injecting the groundwater to determine proper injection and pumping rates the extracted and injected water flow rates were repeatedly measured until an adequate capacity of the pump for manual control could be determined because even if the pump is set to the same number of the impeller rotation frequency hz the flow rate changes depending on the depth or pressure of the target zone we tried to find the most stabilized injection and pumping rates with the applied pump in the field condition the determined flow rates for the injection and pumping tests were 6 l min and 10 l min respectively a multiparameter water quality meter prodss ysi inc yellow springs oh usa was used for measuring obtaining the water quality data including ec electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do by inserting the instrument into the flow cell made by a transparent acrylic cylinder during the pushing and pulling stage of the swpp test fig 2 b 2 2 single well push pull test procedure a few days before the swpp test the groundwater was pumped out of the r4 borehole to fill three separate tanks of 500 liters l 1000 l and 3000 l capacity respectively depending on the prepared volume 500 l was prepared for the chaser 1000 l for sf6 and kr dissolution and 3000 l for co2 and uranine dissolution the water mixing system was designed to be injected into the r4 borehole after passing through the flow cell which was used for real time monitoring of the physicochemical parameters by inserting a multi probe sensor prodds into the flow cell a day before the swpp test co2 gas was injected into the 3000 l tank to obtain co2 gas infused water using the co2 dissolver and water circulation pump a few hours before the first stage of the swpp test sf6 and kr gases were injected into the 1000 l water tank through two 8 inch air stones i e fine bubble diffuser for 4 h to make the inert gas infused water based on the obtained results of pre tests figure s1 afterward 3 g of uranine powder was placed into the 3000 l tank to achieve a concentration of 1 ppm next water was drained at 4 l min and 2 l min from the tank where co2 and inert gas were injected respectively with a combined rate of 6 l min by adjusting the gate valves manually and fixing all valves to maintain a constant flow rate the swpp test can be divided into three stages push rest and pull all gas infused water was injected during the pushing stage first the co2 infused and inert gas infused water were injected with a flow rate of 4 l min and 2 l min respectively followed by the chaser water to push the remaining water in the borehole into the fractured media a total of 2530 l 1596 l co2 infused water 812 l gas tracer infused water 122 l chaser water was injected into the borehole r4 for 420 min the flow rate was carefully controlled and the water was constantly injected at approximately 6 l min through borehole r4 during this stage to obtain the initial concentration c0 of tracer species and chemical data in the mixed water co2 infused water insert gas infused water five time sampling campaigns of injected water and gas were undertaken using a small bypass tube attached to the flow cell for the water sample and open loop and air purging olap system for the gas sample respectively gas tracers with low solubility can readily escape through the surface of the prepared water tank during the pushing stage therefore the initial tracer concentration c0 was measured during the injection to estimate the total mass of gas species injected table 1 represents each tracer s initial concentration and the total injected mass of each tracer with the background conditions after the pushing stage the resting stage was maintained for 5 5 days without water injection or pumping during the resting stage the solubility fractionation between inert gases volume ratio reflecting the given environment according to the solubility of each gas occurred because in this stage the regional groundwater flow is slow and artificial influences are not involved using this physical mechanism which is the equilibration of the gas water volume it can be determined whether the fractured zone is an open closed system by plotting the ratio of each inert gas on the equilibrium trend line holland and gilfillan 2013 as the volume ratio of underground gas water decreases the minor soluble gas tends to be concentrated in the gas phase until the volume ratio is zero vgas vwater 0 the relative solubility of each gas controls the concentration limit if the tested system is closed it is assumed that the phase partitioning behavior is ideal and that the sampled concentration ratios follow the closed fractionation line if the test area is open it can be assumed that some gas phase is continually removed and the ratios follow the rayleigh fractionation line holland and gilfillan 2013 the pumping rate was controlled at 10 l min and since the water recharge drain cell installed in the olap is small 86 5 ml and requires a fine adjustment the extracted water was split into two separate lines one path was used to monitor groundwater physicochemical parameters ph ec temperature and do to measure pco2 by flowing into the olap system and to sample gas tracers the other path was used to sample the groundwater measure the uranine tracer and consistently flow out the rest volume the physicochemical parameters were automatically recorded at 5 min intervals by passing through the flow cell the curves of pco2 and uranine concentration were checked compared to sequentially obtained data the sampling time interval was controlled until the end of the pulling stage the sampling campaign was started with an intensive interval 15 30 or 60 min for a few days to obtain the less varied curves in concentration then the sampling interval was gradually increased max 12 h in the tailing curve part of the concentration shows if it has been confirmed that the physicochemical parameters monitored in real time remain almost recovered to the background value before the pushing stage the sampling campaign with a 12 hour interval was finished additional groundwater was extracted for one week to be sure to return to the environment before the tracer injection thirty eight sampling campaigns were undertaken for one week during the pulling stage one last sample for kr and sf6 was performed on the previous day when the groundwater extraction was ended 20 440 min later from starting the pulling stage 2 3 a rapid method for inert gas monitoring during the swpp test when a push pull test is conducted in the field the initial sampling interval of the groundwater extraction pulling stage is essential to determine the entire period of the pulling stage extraction rate and sample interval during the test because generally the high concentration of tracer is recorded in the initial pulling stage which can significantly affect estimating the recovery ratio thus careful determination of sampling techniques is necessary to detect early change signals that might be missed with an inappropriate technique selection addy et al 2002 hall et al 1991 semprini et al 2005 consequently the high sampling frequency increases the probability of correctly characterizing the btc during the swpp test to be applied in the swpp test with gas tracers a fast sampling method should be considered in the field to maximize data acquired in due time in the present study the swpp test was designed so that each sampling campaign can be completed in 15 min based on the method introduced by sano and fischer 2013 the gas injection and sample collection methods for the kr and sf6 samples can be applied by modifying the olap system the detailed processes of the proposed method for the swpp test in this study are described below 2 4 on site pco2 measurement and inert gas sampling the olap system an on site pco2 analyzer was operated to analyze pco2 in groundwater during the test the system adopted the gas purging method first introduced by swinnerton et al 1962 to analyze dissolved gases in water and a portable system to utilize it in the field test as reported by wilkinson et al 2018 consistent with previous studies this study used equipment by modifying it to continuously analyze pco2 and suit the condition of the study site ha et al 2020a figure s2 the system consists of a purging cell for extracting the dissolved co2 two pumps to deliver groundwater and inject the purging gas and a commercial infrared gas analyzer gmt220 vaisala co finland by delivering groundwater into the purging cell connected to the water volume controller and supplying purging the water continuously the co2 concentration of the gas extracted from the pumped water was measured and recorded by gmt220 in real time until it reached equilibrium the flow rates of the delivered groundwater the purging gas rate and the water volume in the purging cell were optimized for this push pull test as 0 25 l min 0 5 l min and 86 5 ml respectively by referring to the efficient design suggested by butler et al 1988 and dickson et al 2007 the olap system was designed according to sop 5 standard operating procedure dickson et al 2007 and details of the results analysis method basic design structure and precautions can be found in dickson et al 2007 the olap system was continuously operated during the pulling stage of the push pull test and pco2 was measured every 5 s the gas samples for laboratory analysis were sampled using tedlar bags 1 l multi layer foil restek co bellefonte pa usa by connecting them to the outlet tube of the olap system because the system was installed outside the temperature in the purging cell showed slight fluctuations due to the ambient temperature changes but it was negligible when measuring pco2 the pressure in the purging cell was maintained constant during pco2 measurement and gas sampling 2 5 kr and sf6 analysis gas samples from the olap system were analyzed using two kinds of gas chromatography gc devices gc agilent 7890b and 6890 agilent ltd usa detectors via different gc instruments kr gas was measured by gc 7890b equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd maintaining 120 c using ultrapure helium he 99 999 as a carrier gas the molesieve column agilent hp molesieve 30 m 0 53 mm 50 µm was installed in a chiller rw3 2035 lab companion usa that maintains the temperature of the column constant at 30 c to establish a specific retention time that can show the peak of kr the pressure in the sample loop was measured using an inficon capacitance manometer cdg025d 0 1000 torr 0 2 accuracy installed in the gc valve heater for temperature stability a volume of 45 ml was extracted from the gas sample bag using a 50 ml gas tight syringe and then attached to the valve at the front of the sample loop the gas specimen from each sample was analyzed three times with the pressure of the first expansion generally between 120 and 130 torr the peak area over the sample loop pressure ratio was monitored for each gas sample the calculation of the concentration of kr was based on a linear regression line fitted to the ratios from 1008 µmol mol kr standard gas airkorea ltd korea iso 9001 certified institute sf6 gas was measured using an agilent 6890 gc equipped with an electron capture detector ecd using ultrapure nitrogen n2 99 999 as a carrier gas the inlet oven and detector temperatures were maintained at 200 50 and 250 c respectively a capillary column agilent hp plot al203 15 m 0 53 mm 15 µm was used and the carrier gas flow rate was 4 4 ml min the split mode was applied on the inlet with a 5 over 1 ratio the gas specimen was obtained without volume extraction from each sample bag using solid phase micro extraction spme fiber 100 µm pdms supelco ltd usa and manually inserting the sf6 fiber into the gc inlet through the septum and the glass liner sf6 standard gas 101 2 502 9 and 1011 µmol mol airkorea ltd korea was used to make a linear regression line sf6 measurements were conducted three times for each gas sample and calibrated based on the standard line concentrations from the three repeated measurements were then averaged to represent a mean sf6 concentration for each sample these two analysis procedures can be performed simultaneously because the detection time was under 15 min for each gas sample analysis 2 6 on site uranine measurement a field portable instrument a fluorometer 10 086r 10 au fluorometer turner designs usa was used to detect the uranine tracer approximately 7 ml of the extracted water was filled in a transparent glass tube φ13 mm x 100 mm and inserted into the instrument the discrete sample analyses were applied and by checking the lamp condition the standard solution 1 ppm mg l was measured after every water sample measurement measurements were performed thrice for each sample e g a total of 27 ml was used and the used glass tube was cleaned using distilled water the detection limit was 0 01 ppb µg l uranine in water and the same standard solution confirmed all detected values 2 7 acquired data utilization and evaluation 2 7 1 applying the physical chemistry of inert gases phase partitioning characteristics of noble gasses help determine the existence of different phases within the subsurface darrah et al 2014 gilfillan et al 2009 györe et al 2021 kharaka and specht 1988 pinti and marty 1995 especially phase partitioning in gas and water systems has been determined for various environments amonette et al 2019 darrah et al 2014 gilfillan et al 2009 zhou and ballentine 2006 if the subsurface system is identified using the phase partitioning of artificially injected noble gases it could be used to ensure the stability of repositories containing radioactive waste or co2 by determining whether the storage has an open or closed system the distribution of noble gases between the gaseous and liquid phases is based on henry s law ballentine et al 2002 which states the relationship between substances as a dissolved phase and gaseous phase eq 1 1 c i g a s k i d c i w a t e r where c i g a s and c i w a t e r are the concentrations of noble gas species i in the gaseous and water phases respectively l3 m and k i d is the dimensionless henry constant of noble gas species i the type of equilibrium system of the environment has to be defined to determine the degree of phase partitioning between the two phases ballentine et al 2002 the two types of systems are the closed and open systems which differ in terms of whether the partitioned gas phase is maintained within the system or lost from the system ballentine et al 2002 in the case of a closed system batch model equilibrium is assumed between the gaseous and water phase concentration the number of moles can be calculated with henry s constant units of molality for each inert gas as follows 2 n g n t r t ρ l v l γ n φ n k i m v g 1 1 where n g a n d t are the number of moles in the gaseous phase and the total in the system on the used noble gas r is the standard gas constant 0 082 pl3mol 1t 1 ρ l is the density of the liquid ml 3 t is temperature v l a n d v g are the volume of liquid and gas respectively l3 γ n is the liquid phase activity coefficient φ n is the gas phase fugacity coefficient and k i m is henry s constant mpmol 1 the corresponding equation which depicts the relationship between the noble gas concentrations and total concentrations in the volume can be related to the source ratio in the system according to bosch and mazor 1988 expressed by 3 i a i b g i a i b t v g v l 1 k i a d v g v l 1 k i b d i a and i b are the numbers of moles in each noble gas a and b respectively moles i a i b g and i a i b t are the ratios of noble gas a and b within the gas phase and the whole system including the gas and liquid phases respectively v g v l is the volume ratio between the gas and liquid phase and k i a a n d b d is the dimensionless henry s constant of each noble gas a and b as for the open system continuous loss of phase partitioned noble gases to the gas phase is considered to proceed which results from extensive phase partitioning relative to the closed system this mechanism is expressed based on rayleigh s law expressed as follows 4 i a i b l i q u i d i a i b t f α 1 α k a w a t e r m k b w a t e r m where f is the fraction of b noble gas remaining in the liquid phase the type of system can be determined by the relative similarity of the sample point values with the phase partitioning lines corresponding to each system this comparison can allow the characterization of the physical mechanisms that have influenced the groundwater along its flow path and the quantification of the degree of phase partitioning the samples have gone through scott et al 2021 tyne et al 2021 data accumulation through various experiments is required one of the objectives of the present study is to determine whether sf6 can follow the open closed model of equilibrium partitioning between phases gaseous and liquid with another inert gas kr and whether the acquired data on sf6 provide information that can aid the understanding of the mechanism at the fractured aquifer sf6 is a non polar species commonly used as tracers by mixing with other noble gasses and many related studies have been conducted freifeld et al 2005 lu et al 2012 straujkova et al 2020 however further studies are still necessary to explain the physical partitioning phenomenon between sf6 and other gasses in the highly gas saturated porous media freifeld et al 2005 stalker et al 2015 the reason may be due to the sampling intervals monitoring distances and operational difficulties during field experiments boreham et al 2011 stalker et al 2015 and the interpretation of fractionation among the inert gasses may also vary depending on the solubility difference problem e g 35 mg l for sf6 and 234 mg l for kr vulava et al 2002 solubility xe kr sf6 ar ne he gallardo et al 1990 reid et al 1987 2 7 2 applying for effective porosity and linear velocity estimation acquired conservative tracer data derived from the swpp test can be used for estimating groundwater velocity and effective porosity in the area where the test is conducted hall et al 1991 hall et al 1991 provided two eqs 7 and 8 to estimate the physical parameters porosity and velocity of the tested aquifer based on darcy s law equation and the regional advective velocity equation leap and kaplan 1988 as follow 5 υ k i n e 6 υ q t p π b n e t d where υ is the average linear velocity lt 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 i is the hydraulic gradient ll 1 and n e is the effective porosity q is a constant pumping rate l3t 1 during recovery of the tracers t p is the elapsed time t from the start of pumping to the center of tracer mass is recovered t d is the resting time plus t p t and b is the aquifer thickness l if eqs 5 and 6 are valid in the tested aquifer the two equations can be rearranged to derive the effective porosity and groundwater velocity 7 n e π b k 2 i 2 t d 2 q t p and 8 υ q t p π b t d 2 k i by applying these basic models validated by several studies chen and wang 2021 gelhar and collins 1971 haggerty et al 2001 istok et al 1997 schroth and istok 2006 schroth et al 2000 on the obtained tracer data presented here the modified and rapid method of the swpp test to analyze the inert gasses in the present study it is possible to determine whether the suggested method is reliable to interpret the hydrogeological properties with the swpp test the basic assumptions for estimating the effective porosity and linear velocity are that the targeted aquifer has a homogeneous condition the background velocity of groundwater is negligible compared to the velocity induced by the pump and the condition that the groundwater is saturated between two packers is sustained until the end of the pulling stage istok et al 1997 schroth and istok 2006 the input values were 10 l min for the pumping rate 2 50e 5 m s for the hydraulic conductivity 0 01 for the hydraulic gradient measured between h4 and r4 fig 1 and 7920 min for the draft time the value of the hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on the cubic law cook 2003 using fracture spacing about 1 m intervals and apertures 0 18 6 54 cm these properties of the fractures were derived using imagej https https imagej nih gov ij based on bips images figure s3 1 and s3 2 in supplementary material the elapsed time extracting the center of mass of the recovered tracer was estimated using a simple formula as t p t 1 m 1 t 2 m 2 t n m n t o t a l m a s s t sampling time m the concentration of the tracers payne et al 2008 these elapsed time durations were represented differently depending on the tracer of sf6 kr and uranine because the btc of each tracer was different 2 7 3 applying a two dimensional analytical transport solution an analytical solution can be used for understanding the transport of gas tracers with distance and time dependent transport coefficients zheng and bennett 2002 to verify that the modified and rapid method as suggested in this study provides the variables including sf6 kr uranine and co2 transport the two dimensional model was applied to the obtained results of the swpp test because double inflatable packers isolated the test zone at 6 m 8 m height it is assumed that the source has a patch shape as the cylindrical boundary and the top and bottom boundary have the no flow condition 2 d model can be conceived from the original formula neville 1994 and is expressed as follows 9 c x y t x 4 b π d x 0 t c 0 t ξ 1 ξ 3 e x p λ ξ x v ξ 2 4 d x ξ e r f c y y 0 2 d y ξ e r f c y y 0 2 d y ξ d ξ where x is the plume travel distance during the pushing stage of the swpp test l b is the aquifer thickness l d x and d y are effective dispersion coefficients for longitudinal and transverse directions respectively d x y d x y r d x y α l t h ν d r is retardation factor d x y is the constant dispersion coefficient α l t r is longitudinal and horizontal transverse dispersivity υ is linear velocity lt

concentration c ξ λ is the first order reactive rate assumed 0 in this study v is a groundwater velocity υ r lt 1 y is the source width y 2 π r r is the borehole radius 0 0381 m l and y 0 y 2 l the input variables were calculated and adjusted to the swpp test condition as much as possible the linear velocity was derived using eq 8 using uranine btc in the case of the travel distance of the plume through the fractured zone the initial source boundary location x would not exceed the range of the fracture length 14 28 m which was derived using the pkn and kgd model geertsma and de klerk 1969 khristianovic and zheltov 1955 nordgren 1972 perkins and kern 1961 with the monitored pressure at the inside of packers during the pushing stage and the fracture information derived from the bips in addition the effective radius or radius of influence caused by a hydraulic test with packers can be suggested by 5 10 m royle 2002 yihdego 2017 thus the two dimensional model on the swpp test was conducted assuming the source boundary location x as 5 and 10 m r value was changed to match the obtained data assuming that the degree of retardation may differ for each gas tracer according to the physicochemical properties the conservative tracer uranine non sorbing tracer can be used as a standard tracer for estimating the transport of other tracers through the fractured zone because it is least influenced by uncertain external factors e g chemical reaction with rock or other tracers shook et al 2004 and is almost fully recovered after the end of the swpp test as shown in figure 4 right a representative value of the linear velocity was calculated by using the btc of the uranine tracer two scenarios were conducted according to the value of distance x as 5 and 10 m by changing the two variables including the dispersive coefficient d x and d y and the retardation factor r zheng and bennett 2002 the modeled curve was calculated until the best matched result was derived with the uranine tracer s btc and based on this the retardation value r was changed to match the concentration curve of other tracers each derived input value can be summarized as shown in table 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 the results of the swpp test there was an initial variation period for all real time monitored variables including do ec ph and hydraulic pressure between the two packers it is believed that a change in conditions was generated due to a sudden pressure change as the groundwater was extracted in the initial pulling stage afterward a recovery period was observed in the parameters in a short time and then they approached the background level until the pulling stage ended fig 3 the monitored do ph and ec ranges were 1 6 7 2 mg l 6 67 8 08 and 177 9 328 5 µs cm respectively the variation in do was adjusted promptly to a stabilized value over 5 0 mg l in 5 min and increased near the background concentration 6 99 mg l a high ph value is initially observed which then falls becoming low immediately and returning to the background value after five minutes the monitored value ph 6 67 was slightly lower than the background ph 7 12 this behavior may be due to the presence of a buffering effect secondary derived carbonate minerals e g ca mg capable of accepting a large amount of low ph water ha et al 2020b in such a context it is considered that ec values increased gradually because ion solubility in groundwater was changed the monitored ec started at a lower value 177 9 µs cm than the background value 222 1 µs cm and then increased gradually to 328 8 µs cm and decreased after 279 min the variation of ec values with the elapsed time implies that mineral dissolution from the rock aquifer has been derived from the low ph caused by dissolved co2 the ec values also showed a recovery curve to the background value although not completely recovered as the swpp test progressed considering that the hydraulic pressure between the two packers was stably monitored within a specific range as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the groundwater was steadily and continuously extracted through the interval between the two packers during the pulling stage the monitored concentration curves of sf6 kr uranine and pco2 were represented by normalized values for comparison with the same elapsed time as shown in fig 4 after starting the pulling stage the peak concentrations were obtained sequentially at 40 138 160 and 295 min for pco2 kr sf6 and uranine although each btc of tracers had a different peak time the shapes of curves were primarily similar in the entire pulling stage in the case of the uranine tracer btc s falling limb was gentler than other tracers the reason is that although the uranine tracer is non reactive and non phase changing material it seems that some slight adsorption to the surrounding inorganic materials composed of sio2 68 al2o3 15 was reflected in the btc bork et al 2020 kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 the btc of other tracers had a sharp curve compared to the uranine tracer because the gas tracers of sf6 kr and pco2 have the property of degassing from the dissolved phase depending on the solubility of each gas species it is considered to have been reduced relatively quickly the recovery rates for each tracer are presented on the right side of fig 4 the most recovered tracer was the uranine tracer and the mass recovery rate was 95 49 sf6 tracer showed the lowest recovery rate with 25 71 in the case of the co2 tracer injected with the enormous mass the recovery rate was 51 80 the kr tracer showed a significant mass recovery rate of 85 43 despite having the characteristics of the gaseous phase 3 2 evaluating the flow mechanism during the pulling stage using fractionation between sf6 and kr tracers sf6 and kr tracers were compared using the batch and rayleigh models ballentine et al 2002 the gas partitioning was checked to verify if it would generally follow two model lines despite the sf6 being intensely volatile similar to 3h clark et al 2005 easily accumulating in gas pockets and causing delayed transport vulava et al 2002 the blue dashed line shows the open system line from the injected concentration c0 of the gas tracer if the concentrations lie on this line it could mean that the partitioned gasses are continuously removed from one system to another these other potential systems could be a gas blurb e g co2 ch4 in the subsurface environment holland and gilfillan 2013 zhou et al 2005 an unisolated part of the borehole and another reservoir connected by geologic fractures barry et al 2016 the pink dash line represents the closed system line if the ratios of the obtained data follow this line the target zone could be assumed to be isolated from another system sf6 tracer could be used to model the gas partitioning dependent on the solubility of each gas it means that the molecules are interacting between the water and the gas in the isolated space as shown in fig 5 the ratio between two tracers kr and sf6 was plotted on the solubility controlled rayleigh fractionation lines it follows as the sampling time elapsed the ratio mark was plotted diagonally from the upper right to the lower left based on the displayed concentration ratio according to the sample times and the closer and farther away from the closed system line the plume behavior mechanism can be interpreted by dividing it into three steps according to characteristics as the first step it can be seen that the samples are clustered in a confined area near the open system line between 10 and 510 min as shown in fig 5 this phenomenon can be interpreted as co2 which degasses relatively rapidly from the groundwater and acts as a carrier gas due to a sudden pressure change when the pump is operated in addition as shown in fig 3 the pressure between the packers increased rapidly at the beginning of the pulling stage and then recovered to a stable pressure in the second step the plume was constantly pulled and began to enter a stable section from 630 to 4410 min because most of the sampled concentration ratios were demonstrated following the closed system line potentially no gas was lost to the external system during the pulling stage in other words the multi tracer dissolved water was expected to behave only through the fractured zone it is assumed that the injected water would have been isolated well from other potential systems if only artificial factors could have been excluded in the final step from 5862 to 20 440 min the background diluted the existing concentrations in the plume because the end migrated through the fractures for a long time and was exposed to the background groundwater therefore the ratio of the tracers was gradually plotted in the direction of the background ratio out of the closed system line 3 3 estimating the effective porosity and linear velocity using conservative tracers the acquired sf6 kr and uranine data were used to estimate the effective porosity and the linear groundwater velocity through the fractured zone of the rock aquifer isolated by two packers in the present study the center of mass for each tracer was applied in eqs 7 and 8 the elapsed times for obtaining the center of mass of the plume migration through the fractured aquifer were 426 1 642 1 and 527 9 min for sf6 kr and uranine respectively based on the evaluated elapse time the effective porosity of the targeted zone was calculated using eq 7 and derived as 0 20 0 14 and 0 17 for sf6 kr and uranine respectively the linear groundwater velocity was calculated using eq 8 as 0 017 0 025 and 0 021 m d for each tracer the input parameters and calculated results for each tracer are summarized in table 3 the elapsed times were different suggesting different physical and chemical characteristics of the tracers the time of the peak concentration for kr sf6 and uranine were 138 160 and 295 min respectively and the difference in the peak time between gas tracers was 22 min 18 lag rate while for uranine tracer compared with kr was delayed with 157 min 113 lag rate the reason can be understood by the difference in the aqueous diffusion coefficient of 4 5 8 73 and 14 5 10 10 m2s 1 for uranine sf6 and kr respectively king and saltzman 1995 skagius and neretnieks 1986 wise and houghton 1968 the more molecular diffusion coefficients increase the more gas tracers can diffuse into the rock matrix and relatively being limited the tracer migration from the testing borehole to the fractured zone during the resting stage hoffmann et al 2020 therefore the peak concentration appears early if the diffusion coefficient is relatively larger than other tracers in this sense the center of kr mass plume diffused relatively widely around the borehole showed last among injected tracers 642 1 min the mass plume center of uranine which is a powder solute that can be adsorbed in inorganic material kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 appeared 527 9 min and the center of sf6 mass plume arrived fastest 426 1 min among those tracers despite the difference in the btc characteristics appearing depending on whether the tracer was solid gas or physically chemically different they all provided similar linear velocity effective porosity values these results implied that the btc of each trace was obtained by well reflecting the hydrogeological properties during the resting and pulling stages thus the center of mass times was derived similarly therefore using a non reactive gas can be considered an essential tracer and implied that a more significant result in dissolved gas flow through the aquifer can be obtained if the purpose is to understand the migration of leaked co2 by conducting the swpp test 3 4 evaluating the multi tracer transport through the fractured zone the best fitted curves derived from the two dimensional analytical transport model are represented in fig 6 with red blue orange and purple colors for sf6 kr uranine and pco2 respectively the others are shown with gray lines the empty circles are the observed data for sf6 kr uranine and pco2 representing the elapsed time during the pulling stage of the swpp test two assumptions were adopted according to the plume travel distances 5 and 10 m as stated in the previous methods section some variables were fixed by the values derived using the btc of the uranine tracer such as the dispersivity coefficient α l t r and the linear velocity υ the values of the dispersivity coefficient were applied depending on the plume travel distances as α l 10 m α t r 1 m for 5 m plume travel and α l 25 m α t r 2 5 m for 10 m plume travel based on the standard variables above the modeled btcs matched the other tracers by changing the value of the retardation factor r thus in the case of the 5 m plume travel when r were 2 8 3 0 and 3 5 the best fitted curves were for sf6 kr and pco2 respectively in the case of the 10 m plume travel distance the best fitted curves were derived when r were 1 5 1 8 and 2 0 for sf6 kr and pco2 respectively considering that relatively small r values would have drawn btcs faster v υ r the results of the modeled btcs indicate that the concentration curves of sf6 and kr tracer were obtained earlier than pco2 as demonstrated by the previous studies flohr et al 2021 kilgallon et al 2018 myers et al 2013 however the initial peak times of observed btcs were not followed in the previous studies different results of inert gas btcs may be derived depending on the various field conditions based on the inert gas tracer mixed with injected co2 which could act as early warnings of co2 leakage kilgallon et al 2018 e g complexity heterogeneity myers et al 2013 for unidirectional flows i e a plume flowing out of the repository and moving in one direction because the inert gas has a lower solubility than co2 which is depicted as a leading curve is a potential warning however a different mechanism may be shown in obtaining co2 and inert gas concentration curves in reciprocating flows such as the push pull test in addition if it is assumed that two packers are entirely isolated the tested zone and the target zone are not connected with the atmosphere via any pathways so sudden pressure changes are potentially generated in the isolated zone at the beginning of water extraction in a short time fig 3 this pressure change would cause the gases remaining under the upper packer to be re dissolved into the groundwater quickly as shown by the peak concentration of co2 monitored earlier than the inert gas tracers at least in the place expected to be an isolated zone e g co2 storage waste repository sf6 or kr can be applied as a combined inert reacting tracer test method for estimating the contact area between dissolved degassed gas mass flows through a fractured zone and the rock medium hawkins et al 2018 in addition because the best fit curves of the inert gas tracers were derived with the r value which was similar to that of pco2 in the case of studies related to gas leakage it can be implied that the use of gas tracers might be more likely to provide essential information than conservative tracers such as uranine salt etc the non reactive tracers uranine sf6 and kr tended to fit nicely between the modeled curves and the observed data until the end of the curves as shown in fig 6 in contrast it was challenging to match the calculated curve after 5000 min in the case of observed pco2 data this reason can be interpreted in various ways for example the injected high concentration of co2 may remain the low concentration of co2 may continue in the background inconclusive geochemical react interactions may exist between rocks and groundwater and two or three sources may be mixed the application of the two dimensional analysis model confirmed that the data obtained using the proposed method in this study could be used to understand the hydrological characteristics of the fractured aquifer furthermore the gas tracer migration analysis was possible depending on the plume travel distance and different curves could be calculated depending on the gas tracer accordingly the sampling method suggested in this study could identify the fractured aquifer characteristics 4 conclusion this study performed the swpp test that injected sf6 kr and uranine as tracers to investigate gas dissolved plume migration characteristics through the isolated fracture zone a frequent and rapid sampling method was applied from the beginning of the pulling stage to obtain reliable and interpretable data curves through the swpp test mainly when targeting a rock aquifer the acquired data were applied to obtain reasonable estimates of the effective porosity and linear velocity which are the essential parameters for understanding the subsurface flow system gas tracers data of the swpp test were used to estimate inert gas fractionation and then to a two dimensional advection dispersion model to compare the observed and the computed concentration distributions in the region and timespan of interest the estimation and comparison provided information that could facilitate understanding the hydraulic and transport characteristics of the target zone and local geologic structure influencing the tracer distribution and subsurface co2 for ccs leakage monitoring in addition the approximated travel distance of the dissolved gas tracers through the apertures could be assumed based on the 2 d analytical model the analytical model results imply that dispersion may play a significant advection role in the migration of the dissolved gas plume through the isolated fracture zone although the uranine tracer is a useful conservative tracer it seems more reasonable to use an inert gas tracer to investigate the dissolved gas s plume behavior as a high retardation value can be matched the breakthrough curve compared to other tracers the results have confirmed that the early warning role of the inert gas tracers can be demonstrated differently as suggested in previous studies due to the uncertain physical mechanism of mass accumulation and dissolved gas plume migration in the case of the swpp test such mechanisms would have to be clarified through further studies credit authorship contribution statement won tak joun conceptualization

14845,in the present study a single well push pull swpp test was conducted with multi component tracers including inert gas sf6 and kr and uranine conservative to understand the volatile semi volatile component transport characteristics in the groundwater system in an swpp test it is essential to obtain an initial breakthrough curve btc of the inert gas concentration at the beginning of the pulling stage to analyze the hydraulic properties of the groundwater system as a result of the swpp test using a proposed method in this study physicochemical parameters of the groundwater and btc of gas tracers and uranine were acquired simultaneously and successfully in addition on site measurements of uranine pco2 and water quality data such as electrical conductivity ec temperature ph and dissolved oxygen were undertaken modification of an existing pco2 measuring system allowed the gas samples to be collected transported and analyzed for inert gas components within a few hours as a result reliable and interpretable data with a recovery ratio of 26 85 and 95 for sf6 kr and uranine respectively were obtained the differences in the recovery ratio were utilized to identify the environmental system whether it contains gas inside the isolated system closed or not open and to understand plume behavior characteristics in the experimental zone by applying a two dimensional advection dispersion model to the acquired tracer test data and comparing the observed and computed tracer concentrations helpful information was obtained on the hydraulic and transport

khaledialidusti and kleppe 2017 shook et al 2004 wang et al 2020 in addition the swpp test has been variously applied for each purpose of research such as for establishing the role of radionuclide migration for safety assessment predicting a potential risk of deleterious mass release near radioactive waste repositories and evaluating dissolved co2 plume migration through porous or fractured media when the co2 leakage occurs löfgren et al 2007 mickler et al 2013 moreno and crawford 2009 nordqvist et al 2012 olsson and winberg 1997 rillard et al 2014 yang et al 2013 to estimate the groundwater flow tracers normally used in swpp tests include sodium chloride salt uranine fluorescent property and stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δd in the target area matsumoto et al 2020 in addition the chemical impact of co2 leakage on potable groundwater has been investigated and understood near a carbon capture and storage ccs site through swpp tests performed by artificially injecting the dissolved or gas phase co2 with the tracers mickler et al 2013 yang et al 2013 furthermore non reactive gasses such as sf6 kr ar and he have been mainly used in several studies on the transport mechanisms of co2 intrusion into aquifer systems ballentine et al 2002 holland and gilfillan 2013 gilfillan et al 2009 györe et al 2015 györe et al 2017 and a detailed case study based on a lab scale experiment has verified the usefulness of the noble gas as a precursor tracer when co2 leakage events occur kilgallon et al 2018 a combination of a reactive and a non reactive conservative tracer has regularly been used in conventional swpp tests as it provides additional information about the chemical physical and biological properties of the subsurface environment hillebrand et al 2015 knapp et al 2017 maier et al 2015 schaffer et al 2016 in particular the breakthrough curve btc of the conservative tracer has been utilized as a criterion curve for the caracterization of the plume paths and distribution of the target species acquired btcs facilitate obtaining the most representative properties of the aquifer such as flow velocity or porosity cao et al 2020 gelhar and collins 1971 hall et al 1991 paradis et al 2018 schroth and istok 2006 while minimizing disturbance to the surrounding environment and the target species plume when compared with reactive tracers using multiple tracers with similar physical and chemical properties e g gas liquid and free phase to the contaminant would provide more representative information on the characteristics of the formed plume chatton 2017 cao et al 2020 for instance plume migration of the dissolved co2 or ch4 could be better represented by a gas tracer such as sf6 kr ar etc than a non gaseous tracer such as salt or uranine because generally the dissolved gasses could reveal the degassing and re dissolving characteristics depending on the pressure p and temperature t of the plume migration path liu et al 2021 in addition the physicochemical properties of tracers can vary according to the solvent solute combination reid et al 1987 and evaluating the behavior of the gas dissolved plume using the gas tracers would enhance understanding of behavior reflecting gas properties györe et al 2015 2017 however our knowledge of dissolved plume behavior remains poor furthermore there is a lack of awareness of the need to use inert gases instead of solute tracers when investigating dissolved gas plume behavior hoffmann et al 2020 such as in landfill projects e g co2 ch4 napl non aqueous phase liquid remediation projects e g betx pce tce and ccs projects the application of some sampling methods for noble gas may be challenging if a swpp test is conducted at a site where dissolved gas concentrations may be

pipe e g polyethylene due to depressurization oldenburg 2006 as dissolved gas can partition into the free gas phase beyerle et al 2000 the bubbles produced like this make the sampling more arduous and time consuming an in situ sampling technique involving sealing the water sample isolated at in situ conditions was developed to sample the water where bubbles can occur winckler et al 2000 however this method is unsuitable for the swpp test requiring a high sampling frequency an alternative sampling method could be applied to the swpp test to obtain the desired data if the purpose of a study is focused on obtaining reasonable criteria for comparison with a highly soluble and reactive gas such as co2 unless studies measure low concentrations in nature sano and fischer 2013 suggested an alternative method to detect gas tracers with a heavy molecular weight and a high concentration in the groundwater by generating bubbles in a specific water sample volume similarly a commercialized instrument e g rad7 sarad with a bubbling system is generally used to measure radon rn concentration in groundwater kitto and kuhland 1995 the principle of this method can be applied in various ways for analyzing target tracers by controlling the water air volume and gas bubbling rate in addition a portable instrument such as ge mims gas equilibrium membrane inlet mass spectrometers developed by brennwald et al 2016 can be used to obtain continuous data with high resolution for various gas species brennwald et al 2022 chatton et al 2017 brennwald et al 2022 recommended the bubble free gas labeling method because bubbles could hamper identifying the composition of gas tracers that can be used to estimate the groundwater mixing ratio and diluting factor these two techniques could be suggested as applicable methods for the swpp tests if a way to modify and supplement is supported to conduct the test in a high gas saturated site such as a landfill co2 control release test or geyser this study aims to perform the swpp test using inert gas tracers and with the acquired data to understand how the gas dissolved plumes behave in the subsurface environment hydraulic and transport characteristics of the gas dissolved plumes of the swpp test zone are to be estimated for this purpose gas tracers such as co2 sf6 and kr were used and an approach for sampling gas tracers in time and cost effectively during the swpp test was introduced an on site instrument called open loop and air purging olap developed by ha et al 2020a to detect pco2 concentration in the groundwater was modified and applied to the swpp test directly to collect the data for all gas tracers simultaneously 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and target borehole for the swpp test the swpp test was performed at the korea co2 storage environmental management k cosem research site approximately 78 km southeast of seoul in chungcheongbuk do korea fig 1 the geological structures can be represented by four formations each of which has different depths and thicknesses including consolidated biotite granite weathered biotite granite weathered soil and silty sand layers in order from the bottom layer as shown in fig 2 the weathered biotite granite layer and the weathered soil layer with the silty sand layer are sequentially covered with a thickness of 41 to 61 m above sea level a s l and 61 to 92 m a s l respectively the average surface elevation is 92 5 m a s l and the average range of the groundwater elevation is 75 6 3 75 59 m a s l between two boreholes near the main test well r4 piezometers b1 to b10 presented with blank circle marks in fig 1 have a 2 inch diameter these are used to monitor the shallow aquifer system and r1 to r4 and h4 boreholes blue color circle have a 3 inch diameter and are penetrated through the bedrock 25 m a s l as illustrated in fig 1 the r4 borehole was selected for conducting the dissolved gas tracer swpp test test in the present study the well r4 as far away as possible from the surrounding clustered boreholes was used this distribution of the boreholes excluded the possibility of degassing if the tracer plume reached a preferential pathway connected with other boreholes the r4 borehole penetrated the entire section from 0 to 120 m below the ground surface bgs to prevent collapse and contamination silty sand and weathered soil sections and weathered biotite granite sections were secured with pvc pipe casing and gravel packing and the rest of the exposed biotite granite parts that were remained perforated the depth of a 6 m interval 76 73 82 73 m bgs was selected as an appropriate depth among the candidate intervals for performing the swpp test based on borehole imagery a double inflatable packer was installed at both ends of the section an electric impeller driven pump mp1 grundfos denmark was also installed in the center of the test interval so that groundwater could be injected during the pushing stage or extracted during the pulling stage therefore the pump a double inflatable packer and a 120 m long pipeline were connected in a row and installed in the borehole as shown in fig 2 a after inserting all the necessary equipment in the r4 borehole pure n2 gas 99 99 was injected to inflate both packers water level data loggers levelogger model 3001 solinst ltd canada were installed above and between the double inflatable packers to check the groundwater pressure before during and after the test before the main swpp test preliminary tests were performed using the installed pump and the flowmeter by extracting injecting the groundwater to determine proper injection and pumping rates the extracted and injected water flow rates were repeatedly measured until an adequate capacity of the pump for manual control could be determined because even if the pump is set to the same number of the impeller rotation frequency hz the flow rate changes depending on the depth or pressure of the target zone we tried to find the most stabilized injection and pumping rates with the applied pump in the field condition the determined flow rates for the injection and pumping tests were 6 l min and 10 l min respectively a multiparameter water quality meter prodss ysi inc yellow springs oh usa was used for measuring obtaining the water quality data including ec electrical conductivity ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do by inserting the instrument into the flow cell made by a transparent acrylic cylinder during the pushing and pulling stage of the swpp test fig 2 b 2 2 single well push pull test procedure a few days before the swpp test the groundwater was pumped out of the r4 borehole to fill three separate tanks of 500 liters l 1000 l and 3000 l capacity respectively depending on the prepared volume 500 l was prepared for the chaser 1000 l for sf6 and kr dissolution and 3000 l for co2 and uranine dissolution the water mixing system was designed to be injected into the r4 borehole after passing through the flow cell which was used for real time monitoring of the physicochemical parameters by inserting a multi probe sensor prodds into the flow cell a day before the swpp test co2 gas was injected into the 3000 l tank to obtain co2 gas infused water using the co2 dissolver and water circulation pump a few hours before the first stage of the swpp test sf6 and kr gases were injected into the 1000 l water tank through two 8 inch air stones i e fine bubble diffuser for 4 h to make the inert gas infused water based on the obtained results of pre tests figure s1 afterward 3 g of uranine powder was placed into the 3000 l tank to achieve a concentration of 1 ppm next water was drained at 4 l min and 2 l min from the tank where co2 and inert gas were injected respectively with a combined rate of 6 l min by adjusting the gate valves manually and fixing all valves to maintain a constant flow rate the swpp test can be divided into three stages push rest and pull all gas infused water was injected during the pushing stage first the co2 infused and inert gas infused water were injected with a flow rate of 4 l min and 2 l min respectively followed by the chaser water to push the remaining water in the borehole into the fractured media a total of 2530 l 1596 l co2 infused water 812 l gas tracer infused water 122 l chaser water was injected into the borehole r4 for 420 min the flow rate was carefully controlled and the water was constantly injected at approximately 6 l min through borehole r4 during this stage to obtain the initial concentration c0 of tracer species and chemical data in the mixed water co2 infused water insert gas infused water five time sampling campaigns of injected water and gas were undertaken using a small bypass tube attached to the flow cell for the water sample and open loop and air purging olap system for the gas sample respectively gas tracers with low solubility can readily escape through the surface of the prepared water tank during the pushing stage therefore the initial tracer concentration c0 was measured during the injection to estimate the total mass of gas species injected table 1 represents each tracer s initial concentration and the total injected mass of each tracer with the background conditions after the pushing stage the resting stage was maintained for 5 5 days without water injection or pumping during the resting stage the solubility fractionation between inert gases volume ratio reflecting the given environment according to the solubility of each gas occurred because in this stage the regional groundwater flow is slow and artificial influences are not involved using this physical mechanism which is the equilibration of the gas water volume it can be determined whether the fractured zone is an open closed system by plotting the ratio of each inert gas on the equilibrium trend line holland and gilfillan 2013 as the volume ratio of underground gas water decreases the minor soluble gas tends to be concentrated in the gas phase until the volume ratio is zero vgas vwater 0 the relative solubility of each gas controls the concentration limit if the tested system is closed it is assumed that the phase partitioning behavior is ideal and that the sampled concentration ratios follow the closed fractionation line if the test area is open it can be assumed that some gas phase is continually removed and the ratios follow the rayleigh fractionation line holland and gilfillan 2013 the pumping rate was controlled at 10 l min and since the water recharge drain cell installed in the olap is small 86 5 ml and requires a fine adjustment the extracted water was split into two separate lines one path was used to monitor groundwater physicochemical parameters ph ec temperature and do to measure pco2 by flowing into the olap system and to sample gas tracers the other path was used to sample the groundwater measure the uranine tracer and consistently flow out the rest volume the physicochemical parameters were automatically recorded at 5 min intervals by passing through the flow cell the curves of pco2 and uranine concentration were checked compared to sequentially obtained data the sampling time interval was controlled until the end of the pulling stage the sampling campaign was started with an intensive interval 15 30 or 60 min for a few days to obtain the less varied curves in concentration then the sampling interval was gradually increased max 12 h in the tailing curve part of the concentration shows if it has been confirmed that the physicochemical parameters monitored in real time remain almost recovered to the background value before the pushing stage the sampling campaign with a 12 hour interval was finished additional groundwater was extracted for one week to be sure to return to the environment before the tracer injection thirty eight sampling campaigns were undertaken for one week during the pulling stage one last sample for kr and sf6 was performed on the previous day when the groundwater extraction was ended 20 440 min later from starting the pulling stage 2 3 a rapid method for inert gas monitoring during the swpp test when a push pull test is conducted in the field the initial sampling interval of the groundwater extraction pulling stage is essential to determine the entire period of the pulling stage extraction rate and sample interval during the test because generally the high concentration of tracer is recorded in the initial pulling stage which can significantly affect estimating the recovery ratio thus careful determination of sampling techniques is necessary to detect early change signals that might be missed with an inappropriate technique selection addy et al 2002 hall et al 1991 semprini et al 2005 consequently the high sampling frequency increases the probability of correctly characterizing the btc during the swpp test to be applied in the swpp test with gas tracers a fast sampling method should be considered in the field to maximize data acquired in due time in the present study the swpp test was designed so that each sampling campaign can be completed in 15 min based on the method introduced by sano and fischer 2013 the gas injection and sample collection methods for the kr and sf6 samples can be applied by modifying the olap system the detailed processes of the proposed method for the swpp test in this study are described below 2 4 on site pco2 measurement and inert gas sampling the olap system an on site pco2 analyzer was operated to analyze pco2 in groundwater during the test the system adopted the gas purging method first introduced by swinnerton et al 1962 to analyze dissolved gases in water and a portable system to utilize it in the field test as reported by wilkinson et al 2018 consistent with previous studies this study used equipment by modifying it to continuously analyze pco2 and suit the condition of the study site ha et al 2020a figure s2 the system consists of a purging cell for extracting the dissolved co2 two pumps to deliver groundwater and inject the purging gas and a commercial infrared gas analyzer gmt220 vaisala co finland by delivering groundwater into the purging cell connected to the water volume controller and supplying purging the water continuously the co2 concentration of the gas extracted from the pumped water was measured and recorded by gmt220 in real time until it reached equilibrium the flow rates of the delivered groundwater the purging gas rate and the water volume in the purging cell were optimized for this push pull test as 0 25 l min 0 5 l min and 86 5 ml respectively by referring to the efficient design suggested by butler et al 1988 and dickson et al 2007 the olap system was designed according to sop 5 standard operating procedure dickson et al 2007 and details of the results analysis method basic design structure and precautions can be found in dickson et al 2007 the olap system was continuously operated during the pulling stage of the push pull test and pco2 was measured every 5 s the gas samples for laboratory analysis were sampled using tedlar bags 1 l multi layer foil restek co bellefonte pa usa by connecting them to the outlet tube of the olap system because the system was installed outside the temperature in the purging cell showed slight fluctuations due to the ambient temperature changes but it was negligible when measuring pco2 the pressure in the purging cell was maintained constant during pco2 measurement and gas sampling 2 5 kr and sf6 analysis gas samples from the olap system were analyzed using two kinds of gas chromatography gc devices gc agilent 7890b and 6890 agilent ltd usa detectors via different gc instruments kr gas was measured by gc 7890b equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd maintaining 120 c using ultrapure helium he 99 999 as a carrier gas the molesieve column agilent hp molesieve 30 m 0 53 mm 50 µm was installed in a chiller rw3 2035 lab companion usa that maintains the temperature of the column constant at 30 c to establish a specific retention time that can show the peak of kr the pressure in the sample loop was measured using an inficon capacitance manometer cdg025d 0 1000 torr 0 2 accuracy installed in the gc valve heater for temperature stability a volume of 45 ml was extracted from the gas sample bag using a 50 ml gas tight syringe and then attached to the valve at the front of the sample loop the gas specimen from each sample was analyzed three times with the pressure of the first expansion generally between 120 and 130 torr the peak area over the sample loop pressure ratio was monitored for each gas sample the calculation of the concentration of kr was based on a linear regression line fitted to the ratios from 1008 µmol mol kr standard gas airkorea ltd korea iso 9001 certified institute sf6 gas was measured using an agilent 6890 gc equipped with an electron capture detector ecd using ultrapure nitrogen n2 99 999 as a carrier gas the inlet oven and detector temperatures were maintained at 200 50 and 250 c respectively a capillary column agilent hp plot al203 15 m 0 53 mm 15 µm was used and the carrier gas flow rate was 4 4 ml min the split mode was applied on the inlet with a 5 over 1 ratio the gas specimen was obtained without volume extraction from each sample bag using solid phase micro extraction spme fiber 100 µm pdms supelco ltd usa and manually inserting the sf6 fiber into the gc inlet through the septum and the glass liner sf6 standard gas 101 2 502 9 and 1011 µmol mol airkorea ltd korea was used to make a linear regression line sf6 measurements were conducted three times for each gas sample and calibrated based on the standard line concentrations from the three repeated measurements were then averaged to represent a mean sf6 concentration for each sample these two analysis procedures can be performed simultaneously because the detection time was under 15 min for each gas sample analysis 2 6 on site uranine measurement a field portable instrument a fluorometer 10 086r 10 au fluorometer turner designs usa was used to detect the uranine tracer approximately 7 ml of the extracted water was filled in a transparent glass tube φ13 mm x 100 mm and inserted into the instrument the discrete sample analyses were applied and by checking the lamp condition the standard solution 1 ppm mg l was measured after every water sample measurement measurements were performed thrice for each sample e g a total of 27 ml was used and the used glass tube was cleaned using distilled water the detection limit was 0 01 ppb µg l uranine in water and the same standard solution confirmed all detected values 2 7 acquired data utilization and evaluation 2 7 1 applying the physical chemistry of inert gases phase partitioning characteristics of noble gasses help determine the existence of different phases within the subsurface darrah et al 2014 gilfillan et al 2009 györe et al 2021 kharaka and specht 1988 pinti and marty 1995 especially phase partitioning in gas and water systems has been determined for various environments amonette et al 2019 darrah et al 2014 gilfillan et al 2009 zhou and ballentine 2006 if the subsurface system is identified using the phase partitioning of artificially injected noble gases it could be used to ensure the stability of repositories containing radioactive waste or co2 by determining whether the storage has an open or closed system the distribution of noble gases between the gaseous and liquid phases is based on henry s law ballentine et al 2002 which states the relationship between substances as a dissolved phase and gaseous phase eq 1 1 c i g a s k i d c i w a t e r where c i g a s and c i w a t e r are the concentrations of noble gas species i in the gaseous and water phases respectively l3 m and k i d is the dimensionless henry constant of noble gas species i the type of equilibrium system of the environment has to be defined to determine the degree of phase partitioning between the two phases ballentine et al 2002 the two types of systems are the closed and open systems which differ in terms of whether the partitioned gas phase is maintained within the system or lost from the system ballentine et al 2002 in the case of a closed system batch model equilibrium is assumed between the gaseous and water phase concentration the number of moles can be calculated with henry s constant units of molality for each inert gas as follows 2 n g n t r t ρ l v l γ n φ n k i m v g 1 1 where n g a n d t are the number of moles in the gaseous phase and the total in the system on the used noble gas r is the standard gas constant 0 082 pl3mol 1t 1 ρ l is the density of the liquid ml 3 t is temperature v l a n d v g are the volume of liquid and gas respectively l3 γ n is the liquid phase activity coefficient φ n is the gas phase fugacity coefficient and k i m is henry s constant mpmol 1 the corresponding equation which depicts the relationship between the noble gas concentrations and total concentrations in the volume can be related to the source ratio in the system according to bosch and mazor 1988 expressed by 3 i a i b g i a i b t v g v l 1 k i a d v g v l 1 k i b d i a and i b are the numbers of moles in each noble gas a and b respectively moles i a i b g and i a i b t are the ratios of noble gas a and b within the gas phase and the whole system including the gas and liquid phases respectively v g v l is the volume ratio between the gas and liquid phase and k i a a n d b d is the dimensionless henry s constant of each noble gas a and b as for the open system continuous loss of phase partitioned noble gases to the gas phase is considered to proceed which results from extensive phase partitioning relative to the closed system this mechanism is expressed based on rayleigh s law expressed as follows 4 i a i b l i q u i d i a i b t f α 1 α k a w a t e r m k b w a t e r m where f is the fraction of b noble gas remaining in the liquid phase the type of system can be determined by the relative similarity of the sample point values with the phase partitioning lines corresponding to each system this comparison can allow the characterization of the physical mechanisms that have influenced the groundwater along its flow path and the quantification of the degree of phase partitioning the samples have gone through scott et al 2021 tyne et al 2021 data accumulation through various experiments is required one of the objectives of the present study is to determine whether sf6 can follow the open closed model of equilibrium partitioning between phases gaseous and liquid with another inert gas kr and whether the acquired data on sf6 provide information that can aid the understanding of the mechanism at the fractured aquifer sf6 is a non polar species commonly used as tracers by mixing with other noble gasses and many related studies have been conducted freifeld et al 2005 lu et al 2012 straujkova et al 2020 however further studies are still necessary to explain the physical partitioning phenomenon between sf6 and other gasses in the highly gas saturated porous media freifeld et al 2005 stalker et al 2015 the reason may be due to the sampling intervals monitoring distances and operational difficulties during field experiments boreham et al 2011 stalker et al 2015 and the interpretation of fractionation among the inert gasses may also vary depending on the solubility difference problem e g 35 mg l for sf6 and 234 mg l for kr vulava et al 2002 solubility xe kr sf6 ar ne he gallardo et al 1990 reid et al 1987 2 7 2 applying for effective porosity and linear velocity estimation acquired conservative tracer data derived from the swpp test can be used for estimating groundwater velocity and effective porosity in the area where the test is conducted hall et al 1991 hall et al 1991 provided two eqs 7 and 8 to estimate the physical parameters porosity and velocity of the tested aquifer based on darcy s law equation and the regional advective velocity equation leap and kaplan 1988 as follow 5 υ k i n e 6 υ q t p π b n e t d where υ is the average linear velocity lt 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 i is the hydraulic gradient ll 1 and n e is the effective porosity q is a constant pumping rate l3t 1 during recovery of the tracers t p is the elapsed time t from the start of pumping to the center of tracer mass is recovered t d is the resting time plus t p t and b is the aquifer thickness l if eqs 5 and 6 are valid in the tested aquifer the two equations can be rearranged to derive the effective porosity and groundwater velocity 7 n e π b k 2 i 2 t d 2 q t p and 8 υ q t p π b t d 2 k i by applying these basic models validated by several studies chen and wang 2021 gelhar and collins 1971 haggerty et al 2001 istok et al 1997 schroth and istok 2006 schroth et al 2000 on the obtained tracer data presented here the modified and rapid method of the swpp test to analyze the inert gasses in the present study it is possible to determine whether the suggested method is reliable to interpret the hydrogeological properties with the swpp test the basic assumptions for estimating the effective porosity and linear velocity are that the targeted aquifer has a homogeneous condition the background velocity of groundwater is negligible compared to the velocity induced by the pump and the condition that the groundwater is saturated between two packers is sustained until the end of the pulling stage istok et al 1997 schroth and istok 2006 the input values were 10 l min for the pumping rate 2 50e 5 m s for the hydraulic conductivity 0 01 for the hydraulic gradient measured between h4 and r4 fig 1 and 7920 min for the draft time the value of the hydraulic conductivity was calculated based on the cubic law cook 2003 using fracture spacing about 1 m intervals and apertures 0 18 6 54 cm these properties of the fractures were derived using imagej https https imagej nih gov ij based on bips images figure s3 1 and s3 2 in supplementary material the elapsed time extracting the center of mass of the recovered tracer was estimated using a simple formula as t p t 1 m 1 t 2 m 2 t n m n t o t a l m a s s t sampling time m the concentration of the tracers payne et al 2008 these elapsed time durations were represented differently depending on the tracer of sf6 kr and uranine because the btc of each tracer was different 2 7 3 applying a two dimensional analytical transport solution an analytical solution can be used for understanding the transport of gas tracers with distance and time dependent transport coefficients zheng and bennett 2002 to verify that the modified and rapid method as suggested in this study provides the variables including sf6 kr uranine and co2 transport the two dimensional model was applied to the obtained results of the swpp test because double inflatable packers isolated the test zone at 6 m 8 m height it is assumed that the source has a patch shape as the cylindrical boundary and the top and bottom boundary have the no flow condition 2 d model can be conceived from the original formula neville 1994 and is expressed as follows 9 c x y t x 4 b π d x 0 t c 0 t ξ 1 ξ 3 e x p λ ξ x v ξ 2 4 d x ξ e r f c y y 0 2 d y ξ e r f c y y 0 2 d y ξ d ξ where x is the plume travel distance during the pushing stage of the swpp test l b is the aquifer thickness l d x and d y are effective dispersion coefficients for longitudinal and transverse directions respectively d x y d x y r d x y α l t h ν d r is retardation factor d x y is the constant dispersion coefficient α l t r is longitudinal and horizontal transverse dispersivity υ is linear velocity lt 1 d is the content diffusion coefficient of mass kr sf6 uranine and co2 c 0 t is the initial concentration of tracers ml 3 t is total mass recovery time t ξ is elapsed time t at the specific concentration c ξ λ is the first order reactive rate assumed 0 in this study v is a groundwater velocity υ r lt 1 y is the source width y 2 π r r is the borehole radius 0 0381 m l and y 0 y 2 l the input variables were calculated and adjusted to the swpp test condition as much as possible the linear velocity was derived using eq 8 using uranine btc in the case of the travel distance of the plume through the fractured zone the initial source boundary location x would not exceed the range of the fracture length 14 28 m which was derived using the pkn and kgd model geertsma and de klerk 1969 khristianovic and zheltov 1955 nordgren 1972 perkins and kern 1961 with the monitored pressure at the inside of packers during the pushing stage and the fracture information derived from the bips in addition the effective radius or radius of influence caused by a hydraulic test with packers can be suggested by 5 10 m royle 2002 yihdego 2017 thus the two dimensional model on the swpp test was conducted assuming the source boundary location x as 5 and 10 m r value was changed to match the obtained data assuming that the degree of retardation may differ for each gas tracer according to the physicochemical properties the conservative tracer uranine non sorbing tracer can be used as a standard tracer for estimating the transport of other tracers through the fractured zone because it is least influenced by uncertain external factors e g chemical reaction with rock or other tracers shook et al 2004 and is almost fully recovered after the end of the swpp test as shown in figure 4 right a representative value of the linear velocity was calculated by using the btc of the uranine tracer two scenarios were conducted according to the value of distance x as 5 and 10 m by changing the two variables including the dispersive coefficient d x and d y and the retardation factor r zheng and bennett 2002 the modeled curve was calculated until the best matched result was derived with the uranine tracer s btc and based on this the retardation value r was changed to match the concentration curve of other tracers each derived input value can be summarized as shown in table 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 the results of the swpp test there was an initial variation period for all real time monitored variables including do ec ph and hydraulic pressure between the two packers it is believed that a change in conditions was generated due to a sudden pressure change as the groundwater was extracted in the initial pulling stage afterward a recovery period was observed in the parameters in a short time and then they approached the background level until the pulling stage ended fig 3 the monitored do ph and ec ranges were 1 6 7 2 mg l 6 67 8 08 and 177 9 328 5 µs cm respectively the variation in do was adjusted promptly to a stabilized value over 5 0 mg l in 5 min and increased near the background concentration 6 99 mg l a high ph value is initially observed which then falls becoming low immediately and returning to the background value after five minutes the monitored value ph 6 67 was slightly lower than the background ph 7 12 this behavior may be due to the presence of a buffering effect secondary derived carbonate minerals e g ca mg capable of accepting a large amount of low ph water ha et al 2020b in such a context it is considered that ec values increased gradually because ion solubility in groundwater was changed the monitored ec started at a lower value 177 9 µs cm than the background value 222 1 µs cm and then increased gradually to 328 8 µs cm and decreased after 279 min the variation of ec values with the elapsed time implies that mineral dissolution from the rock aquifer has been derived from the low ph caused by dissolved co2 the ec values also showed a recovery curve to the background value although not completely recovered as the swpp test progressed considering that the hydraulic pressure between the two packers was stably monitored within a specific range as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the groundwater was steadily and continuously extracted through the interval between the two packers during the pulling stage the monitored concentration curves of sf6 kr uranine and pco2 were represented by normalized values for comparison with the same elapsed time as shown in fig 4 after starting the pulling stage the peak concentrations were obtained sequentially at 40 138 160 and 295 min for pco2 kr sf6 and uranine although each btc of tracers had a different peak time the shapes of curves were primarily similar in the entire pulling stage in the case of the uranine tracer btc s falling limb was gentler than other tracers the reason is that although the uranine tracer is non reactive and non phase changing material it seems that some slight adsorption to the surrounding inorganic materials composed of sio2 68 al2o3 15 was reflected in the btc bork et al 2020 kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 the btc of other tracers had a sharp curve compared to the uranine tracer because the gas tracers of sf6 kr and pco2 have the property of degassing from the dissolved phase depending on the solubility of each gas species it is considered to have been reduced relatively quickly the recovery rates for each tracer are presented on the right side of fig 4 the most recovered tracer was the uranine tracer and the mass recovery rate was 95 49 sf6 tracer showed the lowest recovery rate with 25 71 in the case of the co2 tracer injected with the enormous mass the recovery rate was 51 80 the kr tracer showed a significant mass recovery rate of 85 43 despite having the characteristics of the gaseous phase 3 2 evaluating the flow mechanism during the pulling stage using fractionation between sf6 and kr tracers sf6 and kr tracers were compared using the batch and rayleigh models ballentine et al 2002 the gas partitioning was checked to verify if it would generally follow two model lines despite the sf6 being intensely volatile similar to 3h clark et al 2005 easily accumulating in gas pockets and causing delayed transport vulava et al 2002 the blue dashed line shows the open system line from the injected concentration c0 of the gas tracer if the concentrations lie on this line it could mean that the partitioned gasses are continuously removed from one system to another these other potential systems could be a gas blurb e g co2 ch4 in the subsurface environment holland and gilfillan 2013 zhou et al 2005 an unisolated part of the borehole and another reservoir connected by geologic fractures barry et al 2016 the pink dash line represents the closed system line if the ratios of the obtained data follow this line the target zone could be assumed to be isolated from another system sf6 tracer could be used to model the gas partitioning dependent on the solubility of each gas it means that the molecules are interacting between the water and the gas in the isolated space as shown in fig 5 the ratio between two tracers kr and sf6 was plotted on the solubility controlled rayleigh fractionation lines it follows as the sampling time elapsed the ratio mark was plotted diagonally from the upper right to the lower left based on the displayed concentration ratio according to the sample times and the closer and farther away from the closed system line the plume behavior mechanism can be interpreted by dividing it into three steps according to characteristics as the first step it can be seen that the samples are clustered in a confined area near the open system line between 10 and 510 min as shown in fig 5 this phenomenon can be interpreted as co2 which degasses relatively rapidly from the groundwater and acts as a carrier gas due to a sudden pressure change when the pump is operated in addition as shown in fig 3 the pressure between the packers increased rapidly at the beginning of the pulling stage and then recovered to a stable pressure in the second step the plume was constantly pulled and began to enter a stable section from 630 to 4410 min because most of the sampled concentration ratios were demonstrated following the closed system line potentially no gas was lost to the external system during the pulling stage in other words the multi tracer dissolved water was expected to behave only through the fractured zone it is assumed that the injected water would have been isolated well from other potential systems if only artificial factors could have been excluded in the final step from 5862 to 20 440 min the background diluted the existing concentrations in the plume because the end migrated through the fractures for a long time and was exposed to the background groundwater therefore the ratio of the tracers was gradually plotted in the direction of the background ratio out of the closed system line 3 3 estimating the effective porosity and linear velocity using conservative tracers the acquired sf6 kr and uranine data were used to estimate the effective porosity and the linear groundwater velocity through the fractured zone of the rock aquifer isolated by two packers in the present study the center of mass for each tracer was applied in eqs 7 and 8 the elapsed times for obtaining the center of mass of the plume migration through the fractured aquifer were 426 1 642 1 and 527 9 min for sf6 kr and uranine respectively based on the evaluated elapse time the effective porosity of the targeted zone was calculated using eq 7 and derived as 0 20 0 14 and 0 17 for sf6 kr and uranine respectively the linear groundwater velocity was calculated using eq 8 as 0 017 0 025 and 0 021 m d for each tracer the input parameters and calculated results for each tracer are summarized in table 3 the elapsed times were different suggesting different physical and chemical characteristics of the tracers the time of the peak concentration for kr sf6 and uranine were 138 160 and 295 min respectively and the difference in the peak time between gas tracers was 22 min 18 lag rate while for uranine tracer compared with kr was delayed with 157 min 113 lag rate the reason can be understood by the difference in the aqueous diffusion coefficient of 4 5 8 73 and 14 5 10 10 m2s 1 for uranine sf6 and kr respectively king and saltzman 1995 skagius and neretnieks 1986 wise and houghton 1968 the more molecular diffusion coefficients increase the more gas tracers can diffuse into the rock matrix and relatively being limited the tracer migration from the testing borehole to the fractured zone during the resting stage hoffmann et al 2020 therefore the peak concentration appears early if the diffusion coefficient is relatively larger than other tracers in this sense the center of kr mass plume diffused relatively widely around the borehole showed last among injected tracers 642 1 min the mass plume center of uranine which is a powder solute that can be adsorbed in inorganic material kasnavia et al 1999 sabatini 2000 appeared 527 9 min and the center of sf6 mass plume arrived fastest 426 1 min among those tracers despite the difference in the btc characteristics appearing depending on whether the tracer was solid gas or physically chemically different they all provided similar linear velocity effective porosity values these results implied that the btc of each trace was obtained by well reflecting the hydrogeological properties during the resting and pulling stages thus the center of mass times was derived similarly therefore using a non reactive gas can be considered an essential tracer and implied that a more significant result in dissolved gas flow through the aquifer can be obtained if the purpose is to understand the migration of leaked co2 by conducting the swpp test 3 4 evaluating the multi tracer transport through the fractured zone the best fitted curves derived from the two dimensional analytical transport model are represented in fig 6 with red blue orange and purple colors for sf6 kr uranine and pco2 respectively the others are shown with gray lines the empty circles are the observed data for sf6 kr uranine and pco2 representing the elapsed time during the pulling stage of the swpp test two assumptions were adopted according to the plume travel distances 5 and 10 m as stated in the previous methods section some variables were fixed by the values derived using the btc of the uranine tracer such as the dispersivity coefficient α l t r and the linear velocity υ the values of the dispersivity coefficient were applied depending on the plume travel distances as α l 10 m α t r 1 m for 5 m plume travel and α l 25 m α t r 2 5 m for 10 m plume travel based on the standard variables above the modeled btcs matched the other tracers by changing the value of the retardation factor r thus in the case of the 5 m plume travel when r were 2 8 3 0 and 3 5 the best fitted curves were for sf6 kr and pco2 respectively in the case of the 10 m plume travel distance the best fitted curves were derived when r were 1 5 1 8 and 2 0 for sf6 kr and pco2 respectively considering that relatively small r values would have drawn btcs faster v υ r the results of the modeled btcs indicate that the concentration curves of sf6 and kr tracer were obtained earlier than pco2 as demonstrated by the previous studies flohr et al 2021 kilgallon et al 2018 myers et al 2013 however the initial peak times of observed btcs were not followed in the previous studies different results of inert gas btcs may be derived depending on the various field conditions based on the inert gas tracer mixed with injected co2 which could act as early warnings of co2 leakage kilgallon et al 2018 e g complexity heterogeneity myers et al 2013 for unidirectional flows i e a plume flowing out of the repository and moving in one direction because the inert gas has a lower solubility than co2 which is depicted as a leading curve is a potential warning however a different mechanism may be shown in obtaining co2 and inert gas concentration curves in reciprocating flows such as the push pull test in addition if it is assumed that two packers are entirely isolated the tested zone and the target zone are not connected with the atmosphere via any pathways so sudden pressure changes are potentially generated in the isolated zone at the beginning of water extraction in a short time fig 3 this pressure change would cause the gases remaining under the upper packer to be re dissolved into the groundwater quickly as shown by the peak concentration of co2 monitored earlier than the inert gas tracers at least in the place expected to be an isolated zone e g co2 storage waste repository sf6 or kr can be applied as a combined inert reacting tracer test method for estimating the contact area between dissolved degassed gas mass flows through a fractured zone and the rock medium hawkins et al 2018 in addition because the best fit curves of the inert gas tracers were derived with the r value which was similar to that of pco2 in the case of studies related to gas leakage it can be implied that the use of gas tracers might be more likely to provide essential information than conservative tracers such as uranine salt etc the non reactive tracers uranine sf6 and kr tended to fit nicely between the modeled curves and the observed data until the end of the curves as shown in fig 6 in contrast it was challenging to match the calculated curve after 5000 min in the case of observed pco2 data this reason can be interpreted in various ways for example the injected high concentration of co2 may remain the low concentration of co2 may continue in the background inconclusive geochemical react interactions may exist between rocks and groundwater and two or three sources may be mixed the application of the two dimensional analysis model confirmed that the data obtained using the proposed method in this study could be used to understand the hydrological characteristics of the fractured aquifer furthermore the gas tracer migration analysis was possible depending on the plume travel distance and different curves could be calculated depending on the gas tracer accordingly the sampling method suggested in this study could identify the fractured aquifer characteristics 4 conclusion this study performed the swpp test that injected sf6 kr and uranine as tracers to investigate gas dissolved plume migration characteristics through the isolated fracture zone a frequent and rapid sampling method was applied from the beginning of the pulling stage to obtain reliable and interpretable data curves through the swpp test mainly when targeting a rock aquifer the acquired data were applied to obtain reasonable estimates of the effective porosity and linear velocity which are the essential parameters for understanding the subsurface flow system gas tracers data of the swpp test were used to estimate inert gas fractionation and then to a two dimensional advection dispersion model to compare the observed and the computed concentration distributions in the region and timespan of interest the estimation and comparison provided information that could facilitate understanding the hydraulic and transport characteristics of the target zone and local geologic structure influencing the tracer distribution and subsurface co2 for ccs leakage monitoring in addition the approximated travel distance of the dissolved gas tracers through the apertures could be assumed based on the 2 d analytical model the analytical model results imply that dispersion may play a significant advection role in the migration of the dissolved gas plume through the isolated fracture zone although the uranine tracer is a useful conservative tracer it seems more reasonable to use an inert gas tracer to investigate the dissolved gas s plume behavior as a high retardation value can be matched the breakthrough curve compared to other tracers the results have confirmed that the early warning role of the inert gas tracers can be demonstrated differently as suggested in previous studies due to the uncertain physical mechanism of mass accumulation and dissolved gas plume migration in the case of the swpp test such mechanisms would have to be clarified through further studies credit authorship contribution statement won tak joun conceptualization

care additives cpcas as part of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are emerging environmental contaminants of concern and are often considered pseudopersistent compounds especially in aquatic environments godoy and kummrow 2017 due to increasing consumption incomplete metabolism and incomplete removal in treatment plants chaturvedi et al 2021 collado et al 2014 rashid and liu 2021 apparently their pseudopersistence could and will lead to long term harm to the environment despite the low ambient concentrations bolong et al 2009 li et al 2021b acute and chronic exposure to these toxic substances such as eyeliner eyeshadow mascara nail polish may lead to serious health problems abbas et al 2022 chemicals including organic and inorganic ultraviolet filters parabens triclosan and others can cause metabolic interference and cell damage in organisms resulting in developmental and behavioral abnormalities genotoxicity and neurotoxicity carve et al 2021 khalil et al 2022 lozano et al 2020 generally cpcas occur in the form of mixtures in the environment obviously the toxicity of mixtures cannot be described simply by the summation of component concentrations and toxic equivalents but rather exhibit interactions that can produce toxic effects such as addition synergism and antagonism kar and leszczynski 2019 sigurnjak bureš et al 2021 for example the ecotoxicity of these mixtures may be higher than the effects of each component and a toxicity response can occur even if all components are at concentrations below their individual no observed effect concentration noec backhaus 2014 therefore studying the toxicity of cpca mixtures is crucial to evaluate the ecotoxicological risks the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model for predictive toxicology is a mathematical relationship between a chemical s quantitative molecular descriptors and its toxicological endpoint cronin and yoon 2019 qsar has been widely used in the study of contaminant toxicology prediction and can compensate for the lack of ecotoxicological data of contaminants reduce experimental costs and help to evaluate the uncertainty of experimental data properly validated models can predict toxicity for chemicals within the applicability of the models to complement or replace experimental observations carnesecchi et al 2020 khan et al 2019 considerable research has been conducted examining the toxicity of ppcps based on qsar models for instance qsar models have been developed concerning the environmental fate and toxicity of ultraviolet filter substances westphal et al 2020 and to predict the toxicity of transformation byproducts of synthetic musk a fragrance additive widely used in cpcas li et al 2021a additionally qsar models have been applied to examine toxicity on various mixtures of commonly used antibiotics and pesticides qin et al 2018 wang et al 2018b apparently these studies focused mainly on the effects of individual compounds or mixtures of pharmaceutical products on the aquatic environment seldom focusing on mixtures of cpcas government regulations are perceived as keeping poison out of cpcas however these products applications including face body and sun care color cosmetics showers and baths deodorants shampoos etc may have less oversight than other consumer products unfortunately cpcas are continually released into the aquatic environment and are biologically active and persistent but the aquatic toxicity of their mixture is still not very clear this knowledge gap needs to be addressed to develop definitive aquatic risk assessments in addition there are many outstanding issues in qsar studies of mixture toxicity such as the selection of suitable descriptors and the calculation of mixture descriptors as well as the need for more rigorous internal and external validation in this context the major goal of this work is to gain insight into the aquatic toxicity of mixtures of cpcas five chemicals and to develop suitable qsar models for toxicity prediction the basis of the selection of these chemicals is their coexistence in aquatic environments and they are widely used as cpcas leusch et al 2019 wang et al 2021a 2021b the mixture ratio was designed by the direct equipartition ray design equray procedure dou et al 2011 and the toxicity data were obtained by an acute toxicity test on daphnia magna we analyzed the toxicity interactions and developed qsar models which examines different mixture descriptors calculations by different methods and propose a new comprehensive parameter that integrates internal and external validation criteria for qsar models performance evaluation a reliable quantitative structure activity relationship was obtained to inform the toxicity prediction of cpca mixtures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and acute toxicity test the test chemicals table 1 with 99 purity including benzophenone bzp methylparaben mpb bisphenol a bpa galaxolide hhcb and triclosan tcs were purchased from j k scientific co beijing china the five chemicals were mixed in pairs to form a total of 10 mixture systems according to the equray procedure five mixture rays were designed for each binary mixture system table 2 for a total of 50 mixture rays in 10 binary mixture systems by setting 2 3 as the suitable dilution factor 6 levels in the set experiment concentration range table a 1 of supplementary material a sm thereafter were specified for each mixture ray the acute toxicity data of 330 tests including 50 6 tests of the mixture systems and 5 6 tests of the individual toxicity test of five chemicals were obtained by the 48 hour activity inhibition test on daphnia magna following the organization for economic cooperation and development guideline 202 oecd 2004 the daphnia magna were obtained from the laboratory animal monitoring institute of guangdong province china the chlorella sp for feeding daphnia magna were purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology in china the daphnia magna were cultivated at 22 1 c under a 16 h light 8 h dark photoperiod after three generations of parthenogenesis juvenile fleas 6 24 h old were used for the exposure test the test conditions were the same as the incubation conditions light avoidance experiments would be conducted if the test substances were unstable in light three parallel experiments were performed for all tests with 12 daphnids in each test solution 24 ml without feeding during the test after 48 h of exposure the number of immobile individuals was counted and recorded 2 2 concentration response curve crc fitting and mixture toxicity analysis the observed 50 effective concentration ec50 data were obtained by fitting the concentration and test toxicity effect data into nonlinear curves all concentrations are in mol l unless otherwise stated the four parameter log logistic function logit function and weibull function detailed in sm a were used for crc fitting qin et al 2021 ritz 2010 the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used for iteration and the best fitting curve with effect was selected based on aic akaike information criteria and bic bayesian information criteria in origin 2020b as classical models the concentration addition ca model and the independent action ia model have been widely used to predict and analyze the toxic effect of mixtures mainly for qualitatively judging the toxic effect of the mixture the ca model eq 1 berenbaum 1985 is suitable for a mixture system in which all components exert their effects through the same mechanism of action moa the ia model eq 2 bliss 1939 is applicable to the case in which the components in the mixture system exert their effects through completely different moas villa et al 2012 1 e c x m i x i n p i e c x i 1 where e c x m i x is the concentration of mixture provoking an x effect predicted by ca e c x i is the concentration of component i provoking the same effect of x when applied individually and p i is the concentration proportion of component i in the mixture 2 e c m i x 1 i 1 n 1 e c i where e c m i x is the effect of the mixture c m i x is the concentration of the mixture and e c i is the effect of the component with a concentration of c i the prediction results of the ca and ia models indicate the combined toxic effect as follows qin et al 2018 2021 a e c 50 c a or e c 50 i a ranges in the 95 confidence interval ci of e c 50 o b s indicate an additive effect b e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a less than e c 50 l o w e r and larger than e c 50 u p p e r respectively indicate a partial additive effect c e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a less than e c 50 l o w e r indicate an antagonistic effect d e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a larger than e c 50 u p p e r indicate a synergistic effect e c 50 l o w e r and e c 50 u p p e r are the lower and upper values of the 95 ci respectively synergistic and antagonistic effects are considered nonadditive effects the predictive accuracy of the ca and ia models was quantified for each ray by the model deviation ratio mdr belden et al 2007 which was calculated by dividing the predicted toxicity by the observed toxicity the root mean square error rmse and accuracy rate ar number of correctly predicted total number were used to evaluate the performance of the model prediction qu et al 2019 the predicted value was considered correct if it was within the 95 ci of e c 50 o b s 2 3 descriptor calculation the molecular descriptors of the five target chemicals were obtained through the pubchem database kim et al 2021 estimation program interface epi suite v4 11 usepa 2012 quantum chemical software gaussian 16 rev c 01 and gaussview version 6 dennington et al 2016 frisch et al 2016 and the padel descriptor software chirico et al 2021 the epi suite was applied to calculate physical and chemical parameters as descriptors gaussian and gaussview were used for molecular structure optimization and frequency analysis of 5 chemicals through density functional theory at the b3lyp 6 31g d level the optimized molecular structure files were used as input to the padel descriptor software for descriptor calculation mixture descriptors can be calculated from a function eq 3 of the molecular descriptors d i of the components that make up the mixture and their molar fractions x i gaudin et al 2015 3 d m i x f x i d i sixteen equations satisfying this functional relation were used to calculate the mixture descriptors detailed in sm a chatterjee and roy 2021 gaudin et al 2015 qin et al 2018 2021 sobati et al 2016 the 16 equations d mix v v 1 16 were divided into two categories direct combinations d m i x 1 11 describing the direct correlation with the properties of each component and deviation combinations d m i x 12 16 describing the deviation of the properties of each component from the linear contribution of their respective concentrations 2 4 dataset division and descriptor filtering the dataset was split into training and test sets at a ratio of 80 20 rational approaches that are more suitable for a small dataset with 50 500 chemicals were chosen to avoid the information loss caused by dataset partitioning three different partitioning techniques including kennard stone s algorithm kennard and stone 1969 division ksd euclidean distance based division dbd and sorted activity based division abd were applied here details are reported in sm a two methods were applied for descriptor filtering one is the genetic algorithm ga leardi et al 1992 which simulates the process of heredity and evolution of organisms in the natural environment the other method is stepwise multiple linear regression s mlr agostinelli 2002 which is used for the selection of the most relevant descriptors from the descriptors pool which depend on the mixtures in the training set ga and s mlr were carried out using tools provided in a previous study ambure et al 2015 the parameters employed and details are reported in table a 2 before filtering descriptors with ga and s mlr all the descriptors were preprocessed as follows constant descriptors with the same or almost the same value were removed with a variance cutoff value 0 001 interrelated descriptors with a correlation coefficient 0 99 were identified and one of the interrelated descriptors was removed descriptors scaling was employed by z score normalization eq 4 to normalize the descriptors to a uniform scale 4 d d d σ where d is the normalized descriptor value d and d are the original value and its mean value respectively and σ represents the population standard deviation of descriptor value d 2 5 model development models were developed by linear multiple linear regression mlr and partial least squares regression pls and nonlinear support vector machine regression svm methods mlr based on the ordinary least squares method is the most common statistical method widely used in qsar studies gramatica et al 2016 onlu and sacan 2018 salmani et al 2021 tang et al 2020 pls is a generalization of mlr and extracts latent variables lvs by considering information in both the independent and dependent variables the number of lvs is based on the q l o o 2 of leave one out loo cross validation stop extracting lvs if further addition of lvs does not increase the q l o o 2 of the training set by at least 5 regression is performed for the extracted lvs chatterjee and roy 2021 wold et al 2001 as a nonlinear method svm is suitable for small datasets and has the advantage of effectively avoiding overfitting and the disaster of dimensionality with excellent generalization ability cortes and vapnik 1995 the algorithm was implemented in the matlab platform with a library for svm libsvm chang and lin 2011 the most widely used radial basis kernel function rbf is selected cortes and vapnik 1995 then ga was applied for parameter including penalty factor c and parameters g and p in the kernel function tuning the number of populations was set to 20 for 100 iterations and parameters were determined in the loo cross validation on the training set the svm models were then developed with the optimal parameters 2 6 model validation and evaluation statistical parameters for internal and external validation were applied to evaluate the goodness of fit robustness and predictive power of the qsar models r a d j t r 2 and r m s e t r were used to measure the goodness of fit of the models developed by the training set the internal validation is performed by loo cross validation to characterize the robustness based on q l o o 2 and r m s e l o o c v for external validation r 2 based parameters and error based parameters were used to assess the external predictive quality of the models lavado et al 2021 r 2 based parameters include q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 and the concordance correlation coefficient c c c which quantifies the similarity between predicted and observed values as a single criterion gramatica and sangion 2016 the selected error based parameter was r m s e e x t which better reveals differences in model performance by assigning higher weights to larger errors than other error based metrics chai and draxler 2014 acceptable thresholds for the above parameters can be used to select reliable models roy and kar 2015 the thresholds for the parameters are r a d j 2 0 6 q l o o 2 0 5 q f 1 2 q f 2 2 0 6 and c c c 0 85 chirico and gramatica 2012 to select the best model among the developed qsar models we tried to integrate all the statistical parameters for evaluation as well as to combine scatter plots of predicted values compared with observed values for model performance analysis to find unreliable qsar models hidden by good statistical parameters we created a comprehensive parameter cp to unify the above statistical parameters through a weighting method bayesian statistical method was used to determine the weighting coefficients through the prior information from the experience all the three factors are crucial for the performance of qsar model while the predictive power is of more importance cherkasov et al 2014 according to our final weight allocation of 0 3 0 3 and 0 4 the cp performs well and provides a good support for comparing the performance differences of qsar models these statistical parameters are transformed into cp based on the following three criteria 1 r a d j t r 2 q l o o 2 q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 a n d c c c as high as possible for the model to have great goodness of fit robustness and external predictive power alexander et al 2015 gramatica 2014 2 r a d j t r 2 a n d q l o o 2 as close as possible to ensure that the model has high robustness gramatica and sangion 2016 3 r m s e t r r m s e l o o c v and r m s e e x t are as low and close as possible indicating that the model has both predictivity and sufficient generalizability gramatica 2007 the resulting expression for cp is given as follows 5 c p 0 3 r a d j t r 2 0 3 q l o o 2 0 1 q f 1 e x t 2 0 1 q f 2 e x t 2 0 2 c c c 0 3 r m s e t r 0 1 r m s e l o o c v 0 1 r a d j t r 2 q l

mentioned in section 2 2 were also used to evaluate the performance of the qsar models for the quantitative prediction of mixture toxicity 6 m d r p r e d i c t e d p e c 50 o b s e r v e d p e c 50 1 n 100 where n is the size of the whole dataset 2 7 applicability domain in this study the descriptors space covered by the training set mixtures was taken as the application domain defined by the leverage approach from the hat matrix the application domain was visualized with a williams plot of leverage value hi versus standardized residuals δ hi was calculated through the mixture descriptors by eq 7 and the warning leverage h was fixed at 3 m 1 n δ was calculated by eq 8 7 h i x i x t x 1 x i t i 1 n 8 δ y i y i i 1 n y i y i 2 n m 1 where x i is the descriptor row vector of the mixture i x is the matrix formed by m descriptor values of the n training set samples and the superscript t denotes the transpose of the matrix or vector y i and y i are the observed and predicted values of mixture i respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity of the target chemicals and mixture rays for the concentration response relationship of 5 target chemicals and 50 mixture rays all were well fitted with at least one of the logit weibull or log logistic functions table a 3 and fig a 1 the toxicity of the five types of cpcas to daphnia magna increased in the order bzp mpb bpa hhcb tcs with ec50 values ranging from 1 68 10 6 to 1 50 10 4 mol l table 1 these results were similar to the ecotoxicology ecotox knowledgebase olker et al 2022 the most toxic mixture is hhcb tcs r1 the ray in which the most toxic chemical tcs accounted for the largest proportion and the least toxic mixture is bzp mpb r5 the least toxic chemical bzp accounted for the largest proportion corresponding to an ec50 ranging from 2 72 10 6 to 2 06 10 4 mol l table 2 the range of cpcas mixture toxicity is approximately 1 4 times the range of toxicity of individual chemicals 3 2 mixture toxicity predicted by ca and ia models the predicted values of e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a and the combined toxic effects at 50 effect are summarized in table 2 the results predicted by ca and ia show that 35 of 50 mixtures had additive or partial additive effects at the e c 50 level 12 mixtures were synergistic and 3 mixtures were antagonistic the synergism of the mixtures was caused mainly by mpb since 75 of the mixtures that caused synergism contained mpb and 4 out of 5 mixture rays of mpb hhcb had a synergistic effect this finding is consistent with the conclusion reached in a previous study that binary mixtures containing mpb had higher synergistic potency than binary mixtures without mpb di poi et al 2017 additionally this finding can be reconfirmed by findings obtained in another report that paraben mixed at noec can produce a response darbre 2009 therefore the combined exposure of mpb with other substances in the aquatic environment especially with hhcb should be avoided in the risk management of cpcas most of the predicted p e c 50 the negative logarithm of e c 50 a larger p e c 50 value means greater toxicity with the ca and ia models deviated from the observed values fig 1 the mdrs for ca were in the range of 0 51 2 27 table 2 indicating that the observed effective concentrations were within 0 5 2 times the predicted values for the 50 mixtures 27 mdr values were greater than 1 23 were less than 1 and the median was 1 01 indicating unbiased estimates overall belden et al previously compiled the results of 207 experiments in which the ca model was applied to predict mixture toxicity and evaluated the accuracy belden et al 2007 showing that 88 of the experiments had observed effective concentrations within a factor of 2 of predicted values with a median mdr value of 1 which fits with our results the mdrs for ia range from 0 58 5 60 mostly greater than 1 fig 1 suggesting that ia may underestimate the mixture toxicity apparently ca predicts the effective concentrations more accurately than ia which was also verified in previous studies belden et al 2007 qin et al 2018 ten of 50 crcs predicted by the ca model over the entire set experiment concentration range table a 1 of the toxicity tests fall into the 95 ci of the experimental crcs while only 2 crcs fall into the ia model fig a 1 when the 95 ci of e c 50 o b s was used to judge the accuracy of the predicted values 24 of 50 values predicted by ca were within the 95 ci of e c 50 o b s while only 14 results predicted by ia were within the 95 ci the toxicity calculated by ca and ia differed from the toxicity values obtained from experimental observations fig 1 indicating that ca and ia models are not suitable for the prediction of mixture toxicity 3 3 descriptors for qsar models descriptors are at the core of qsar modeling and the interpretability of qsar models strongly depends on the nature of descriptors used the use of well understood physical chemical characteristics of a molecule as descriptors van der waals volumes and surfaces hydrophobicity lipophilicity h bond related parameters etc can aid in model interpretation metrics related to the electronic configuration of a compound partial charges dipole moment orbital energies etc are also suitable for structural interpretation when placed in the context of reactivity hypotheses similarly 2d descriptors contain simple and useful information about the molecular structure that can aid in model interpretation also various molecular fingerprints and fragment descriptors have a direct connection to molecular structure and thus have the potential to lend interpretability to a model cherkasov et al 2014 in addition many physical chemical or biological properties of compounds are dependent on the three dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule and that many biochemical processes are stereospecific so the analysis of such structure property relationship should take into account the 3d structure of molecules rastija and medić šarić 2009 therefore several different types of descriptors including physicochemical parameters quantum chemical parameters 2d 3d and fingerprint descriptors were included in this work to mirror the various levels of chemical structure in order to find descriptors that can provide explanations for qsar models of mixture toxicity as much as possible twenty seven physicochemical parameters were obtained from the pubchem database and epi suite software seventeen common quantum chemical parameters were extracted from the gaussian output files as descriptors the optimized molecular structure files were input into padel descriptor software and then a total of 2756 descriptors including 2d 3d and fingerprint descriptors were calculated this total of 2800 descriptors screening resulted in 1255 constant 148 semiconstant 80 and 1124 descriptors with more than 98 correlation were deleted finally a total of 273 parameters were obtained as molecular structure descriptors for each target chemical including 17 physicochemical parameters 14 quantum chemical parameters 200 2d descriptors 41 3d descriptors and 1 fingerprint descriptor detailed in sm b overall a total of 273 16 4368 descriptors per mixture ray based on the 16 equations equations a 5 20 of sm a were used for the construction of the qsar models 3 4 qsar model development and validation the training sets divided by the three partitioning techniques ksd dbd and abd differ from one another table a 4 descriptors screened with two filtering methods ga and s mlr were also different table a 5 with 3 dataset division techniques 2 descriptor filtering methods and 3 regression methods a total of 3 2 3 18 qsar models were developed in this study table a 6 all developed models were internally and externally validated in strict accordance with internationally recognized criteria and statistical parameters table 3 for all 6 mlr models the f test passed at the significance level of a 0 01 demonstrating that the overall linear correlation was highly significant the r a d j 2 values of the training set and the q l o o 2 values are all greater than 0 97 indicating that all mlr models have great goodness of fit and robustness before external validation of the mlr models it s necessary to check for systematic errors that violates the basic assumptions of the least square regression model roy and kar 2015 if systematic error is present it is not useful to check the external validation parameters the results show high systematic error is present in three models ksd ga mlr ksd smlr mlr and dbd smlr mlr and they should be discarded detailed in text a 4 the remaining four mlr models without systematic error all showed good external predictive ability with the values of q f 1 e x t 2 and q f 2 e x t 2 and c c c were all above 0 920 much higher than the acceptable thresholds the optimum number of lvs for all pls models is between 1 and 4 one out of the 6 pls models ksd smlr pls had q f 1 e x t 2 and q f 2 e x t 2 and c c c less than the acceptable threshold indicating that a large gap exists between the predicted and observed values all internal and external validation parameters of the remaining pls models are above the thresholds indicating that their goodness of fit robustness and external predictive ability are acceptable the svm model structures obtained in matlab are provided in table a 6 all six svm models achieved satisfactory goodness of fit robustness and external predictive power with sufficiently high r a d j t r 2 q l o o 2 q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 a n d c c c values which are all above the corresponding thresholds 3 5 comparison of performance of qsar models mixtures in the training set of the models with ksd fig 2a f were well distributed around the 45 degree line but the predicted values of the test set differed from the corresponding observed values table a 4 indicating that the training set divided by ksd failed to represent the overall dataset the mixtures of training and test sets divided by either dbd fig 2g l or abd fig 2m r techniques are better distributed around the 45 degree line and abd is better than dbd again the c c c values of abd are greater than dbd for the same descriptor filtering and regression methods illustrating that the prediction with abd coincides better with the observed p e c 50 for the same training set the scatter plots of the models obtained by pls have a generally wide distribution band around the 45 degree line and accordingly have the higher mdr table 3 among the 3 regression methods compared to mlr and svm models pls models have the worse goodness of fit and robustness lower r a d j t r 2 and q l o o 2 higher r m s e t r and r m s e l o o c v consequently pls is not an appropriate regression method for developing the qsar model for the mixtures in this study among the 3 regression methods differences in the training set have the greatest impact on the mlr models for ksd which fails to represent the overall dataset the developed qsar models have poor performance with c c c values below 0 8 table 3 and the mixture rays in the test set deviates from the 45 degree line fig 2 for abd which covers all response ranges in the training and test sets mlr based qsar models have excellent goodness of fit robustness and external predictive ability with the largest cp values 0 923 and 0 920 among the 15 qsar models fig 3 generally the training set differences have a minimal impact on the performance of the svm regression method cp 0 85 with any dataset partitioning technique and descriptor filtering method therefore svm is a promising method to obtain more reliable qsar models when the distribution of the dataset is not clear and it is not possible to divide the dataset based on activity dividing the dataset by abd to develop qsar models is optimal for cpcas mixtures according to our results because the cp values of the abd based models with any of the three regression methods are above 0 8 fig 3 the best model based on cp should be abd ga mlr eq 9 with a value of 0 922 its statistical validation metrics r a d j t r 2 0 982 q l o o 2 0 981 q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 0 967 and c c c 0 984 indicate that the model has excellent goodness of fit robustness and external predictive power p e c 50 4 36 0 593 r d f 65 m 10 0 299 a t s 8 e 2 0 281

of descriptors selected in the model the superscript v of descriptors refers to the equation used in the calculation of the mixture descriptors corresponding to d m i x v 3 6 correlations between the selected descriptors and toxicity for the optimal model abd ga mlr eq 9 a regression coefficient plot fig 4 suggests the positive and negative contribution of descriptors towards the modeled response pec50 the descriptors with positive contributions to mixture toxicity rdf65m 10 ats8e 2 aatsc7i 10 and aatsc3e 12 suggest an increase in the response with an increase in the values of descriptors whereas descriptors with negative contributions ggi9 10 sch6 10 gats4c 16 and wpsa1 3 suggest the inverse relationship it is notable that aatsc3e and gats4c are positively correlated with the deviation of the properties of each component of the mixture based on d m i x 12 and d m i x 16 and the rest of the descriptors are directly correlated with the properties of each component based on d m i x 2 3 10 according to the regression coefficients the significance of the descriptors towards response is in following order rdf65m 10 ats8e 2 ggi9 10 sch6 10 aatsc7i 10 aatsc3e 12 gats4c 16 wpsa1 3 among them rdf65m and wpsa1 are 3d descriptors and the rest are 2d descriptors their specific meanings can be found in table a 5 the most contributing descriptor is rdf65m 10 one of rdf descriptors and a 3d descriptor rdf descriptors obtained by the transformation of 3d coordinates of atoms into the structure code that has a fixed number of descriptors irrespective of the size of a molecule rastija and medić šarić 2009 the presence of the rdf65m as descriptor in the model means some linear dependence between the mixture toxicity pec50 and the sum of the products of x i 3 the components cubic molar fractions and rdf65m 3d molecular distribution of mass which calculated at radius of 6 5 å from the geometrical centers of each molecule i e the mixture descriptor rdf65m 10 is calculated with d m i x 10 notably the descriptor rdf65m was found in five out of the six training sets obtained by the three dividing methods and two filtering methods ksd ga ksd mlr dbd smlr abd ga abd smlr table a 4 although the descriptors screened out in the six training sets were not identical indicating that rdf65m is an important descriptor that associated with mixture toxicity for the dataset of this work in addition four descriptors ats8e 2 aatsc7i 10 aatsc3e 12 and gats4c 16 in the optimal model are autocorrelation parameters eq 9 2d autocorrelation descriptors generally explain how the values of certain atomic properties relate to each other with intervals equal to lags saiz urra et al 2007 in the case of the descriptors to develop the qsar models the lag is the topological distance d there are subtle differences between the autocorrelation descriptors atsd aatscd and gatsd in general they describe how the properties are distributed along the topology these four autocorrelation descriptors are weighted by electronegativities first ionization potentials and charges they confirm the relationship between the mixture toxicity and the electronic properties of the component molecules actually all models developed here included the autocorrelation parameters as descriptors table a 5 with the atomic properties involved include mass van der waals volumes polarizabilities etc suggesting that spatial distribution of molecular properties is an important factor influencing toxicity as confirmed in another study lavado et al 2021 the importance of rdf descriptors and autocorrelation descriptors for the model was evaluated by the reduction in the overall capability of the model when the descriptors are removed or changed when the rdf descriptors or autocorrelation descriptors are removed from the optimal model abd ga mlr r a d j t r 2 is reduced by 6 5 and 2 5 these data for q l o o 2 are 10 5 and 3 5 for q f 1 e x t 2 are 1 5 and 2 7 respectively table a 7 these results indicate two kinds of descriptor harbor a certain degree of impact on the goodness of fit robustness and predictive power of the model when both of them are removed the reductions of r a d j t r 2 q l o o 2 and q f 1 e x t 2 of the model reach 35 9 39 2 and 34 8 obviously the model excluding the two main contribution descriptors is completely unusable all these results confirm that the rdf and autocorrelation descriptors are important for characterizing the toxicity of binary mixtures in this study specifically mixture toxicity is affected by 3d distribution of atomic masses in the components of the mixture described by rdf65m or by the spatial distribution of the component molecules electronic properties described by ats8e aatsc7i aatsc3e and gats4c for the five target cpcas the single toxicity ec50 is linearly increased with the value of rdf65m r2 0 945 it seems that molecules with more complex 3d distribution of atomic masses or greater atomic masses within the calculated radius have greater toxicity but for mixture toxicity neither our qsar model nor conventional approaches could not be simply associated with a certain property specifically based on our qsar model descriptors for modeling mixture toxicity mirror the 3d distribution of atomic masses the spatial distribution of molecular electronic properties and some immaterial properties e g the chain structure described by sch6 as well these properties have a trade off relationship that is when one is rising the other is falling or even offset from one another making it hard to confirm the role of one of the properties on the mixture toxicity on the other hand according to the conventional understanding of mixture toxicity interactions always occur with various mechanisms still the biochemical effect of mixtures is not clear toxicological interactions of mixtures are often related to key biological pathways such as reactive oxygen species production and receptor signaling among others lagunas rangel et al 2022 the molecular structural properties play important roles in different biological pathways as for the reason why mpb is responsible for the synergistic effect of the mixtures some possible explanations proposed based on descriptors related to the spatial distribution of molecular electronic properties the descriptor ats8e contributes more to mixture toxicity than those of the rest three autocorrelation descriptors according to the interaction between each pair of atoms with the topological distance equal to 8 and weighted by the electronegativities among the five cpcas ats8e of mpb is the lowest sm b also the potential interaction between atoms with the lag equal to 8 is the least in mpb based on qualitative observation fig a 2 in the other cpcas more interactions between atoms at a lag equal to 8 exist due to more benzene rings or longer alkyl chains for other atoms in mpb absorbing electrons and interacting with atoms of other molecules could be readily occurred because of its high total molecular energy the mixture descriptors weighted simply by the molar fractions of the components d m i x 1 in some previous studies may not be reliable therefore for qsar modeling more computational approaches should be considered for mixture descriptors because the mixtures properties are not just simply linearly related to the properties of the components with the molar fraction of the components as coefficients d m i x 1 the mixture properties may be related to the square root square or third power of the mole fractions or descriptors d m i x 2 11 or to the deviation of the properties of each component d m i x 12 16 the existence of mixture descriptors associated with deviations in the properties of the components is observed in our study aatsc3e 12 and gats4c 16 3 7 applicability domain of the optimal qsar model fig 5 displays the williams plot of the optimal model abd ga mlr the warning leverage value h is 0 675 mixtures with leverage values within the threshold hi h apply to the model high leverage values hi h exceed the range of descriptors defined in the training set which could strengthen the model if it is in the training set if it is in the test set the prediction may be unreliable and an extrapolation result outliers can be detected by the standardized residuals greater than 3 δ 3 test sets of the optimal qsar model were in the applicability domain with no outliers in the present study an outlier in the training set bzp mpb r4 may be an experimental error this model could be used to predict the toxicity ec50 of a binary mixture of the five cpcas with any ratio specifically with mixing ratio of any binary cpcas mixture and the eight descriptors retrievable in sm a mixture descriptors are calculated according to d m i x v and then substituted into eq 9 to obtain the binary mixture toxicity the mixture needs to be in the applicability domain i e the leverage values hi and standardized residuals δ of the unknown mixture can be calculated with eqs 7 and 8 and should be in line with the interval of hi 0 675 and 3 δ 3 the matrix x of training set required for eq 7 is given in sm b 3 8 advantages and challenges of qsar models the rmse values of the 18 qsar models with a range of 0 0493 0 1613 were smaller than 0 1491 for the ca model and 0 3326 for ia except for ksd smlr pls figs 1 and 2 for ar the figures for the 16 out of 18 qsar models were above 50 while the ca and ia models were only 48 and 28 respectively all these results demonstrated that qsar is a more suitable approach for the quantitative prediction of mixture toxicity than ca and ia models as also confirmed in another study qin et al 2018 moreover the application of ca and ia models requires knowledge of the moa of each component and the mechanism of toxic action of the mixture hadrup et al 2013 qu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 in addition to the above quantitative prediction of toxicity qsar models can also be used to analyze the possible mechanisms of toxic effects which has been achieved in many studies chatterjee and roy 2021 khan et al 2019 lavado et al 2021 wang et al 2018a these cpcas in the real environment may be very low when the coexistence of some chemicals at low level the mixture toxicity can be calculated with the traditional methods by ca and ia models based on the toxicity data of single chemicals measured unfortunately in most cases the ca and ia models have low accuracy for toxicity prediction the qsar model we developed can perform the prediction of mixture toxicity ec50 by mixing ratios without concentration limitation in the real world a mixture of multiple pollutants is normality toxicity prediction of multiple mixtures is a huge challenge the current study just established qsar models for binary mixtures but the working framework may be useful for toxicity prediction mixture with more than two chemicals we uniformly examined mixture rays with different mixing ratios thus characterizing the various concentration variations of the binary mixture similarly for ternary mixtures a set of diverse mixture rays with uniformly different concentration fractions can be designed by the uniform design ray ud ray method liu et al 2012 with reference to the calculation of binary mixture descriptors the expression of mixture descriptors could be found in the past decades the focus of qsar has shifted from simple descriptors and easily interpretable linear models toward more complex multi parametric and non linear approaches thus a problem which is the trade off between the predictive power and interpretability of qsar arose as many highly predictive models are often based on complex multi dimensional descriptors and some black box approaches that are hardly interpreted such as neural networks and support vector machines cherkasov et al 2014 however interpretability to the practical acceptance of qsar models is important in 2004 the organization for economic co operation and development published oecd principles for validation of qsar models for regulatory purposes and one of the principles is a mechanistic interpretation if possible developed qsar models here indicate that mixture toxicity is affected by the 3d distribution of atomic masses in the components and the spatial distribution of the component molecules electronic properties admittedly it is hard to provide direct interpretation of toxicity mechanism through the descriptors in the model such as the explicit influence of a certain chemical bond or a functional group on toxicity interpreted in a previous work chatterjee and roy 2021 the reason is that the descriptors in current study are not easily associated with well understood molecular structure but it is such complex descriptors that lead to the high predictive quality of the model the trade off between interpretability and high predictive power of qsar models remains a challenge especially for the mixtures 4 conclusions the aquatic toxicity of five chemicals in cpcas to daphnia magna increases in the order bzp mpb bpa hhcb tcs and the synergistic effect of the mixture of the five cpcas may be caused mainly by mpb a total of 18 qsar models based on 3 different dataset partitioning techniques 2 descriptor filtering methods and 3 regression methods were developed a new comprehensive parameter that integrates 8 metrics eight in one for internal and external validation was proposed for qsar models evaluation the mixture toxicity is mainly affected by the 3d distribution of atomic masses and the spatial distribution of the molecule electronic properties rigorously validated and externally predictive qsar models were developed for predicting the toxicity of binary cpcas mixtures with any ratio in the applicability domain the qsar models have relatively good quantitative predictions compared to the ca and ia models mixture descriptors calculation that are simply weighted by the molar fraction of the components i e linear relate is questionable the mixtures properties also be related to the square root square or third power of the mole fractions or

14846,as emerging environmental contaminants cosmetic and personal care additives cpcas may have less oversight than other consumer products their continuous release and pseudopersistence could cause long term harm to the aquatic environment since cpcas generally exist in the form of mixtures in the environment prediction and analysis of their mixture toxicity are crucial for ecological risk assessment in this study the acute toxicity of five typical cpca mixtures to daphnia magna was tested the combined toxicity of binary mixtures was examined with the traditional concentration addition ca and independent action ia model overall the synergistic effect of the five cpcas may be caused mainly by methylparaben in addition reliable approaches for quantitative structure activity

least squares and support vector machine sixteen equations were applied for the calculation of the mixture descriptors to screen the functional expression of the mixture descriptors with the largest

care additives cpcas as part of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are emerging environmental contaminants of concern and are often considered pseudopersistent compounds especially in aquatic environments godoy and kummrow 2017 due to increasing consumption incomplete metabolism and incomplete removal in treatment plants chaturvedi et al 2021 collado et al 2014 rashid and liu 2021 apparently their pseudopersistence could and will lead to long term harm to the environment despite the low ambient concentrations bolong et al 2009 li et al 2021b acute and chronic exposure to these toxic substances such as eyeliner eyeshadow mascara nail polish may lead to serious health problems abbas et al 2022 chemicals including organic and inorganic ultraviolet filters parabens triclosan and others can cause metabolic interference and cell damage in organisms resulting in developmental and behavioral abnormalities genotoxicity and neurotoxicity carve et al 2021 khalil et al 2022 lozano et al 2020 generally cpcas occur in the form of mixtures in the environment obviously the toxicity of mixtures cannot be described simply by the summation of component concentrations and toxic equivalents but rather exhibit interactions that can produce toxic effects such as addition synergism and antagonism kar and leszczynski 2019 sigurnjak bureš et al 2021 for example the ecotoxicity of these mixtures may be higher than the effects of each component and a toxicity response can occur even if all components are at concentrations below their individual no observed effect concentration noec backhaus 2014 therefore studying the toxicity of cpca mixtures is crucial to evaluate the ecotoxicological risks the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model for predictive toxicology is a mathematical relationship between a chemical s quantitative molecular descriptors and its toxicological endpoint cronin and yoon 2019 qsar has been widely used in the study of contaminant toxicology prediction and can compensate for the lack of ecotoxicological data of contaminants reduce experimental costs and help to evaluate the uncertainty of experimental data properly validated models can predict toxicity for chemicals within the applicability of the models to complement or replace experimental observations carnesecchi et al 2020 khan et al 2019 considerable research has been conducted examining the toxicity of ppcps based on qsar models for instance qsar models have been developed concerning the environmental fate and toxicity of ultraviolet filter substances westphal et al 2020 and to predict the toxicity of transformation byproducts of synthetic musk a fragrance additive widely used in cpcas li et al 2021a additionally qsar models have been applied to examine toxicity on various mixtures of commonly used antibiotics and pesticides qin et al 2018 wang et al 2018b apparently these studies focused mainly on the effects of individual compounds or mixtures of pharmaceutical products on the aquatic environment seldom focusing on mixtures of cpcas government regulations are perceived as keeping poison out of cpcas however these products applications including face body and sun care color cosmetics showers and baths deodorants shampoos etc may have less oversight than other consumer products unfortunately cpcas are continually released into the aquatic environment and are biologically active and persistent but the aquatic toxicity of their mixture is still not very clear this knowledge gap needs to be addressed to develop definitive aquatic risk assessments in addition there are many outstanding issues in qsar studies of mixture toxicity such as the selection of suitable descriptors and the calculation of mixture descriptors as well as the need for more rigorous internal and external validation in this context the major goal of this work is to gain insight into the aquatic toxicity of mixtures of cpcas five chemicals and to develop suitable qsar models for toxicity prediction the basis of the selection of these chemicals is their coexistence in aquatic environments and they are widely used as cpcas leusch et al 2019 wang et al 2021a 2021b the mixture ratio was designed by the direct equipartition ray design equray procedure dou et al 2011 and the toxicity data were obtained by an acute toxicity test on daphnia magna we analyzed the toxicity interactions and developed qsar models which examines different mixture descriptors calculations by different methods and propose a new comprehensive parameter that integrates internal and external validation criteria for qsar models performance evaluation a reliable quantitative structure activity relationship was obtained to inform the toxicity prediction of cpca mixtures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and acute toxicity test the test chemicals table 1 with 99 purity including benzophenone bzp methylparaben mpb bisphenol a bpa galaxolide hhcb and triclosan tcs were purchased from j k scientific co beijing china the five chemicals were mixed in pairs to form a total of 10 mixture systems according to the equray procedure five mixture rays were designed for each binary mixture system table 2 for a total of 50 mixture rays in 10 binary mixture systems by setting 2 3 as the suitable dilution factor 6 levels in the set experiment concentration range table a 1 of supplementary material a sm thereafter were specified for each mixture ray the acute toxicity data of 330 tests including 50 6 tests of the mixture systems and 5 6 tests of the individual toxicity test of five chemicals were obtained by the 48 hour activity inhibition test on daphnia magna following the organization for economic cooperation and development guideline 202 oecd 2004 the daphnia magna were obtained from the laboratory animal monitoring institute of guangdong province china the chlorella sp for feeding daphnia magna were purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology in china the daphnia magna were cultivated at 22 1 c under a 16 h light 8 h dark photoperiod after three generations of parthenogenesis juvenile fleas 6 24 h old were used for the exposure test the test conditions were the same as the incubation conditions light avoidance experiments would be conducted if the test substances were unstable in light three parallel experiments were performed for all tests with 12 daphnids in each test solution 24 ml without feeding during the test after 48 h of exposure the number of immobile individuals was counted and recorded 2 2 concentration response curve crc fitting and mixture toxicity analysis the observed 50 effective concentration ec50 data were obtained by fitting the concentration and test toxicity effect data into nonlinear curves all concentrations are in mol l unless otherwise stated the four parameter log logistic function logit function and weibull function detailed in sm a were used for crc fitting qin et al 2021 ritz 2010 the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used for iteration and the best fitting curve with effect was selected based on aic akaike information criteria and bic bayesian information criteria in origin 2020b as classical models the concentration addition ca model and the independent action ia model have been widely used to predict and analyze the toxic effect of mixtures mainly for qualitatively judging the toxic effect of the mixture the ca model eq 1 berenbaum 1985 is suitable for a mixture system in which all components exert their effects through the same mechanism of action moa the ia model eq 2 bliss 1939 is applicable to the case in which the components in the mixture system exert their effects through completely different moas villa et al 2012 1 e c x m i x i n p i e c x i 1 where e c x m i x is the concentration of mixture provoking an x effect predicted by ca e c x i is the concentration of component i provoking the same effect of x when applied individually and p i is the concentration proportion of component i in the mixture 2 e c m i x 1 i 1 n 1 e c i where e c m i x is the effect of the mixture c m i x is the concentration of the mixture and e c i is the effect of the component with a concentration of c i the prediction results of the ca and ia models indicate the combined toxic effect as follows qin et al 2018 2021 a e c 50 c a or e c 50 i a ranges in the 95 confidence interval ci of e c 50 o b s indicate an additive effect b e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a less than e c 50 l o w e r and larger than e c 50 u p p e r respectively indicate a partial additive effect c e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a less than e c 50 l o w e r indicate an antagonistic effect d e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a larger than e c 50 u p p e r indicate a synergistic effect e c 50 l o w e r and e c 50 u p p e r are the lower and upper values of the 95 ci respectively synergistic and antagonistic effects are considered nonadditive effects the predictive accuracy of the ca and ia models was quantified for each ray by the model deviation ratio mdr belden et al 2007 which was calculated by dividing the predicted toxicity by the observed toxicity the root mean square error rmse and accuracy rate ar number of correctly predicted total number were used to evaluate the performance of the model prediction qu et al 2019 the predicted value was considered correct if it was within the 95 ci of e c 50 o b s 2 3 descriptor calculation the molecular descriptors of the five target chemicals were obtained through the pubchem database kim et al 2021 estimation program interface epi suite v4 11 usepa 2012 quantum chemical software gaussian 16 rev c 01 and gaussview version 6 dennington et al 2016 frisch et al 2016 and the padel descriptor software chirico et al 2021 the epi suite was applied to calculate physical and chemical parameters as descriptors gaussian and gaussview were used for molecular structure optimization and frequency analysis of 5 chemicals through density functional theory at the b3lyp 6 31g d level the optimized molecular structure files were used as input to the padel descriptor software for descriptor calculation mixture descriptors can be calculated from a function eq 3 of the molecular descriptors d i of the components that make up the mixture and their molar fractions x i gaudin et al 2015 3 d m i x f x i d i sixteen equations satisfying this functional relation were used to calculate the mixture descriptors detailed in sm a chatterjee and roy 2021 gaudin et al 2015 qin et al 2018 2021 sobati et al 2016 the 16 equations d mix v v 1 16 were divided into two categories direct combinations d m i x 1 11 describing the direct correlation with the properties of each component and deviation combinations d m i x 12 16 describing the deviation of the properties of each component from the linear contribution of their respective concentrations 2 4 dataset division and descriptor filtering the dataset was split into training and test sets at a ratio of 80 20 rational approaches that are more suitable for a small dataset with 50 500 chemicals were chosen to avoid the information loss caused by dataset partitioning three different partitioning techniques including kennard stone s algorithm kennard and stone 1969 division ksd euclidean distance based division dbd and sorted activity based division abd were applied here details are reported in sm a two methods were applied for descriptor filtering one is the genetic algorithm ga leardi et al 1992 which simulates the process of heredity and evolution of organisms in the natural environment the other method is stepwise multiple linear regression s mlr agostinelli 2002 which is used for the selection of the most relevant descriptors from the descriptors pool which depend on the mixtures in the training set ga and s mlr were carried out using tools provided in a previous study ambure et al 2015 the parameters employed and details are reported in table a 2 before filtering descriptors with ga and s mlr all the descriptors were preprocessed as follows constant descriptors with the same or almost the same value were removed with a variance cutoff value 0 001 interrelated descriptors with a correlation coefficient 0 99 were identified and one of the interrelated descriptors was removed descriptors scaling was employed by z score normalization eq 4 to normalize the descriptors to a uniform scale 4 d d d σ where d is the normalized descriptor value d and d are the original value and its mean value respectively and σ represents the population standard deviation of descriptor value d 2 5 model development models were developed by linear multiple linear regression mlr and partial least squares regression pls and nonlinear support vector machine regression svm methods mlr based on the ordinary least squares method is the most common statistical method widely used in qsar studies gramatica et al 2016 onlu and sacan 2018 salmani et al 2021 tang et al 2020 pls is a generalization of mlr and extracts latent variables lvs by considering information in both the independent and dependent variables the number of lvs is based on the q l o o 2 of leave one out loo cross validation stop extracting lvs if further addition of lvs does not increase the q l o o 2 of the training set by at least 5 regression is performed for the extracted lvs chatterjee and roy 2021 wold et al 2001 as a nonlinear method svm is suitable for small datasets and has the advantage of effectively avoiding overfitting and the disaster of dimensionality with excellent generalization ability cortes and vapnik 1995 the algorithm was implemented in the matlab platform with a library for svm libsvm chang and lin 2011 the most widely used radial basis kernel function rbf is selected cortes and vapnik 1995 then ga was applied for parameter including penalty factor c and parameters g and p in the kernel function tuning the number of populations was set to 20 for 100 iterations and parameters were determined in the loo cross validation on the training set the svm models were then developed with the optimal parameters 2 6 model validation and evaluation statistical parameters for internal and external validation were applied to evaluate the goodness of fit robustness and predictive power of the qsar models r a d j t r 2 and r m s e t r were used to measure the goodness of fit of the models developed by the training set the internal validation is performed by loo cross validation to characterize the robustness based on q l o o 2 and r m s e l o o c v for external validation r 2 based parameters and error based parameters were used to assess the external predictive quality of the models lavado et al 2021 r 2 based parameters include q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 and the concordance correlation coefficient c c c which quantifies the similarity between predicted and observed values as a single criterion gramatica and sangion 2016 the selected error based parameter was r m s e e x t which better reveals differences in model performance by assigning higher weights to larger errors than other error based metrics chai and draxler 2014 acceptable thresholds for the above parameters can be used to select reliable models roy and kar 2015 the thresholds for the parameters are r a d j 2 0 6 q l o o 2 0 5 q f 1 2 q f 2 2 0 6 and c c c 0 85 chirico and gramatica 2012 to select the best model among the developed qsar models we tried to integrate all the statistical parameters for evaluation as well as to combine scatter plots of predicted values compared with observed values for model performance analysis to find unreliable qsar models hidden by good statistical parameters we created a comprehensive parameter cp to unify the above statistical parameters through a weighting method bayesian statistical method was used to determine the weighting coefficients through the prior information from the experience all the three factors are crucial for the performance of qsar model while the predictive power is of more importance cherkasov et al 2014 according to our final weight allocation of 0 3 0 3 and 0 4 the cp performs well and provides a good support for comparing the performance differences of qsar models these statistical parameters are transformed into cp based on the following three criteria 1 r a d j t r 2 q l o o 2 q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 a n d c c c as high as possible for the model to have great goodness of fit robustness and external predictive power alexander et al 2015 gramatica 2014 2 r a d j t r 2 a n d q l o o 2 as close as possible to ensure that the model has high robustness gramatica and sangion 2016 3 r m s e t r r m s e l o o c v and r m s e e x t are as low and close as possible indicating that the model has both predictivity and sufficient generalizability gramatica 2007 the resulting expression for cp is given as follows 5 c p 0 3 r a d j t r 2 0 3 q l o o 2 0 1 q f 1 e x t 2 0 1 q f 2 e x t 2 0 2 c c c 0 3 r m s e t r 0 1 r m s e l o o c v 0 1 r a d j t r 2 q l

mentioned in section 2 2 were also used to evaluate the performance of the qsar models for the quantitative prediction of mixture toxicity 6 m d r p r e d i c t e d p e c 50 o b s e r v e d p e c 50 1 n 100 where n is the size of the whole dataset 2 7 applicability domain in this study the descriptors space covered by the training set mixtures was taken as the application domain defined by the leverage approach from the hat matrix the application domain was visualized with a williams plot of leverage value hi versus standardized residuals δ hi was calculated through the mixture descriptors by eq 7 and the warning leverage h was fixed at 3 m 1 n δ was calculated by eq 8 7 h i x i x t x 1 x i t i 1 n 8 δ y i y i i 1 n y i y i 2 n m 1 where x i is the descriptor row vector of the mixture i x is the matrix formed by m descriptor values of the n training set samples and the superscript t denotes the transpose of the matrix or vector y i and y i are the observed and predicted values of mixture i respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity of the target chemicals and mixture rays for the concentration response relationship of 5 target chemicals and 50 mixture rays all were well fitted with at least one of the logit weibull or log logistic functions table a 3 and fig a 1 the toxicity of the five types of cpcas to daphnia magna increased in the order bzp mpb bpa hhcb tcs with ec50 values ranging from 1 68 10 6 to 1 50 10 4 mol l table 1 these results were similar to the ecotoxicology ecotox knowledgebase olker et al 2022 the most toxic mixture is hhcb tcs r1 the ray in which the most toxic chemical tcs accounted for the largest proportion and the least toxic mixture is bzp mpb r5 the least toxic chemical bzp accounted for the largest proportion corresponding to an ec50 ranging from 2 72 10 6 to 2 06 10 4 mol l table 2 the range of cpcas mixture toxicity is approximately 1 4 times the range of toxicity of individual chemicals 3 2 mixture toxicity predicted by ca and ia models the predicted values of e c 50 c a and e c 50 i a and the combined toxic effects at 50 effect are summarized in table 2 the results predicted by ca and ia show that 35 of 50 mixtures had additive or partial additive effects at the e c 50 level 12 mixtures were synergistic and 3 mixtures were antagonistic the synergism of the mixtures was caused mainly by mpb since 75 of the mixtures that caused synergism contained mpb and 4 out of 5 mixture rays of mpb hhcb had a synergistic effect this finding is consistent with the conclusion reached in a previous study that binary mixtures containing mpb had higher synergistic potency than binary mixtures without mpb di poi et al 2017 additionally this finding can be reconfirmed by findings obtained in another report that paraben mixed at noec can produce a response darbre 2009 therefore the combined exposure of mpb with other substances in the aquatic environment especially with hhcb should be avoided in the risk management of cpcas most of the predicted p e c 50 the negative logarithm of e c 50 a larger p e c 50 value means greater toxicity with the ca and ia models deviated from the observed values fig 1 the mdrs for ca were in the range of 0 51 2 27 table 2 indicating that the observed effective concentrations were within 0 5 2 times the predicted values for the 50 mixtures 27 mdr values were greater than 1 23 were less than 1 and the median was 1 01 indicating unbiased estimates overall belden et al previously compiled the results of 207 experiments in which the ca model was applied to predict mixture toxicity and evaluated the accuracy belden et al 2007 showing that 88 of the experiments had observed effective concentrations within a factor of 2 of predicted values with a median mdr value of 1 which fits with our results the mdrs for ia range from 0 58 5 60 mostly greater than 1 fig 1 suggesting that ia may underestimate the mixture toxicity apparently ca predicts the effective concentrations more accurately than ia which was also verified in previous studies belden et al 2007 qin et al 2018 ten of 50 crcs predicted by the ca model over the entire set experiment concentration range table a 1 of the toxicity tests fall into the 95 ci of the experimental crcs while only 2 crcs fall into the ia model fig a 1 when the 95 ci of e c 50 o b s was used to judge the accuracy of the predicted values 24 of 50 values predicted by ca were within the 95 ci of e c 50 o b s while only 14 results predicted by ia were within the 95 ci the toxicity calculated by ca and ia differed from the toxicity values obtained from experimental observations fig 1 indicating that ca and ia models are not suitable for the prediction of mixture toxicity 3 3 descriptors for qsar models descriptors are at the core of qsar modeling and the interpretability of qsar models strongly depends on the nature of descriptors used the use of well understood physical chemical characteristics of a molecule as descriptors van der waals volumes and surfaces hydrophobicity lipophilicity h bond related parameters etc can aid in model interpretation metrics related to the electronic configuration of a compound partial charges dipole moment orbital energies etc are also suitable for structural interpretation when placed in the context of reactivity hypotheses similarly 2d descriptors contain simple and useful information about the molecular structure that can aid in model interpretation also various molecular fingerprints and fragment descriptors have a direct connection to molecular structure and thus have the potential to lend interpretability to a model cherkasov et al 2014 in addition many physical chemical or biological properties of compounds are dependent on the three dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule and that many biochemical processes are stereospecific so the analysis of such structure property relationship should take into account the 3d structure of molecules rastija and medić šarić 2009 therefore several different types of descriptors including physicochemical parameters quantum chemical parameters 2d 3d and fingerprint descriptors were included in this work to mirror the various levels of chemical structure in order to find descriptors that can provide explanations for qsar models of mixture toxicity as much as possible twenty seven physicochemical parameters were obtained from the pubchem database and epi suite software seventeen common quantum chemical parameters were extracted from the gaussian output files as descriptors the optimized molecular structure files were input into padel descriptor software and then a total of 2756 descriptors including 2d 3d and fingerprint descriptors were calculated this total of 2800 descriptors screening resulted in 1255 constant 148 semiconstant 80 and 1124 descriptors with more than 98 correlation were deleted finally a total of 273 parameters were obtained as molecular structure descriptors for each target chemical including 17 physicochemical parameters 14 quantum chemical parameters 200 2d descriptors 41 3d descriptors and 1 fingerprint descriptor detailed in sm b overall a total of 273 16 4368 descriptors per mixture ray based on the 16 equations equations a 5 20 of sm a were used for the construction of the qsar models 3 4 qsar model development and validation the training sets divided by the three partitioning techniques ksd dbd and abd differ from one another table a 4 descriptors screened with two filtering methods ga and s mlr were also different table a 5 with 3 dataset division techniques 2 descriptor filtering methods and 3 regression methods a total of 3 2 3 18 qsar models were developed in this study table a 6 all developed models were internally and externally validated in strict accordance with internationally recognized criteria and statistical parameters table 3 for all 6 mlr models the f test passed at the significance level of a 0 01 demonstrating that the overall linear correlation was highly significant the r a d j 2 values of the training set and the q l o o 2 values are all greater than 0 97 indicating that all mlr models have great goodness of fit and robustness before external validation of the mlr models it s necessary to check for systematic errors that violates the basic assumptions of the least square regression model roy and kar 2015 if systematic error is present it is not useful to check the external validation parameters the results show high systematic error is present in three models ksd ga mlr ksd smlr mlr and dbd smlr mlr and they should be discarded detailed in text a 4 the remaining four mlr models without systematic error all showed good external predictive ability with the values of q f 1 e x t 2 and q f 2 e x t 2 and c c c were all above 0 920 much higher than the acceptable thresholds the optimum number of lvs for all pls models is between 1 and 4 one out of the 6 pls models ksd smlr pls had q f 1 e x t 2 and q f 2 e x t 2 and c c c less than the acceptable threshold indicating that a large gap exists between the predicted and observed values all internal and external validation parameters of the remaining pls models are above the thresholds indicating that their goodness of fit robustness and external predictive ability are acceptable the svm model structures obtained in matlab are provided in table a 6 all six svm models achieved satisfactory goodness of fit robustness and external predictive power with sufficiently high r a d j t r 2 q l o o 2 q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 a n d c c c values which are all above the corresponding thresholds 3 5 comparison of performance of qsar models mixtures in the training set of the models with ksd fig 2a f were well distributed around the 45 degree line but the predicted values of the test set differed from the corresponding observed values table a 4 indicating that the training set divided by ksd failed to represent the overall dataset the mixtures of training and test sets divided by either dbd fig 2g l or abd fig 2m r techniques are better distributed around the 45 degree line and abd is better than dbd again the c c c values of abd are greater than dbd for the same descriptor filtering and regression methods illustrating that the prediction with abd coincides better with the observed p e c 50 for the same training set the scatter plots of the models obtained by pls have a generally wide distribution band around the 45 degree line and accordingly have the higher mdr table 3 among the 3 regression methods compared to mlr and svm models pls models have the worse goodness of fit and robustness lower r a d j t r 2 and q l o o 2 higher r m s e t r and r m s e l o o c v consequently pls is not an appropriate regression method for developing the qsar model for the mixtures in this study among the 3 regression methods differences in the training set have the greatest impact on the mlr models for ksd which fails to represent the overall dataset the developed qsar models have poor performance with c c c values below 0 8 table 3 and the mixture rays in the test set deviates from the 45 degree line fig 2 for abd which covers all response ranges in the training and test sets mlr based qsar models have excellent goodness of fit robustness and external predictive ability with the largest cp values 0 923 and 0 920 among the 15 qsar models fig 3 generally the training set differences have a minimal impact on the performance of the svm regression method cp 0 85 with any dataset partitioning technique and descriptor filtering method therefore svm is a promising method to obtain more reliable qsar models when the distribution of the dataset is not clear and it is not possible to divide the dataset based on activity dividing the dataset by abd to develop qsar models is optimal for cpcas mixtures according to our results because the cp values of the abd based models with any of the three regression methods are above 0 8 fig 3 the best model based on cp should be abd ga mlr eq 9 with a value of 0 922 its statistical validation metrics r a d j t r 2 0 982 q l o o 2 0 981 q f 1 e x t 2 q f 2 e x t 2 0 967 and c c c 0 984 indicate that the model has excellent goodness of fit robustness and external predictive power p e c 50 4 36 0 593 r d f 65 m 10 0 299 a t s 8 e 2 0 281 g g i 9 10 0 211 s c h 6 10 0 110 a a t s c 7 i 10 0 0986 g a t s 4 c 16 0 0408 a a t s c 3 e 12 9 13 10 3 w p s a 1 3 9 n 40 m 8 f 272 05 where n is the size of the training set and m is the number of descriptors selected in the model the superscript v of descriptors refers to the equation used in the calculation of the mixture descriptors corresponding to d m i x v 3 6 correlations between the selected descriptors and toxicity for the optimal model abd ga mlr eq 9 a regression coefficient plot fig 4 suggests the positive and negative contribution of descriptors towards the modeled response pec50 the descriptors with positive contributions to mixture toxicity rdf65m 10 ats8e 2 aatsc7i 10 and aatsc3e 12 suggest an increase in the response with an increase in the values of descriptors whereas descriptors with negative contributions ggi9 10 sch6 10 gats4c 16 and wpsa1 3 suggest the inverse relationship it is notable that aatsc3e and gats4c are positively correlated with the deviation of the properties of each component of the mixture based on d m i x 12 and d m i x 16 and the rest of the descriptors are directly correlated with the properties of each component based on d m i x 2 3 10 according to the regression coefficients the significance of the descriptors towards response is in following order rdf65m 10 ats8e 2 ggi9 10 sch6 10 aatsc7i 10 aatsc3e 12 gats4c 16 wpsa1 3 among them rdf65m and wpsa1 are 3d descriptors and the rest are 2d descriptors their specific meanings can be found in table a 5 the most contributing descriptor is rdf65m 10 one of rdf descriptors and a 3d descriptor rdf descriptors obtained by the transformation of 3d coordinates of atoms into the structure code that has a fixed number of descriptors irrespective of the size of a molecule rastija and medić šarić 2009 the presence of the rdf65m as descriptor in the model means some linear dependence between the mixture toxicity pec50 and the sum of the products of x i 3 the components cubic molar fractions and rdf65m 3d molecular distribution of mass which calculated at radius of 6 5 å from the geometrical centers of each molecule i e the mixture descriptor rdf65m 10 is calculated with d m i x 10 notably the descriptor rdf65m was found in five out of the six training sets obtained by the three dividing methods and two filtering methods ksd ga ksd mlr dbd smlr abd ga abd smlr table a 4 although the descriptors screened out in the six training sets were not identical indicating that rdf65m is an important descriptor that associated with mixture toxicity for the dataset of this work in addition four descriptors ats8e 2 aatsc7i 10 aatsc3e 12 and gats4c 16 in the optimal model are autocorrelation parameters eq 9 2d autocorrelation descriptors generally explain how the values of certain atomic properties relate to each other with intervals equal to lags saiz urra et al 2007 in the case of the descriptors to develop the qsar models the lag is the topological distance d there are subtle differences between the autocorrelation descriptors atsd aatscd and gatsd in general they describe how the properties are distributed along the topology these four autocorrelation descriptors are weighted by electronegativities first ionization potentials and charges they confirm the relationship between the mixture toxicity and the electronic properties of the component molecules actually all models developed here included the autocorrelation parameters as descriptors table a 5 with the atomic properties involved include mass van der waals volumes polarizabilities etc suggesting that spatial distribution of molecular properties is an important factor influencing toxicity as confirmed in another study lavado et al 2021 the importance of rdf descriptors and autocorrelation descriptors for the model was evaluated by the reduction in the overall capability of the model when the descriptors are removed or changed when the rdf descriptors or autocorrelation descriptors are removed from the optimal model abd ga mlr r a d j t r 2 is reduced by 6 5 and 2 5 these data for q l o o 2 are 10 5 and 3 5 for q f 1 e x t 2 are 1 5 and 2 7 respectively table a 7 these results indicate two kinds of descriptor harbor a certain degree of impact on the goodness of fit robustness and predictive power of the model when both of them are removed the reductions of r a d j t r 2 q l o o 2 and q f 1 e x t 2 of the model reach 35 9 39 2 and 34 8 obviously the model excluding the two main contribution descriptors is completely unusable all these results confirm that the rdf and autocorrelation descriptors are important for characterizing the toxicity of binary mixtures in this study specifically mixture toxicity is affected by 3d distribution of atomic masses in the components of the mixture described by rdf65m or by the spatial distribution of the component molecules electronic properties described by ats8e aatsc7i aatsc3e and gats4c for the five target cpcas the single toxicity ec50 is linearly increased with the value of rdf65m r2 0 945 it seems that molecules with more complex 3d distribution of atomic masses or greater atomic masses within the calculated radius have greater toxicity but for mixture toxicity neither our qsar model nor conventional approaches could not be simply associated with a certain property specifically based on our qsar model descriptors for modeling mixture toxicity mirror the 3d distribution of atomic masses the spatial distribution of molecular electronic properties and some immaterial properties e g the chain structure described by sch6 as well these properties have a trade off relationship that is when one is rising the other is falling or even offset from one another making it hard to confirm the role of one of the properties on the mixture toxicity on the other hand according to the conventional understanding of mixture toxicity interactions always occur with various mechanisms still the biochemical effect of mixtures is not clear toxicological interactions of mixtures are often related to key biological pathways such as reactive oxygen species production and receptor signaling among others lagunas rangel et al 2022 the molecular structural properties play important roles in different biological pathways as for the reason why mpb is responsible for the synergistic effect of the mixtures some possible explanations proposed based on descriptors related to the spatial distribution of molecular electronic properties the descriptor ats8e contributes more to mixture toxicity than those of the rest three autocorrelation descriptors according to the interaction between each pair of atoms with the topological distance equal to 8 and weighted by the electronegativities among the five cpcas ats8e of mpb is the lowest sm b also the potential interaction between atoms with the lag equal to 8 is the least in mpb based on qualitative observation fig a 2 in the other cpcas more interactions between atoms at a lag equal to 8 exist due to more benzene rings or longer alkyl chains for other atoms in mpb absorbing electrons and interacting with atoms of other molecules could be readily occurred because of its high total molecular energy the mixture descriptors weighted simply by the molar fractions of the components d m i x 1 in some previous studies may not be reliable therefore for qsar modeling more computational approaches should be considered for mixture descriptors because the mixtures properties are not just simply linearly related to the properties of the components with the molar fraction of the components as coefficients d m i x 1 the mixture properties may be related to the square root square or third power of the mole fractions or descriptors d m i x 2 11 or to the deviation of the properties of each component d m i x 12 16 the existence of mixture descriptors associated with deviations in the properties of the components is observed in our study aatsc3e 12 and gats4c 16 3 7 applicability domain of the optimal qsar model fig 5 displays the williams plot of the optimal model abd ga mlr the warning leverage value h is 0 675 mixtures with leverage values within the threshold hi h apply to the model high leverage values hi h exceed the range of descriptors defined in the training set which could strengthen the model if it is in the training set if it is in the test set the prediction may be unreliable and an extrapolation result outliers can be detected by the standardized residuals greater than 3 δ 3 test sets of the optimal qsar model were in the applicability domain with no outliers in the present study an outlier in the training set bzp mpb r4 may be an experimental error this model could be used to predict the toxicity ec50 of a binary mixture of the five cpcas with any ratio specifically with mixing ratio of any binary cpcas mixture and the eight descriptors retrievable in sm a mixture descriptors are calculated according to d m i x v and then substituted into eq 9 to obtain the binary mixture toxicity the mixture needs to be in the applicability domain i e the leverage values hi and standardized residuals δ of the unknown mixture can be calculated with eqs 7 and 8 and should be in line with the interval of hi 0 675 and 3 δ 3 the matrix x of training set required for eq 7 is given in sm b 3 8 advantages and challenges of qsar models the rmse values of the 18 qsar models with a range of 0 0493 0 1613 were smaller than 0 1491 for the ca model and 0 3326 for ia except for ksd smlr pls figs 1 and 2 for ar the figures for the 16 out of 18 qsar models were above 50 while the ca and ia models were only 48 and 28 respectively all these results demonstrated that qsar is a more suitable approach for the quantitative prediction of mixture toxicity than ca and ia models as also confirmed in another study qin et al 2018 moreover the application of ca and ia models requires knowledge of the moa of each component and the mechanism of toxic action of the mixture hadrup et al 2013 qu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 in addition to the above quantitative prediction of toxicity qsar models can also be used to analyze the possible mechanisms of toxic effects which has been achieved in many studies chatterjee and roy 2021 khan et al 2019 lavado et al 2021 wang et al 2018a these cpcas in the real environment may be very low when the coexistence of some chemicals at low level the mixture toxicity can be calculated with the traditional methods by ca and ia models based on the toxicity data of single chemicals measured unfortunately in most cases the ca and ia models have low accuracy for toxicity prediction the qsar model we developed can perform the prediction of mixture toxicity ec50 by mixing ratios without concentration limitation in the real world a mixture of multiple pollutants is normality toxicity prediction of multiple mixtures is a huge challenge the current study just established qsar models for binary mixtures but the working framework may be useful for toxicity prediction mixture with more than two chemicals we uniformly examined mixture rays with different mixing ratios thus characterizing the various concentration variations of the binary mixture similarly for ternary mixtures a set of diverse mixture rays with uniformly different concentration fractions can be designed by the uniform design ray ud ray method liu et al 2012 with reference to the calculation of binary mixture descriptors the expression of mixture descriptors could be found in the past decades the focus of qsar has shifted from simple descriptors and easily interpretable linear models toward more complex multi parametric and non linear approaches thus a problem which is the trade off between the predictive power and interpretability of qsar arose as many highly predictive models are often based on complex multi dimensional descriptors and some black box approaches that are hardly interpreted such as neural networks and support vector machines cherkasov et al 2014 however interpretability to the practical acceptance of qsar models is important in 2004 the organization for economic co operation and development published oecd principles for validation of qsar models for regulatory purposes and one of the principles is a mechanistic interpretation if possible developed qsar models here indicate that mixture toxicity is affected by the 3d distribution of atomic masses in the components and the spatial distribution of the component molecules electronic properties admittedly it is hard to provide direct interpretation of toxicity mechanism through the descriptors in the model such as the explicit influence of a certain chemical bond or a functional group on toxicity interpreted in a previous work chatterjee and roy 2021 the reason is that the descriptors in current study are not easily associated with well understood molecular structure but it is such complex descriptors that lead to the high predictive quality of the model the trade off between interpretability and high predictive power of qsar models remains a challenge especially for the mixtures 4 conclusions the aquatic toxicity of five chemicals in cpcas to daphnia magna increases in the order bzp mpb bpa hhcb tcs and the synergistic effect of the mixture of the five cpcas may be caused mainly by mpb a total of 18 qsar models based on 3 different dataset partitioning techniques 2 descriptor filtering methods and 3 regression methods were developed a new comprehensive parameter that integrates 8 metrics eight in one for internal and external validation was proposed for qsar models evaluation the mixture toxicity is mainly affected by the 3d distribution of atomic masses and the spatial distribution of the molecule electronic properties rigorously validated and externally predictive qsar models were developed for predicting the toxicity of binary cpcas mixtures with any ratio in the applicability domain the qsar models have relatively good quantitative predictions compared to the ca and ia models mixture descriptors calculation that are simply weighted by the molar fraction of the components i e linear relate is questionable the mixtures properties also be related to the square root square or third power of the mole fractions or descriptors or to the deviation of the properties of each component rather they are nonlinearly relate in most cases the best possible work frame for construction and validation of qsar models to

14847,cavitation is a potentially useful phenomenon accompanied by extreme conditions which is one of the reasons for its increased use in a variety of applications such as surface cleaning enhanced chemistry and water treatment yet we are still not able to answer many fundamental questions related to efficacy and effectiveness of cavitation treatment such as can single bubbles destroy contaminants and what precisely is the mechanism behind bubble s cleaning power for these reasons the present paper addresses cavitation as a tool for eradication and removal of wall bound bacteria at a fundamental level of a single microbubble and a bacterial cell we present a method to study bubble bacteria interaction on a nano to microscale resolution in both space and time the method allows for accurate and fast positioning of a single microbubble above the individual wall bound bacterial cell with optical tweezers and triggering of a violent microscale cavitation event which either results in mechanical removal or destruction of the bacterial cell results on e coli bacteria show that only cells in the immediate vicinity of the microbubble are affected and that a very high likelihood of cell detachment and cell death exists for cells located directly under the center of a bubble further details behind near wall microbubble dynamics are revealed by numerical simulations which demonstrate that a water jet resulting from a near wall bubble implosion is the primary mechanism of wall bound cell damage the results suggest that peak hydrodynamic forces as high as 0 8 μn and 1 2 μn are required to achieve consistent e coli bacterial cell detachment or death with high frequency mechanical perturbations on a nano to microsecond time scale understanding of the cavitation phenomenon at a fundamental level of a single bubble will enable further optimization of novel water treatment and surface cleaning technologies to provide more efficient and chemical free processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cavitation microbubble bacteria surface cleaning water treatment disinfection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cavitation rapid vaporization and bubble collapse due to a local change in pressure is a widely used method in industry and research for cleaning disinfection dispersion cell disruption and isolation of cell components zupanc et al 2019 furthermore it is recognized as effective and chemical free novel advanced water and wastewater treatment process šarc et al 2016 zupanc et al 2019 2014 the macroscopic effects of cavitation on bacteria are the results of implosions of a large number of bubbles gogate and pandit 2005 paliwal and mitragotri 2006 zupanc et al 2019 however the effects of the large bubble clusters do not reveal the inherent nature of cavitation and a plethora of possible cavitation modes of action on bacteria mechanical physical chemical as stated by prosperetti thousands of papers have been devoted to the subject of bubbles yet the exact mode of action of the bubble has not been elucidated prosperetti 2004 to evaluate the effect of cavitation on bacteria at a fundamental level one needs to downscale the cavitation process to a single cavitation bubble which is similar in size to a bacterial cell to do so spatio temporal control of a single cavitation microbubble is required which is currently missing in this work we test the effect of high frequency mechanical stress produced by a single microbubble on bacterial ability to survive the cavitation microbubble forms when formation of micrometer sized vapor and gas cavities inside a liquid medium are followed by a violent cavitation implosion on a nano to microsecond time scale time dependent response of bacteria to mechanical stress reveals a rubbery cell material response at low frequencies viscoelastic response at intermediate frequencies and glassy response at high frequencies vadillo rodríguez and dutcher 2011 the intermediate frequency regime corresponds to a characteristic time of cell growth when the cell is optimally adapted to the environment and most difficult to eradicate from a material point of view bacteria should be most susceptible to mechanical stress and consequently to destruction when exposed to high frequencies when cell wall material behavior changes from ductile to brittle and irreversible changes in cell wall structure are likely to occur whereas bacterial response to low and intermediate mechanical stress frequencies are well characterized by atomic force microscopy laminar flow studies and growth studies in confined spaces amir et al 2014 tuson et al 2012 vezenov and barrett 2013 the bacterial response to high frequency mechanical stress i e in the micro or nanosecond domain is not well documented the interactions of a cavitation bubble tens of micrometers in size with eukaryotic cells have been described jasikova et al 2019 o connor et al 2021 ohl et al 2006 rau et al 2006 mostly laser induced cavitation was used to provide controllable bubble collapse however due to intense laser irradiance plasma formation and reactive species development patinglag et al 2021 sinibaldi et al 2019 the mechanical effects of cavitation on eukaryotic cells may be largely masked in contrast to eukaryotic cells single bubble bacteria interactions have not been studied mainly due to unreliable production of micrometer size cavitation bubbles lack of the ability to manipulate and position bubbles at a desired location and small size of bacteria and microbubbles which are close to the diffraction limit of the light microscope we show the development of a new method which enables a real time evaluation of the bacterial response to the mechanical stress induced by a single microbubble cavitation event on a nano to microsecond time scale the combination of optical tweezers and pressure waves enabled an accurate and fast positioning of a single microbubble and controlled induction of single microbubble cavitation event with the optical tweezer we have produced a stable single nucleation bubble in the vicinity of the bacterial cell the microbubble cavitation was triggered remotely with high voltage electric discharge which promoted pressure waves through the medium and induced nucleation microbubble growth and collapse observed with high speed camera direct observation of the interaction between a single cavitation microbubble and the individual bacterial cell is presented the evolution of the fluid flow field during the microbubble collapse was characterized by silica bead displacements which enabled in situ measurement of the fluid velocity field during the single cavitation event the effect of a single microbubble on bacterial cell viability was recorded by fluorescence microscopy the experimental results were used to validate the results of the numerical model where the evolution of the single microbubble cavitation and its interaction with a bacterial cell was simulated the threshold wall shear stress and hydrodynamic force needed for cell detachment and bacterial death during the single microbubble cavitation event were estimated 2 methods 2 1 single microbubble generation to generate micrometer sized cavities a combination of optical tweezers and high voltage electric discharge was used laser focusing was applied to generate a stable micrometer sized vapor microbubble which served as an initial microbubble nucleus then tension wave from spark discharge was used to

from different acquired channels brightfield red and green fluorescence were aligned in between channels next image analysis was performed through custom written imagej macro script to acquire positions of bacterial cells on the microscopic images center and maximum radius of microbubble were determined with high speed camera and photron viewer pfv 4 software location of the microbubble center was determined on microscopic images images were trimmed to 2x of maximum microbubble radius with the thresholded and trimmed brightfield images we obtained binary images of bacterial cells before and after microbubble collapse the possible nearby magnetic beads were eliminated from the image analysis with subtracting area of the beads from binary images to fully separate overlapping cells additional manual review and segmentation of the cells was performed on binary images the location of each bacterium was determined before and after the cavitation microbubble collapse plugin analyze particles with center of mass measurement for location of bacterial cell on image the detached cells were determined by subtracting binary images before and after collapse additionally we analyzed images from red fluorescence channel pi dye prior and after the cavitation microbubble collapse to determine the number of dead bacterial cells data analysis a schematic representation of the microbubble bacterium interaction model at different perspectives is given in fig 2 the cell locations obtained from image analysis were transformed into a non dimensional distance δ as follows 1 δ x

each experimental repeat was determined in relation to δ the event probability for cell detachment and cell damage in the j th bin of the i th experimental repeat was defined as follows 2 p d e t a c

final state the number of cells identified as detached and the number of dead cells respectively cell death probability is determined in relation to both the initial state and to the final state the latter represents the cell death probability for non detached cells only 2 3 numerical methods numerical simulations of near wall microbubble dynamics were employed to reveal further details regarding bubble shape evolution and the resulting flow field these results were then used to determine the hydrodynamic forces on nearby wall bound bacterial cells according to the attached cell model validation of the employed methodology can be found in appendix b and c bubble dynamics model the presently utilized bubble dynamics model ansys 2021 is based on the finite volume method along with the volume of fluid method to resolve compressible multiphase flow two fluid phases are considered a gas bubble and ambient liquid and their interfaces are captured by solving continuity equations for the volume fraction field α l of the liquid phase equation of mass conservation for the liquid phase can be written as 5 α l ρ l t α l ρ l u l 0 here ρ l and u l denote the density and velocity vector field of the liquid phase the volume fraction field of the gas phase α g can be obtained as α g 1 α l after both volume fraction fields are known we can determine the volume averaged fluid properties ϕ throughout the whole computational domain as ϕ i α i ϕ i in the present case this is true for density ρ dynamic viscosity μ and thermal conductivity k based on the determined material properties a single momentum eq 6 and energy eq 7 equation can be solved which yields the shared velocity u and temperature t fields 6 t ρ u ρ u u p τ b 7 t ρ e u ρ e p k t here p denotes pressure b body forces τ the viscous stress tensor and e the total specific energy presently both phases are considered as newtonian fluids the effects of surface tension are considered at the interface between the gas phase and ambient liquid the pressure jump across the liquid gas interface is modeled with a body force in the momentum equation according to the continuum surface force model brackbill et al 1992 the liquid phase is modeled as compressible according to the tait s equation of state whereas the gas phase is considered as ideal gas numerical model setup expansion of an initially stable microbubble initial radius r0 1 1 µm is achieved by over pressurizing the bubble interior initial bubble pressure 1 96 108 pa in comparison to the ambient pressure p 101 325 pa the ambient liquid temperature is set to 293 15 k a bubble is initiated between db 1 5 µm and 15 µm increment of 1 5 µm away from the wall which in the present case amounts to the non dimensional bubble wall distance γ db rr max between 0 087 and 1 02 increment of 0 1 the gas phase is considered as air and the ambient liquid as water the corresponding material parameter are given in table 1 simulations are done in axial symmetry with an orthogonal grid of uniform spacing in vicinity of the bubble δx 44 nm r0 δx 25 rr max δx 370 chosen based on grid and time step independence analysis in previous research zevnik and dular 2022 2021 2020 in addition solution convergence for the present case was additionally controlled for the case with γ 0 2 for the maximum jet speed see fig a6c the error at the chosen resolution towards the grid independent solution was estimated at 7 4 the grid independent solution was calculated according to the richardson interpolation from the results obtained by three sequential simulations with resolutions of roughly 200 400 and 800 computational cells per maximum bubble diameter the grid spacing gradually coarsens towards the computational domain edges and the total number of cells at the chosen resolution is in the order of half a million computational time step is set according to the courant friedrichs lewy condition with the maximum cell courant number of 0 2 boundary conditions at the end of the computational domain were set to wave non reflecting pressure outlet p 101 325 pa t 293 15 k and no slip condition is considered at the wall more details regarding the employed numerical model and setup can be found in our previous work zevnik and dular 2022 attached cell model expanding and collapsing cavitation microbubble induces a temporally and spatially variable flow field in the ambient liquid which exerts hydrodynamic loads on nearby wall bound cells under the assumption of a spherical cell shape we can estimate the hydrodynamic drag force f d which can be for an attached spherical cell of radius r c written as 8 f d 1 2 ρ l π r c 2 c d u u here u u t r c is local flow velocity at the location of the cell r c since the presence of cells is not actually considered in the bubble dynamics model the height of bacterial cells h c above the wall is not guaranteed to be greater than the numerically obtained liquid film thickness formed between the bottom bubble surface and the wall due to the small standoff bubble wall distances γ considered the effective flow velocity is thus determined as 9 u t r c 1 h c z 0 z h c α l u t r c z d z where only velocity field of the liquid phase is considered to better represent the actual experimental conditions where the bubble is expected to overlay the cells rather than engulf them the drag coefficient c d can be calculated according to the kaskas equation kaskas 1964 as 10 c d 24 r e 4 r e 0 4 which is valid for reynolds numbers r e 2 10 5 reynolds number is presently defined as 11 r e 2 r c ρ l u μ l presently cells are considered as spheres with radius of r c 1 8 d c 3 3 16 d c 2 l c d c 1 3 0 45 0 06 µm here l c 1 44 0 25 µm and d c 0 63 0 06 µm n 30 denote the actual bacterial cell length and diameter the latter also corresponds to the bacterial cell height h c above the wall the expression for cell radius rc is obtained from computing the equivalent radius of the actual bacterial cell volume assuming a spherocylindrical cell shape 2 4 cell event probability model the relation between the exerted peak hydrodynamic force and the probability of single cell event occurrence detachment cell death was quantified by fitting the obtained data to the cell event probability model the latter is described by a piecewise function with three coefficients the main relation between the chosen load metric and cell event probability is characterized by a power law function where the coefficients are set up in a way to represent the lower threshold load upper threshold load and the corresponding load exponent the cell event probability at the peak hydrodynamics force f m a x is fitted according to the following piecewise function 12 p e v e n t f m a x 0 f m a x f l t h f m a x β f f l t h β f f u t h β f f l t h β f f l t h f m a x f u t h 1 f u t h f m a x here f l t h and f u t h correspond to lower and upper peak force threshold the former can be understood as a threshold for the possible occurrence of the considered cell event p e v e n t f m a x 0 whereas the latter represents the upper threshold force above which the considered cell event is likely to occur for the vast majority of cells p e v e n t f m a x 1 β f is a third fitting coefficient and denotes the force exponent a similar model is employed to characterize cell event probability in relation to the peak wall shear stresses τ m a x model fitting was performed using a non linear least squares method along with a thrust region algorithm a global fit was performed for each load metric cell event pair 4 pairs in total 3 results 3 1 experimental observations of the interaction of a single cavitation microbubble with a bacterial cell upon a µs laser pulse local heating generated a micrometer sized stable nucleation microbubble with a median radius of 1 1 µm n 15 the lifespan of a nucleation microbubble was in the order of milliseconds to seconds and the nucleation microbubble formation had no effect on nearby bacterial cell adhesion and viability fig a3 the formation of an unstable cavitation microbubble fig 3 a was triggered by shock waves fig a1 induced by a remote spark discharge approximately 3 mm from the nucleation microbubble site the initially stable nucleation microbubble first underwent a contraction upon shock wave propagation which was then followed by an explosive microbubble expansion during 1 4 µs due to the focusing of a tensile wave the induced cavitation microbubble expanded in size to the median maximum radius of 15 4 µm n 15 during a rapid cavitation microbubble collapse 1 4 µs we were able to observe a microjet formation the latter was directed towards the rigid surface as indicated by the inner dark annulus on fig 3a the effect of a single microbubble collapse on a monolayer of attached bacterial cells is shown in fig 3b the bacterial cells were initially homogenously distributed over the entire field of view cell density was 0 15 0 03 cells µm2 and the magnetic beads were positioned at different locations in the vicinity of the bacterial cells by optical tweezers after exposure to microbubble collapse one can observe an area of detached bacterial cells in the center of the projected cavitation microbubble radius furthermore the zone of detached cells is surrounded by an annulus of still attached but damaged bacterial cells the fluorescence image red pseudo colored bacteria shows cells with a compromised cytoplasmic membrane the latter resulted in the uptake of membrane impermeable pi fluorophore indicating cell death the dashed circle represents the projected maximum microbubble radius rr max obtained from high speed camera imaging based on experimental results and image analysis we could categorize individual bacterial cells as either detached attached but dead or not affected fig 3c the area of damaged bacterial cells is similar to the projected maximum microbubble size due to high speed photography constraints temporal resolution 0 7 µs spatial resolution 3 px µm only cavitation microbubbles with the maximum expansion radius above 10 µm were used in further statistical analyses nevertheless it has to be stressed that the presented method also allows for a reproducible generation of smaller cavitation microbubbles in the most cases a single cycle of bubble oscillation was observed as shown in fig 3a however in rare cases the microbubble underwent an additional oscillation phase which could lead to an exaggerated estimate of the effectiveness of the primary bubble however the secondary oscillations occurred within the area of maximum bubble size where there is a high probability that cells are already detached or damaged from the primary oscillation cycle additionally it is important to note that in the absence of the stable nucleation microbubble the spark discharge did not induce cavitation events at the magnetic bead nor had any effect on bacterial cell adhesion and viability in the observed experimental volume fig a3 also according to the high speed microbubble shape visualizations the presence of magnetic microbeads did not affect the microbubble dynamics near the solid wall 3 2 mechanisms that cause bacterial cell detachment and damage to gain a mechanistic insight into the microbubble bacteria interaction numerical simulations of near wall microbubble dynamics were performed from which bubble shape evolution and the resulting flow field were obtained these results were then used to determine the hydrodynamic forces on nearby wall bound bacterial cells fig 4 the obtained numerical results reveal two distinct characteristic modes of microbubble collapse which primarily depend on the value of the microbubble wall distance parameter γ presently defined as a ratio of the initial bubble wall distance and the maximum projected microbubble radius fig 2 both bubble collapse modes include a uniaxial jet formation towards the wall however the characteristics of the developed jets vastly differ between both modes for microbubbles in extreme vicinity of the wall γ 0 3 a very fast and thin jet towards the wall is developed fig 4a with the peak jet velocity well above 1000 m s between 1200 and 1400 m s and a normalized jet radius rjet rr max of 0 021 0 001 on the other hand for microbubbles with γ 0 4 a commonly recognized classical jet can be observed fig 4b with a normalized radius of 0 30 0 02 and peak velocities between 56 and 75 m s 64 8 m s the resulting peak wall shear stresses and hydrodynamic forces during a single cavitation event are given in fig 4c which shows high spatial variability and non linear dependence on the microbubble cell distance δ one can observe an increase in the width of the shaded area min max envelope for δ 0 2 which points towards a highly variable magnitude of peak microbubble induced mechanical loads in the region of the jet impact this can be attributed to the fact that different microbubble jetting modes can occur along the bubble wall distance parameter γ fig 4a b peak magnitudes of the hydrodynamic forces and wall shear stresses at δ 0 1 can locally reach ten micronewtons and a few megapascals respectively the occurrence of peak loads coincides with the time of jet impact and subsequent outward radial flow along the wall the peak loads however are highly transient tens of nanoseconds as their duration is roughly two orders of magnitude shorter than the cavitation microbubble lifetime few microseconds additionally the loads decay quickly with the distance from the center of the jet and cells at the distance of the maximum microbubble radius δ 1 are subjected to the peak local shear stress and hydrodynamic forces of 20 kpa and 70 nn which is several orders of magnitude smaller than in the center of the jet the results of the simulations are in line with the present experimental observations of bacterial cell detachment and destruction as the formed crater of detached cells in the center of the jet impact zone indicates the highest shear stresses and hydrodynamic forces 3 3 effectiveness of a cavitation microbubble to eradicate wall bound bacterial cells probabilities of the two main identified bacterial cell outcomes cell detachment and cell death are presented in fig 5 shown results are based on the data gathered from fifteen experimental cases where maximum radii of cavitation microbubbles and positions of e coli cells were documented in accordance with the definition of the microbubble cell distance δ fig 2 a very high likelihood almost 100 of cell detachment can be seen for cells located directly under the center of an imploding microbubble δ 0 2 this was already noted before from the microscopic images in the form of area without bacterial cells fig 3b as high probability for cell detachment directly under the center of microbubble cell death is presented for values only above δ 0 2 with δ 0 2 cell detachment probability exponentially decreases reaching 25 probability at δ 1 and 10 for δ 1 5 due to inability to track detached cells e coli viability was determined from the cells that remained attached fig 5b we can observe that cell death probability exponentially decreases with δ and is practically null for δ 1 the results suggest that it is easier to detach bacterial cells than to damage them as the former outcomes shows consistently higher probabilities along δ i e the median probability for bacterial cell detachment decreases towards only after δ 2 whereas cell death is decreased toward zero already at δ 0 8 3 4 required mechanical loads for removal and eradication of bacteria on a temporal scale of a single cavitation microbubble event the relation between the exerted peak mechanical loads and the probability of identified cell outcomes is given in fig 6 the obtained experimental and numerical results were fitted to a piecewise power law model materials and methods section 2 4 cell event probability model the obtained model parameters table 2 can be understood as the threshold mechanical loads for the possible outcome of cell detachment or death when subjected to high frequency mechanical perturbations on a nano to microsecond time scale the lower threshold corresponds to the bound below which a certain cell outcome is highly unlikely p 0 whereas the upper threshold denotes the bound above which a cell outcome has a very high likelihood of occurrence p 1 presently we observed a very high likelihood of e coli bacteria detachment at peak hydrodynamic force of 0 8 0 1 µn and cell death at 1 2 0 5 µn these values translate to the microbubble cell distance for a highly probable outcome of cell detachment on the interval of δ 0 0 4 and δ 0 0 35 for cell death in certain applications especially in medicine a similar question is usually framed the other way around at what forces or bubble cell distances can we still expect the cells to remain viable in our case cells are not expected to get detached or damaged when peak forces are below 14 4 nn and 52 14 nn additionally microbubble collapse mode fast thin jet versus classical jet did not affect the obtained cell event probability distribution along δ appendix d which suggests that e coli cell detachment or death is independent of the microbubble jetting mechanism 4 discussion downscaling of the cavitation process to a single cavitation microbubble and study of its interaction with a bacterial cell has not been performed yet in this study spatio temporal control of a single cavitation microbubble combined with numerical analysis provided unprecedented mechanistic insight into hydrodynamic forces and shear stresses that affect individual bacterial cells during a single cavitation microbubble event we present a direct observation of bacterial cell response to high frequency mechanical perturbations spanning the time domain from nanosecond to microsecond high frequency perturbations on bacterial cells have been used with mixed success for antibacterial purposes in the past salmen et al 2018 wietzikoski lovato et al 2018 for example exposure of s epidermidis and s aureus to high frequency electromagnetic fields mostly produced no statistically significant decrease on bacterial growth on the other hand exposure of p aeruginosa to electromagnetic fields at 900 mhz led to a significant reduction in growth rate while 1800 mhz had insignificant effect the effects have been attributed to temperature gradients and the formation of reactive oxygen species ros although similar physico chemical effects on bacteria have been proposed for cavitation we argue that in the case of single microbubble cavitation event high frequency mechanical effects on bacterial cells are far more significant than temperature and ros the effects of a single microbubble collapse are highly transient as single microbubble growth and collapse is completed in approximately 5 μs those effects are not as sustained as in the case of high frequency electromagnetic fields or high frequency ultrasound cavitation for example yasuda et al 2016 have used high frequency focused ultrasound 1 mhz pulses to generate ros but for an efficient ros generation they had to use a repeated sequence of high intensity pulses for 5 min in the case of ultrasound cavitation it is known that higher production of ros is expected at high frequency ultrasound 100 khz and above as less energy during the bubble collapse translates into shockwaves and the number of bubble collapses is increased mason et al 2011 yusof et al 2016 this suggests that during the single cavitation event a probability for ros generation is very low due to high reactivity of ros species it would be technically very challenging to detect their presence during the single cavitation event although the generation of ros cannot be completely excluded on the other hand physical mechanisms that accompany cavitation such as high local temperatures suslick et al 1999 strong shear flows zupanc et al 2014 jets dular et al 2019 shock waves petkovšek et al 2020 rapid pressure drop šarc et al 2016 and supersonic flow shamsborhan et al 2010 are much more likely during a single cavitation event the controlled single microbubble experiment together with computational simulations provides an opportunity to determine which mode of cavitation is more significant to bacterial inactivation during a microbubble collapse the temperature within the microbubble may reach peak values of several thousandths kelvin suslick et al 1999 however these are short lived and spatially confined to the center of the collapsing microbubble from our previous numerical research it follows that thermal load on bacteria during a single microbubble event could only be relevant in cases when the collapsing microbubble remains in the direct proximity of the cell surface zevnik and dular 2022 2021 2020 as the thermal boundary layer is thin in comparison to the maximal bubble size in the case of non attached microbubbles the temperature changes at the location of a bacterium are in fact negligibly small and well below the threshold for bacterial death mitsuzawa et al 2006 the same however cannot be said for compressive and shear loads the experimental and numerical results suggest that the main contributing damaging mechanism for wall bound bacteria is a microjet formation towards the wall upon impact the jet changes flow direction and flows radially outwards along the wall causing high local pressures and shear forces on the attached cells looking at the maximum calculated values along δ we can observe shear stresses in the order of a few megapascal and the resulting hydrodynamic forces as high as ten micronewtons the presently obtained results point toward the jet impact and its outflow along the wall as the primary mechanism that causes wall bound bacterial cell detachment and death when a single near wall microbubble event is considered nevertheless we presently cannot exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect of other potentially damaging mechanisms such as free radicals and shock waves the reasoning for outlining the jet as the primary mechanism is as follows first a microbubble event causes cells either to detach from the wall die or remain unaffected the regions of detached cells exhibit round shapes and are surrounded by annular shaped areas of attached but dead bacterial cells centers of both regions are tightly related to the bubble center which also corresponds to the jet center see figs 3b and 3c these findings point towards a mechanism that can be characterized by axial symmetry with its center at the bubble jet center second the results imply that cell detachment is practically guaranteed for δ 0 3 which is followed by a monotonic and gradually decreasing trend of cell detachment probability with radial distance δ from the bubble jet center see fig 5a a similar trend was also observed for cell death see fig 5b similar non linearly decreasing trends are obtained for both bubble induced load metrics peak hydrodynamic force and wall shear stress obtained from numerical simulations furthermore the occurrence of peak calculated loads corresponds to the time of jet impact and its radial outflow along the wall third the radial position of the toroidal bubble collapse is obtained to range between 0 23 δ 0 36 see non dimensional rr at non dimensional t 1 in fig a5 and bubble shapes at t4 in figs a6a and a6b we do not exclude the toroidal bubble collapse as a contributing mechanism for causing bacterial cell detachment and death however based on the observed trends of cell outcomes with radial distance δ from the bubble center we find it highly unlikely to be the primary damaging mechanism furthermore our previous research pandur et al 2022 zevnik and dular 2022 2021 points toward a conclusion that high pressure and shock waves of magnitude characteristics of bubble collapse are not being sufficient to cause bacterial cell damage the reason for this is a relatively high stability of bacterial cell envelopes to compressive loads their high compliance and thus a similar acoustic impedance to water which renders them almost invisible to weak shock waves nevertheless an important note to add here is that we expect the intensity of bubble collapse to play an important role in this regard which could lead to different conclusions with other considered bubble collapse scenarios than the ones considered in the present study for example reuter et al 2022 have just recently observed that cavitation erosion of harder materials occurs only for laser induced bubble collapses at close stand offs below γ 0 2 where a shock wave self focusing mechanism develops however the latter results from non axially symmetric bubble collapse causes the damage to be localized to a narrow spot away from the central axis which is not the case in the presently obtained results as observed there are three possible outcomes for bacteria after a single cavitation event bacteria are either detached remain attached but dead or remain attached and viable the probability for cell detachment and damage exponentially decreases with bubble cell distance similar effects were observed for attached eukaryotic cells gac et al 2007 hellman et al 2008 jasikova et al 2019 o connor et al 2021 ohl et al 2006 rau et al 2006 zhou et al 2012 for a single cavitation event we determined hydrodynamic force for bacterial detachment to be in the range from 14 nn to 0 8 µn the detachment probability increases with hydrodynamic force and is very likely above 1 µn p 1 detachment of e coli from a pll coated glass substrate was measured independently with fluidfm method by potthoff et al 2015 who measured the detachment force of 14 nn per cell this is comparable to our detachment threshold force the threshold force for cell death was higher than for detachment 1 2 µn this is in line with the reported bursting force of 3 6 µn for the exponential grown e coli shiu et al 1999 the highest mechanical stress was calculated at the projected center of microbubble collapse due to jet formation which is consistent with the experimental observation where all bacteria detached at the center of the projected cavitation microbubble the obtained peak wall shear stress of 145 kpa during the single cavitation event corresponds to the one reported by zeng et al 2018 where they report wall shear stresses of 100 kpa after the jet impact numerical results revealed two distinct modes of microbubble collapse a classical jet dular et al 2019 and a fast thin jet koch et al 2021 lechner et al 2020 2019 reuter and ohl 2021 depending on the microbubble wall distance we were unable to experimentally observe a fast needle like jet due to the limited spatial temporal resolution of the high speed camera although observation in bigger cavitating bubbles were recently reported koch et al 2021 lechner et al 2020 reuter and ohl 2021 despite different jetting modes bacterial cell detachment nor viability did not significantly differ between the two jetting modes this finding can be further explained by the obtained numerical results presented in fig 4c where peak bubble induced loads are shown there we can observe that the min max envelopes of both load metrics exhibit very high variation beyond an order of magnitude across γ in the region directly below the bubble center δ 0 2 which can be attributed to vastly different microbubble collapse and jetting dynamics however moving further away from the bubble center we can observe a relatively narrow span of the min max envelope up to a few ten percents for δ 0 5 between all considered cases 0 15 γ 0 58 this implies that the peak loads on cells are of similar magnitudes across both identified bubble jetting modes i e fast thin jet and classical jet when cells are positioned sufficiently far away from the bubble center δ 0 5 one additional important thing to consider is the fact that with δ 0 3 virtually all cells were either detached or remained attached to the wall but died see fig 5 from that one can deduce that even bubble collapse with classical jet formation causes high enough loads to affect bacterial cells the results of this study imply an intimate relation between the bacterial cell and a cavitation microbubble only when the two are in contact or in very close proximity a bubble has an effect on the bacterial cell the detrimental effect of cavitation on bacterial viability and attachment is spatially confined to the center of the projected cavitation microbubble this suggests that a vast majority of cavitation events in the suspension will go unnoticed by bacteria of course one should not neglect micro and macro streaming of the fluid induced by cavitation events which is expected to have a cleaning effect verhaagen and fernández rivas 2016 while the results are strictly speaking valid only for e coli a gram negative bacterium recent numerical simulations by zevnik and dular 2022 revealed that the difference in peak cavitation forces felt by gram negative and gram positive bacteria is only 20 30 however this needs to be experimentally verified the present research focused on a relation between cavitation microbubbles and attached cells which renders the findings as less applicable to free floating planktonic cells in suspensions however still most of the bacterial cells in environment are present in a group of cells i e biofilms or flocs or at least are embedded in complex biological extracellular matrix costerton et al 1995 guasto et al 2012 hall stoodley et al 2004 sretenovic et al 2017 all these cases could cause cavitating microbubbles to from characteristic jets toward bacterial cells as is also true in the presented paper examples of a complex medium are wastewater and activated sludge where enormous amount of biological material needs to be treated the threshold cavitation forces for embedded cells in biomatrix e g biofilms are currently unknown and could be higher due to increased biofilm stress resistance compared to monolayer costerton et al 1995 hall stoodley et al 2004 simunič et al 2020 however if one is interested in inactivation of bacteria the majority of cavitation events will not reach its target due to the statistical nature of the cavitation increasing the number of micro cavitation events should increase the likelihood of the direct contact between the bacterial cell and the cavitation bubble therefore to increase efficiency of cavitation for bacterial killing purpose one should aim to increase the density of microbubbles in the suspension yet the effectiveness of different sized cavitation bubbles micro and macro scale on cells is still not exploited and could have an effect of effectiveness as suggested by zevnik and dular 2022 determining the bacterial threshold mechanical loads enables quantitative assessment and further optimization of novel surface and water treatment technologies to provide more efficient and chemical free processes of water treatment on the other hand the ability to produce and manipulate single cavitation microbubbles could have far more reaching consequences for the future technologies for example a reliable production of single cavitation microbubbles could be used in medicine as a high precision surgical tool with the ability to mechanically remove problematic cells with the minimal collateral damage the use of high energy quanta released during the single cavitation event could also be used in nanotechnology for targeted delivery of molecular payloads or for nanopatterning of biotic and

stand off distance to 200 µm between the needles increases maximum bubble radius to rmax 874 22 µm to directly compare different experimental and numerical results bubble radii and the corresponding times were transformed into their non dimensional form as r r r r r r m a x and t t t m a x t c respectively temporal bubble size dynamics shows symmetrical bubble growth and collapse where initial bubble growth shows some discrepancies as ambient pressure oscillations are present generation of single microbubble cavitation started with short laser pulse on magnetic microbead to produce nucleation microbubble fig a2 nucleation microbubble was located on the surface of the magnetic microbead or was detached from surface of the microbead next the high voltage spark discharge was released to produce cavitation bubble and propagation of pressure waves lag time between generation of nucleation bubble and spark discharge bubble was approx between 50 and 100 ms this lag time didn t have influence on microbubble collapse as nucleation microbubble lifetime was in the range of hundredths of miliseconds surface attached bacterial cells were homogenously distributed on pll coated glass slide fig a3 bacterial cells formed a monolayer of cells on a glass surface which were firmly adhered as neither propagation of pressure waves nor generation of nucleation bubble had impact on a nearby cells appendix b flow field characterization during a single microbubble event the experimental chamber was filled with dh2o and magnetic beads as described in materials and methods 2 1 single microbubble generation additionally silica beads bang laboratories 4 µm diameter were added to a final concentration of approximately 104 beads ml the silica beads were accurately positioned at the desired distance from the nucleation microbubble by optical tweezers high speed imaging was acquired as described in materials and methods 2 1 single microbubble generation for determination of bead positions on high speed images the imagej trackmate plugin was used tinevez et al 2017 log laplacian of gaussian detector was used to automatically detect silica bead with estimated object diameter 4 2 µm furthermore possible false detection of particle position was manually corrected for particle tracking simple linear assignment problem lap tracker was used through bead position tracking we could determine bead displacements and velocities induced by a single cavitation microbubble event on a µs timeframe fig a4 b the obtained peak and time averaged microbead velocities in relation to parameter δ are gathered in fig a4a from there it is clear that microbead velocities show a nonmonotonic decreasing trend along the bubble particle distance parameter δ additionally these results were later used a means of validating the employed numerical methodology to resolve fluid flow at the proximity of the microbubble appendix c appendix c numerical model validation near wall microbubble dynamics numerical model of near wall microbubble dynamics was validated against the experimental results of microbubble shape and size evolution it is important to note that we refer to the bubble radius r r as a radius of the outer contour of the bubble shape from the experimental observations which can be understood as a vertical projection of the bubble shape to the horizontal plane the maximum bubble radius rr max from validation experiments varied between 11 0 and 20 5 µm mean 14 5 µm n 24 and were obtained by high speed visualization the nondimensional bubble wall distance γ was varied between 0 20 and 0 46 mean 0 30 n 24 here rr max and tmax denote the maximal bubble radius and the corresponding time and tc the bubble collapse time simulations yield rr max 16 3 0 5 µm tmax 1 58 0 05 µs and tc 1 73 0 07 µs 0 18 γ 0 48 increment δγ 0 1 n 4 a comparison between the experimentally and numerically obtained cavitation microbubble radii is given in fig a5 the non dimensional projected microbubble radius rr is in good agreement with the experimentally observed radii especially when one considers the technical limitations at the considered spatiotemporal scales some discrepancies can be observed during the initial stages of microbubble expansion t 0 9 this can be explained by the fact that the experimental microbubbles expanded according to the ambient pressure oscillations local focusing of a tensile wave which is some cases led to a slower rate of the initial microbubble expansion depending on the characteristics of the locally induced pressure field nevertheless the present and previous zeng et al 2018 research shows that peak bubble induced mechanical loads occur during the bubble collapse phase which is the reason that we consider these discrepancies as still acceptable in the present case visualization of numerically obtained bubble shape evolution revealed two distinct characteristic modes of bubble collapse which primarily depend on the value of the bubble wall distance parameter γ fig a6 both bubble collapse modes include a uniaxial jet formation towards the wall however their characteristics velocity size vastly differ between both modes the occurrence of different jetting mechanisms and the developed jet characteristics are in good agreement with previous studies of near wall bubble dynamics on larger scales lechner et al 2020 the present experimental setup unfortunately does not allow for evaluation of the developed jet velocities and visualization of fast jets due to the high speed visualization constraints temporal resolution 1 44 106 fps spatial resolution 0 33 μm px this has presented as a major challenge even with larger macro bubbles reuter and ohl 2021 however the fact that we were unable to observe a jet formation for all experimental cases with γ 0 25 is in line with the occurrence of very fast and thin jets as predicted by numerical simulations microbubble induced velocity field the microbubble induced ambient velocity field was experimentally characterized by measuring the displacements of silica microbeads as described in appendix b the obtained time averaged and maximum microbead velocities were used to validate the numerical model for the resolution of the near bubble flow field development direct comparison between experimental and numerical results is given in fig a7 overall the numerical model does seem to overpredict microbead velocities however this can be largely attributed the fact that the experimentally obtained results are prone to underestimation due to high speed photography constraints high speed camera frame rate of 1 44 106 fps yields δt 0 7 µs in comparison the numerical simulations offer much finer temporal resolution with δ t 0 1 μ s appendix d statistical analysis cell event probability versus δ was fitted to the exponential curve model fit of the median cell detachment probability yields p e 2δ rmse 0 039 r2 0 98 while fit of the median cell dead probability versus δ yields p e 4δ rmse 0 044 r2 0 98 for the effect of jetting mechanism on cell detachment and death a two sample kolmogorov smirnov tests for median cell event probability distributions along δ with threshold γ of 0 30 yields p values of 0 77 and 0 71 for cell detachment and death respectively 
14847,cavitation is a potentially useful phenomenon accompanied by extreme conditions which is one of the reasons for its increased use in a variety of applications such as surface cleaning enhanced chemistry and water treatment yet we are still not able to answer many fundamental questions related to efficacy and effectiveness of cavitation treatment such as can single bubbles destroy contaminants and what precisely is the mechanism behind bubble s cleaning power for these reasons the present paper addresses cavitation as a tool for eradication and removal of wall bound bacteria at a fundamental level of a single microbubble and a bacterial cell we present a method to study bubble bacteria interaction on a nano to microscale resolution in both space and time the method allows for accurate and fast positioning of a single microbubble above the individual wall bound bacterial cell with optical tweezers and triggering of a violent microscale cavitation event which either results in mechanical removal or destruction of the bacterial cell results on e coli bacteria show that only cells in the immediate vicinity of the microbubble are affected and that a very high likelihood of cell detachment and cell death exists for cells located directly under the center of a bubble further details behind near wall microbubble dynamics are revealed by numerical simulations which demonstrate that a water jet resulting from a near wall bubble implosion is the primary mechanism of wall bound cell damage the results suggest that peak hydrodynamic forces as high as 0 8 μn and 1 2 μn are required to achieve consistent e coli bacterial cell detachment or death with high frequency mechanical perturbations on a nano to microsecond time scale understanding of the cavitation phenomenon at a fundamental level of a single bubble will enable further optimization of novel water treatment and surface cleaning technologies to provide more efficient and chemical free processes

introduction cavitation rapid vaporization and bubble collapse due to a local change in pressure is a widely used method in industry and research for cleaning disinfection dispersion cell disruption and isolation of cell components zupanc et al 2019 furthermore it is recognized as effective and chemical free novel advanced water and wastewater treatment process šarc et al 2016 zupanc et al 2019 2014 the macroscopic effects of cavitation on bacteria are the results of implosions of a large number of bubbles gogate and pandit 2005 paliwal and mitragotri 2006 zupanc et al 2019 however the effects of the large bubble clusters do not reveal the inherent nature of cavitation and a plethora of possible cavitation modes of action on bacteria mechanical physical chemical as stated by prosperetti thousands of papers have been devoted to the subject of bubbles yet the exact mode of action of the bubble has not been elucidated prosperetti 2004 to evaluate the effect of cavitation on bacteria at a fundamental level one needs to downscale the cavitation process to a single cavitation bubble which is similar in size to a bacterial cell to do so spatio temporal control of a single cavitation microbubble is required which is currently missing in this work we test the effect of high frequency mechanical stress produced by a single microbubble on bacterial ability to survive the cavitation microbubble forms when formation of micrometer sized vapor and gas cavities inside a liquid medium are followed by a violent cavitation implosion on a nano to microsecond time scale time dependent response of bacteria to mechanical stress reveals a rubbery cell material response at low frequencies viscoelastic response at intermediate frequencies and glassy response at high frequencies vadillo rodríguez and dutcher 2011 the intermediate frequency regime corresponds to a characteristic time of cell growth when the cell is optimally adapted to the environment and most difficult to eradicate from a material point of view bacteria should be most susceptible to mechanical stress and consequently to destruction when exposed to high frequencies when cell wall material behavior changes from ductile to brittle and irreversible changes in cell wall structure are likely to occur whereas bacterial response to low and intermediate mechanical stress frequencies are well characterized by atomic force microscopy laminar flow studies and growth studies in confined spaces amir et al 2014 tuson et al 2012 vezenov and barrett 2013 the bacterial response to high frequency mechanical stress i e in the micro or nanosecond domain is not well documented the interactions of a cavitation bubble tens of micrometers in size with eukaryotic cells have been described jasikova et al 2019 o connor et al 2021 ohl et al 2006 rau et al 2006 mostly laser induced cavitation was used to provide controllable bubble collapse however due to intense laser irradiance plasma formation and reactive species development patinglag et al 2021 sinibaldi et al 2019 the mechanical effects of cavitation on eukaryotic cells may be largely masked in contrast to eukaryotic cells single bubble bacteria interactions have not been studied mainly due to unreliable production of micrometer size cavitation bubbles lack of the ability to manipulate and position bubbles at a desired location and small size of bacteria and microbubbles which are close to the diffraction limit of the light microscope we show the development of a new method which enables a real time evaluation of the bacterial response to the mechanical stress induced by a single microbubble cavitation event on a nano to microsecond time scale the combination of optical tweezers and pressure waves enabled an accurate and fast positioning of a single microbubble and controlled induction of single microbubble cavitation event with the optical tweezer we have produced a stable single nucleation bubble in the vicinity of the bacterial cell the microbubble cavitation was triggered remotely with high voltage electric discharge which promoted pressure waves through the medium and induced nucleation microbubble growth and collapse observed with high speed camera direct observation of the interaction between a single cavitation microbubble and the individual bacterial cell is presented the evolution of the fluid flow field during the microbubble collapse was characterized by silica bead displacements which enabled in situ measurement of the fluid velocity field during the single cavitation event the effect of a single microbubble on bacterial cell viability was recorded by fluorescence microscopy the experimental results were used to validate the results of the numerical model where the evolution of the single microbubble cavitation and its interaction with a bacterial cell was simulated the threshold wall shear stress and hydrodynamic force needed for cell detachment and bacterial death during the single microbubble cavitation event were estimated 2 methods 2 1 single microbubble generation to generate micrometer sized cavities a combination of optical tweezers and high voltage electric

capacitance of the piezo actuator was estimated at roughly 30 pf to accurately position electrical discharge in the medium the micron sized tip of tungsten surgical needles roboz surgical instrument rs 6065 0 5 mm diameter tapered to micrometer sized tip were carefully placed at desired stand off distances from each other mechanical driven piezo igniter unit was triggered via custom labview

positions of bacterial cells on the microscopic images center and maximum radius of microbubble were determined with high speed camera and photron viewer pfv 4 software location of the microbubble center was determined on microscopic images images were trimmed to 2x of maximum microbubble radius with the thresholded and trimmed brightfield images we obtained binary images of bacterial cells before and after microbubble collapse the possible nearby magnetic beads were eliminated from the image analysis with subtracting area of the beads from binary images to fully separate overlapping cells additional manual review and segmentation of the cells was performed on binary images the location of each bacterium was determined before and after the cavitation microbubble collapse plugin analyze particles with center of mass measurement for location of bacterial cell on image the detached cells were determined by subtracting binary images before and after collapse additionally we analyzed images from red fluorescence channel pi dye prior and after the cavitation microbubble collapse to determine the number of dead bacterial cells data analysis a schematic representation of the microbubble bacterium interaction model at different perspectives is given in fig 2 the cell locations obtained from image analysis were transformed into a non dimensional distance δ as follows 1 δ x c e l l x b u b b l e c e n t e r 2 y c e l l y b u b b l e c e n t e r 2 r r m a x here x and y denote the horizontal and vertical coordinate a subscript cell denotes the corresponding coordinate of the cell center whereas rr max stands for the maximal projected bubble radius presently δ ranges between 0 at the microbubble center and 2 two maximal radii away from the microbubble center each class of bacteria initial state detached cells attached but dead cells final state was discretized into bins with width of δδ 0 1 20 bins in total the probability of bacterial detachment and cell death for each experimental repeat was determined in relation to δ the event probability for cell detachment and cell damage in the j th bin of the i th experimental repeat was defined as follows 2 p d e t a c h i j max n d e t a c h i j n c e l l i n i i j n c e l l i n i i j n c e l l f i n a l i j n c e l l i n i i j 3 p d e a d i j n d e a d i j n c e l l i n i i j 4 p d e a d n o n d e t a c h e d i j n d e a d i j n c e l l f i n a l i j where n cell ini i j n cell final i j n detach i j and n d e a d i j denote the number of cells in the j th bin of the i th experimental repeat at the initial and final state the number of cells identified as detached and the number of dead cells respectively cell death probability is determined in relation to both the initial state and to the final state the latter represents the cell death probability for non detached cells only 2 3 numerical methods numerical simulations of near wall microbubble dynamics were employed to reveal further details regarding bubble shape evolution and the resulting flow field these results were then used to determine the hydrodynamic forces on nearby wall bound bacterial cells according to the attached cell model validation of the employed methodology can be found in appendix b and c bubble dynamics model the presently utilized bubble dynamics model ansys 2021 is based on the finite volume method along with the volume of fluid method to resolve compressible multiphase flow two fluid phases are considered a gas bubble and ambient liquid and their interfaces are captured by solving continuity equations for the volume fraction field α l of the liquid phase equation of mass conservation for the liquid phase can be written as 5 α l ρ l t α l ρ l u l 0 here ρ l and u l denote the density and velocity vector field of the liquid phase the volume fraction field of the gas phase α g can be obtained as α g 1 α l after both volume fraction fields are known we can determine the volume averaged fluid properties ϕ throughout the whole computational domain as ϕ i α i ϕ i in the present case this is true for density ρ dynamic viscosity μ and thermal conductivity k based on the determined material properties a single momentum eq 6 and energy eq 7 equation can be solved which yields the shared velocity u and temperature t fields 6 t ρ u ρ u u p τ b 7 t ρ e u ρ e p k t here p denotes pressure b body forces τ the viscous stress tensor and e the total specific energy presently both phases are considered as newtonian fluids the effects of surface tension are considered at the interface between the gas phase and ambient liquid the pressure jump across the liquid gas interface is modeled with a body force in the momentum equation according to the continuum surface force model brackbill et al 1992 the liquid phase is modeled as compressible according to the tait s equation of state whereas the gas phase is considered as ideal gas numerical model setup expansion of an initially stable microbubble initial radius r0 1 1 µm is achieved by over pressurizing the bubble interior initial bubble pressure 1 96 108 pa in comparison to the ambient pressure p 101 325 pa the ambient liquid temperature is set to 293 15 k a bubble is initiated between db 1 5 µm and 15 µm increment of 1 5 µm away from the wall which in the present case amounts to the non dimensional bubble wall distance γ db rr max between 0 087 and 1 02 increment of 0 1 the gas phase is considered as air and the ambient liquid as water the corresponding material parameter are given in table 1 simulations are done in axial symmetry with an orthogonal grid of uniform spacing in vicinity of the bubble δx 44 nm r0 δx 25 rr max δx 370 chosen based on grid and time step independence analysis in previous research zevnik and dular 2022 2021 2020 in addition solution convergence for the present case was additionally controlled for the case with γ 0 2 for the maximum jet speed see fig a6c the error at the chosen resolution towards the grid independent solution was estimated at 7 4 the grid independent solution was calculated according to the richardson interpolation from the results obtained by three sequential simulations with resolutions of roughly 200 400 and 800 computational cells per maximum bubble diameter the grid spacing gradually coarsens towards the computational domain edges and the total number of cells at the chosen resolution is in the order of half a million computational time step is set according to the courant friedrichs lewy condition with the maximum cell courant number of 0 2 boundary conditions at the end of the computational domain were set to wave non reflecting pressure outlet p 101 325 pa t 293 15 k and no slip condition is considered at the wall more details regarding the employed numerical model and setup can be found in our previous work zevnik and dular 2022 attached cell model expanding and collapsing cavitation microbubble induces a temporally and spatially variable flow field in the ambient liquid which exerts hydrodynamic loads on nearby wall bound cells under the assumption of a spherical cell shape we can estimate the hydrodynamic drag force f d which can be for an attached spherical cell of radius r c written as 8 f d 1 2 ρ l π r c 2 c d u u here u u t r c is local flow velocity at the location of the cell r c since the presence of cells is not actually considered in the bubble dynamics model the height of bacterial cells h c above the wall is not guaranteed to be greater than the numerically obtained liquid film thickness formed between the bottom bubble surface and the wall due to the small standoff bubble wall distances γ considered the effective flow velocity is thus determined as 9 u t r c 1 h c z 0 z h c α l u t r c z d z where only velocity field of the liquid phase is considered to better represent the actual experimental conditions where the bubble is expected to overlay the cells rather than engulf them the drag coefficient c d can be calculated according to the kaskas equation kaskas 1964 as 10 c d 24 r e 4 r e 0 4 which is valid for reynolds numbers r e 2 10 5 reynolds number is presently defined as 11 r e 2 r c ρ l u μ l presently cells are considered as spheres with radius of r c 1 8 d c 3 3 16 d c 2 l c d c 1 3 0 45 0 06 µm here l c 1 44 0 25 µm and d c 0 63 0 06 µm n 30 denote the actual bacterial cell length and diameter the latter also corresponds to the bacterial cell height h c above the wall the expression for cell radius rc is obtained from computing the equivalent radius of the actual bacterial cell volume assuming a spherocylindrical cell shape 2 4 cell event probability model the relation between the exerted peak hydrodynamic force and the probability of single cell event occurrence detachment cell death was quantified by fitting the obtained data to the cell event probability model the latter is described by a piecewise function with three coefficients the main relation between the chosen load metric and cell event probability is characterized by a power law function where the coefficients are set up in a way to represent the lower threshold load upper threshold load and the corresponding load exponent the cell event probability at the peak hydrodynamics force f m a x is fitted according to the following piecewise function 12 p e v e n t f m a x 0 f m a x f l t h f m a x β f f l t h β f f u t h β f f l t h β f f l t h f m a x f u t h 1 f u t h f m a x here f l t h and f u t h correspond to lower and upper peak force threshold the former can be understood as a threshold for the possible occurrence of the considered cell event p e v e n t f m a x 0 whereas the latter represents the upper threshold force above which the considered cell event is likely to occur for the vast majority of cells p e v e n t f m a x 1 β f is a third fitting coefficient and denotes the force exponent a similar model is employed to characterize cell event probability in relation to the peak wall shear stresses τ m a x model fitting was performed using a non linear least squares method along with a thrust region algorithm a global fit was performed for each load metric cell event pair 4 pairs in total 3 results 3 1 experimental observations of the interaction of a single cavitation microbubble with a bacterial cell upon a µs laser pulse local heating generated a micrometer sized stable nucleation microbubble with a median radius of 1 1 µm n 15 the lifespan of a nucleation microbubble was in the order of milliseconds to seconds and the nucleation microbubble formation had no effect on nearby bacterial cell adhesion and viability fig a3 the formation of an unstable cavitation microbubble fig 3 a was triggered by shock waves fig a1 induced by a remote spark discharge approximately 3 mm from the nucleation microbubble site the initially stable nucleation microbubble first underwent a contraction upon shock wave propagation which was then followed by an explosive microbubble expansion during 1 4 µs due to the focusing of a tensile wave the induced cavitation microbubble expanded in size to the median maximum radius of 15 4 µm n 15 during a rapid cavitation microbubble collapse 1 4 µs we were able to observe a microjet formation the latter was directed towards the rigid surface as indicated by the inner dark annulus on fig 3a the effect of a single microbubble collapse on a monolayer of attached bacterial cells is shown in fig 3b the bacterial cells were initially homogenously distributed over the entire field of view cell density was 0 15 0 03 cells µm2 and the magnetic beads were positioned at different locations in the vicinity of the bacterial cells by optical tweezers after exposure to microbubble collapse one can observe an area of detached bacterial cells in the center of the projected cavitation microbubble radius furthermore the zone of detached cells is surrounded by an annulus of still attached but damaged bacterial cells the fluorescence image red pseudo colored bacteria shows cells with a compromised cytoplasmic membrane the latter resulted in the uptake of membrane impermeable pi fluorophore indicating cell death the dashed circle represents the projected maximum microbubble radius rr max obtained from high speed camera imaging based on experimental results and image analysis we could categorize individual bacterial cells as either detached attached but dead or not affected fig 3c the area of damaged bacterial cells is similar to the projected maximum microbubble size due to high speed photography constraints temporal resolution 0 7 µs spatial resolution 3 px µm only cavitation microbubbles with the maximum expansion radius above 10 µm were used in further statistical analyses nevertheless it has to be stressed that the presented method also allows for a reproducible generation of smaller cavitation microbubbles in the most cases a single cycle of bubble oscillation was observed as shown in fig 3a however in rare cases the microbubble underwent an additional oscillation phase which could lead to an exaggerated estimate of the effectiveness of the primary bubble however the secondary oscillations occurred within the area of maximum bubble size where there is a high probability that cells are already detached or damaged from the primary oscillation cycle additionally it is important to note that in the absence of the stable nucleation microbubble the spark discharge did not induce cavitation events at the magnetic bead nor had any effect on bacterial cell adhesion and viability in the observed experimental volume fig a3 also according to the high speed microbubble shape visualizations the presence of magnetic microbeads did not affect the microbubble dynamics near the solid wall 3 2 mechanisms that cause bacterial cell detachment and damage to gain a mechanistic insight into the microbubble bacteria interaction numerical simulations of near wall microbubble dynamics were performed from which bubble shape evolution and the resulting flow field were obtained these results were then used to determine the hydrodynamic forces on nearby wall bound bacterial cells fig 4 the obtained numerical results reveal two distinct characteristic modes of microbubble collapse which primarily depend on the value of the microbubble wall distance parameter γ presently defined as a ratio of the initial bubble wall distance and the maximum projected microbubble radius fig 2 both bubble collapse modes include a uniaxial jet formation towards the wall however the characteristics of the developed jets vastly differ between both modes for microbubbles in extreme vicinity of the wall γ 0 3 a very fast and thin jet towards the wall is developed fig 4a with the peak jet velocity well above 1000 m s between 1200 and 1400 m s and a normalized jet radius rjet rr max of 0 021 0 001 on the other hand for microbubbles with γ 0 4 a commonly recognized classical jet can be observed fig 4b with a normalized radius of 0 30 0 02 and peak velocities between 56 and 75 m s 64 8 m s the resulting peak wall shear stresses and hydrodynamic forces during a single cavitation event are given in fig 4c which shows high spatial variability and non linear dependence on the microbubble cell distance δ one can observe an increase in the width of the shaded area min max envelope for δ 0 2 which points towards a highly variable magnitude of peak microbubble induced mechanical loads in the region of the jet impact this can be attributed to the fact that different microbubble jetting modes can occur along the bubble wall distance parameter γ fig 4a b peak magnitudes of the hydrodynamic forces and wall shear stresses at δ 0 1 can locally reach ten micronewtons and a few megapascals respectively the occurrence of peak loads coincides with the time of jet impact and subsequent outward radial flow along the wall the peak loads however are highly transient tens of nanoseconds as their duration is roughly two orders of magnitude shorter than the cavitation microbubble lifetime few microseconds additionally the loads decay quickly with the distance from the center of the jet and cells at the distance of the maximum microbubble radius δ 1 are subjected to the peak local shear stress and hydrodynamic forces of 20 kpa and 70 nn which is several orders of magnitude smaller than in the center of the jet the results of the simulations are in line with the present experimental observations of bacterial cell detachment and destruction as the formed crater of detached cells in the center of the jet impact zone indicates the highest shear stresses and hydrodynamic forces 3 3 effectiveness of a cavitation microbubble to eradicate wall bound bacterial cells probabilities of the two main identified bacterial cell outcomes cell detachment and cell death are presented in fig 5 shown results are based on the data gathered from fifteen experimental cases where maximum radii of cavitation microbubbles and positions of e coli cells were documented in accordance with the definition of the microbubble cell distance δ fig 2 a very high likelihood almost 100 of cell detachment can be seen for cells located directly under the center of an imploding microbubble δ 0 2 this was already noted before from the microscopic images in the form of area without bacterial cells fig 3b as high probability for cell detachment directly under the center of microbubble cell death is presented for values only above δ 0 2 with δ 0 2 cell detachment probability exponentially decreases reaching 25 probability at δ 1 and 10 for δ 1 5 due to inability to track detached cells e coli viability was determined from the cells that remained attached fig 5b we can observe that cell death probability exponentially decreases with δ and is practically null for δ 1 the results suggest that it is easier to detach bacterial cells than to damage them as the former outcomes shows consistently higher probabilities along δ i e the median probability for bacterial cell detachment decreases towards only after δ 2 whereas cell death is decreased toward zero already at δ 0 8 3 4 required mechanical loads for removal and eradication of bacteria on a temporal scale of a single cavitation microbubble event the relation between the exerted peak mechanical loads and the probability of identified cell outcomes is given in fig 6 the obtained experimental and numerical results were fitted to a piecewise power law model materials and methods section 2 4 cell event probability model the obtained model parameters table 2 can be understood as the threshold mechanical loads for the possible outcome of cell detachment or death when subjected to high frequency mechanical perturbations on a nano to microsecond time scale the lower threshold corresponds to the bound below which a certain cell outcome is highly unlikely p 0 whereas the upper threshold denotes the bound above which a cell outcome has a very high likelihood of occurrence p 1 presently we observed a very high likelihood of e coli bacteria detachment at peak hydrodynamic force of 0 8 0 1 µn and cell death at 1 2 0 5 µn these values translate to the microbubble cell distance for a highly probable outcome of cell detachment on the interval of δ 0 0 4 and δ 0 0 35 for cell death in certain applications especially in medicine a similar question is usually framed the other way around at what forces or bubble cell distances can we still expect the cells to remain viable in our case cells are not expected to get detached or damaged when peak forces are below 14 4 nn and 52 14 nn additionally microbubble collapse mode fast thin jet versus classical jet did not affect the obtained cell event probability distribution along δ appendix d which suggests that e coli cell detachment or death is independent of the microbubble jetting mechanism 4 discussion downscaling of the cavitation process to a single cavitation microbubble and study of its interaction with a bacterial cell has not been performed yet in this study spatio temporal control of a single cavitation microbubble combined with numerical analysis provided unprecedented mechanistic insight into hydrodynamic forces and shear stresses that affect individual bacterial cells during a single cavitation microbubble event we present a direct observation of bacterial cell response to high frequency mechanical perturbations spanning the time domain from nanosecond to microsecond high frequency perturbations on bacterial cells have been used with mixed success for antibacterial purposes in the past salmen et al 2018 wietzikoski lovato et al 2018 for example exposure of s epidermidis and s aureus to high frequency electromagnetic fields mostly produced no statistically significant decrease on bacterial growth on the other hand exposure of p aeruginosa to electromagnetic fields at 900 mhz led to a significant reduction in growth rate while 1800 mhz had insignificant effect the effects have been attributed to temperature gradients and the formation of reactive oxygen species ros although similar physico chemical effects on bacteria have been proposed for cavitation we argue that in the case of single microbubble cavitation event high frequency mechanical effects on bacterial cells are far more significant than temperature and ros the effects of a single microbubble collapse are highly transient as single microbubble growth and collapse is completed in approximately 5 μs those effects are not as sustained as in the case of high frequency electromagnetic fields or high frequency ultrasound cavitation for example yasuda et al 2016 have used high frequency focused ultrasound 1 mhz pulses to generate ros but for an efficient ros generation they had to use a repeated sequence of high intensity pulses for 5 min in the case of ultrasound cavitation it is known that higher production of ros is expected at high frequency ultrasound 100 khz and above as less energy during the bubble collapse translates into shockwaves and the number of bubble collapses is increased mason et al 2011 yusof et al 2016 this suggests that during the single cavitation event a probability for ros generation is very low due to high reactivity of ros species it would be technically very challenging to detect their presence during the single cavitation event although the generation of ros cannot be completely excluded on the other hand physical mechanisms that accompany cavitation such as high local temperatures suslick et al 1999 strong shear flows zupanc et al 2014 jets dular et al 2019 shock waves petkovšek et al 2020 rapid pressure drop šarc et al 2016 and supersonic flow shamsborhan et al 2010 are much more likely during a single cavitation event the controlled single microbubble experiment together with computational simulations provides an opportunity to determine which mode of cavitation is more significant to bacterial inactivation during a microbubble collapse the temperature within the microbubble may reach peak values of several thousandths kelvin suslick et al 1999 however these are short lived and spatially confined to the center of the collapsing microbubble from our previous numerical research it follows that thermal load on bacteria during a single microbubble event could only be relevant in cases when the collapsing microbubble remains in the direct proximity of the cell surface zevnik and dular 2022 2021 2020 as the thermal boundary layer is thin in comparison to the maximal bubble size in the case of non attached microbubbles the temperature changes at the location of a bacterium are in fact negligibly small and well below the threshold for bacterial death mitsuzawa et al 2006 the same however cannot be said for compressive and shear loads the experimental and numerical results suggest that the main contributing damaging mechanism for wall bound bacteria is a microjet formation towards the wall upon impact the jet changes flow direction and flows radially outwards along the wall causing high local pressures and shear forces on the attached cells looking at the maximum calculated values along δ we can observe shear stresses in the order of a few megapascal and the resulting hydrodynamic forces as high as ten micronewtons the presently obtained results point toward the jet impact and its outflow along the wall as the primary mechanism that causes wall bound bacterial cell detachment and death when a single near wall microbubble event is considered nevertheless we presently cannot exclude the possibility of a synergistic effect of other potentially damaging mechanisms such as free radicals and shock waves the reasoning for outlining the jet as the primary mechanism is as follows first a microbubble event causes cells either to detach from the wall die or remain unaffected the regions of detached cells exhibit round shapes and are surrounded by annular shaped areas of attached but dead bacterial cells centers of both regions are tightly related to the bubble center which also corresponds to the jet center see figs 3b and 3c these findings point towards a mechanism that can be characterized by axial symmetry with its center at the bubble jet center second the results imply that cell detachment is practically guaranteed for δ 0 3 which is followed by a monotonic and gradually decreasing trend of cell detachment probability with radial distance δ from the bubble jet center see fig 5a a similar trend was also observed for cell death see fig 5b similar non linearly decreasing trends are obtained for both bubble induced load metrics peak hydrodynamic force and wall shear stress obtained from numerical simulations furthermore the occurrence of peak calculated loads corresponds to the time of jet impact and its radial outflow along the wall third the radial position of the toroidal bubble collapse is obtained to range between 0 23 δ 0 36 see non dimensional rr at non dimensional t 1 in fig a5 and bubble shapes at t4 in figs a6a and a6b we do not exclude the toroidal bubble collapse as a contributing mechanism for causing bacterial cell detachment and death however based on the observed trends of cell outcomes with radial distance δ from the bubble center we find it highly unlikely to be the primary damaging mechanism furthermore our previous research pandur et al 2022 zevnik and dular 2022 2021 points toward a conclusion that high pressure and shock waves of magnitude characteristics of bubble collapse are not being sufficient to cause bacterial cell damage the reason for this is a relatively high stability of bacterial cell envelopes to compressive loads their high compliance and thus a similar acoustic impedance to water which renders them almost invisible to weak shock waves nevertheless an important note to add here is that we expect the intensity of bubble collapse to play an important role in this regard which could lead to different conclusions with other considered bubble collapse scenarios than the ones considered in the present study for example reuter et al 2022 have just recently observed that cavitation erosion of harder materials occurs only for laser induced bubble collapses at close stand offs below γ 0 2 where a shock wave self focusing mechanism develops however the latter results from non axially symmetric bubble collapse causes the damage to be localized to a narrow spot away from the central axis which is not the case in the presently obtained results as observed there are three possible outcomes for bacteria after a single cavitation event bacteria are either detached remain attached but dead or remain attached and viable the probability for cell detachment and damage exponentially decreases with bubble cell distance similar effects were observed for attached eukaryotic cells gac et al 2007 hellman et al 2008 jasikova et al 2019 o connor et al 2021 ohl et al 2006 rau et al 2006 zhou et al 2012 for a single cavitation event we determined hydrodynamic force for bacterial detachment to be in the range from 14 nn to 0 8 µn the detachment probability increases with hydrodynamic force and is very likely above 1 µn p 1 detachment of e coli from a pll coated glass substrate was measured independently with fluidfm method by potthoff et al 2015 who measured the detachment force of 14 nn per cell this is comparable to our detachment threshold force the threshold force for cell death was higher than for detachment 1 2 µn this is in line with the reported bursting force of 3 6 µn for the exponential grown e coli shiu et al 1999 the highest mechanical stress was calculated at the projected center of microbubble collapse due to jet formation which is consistent with the experimental observation where all bacteria detached at the center of the projected cavitation microbubble the obtained peak wall shear stress of 145 kpa during the single cavitation event corresponds to the one reported by zeng et al 2018 where they report wall shear stresses of 100 kpa after the jet impact numerical results revealed two distinct modes of microbubble collapse a classical jet dular et al 2019 and a fast thin jet koch et al 2021 lechner et al 2020 2019 reuter and ohl 2021 depending on the microbubble wall distance we were unable to experimentally observe a fast needle like jet due to the limited spatial temporal resolution of the high speed camera although observation in bigger cavitating bubbles were recently reported koch et al 2021 lechner et al 2020 reuter and ohl 2021 despite different jetting modes bacterial cell detachment nor viability did not significantly differ between the two jetting modes this finding can be further explained by the obtained numerical results presented in fig 4c where peak bubble induced loads are shown there we can observe that the min max envelopes of both load metrics exhibit very high variation beyond an order of magnitude across γ in the region directly below the bubble center δ 0 2 which can be attributed to vastly different microbubble collapse and jetting dynamics however moving further away from the bubble center we can observe a relatively narrow span of the min max envelope up to a few ten percents for δ 0 5 between all considered cases 0 15 γ 0 58 this implies that the peak loads on cells are of similar magnitudes across both identified bubble jetting modes i e fast thin jet and classical jet when cells are positioned sufficiently far away from the bubble center δ 0 5 one additional important thing to consider is the fact that with δ 0 3 virtually all cells were either detached or remained attached to the wall but died see fig 5 from that one can deduce that even bubble collapse with classical jet formation causes high enough loads to affect bacterial cells the results of this study imply an intimate relation between the bacterial cell and a cavitation microbubble only when the two are in contact or in very close proximity a bubble has an effect on the bacterial cell the detrimental effect of cavitation on bacterial viability and attachment is spatially confined to the center of the projected cavitation microbubble this suggests that a vast majority of cavitation events in the suspension will go unnoticed by bacteria of course one should not neglect micro and macro streaming of the fluid induced by cavitation events which is expected to have a cleaning effect verhaagen and fernández rivas 2016 while the results are strictly speaking valid only for e coli a gram negative bacterium recent numerical simulations by zevnik and dular 2022 revealed that the difference in peak cavitation forces felt by gram negative and gram positive bacteria is only 20 30 however this needs to be experimentally verified the present research focused on a relation between cavitation microbubbles and attached cells which renders the findings as less applicable to free floating planktonic cells in suspensions however still most of the bacterial cells in environment are present in a group of cells i e biofilms or flocs or at least are embedded in complex biological extracellular matrix costerton et al 1995 guasto et al 2012 hall stoodley et al 2004 sretenovic et al 2017 all these cases could cause cavitating microbubbles to from characteristic jets toward bacterial cells as is also true in the presented paper examples of a complex medium are wastewater and activated sludge where enormous amount of biological material needs to be treated the threshold cavitation forces for embedded cells in biomatrix e g biofilms are currently unknown and could be higher due to increased biofilm stress resistance compared to monolayer costerton et al 1995 hall stoodley et al 2004 simunič et al 2020 however if one is interested in inactivation of bacteria the majority of cavitation events will not reach its target due to the statistical nature of the cavitation increasing the number of micro cavitation events should increase the likelihood of the direct contact between the bacterial cell and the cavitation bubble therefore to increase efficiency of cavitation for bacterial killing purpose one should aim to increase the density of microbubbles in the suspension yet the effectiveness of different sized cavitation bubbles micro and macro scale on cells is still not exploited and could have an effect of effectiveness as suggested by zevnik and dular 2022 determining the bacterial threshold mechanical loads enables quantitative assessment and further optimization of novel surface and water treatment technologies to provide more efficient and chemical free processes of water treatment on the other hand the ability to produce and manipulate single cavitation microbubbles could have far more reaching consequences for the future technologies for example a reliable production of single cavitation microbubbles could be used in medicine as a high precision surgical tool with the ability to mechanically remove problematic cells with the minimal collateral damage the use of high energy quanta released during the single cavitation event could also be used in nanotechnology for targeted delivery of molecular payloads or for nanopatterning of biotic and

is assembled out of two cavitation bubble events i high voltage spark discharge bubble collapse on millimeter scale and ii nucleation microbubble collapse on micrometer scale high voltage spark discharge is positioned in the experimental chamber via tungsten micrometer sized needles where bubble collapse dynamics can be seen in fig a1 bubble growth and collapse occurs in tenths of µs example in fig a1a at stand off distance 75 µm tmax 66 7 µs with rmax 720 µm generation of shockwaves can be observed at the beginning of spark discharge at the beginning of the plasma formation fig a1b estimated propagation of shockwaves was approximately 1700 m s manipulation of discharge bubble dynamics can be done via change od stand off distance between needles the effect of needle stand off distance on bubble maximum radius rmax during spark discharge bubble collapse is shown in fig a1c left figure at 25 µm stand off distance bubbles with rmax 638 36 µm can be produced increasing the stand off distance to 200 µm between the needles increases maximum bubble radius to rmax 874 22 µm to directly compare different experimental and numerical results bubble radii and the corresponding times were transformed into their non dimensional form as r r r r r r m a x and t t t m a x t c respectively temporal bubble size dynamics shows symmetrical bubble growth and collapse where initial bubble growth shows some discrepancies as ambient pressure oscillations are present generation of single microbubble cavitation started with short laser pulse on magnetic microbead to produce nucleation microbubble fig a2 nucleation microbubble was located on the surface of the magnetic microbead or was detached from surface of the microbead next the high voltage spark discharge was released to produce cavitation bubble and propagation of pressure waves lag time between generation of nucleation bubble and spark discharge bubble was approx between 50 and 100 ms this lag time didn t have influence on microbubble collapse as nucleation microbubble lifetime was in the range of hundredths of miliseconds surface attached bacterial cells were homogenously distributed on pll coated glass slide fig a3 bacterial cells formed a monolayer of cells on a glass surface which were firmly adhered as neither propagation of pressure waves nor generation of nucleation bubble had impact on a nearby cells appendix b flow field characterization during a single microbubble event the experimental chamber was filled with dh2o and magnetic beads as described in materials and methods 2 1 single microbubble generation additionally silica beads bang laboratories 4 µm diameter were added to a final concentration of approximately 104 beads ml the silica beads were accurately positioned at the desired distance from the nucleation microbubble by optical tweezers high speed imaging was acquired as described in materials and methods 2 1 single microbubble generation for determination of bead positions on high speed images the imagej trackmate plugin was used tinevez et al 2017 log laplacian of gaussian detector was used to automatically detect silica bead with estimated object diameter 4 2 µm furthermore possible false detection of particle position was manually corrected for particle tracking simple linear assignment problem lap tracker was used through bead position tracking we could determine bead displacements and velocities induced by a single cavitation microbubble event on a µs timeframe fig a4 b the obtained peak and time averaged microbead velocities in relation to parameter δ are gathered in fig a4a from there it is clear that microbead velocities show a nonmonotonic decreasing trend along the bubble particle distance parameter δ additionally these results were later used a means of validating the employed numerical methodology to resolve fluid flow at the proximity of the microbubble appendix c appendix c numerical model validation near wall microbubble dynamics numerical model of near wall microbubble dynamics was validated against the experimental results of microbubble shape and size evolution it is important to note that we refer to the bubble radius r r as a radius of the outer contour of the bubble shape from the experimental observations which can be understood as a vertical projection of the bubble shape to the horizontal plane the maximum bubble radius rr max from validation experiments varied between 11 0 and 20 5 µm mean 14 5 µm n 24 and were obtained by high speed visualization the nondimensional bubble wall distance γ was varied between 0 20 and 0 46 mean 0 30 n 24 here rr max and tmax denote the maximal bubble radius and the corresponding time and tc the bubble collapse time simulations yield rr max 16 3 0 5 µm tmax 1 58 0 05 µs and tc 1 73 0 07 µs 0 18 γ 0 48 increment δγ 0 1 n 4 a comparison between the experimentally and numerically obtained cavitation microbubble radii is given in fig a5 the non dimensional projected microbubble radius rr is in good agreement with the experimentally observed radii especially when one considers the technical limitations at the considered spatiotemporal scales some discrepancies can be observed during the initial stages of microbubble expansion t 0 9 this can be explained by the fact that the experimental microbubbles expanded according to the ambient pressure oscillations local focusing of a tensile wave which is some cases led to a slower rate of the initial microbubble expansion depending on the characteristics of the locally induced pressure field nevertheless the present and previous zeng et al 2018 research shows that peak bubble induced mechanical loads occur during the bubble collapse phase which is the reason that we consider these discrepancies as still acceptable in the present case visualization of numerically obtained bubble shape evolution revealed two distinct characteristic modes of bubble collapse which primarily depend on the value of the bubble wall distance parameter γ fig a6 both bubble collapse modes include a uniaxial jet formation towards the wall however their characteristics velocity size vastly differ between both modes the occurrence of different jetting mechanisms and the developed jet characteristics are in good agreement with previous studies of near wall bubble dynamics on larger scales lechner et al 2020 the present experimental setup unfortunately does not allow for evaluation of the developed jet velocities and visualization of fast jets due to the high speed visualization constraints temporal resolution 1 44 106 fps spatial resolution 0 33 μm px this has presented as a major challenge even with larger macro bubbles reuter and ohl 2021 however the fact that we were unable to observe a jet formation for all experimental cases with γ 0 25 is in line with the occurrence of very fast and thin jets as predicted by numerical simulations microbubble induced velocity field the microbubble induced ambient velocity field was experimentally characterized by measuring the displacements of silica microbeads as described in appendix b the obtained time averaged and maximum microbead velocities were used to validate the numerical model for the resolution of the near bubble flow field development direct comparison between experimental and numerical results is given in fig a7 overall the numerical model does seem to overpredict microbead velocities however this can be largely attributed the fact that the experimentally obtained results are prone to underestimation due to high speed photography constraints high speed camera frame rate of 1 44 106 fps yields δt 0 7 µs in comparison the numerical simulations offer much finer temporal resolution with δ t 0 1 μ s appendix d statistical analysis cell event probability versus δ was fitted to the exponential curve model fit of the median cell detachment probability yields p e 2δ rmse 0 039 r2 0 98 while fit of the median cell dead probability versus δ yields p e 4δ rmse 0 044 r2 0 98 for the effect of jetting mechanism on cell detachment and death a two sample kolmogorov smirnov tests for median cell event probability distributions along δ with threshold γ of 0 30 yields p values of 0 77 and 0 71 for cell detachment and death respectively

traditionally research has been focused on the biomineralization process of pom in which microorganisms play an important role zhang et al 2022a recent studies have revealed that photochemical transformation is also important for the fate of pom harfmann et al 2021 helms et al 2014 lee et al 2021 liu and shank 2015 the photochemical transformation of pom caused by solar radiation can change

investigate dip release resulting from pom photodegradation in water focusing on molecular changes occurring during this process pom photodegradation and dip release were assessed through a simulated light experiment the molecular weight distribution species and structure of p containing formulas in pom during photodegradation were analyzed using ft icr ms in addition ros involved in pom photodegradation were investigated using a reactive oxygen molecular probe to obtain key results on the molecular mechanisms underlying dip release during the photochemical transformation of pom 2

midsummer day the internal temperature of the reactor was maintained at 35 2 c by connecting it with a quartz cold trap and a ventilation device before light irradiation the magnetic stirrer was turned on overnight to ensure that the particles in suspension in the photochemical reaction tubes were in a completely suspended state and weakly adsorbed p was completely released samples were collected at scheduled time intervals to analyze the concentration of dip dark treatment was set as a control and performed under the same conditions but by wrapping in tinfoil to clarify the contribution of pom photodegradation to dip concentrations in water filtered lake water samples under light and dark treatments were used as controls 2 2 determination of p content the amount of dip released from pom photodegradation was determined using the molybdenum blue colorimetric method murphy and riley 1962 the dissolved total phosphorus dtp content was measured after digestion with 5 potassium persulfate the dissolved organic phosphorus dop content was calculated by subtracting dip from dtp to assess the changes in p components during pom photodegradation the p fractions before and after light irradiation were analyzed by chemical sequential extraction as proposed by rydin 2000 details of the method can be found in fig s1 using this method p was separated into six groups

isopropanol ipa 0 2 superoxide dismutase sod 1200 u l catalase cat 20 u l 2 4 6 trimethyphenol tmp 10 mm and furfuryl alcohol ffa 5 mm were added to quench any hydroxyl radical oh superoxide anion o2 h2o2 excited triplet state chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom and singlet oxygen 1o2 zeng et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 respectively o2 was qualitatively analyzed by determining the content of diformazan produced by o2 and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride at 530 nm using a uv spectrophotometer zong et al 2020 the generated h2o2 was quantified by the colorimetric method using cerous sulfate the selective probe compound ffa at an initial concentration of 1 mm song and jiang 2020 was used to capture 1o2 the probe molecule for 3cdom tmp was added to the reaction solution at an initial concentration of 1 mm song and jiang 2020 to measure the oh concentration benzoic acid ba 1 g l was added to the system chen et al 2017 the concentrations of ffa tmp and para hydroxybenzoic acid pba generated by oh and ba were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 the detailed parameters of hplc analyses are listed in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of pom and variation in p content the fluorescence spectroscopy of pom under light irradiation and dark treatment is shown in fig s2 the signal intensity and region volume sharply decreased after light irradiation while almost no change was noted after dark treatment fig s2 and table s2 indicating that the fluorophoric pom components were degraded under light irradiation the concentration of toc in the pom extract decreased from 198 78 mg l to 93 68 mg l after light irradiation and the degradation rate reached to 52 87 in addition the parafac model with two to seven components was assessed based on the residual analysis and split half analysis three components including the protein like component c1 microbial humic like component c2 and terrestrial humic like component c3 were determined as the best fit fig 1 the maximum fluorescence intensity f max values of these three components significantly decreased after light irradiation the microbial humic like component c2 showed the highest decrease 55 3 followed by the terrestrial humic like component c3 50 5 and protein like component c1 42 6 indicating the photodegradation property of pom this property can affect the composition and fate of pom thereby affecting the concentration of bioavailable nutrients in aquatic environments and the eutrophication process fig 2 shows the release of dip during the photodegradation of pom in suspension the concentration of dip in the suspension increased under both light and dark treatments in the dark treatment group dip increased by 0 06 mg l mainly because of the microbial mineralization of pom in contrast dip increased by 0 35 mg l in the light treatment group this was approximately sixfold higher than that in the dark treatment group indicating that more pom was degraded during light treatment considering the amount of dip released in the filtered lake water after light treatment only 0 03 mg l fig 2a it could be confirmed that pom was a significant potential source of p in water kinetic analysis revealed that dip release during pom photodegradation fit the pseudo second order reaction table s3 and fig s3 indicating that intermediates were produced the analysis of dop concentration during the reaction process also revealed that as the irradiation time increased the dop concentration initially increased and then gradually decreased fig s4 indicating that dop may play a more intermediate role during the photodegradation of pom to further clarify the effect of microorganisms on phosphate release during pom degradation flow cytometry was performed to determine the number of microorganisms living and dead bacteria in the resuspended samples fig s5 and table s4 the number of microorganisms during light treatment was lower than that during dark treatment after 10 h indicating that the increase in dip concentration during light treatment was due to the photochemical degradation of pom to determine the p components involved in the photodegradation of pom chemical sequential extraction was performed to analyze the p components in pom the contents of bd p and naoh rp important components of the p pool in pom did not change significantly before and after light irradiation while that of naoh rp only increased slightly fig 2b these findings suggest that bd p and naoh rp are not the sources of dip release in solution the naoh nrp component organic bound p of pom significantly decreased after light irradiation fig 2b again indicating that op in pom degraded during light irradiation surprisingly the res p content also decreased significantly after light irradiation res p consists of refractory op and inert inorganic p rydin 2000 although inert op in res p is difficult to be biodegraded benitez nelson 2000 it can still undergo photochemical decomposition 3 2 variations in molecular characteristics of op the molecular weight distributions of pom and p containing formulas in pom before and after light irradiation are presented in fig 3 the median molecular mass of pom and p containing formulas decreased from 365 381 da to 339 335 da indicating that light irradiation resulted in the conversion of pom and p containing formulas into small molecules the average molecular weight of p containing formulas was 374 2 da table s5 which is close to that reported by ni et al 2021 however the number of p containing formulas detected in our sample 101 was lower than that reported by ni et al 75 670 ni et al 2021 this may be related to the sample composition pretreatment process and data analysis the changes in p containing formulas in pom before and after light irradiation are shown in fig 4 before light irradiation most p containing formulas were lipid lignin and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds with a relative abundance ra of 46 5 18 8 and 13 9 respectively this was followed by unsaturated hydrocarbon like 5 0 and protein like 2 0 p containing formula compounds no p containing formulas were detected in the tannin and condensed aromatic structure like formula compounds after light irradiation lipid unsaturated hydrocarbon and lignin like p containing formula compounds were almost removed their ra decreased by 94 6 94 4 and 48 3 respectively fig s6 some protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds with high o c were newly generated fig 4b the h cwa of p containing formulas increased from 1 78 to 2 01 and their o cwa increased from 0 20 to 0 75 after light irradiation table s5 indicating that p containing formulas exhibited higher saturation and stronger oxidation after light irradiation in summary our results indicate that photochemical degradation tended to remove p containing formula compounds in pom with a low oxygen content such as lipid and lignin like p containing formula compounds and produce p containing formula compounds with a high oxygen content such as protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds to illustrate the compositional changes occurring within each subcategory of molecules photodegradable peak lost photogenerated new peak and photoresistant peak retained p containing formulas after light irradiation are plotted in fig 5 photodegradable p containing formulas were mainly concentrated in the low o c region o c 0 3 and high h c region h c 1 0 in contrast photogenerated p containing formulas were mainly concentrated in the regions of o c 0 3 and h c 1 0 the quantitative distributions of photodegradable photogenerated and photoresistant p containing formulas are presented in fig s7 these results suggest that i less oxidized i e lower o c and more aliphatic i e higher h c compounds were preferentially degraded to generate oxygen rich molecules explaining the significant increase in o c values and ii the degradation of different o c and h c fractions in p varied greatly therefore the degradation potential of p containing formula compounds can be predicted by determining the o c and h c ratios of different p sources the transformation of p molecules can be inferred from the two dimensional display of kendrick mass defect kmd versus nominal mass in ft icr ms hughey et al 2001 molecules with the same kmd value correspond to compounds belonging to the same class and type but with different numbers of functional groups ch2 groups in this study alkyl chain length the difference between compounds with the same kmd value but different mass values can be explained by the change in the number of ch2 which represents the difference in the aliphatic properties of om riedel et al 2012 in other words the longer the alkyl chain length i e the more the number of ch2 groups the stronger is the aliphatic property of om an increase or decrease in the number of alkyl chain substituents of their homologous formula will correspondingly increase or decrease the molecular weight before light irradiation p containing formulas were evenly distributed in the range of 250 480 da fig 6 after light irradiation p containing formulas with different alkyl chain lengths were removed to varying degrees in the homologous series p containing formulas with higher mass values greater than 400 da were preferentially removed which corresponded to the decrease in their molecular weights table s5 when the kmd values were 0 25 p containing formulas were almost removed indicating lower removal selectivity by light irradiation this implies that p containing formulas with high molecular weights stronger aliphatic property and low kmd values are preferentially removed by light irradiation in addition the intensity of p containing formulas decreased to varying degrees after light irradiation also indicating the photodegradation of p containing formulas double bond equivalent dbe is an important parameter to clarify the unsaturation and aromaticity of organic compounds gao et al 2021 the distribution of dbe and carbon numbers cns can be used to analyze and compare the characteristics of oxygen containing molecules in om bae et al 2011 the relationship between the dbe and cns of p containing formulas is plotted in fig s8 before light irradiation p containing formulas had a wide dbe range of 0 9 this range is lower than that of p containing formula compounds 0 14 reported by gao et al in various treatment units of a wastewater treatment plant gao et al 2021 this indicates that the p containing formulas in our study had low unsaturation and low aromaticity which also corresponded to the lower aiwa after light irradiation formulas with dbe 5 were largely removed and the dbe value sharply decreased indicating an increase in double bonds unsaturated hydrocarbons or the opening of the benzene ring lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules liu et al 2014 because formulas with dbe 4 may contain one or more benzene rings moreover dbewa decreased from 2 35 to 0 63 after light irradiation indicating that the generated p containing formulas became more saturated and nonaromatic e g protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds this also explains the sharp decrease in aiwa and dbewa table s5 this result also corresponded to that of the p containing formulas presented in fig 5 p containing formulas had a cn range of 6 27 before light irradiation after light irradiation formulas with cns 15 were largely removed and the average cns decreased suggesting a decrease in the average molecular weight of p containing formulas table s5 and indicating the breakage of co p and or c p bonds by light irradiation the p containing formulas removed after light irradiation were characterized by a low oxygen content fig 5 while the generated p containing formulas were rich in oxygen and highly saturated the removed p containing formulas mainly included lipid like p containing formula compounds with a low oxygen content and some saturation unsaturated hydrocarbon like p containing formula compounds with low unsaturation and lignin like p containing formula compounds with a low oxygen content fig 4 as lipids are usually related to algae derived om with high bioavailability liu et al 2020 they can be easily removed after light irradiation previous studies considered lignin like om to be resistant hertkorn et al 2006 mesfioui et al 2012 opsahl and benner 1997 yuan et al 2017 however we found that part of the lignin like p containing formula compounds were degraded after light irradiation cf blue spheres in zone 5 fig 5 implying that lignin like p containing formula compounds were not completely inert and their reactivity could be related to their molecular structure in contrast lignin like p containing formula compounds with high o c pink spheres in fig 5 were produced after light irradiation these results suggest that lignin like p containing formula compounds with a low oxygen content are more photosensitive than those with a high oxygen content the relationship between the light sensitivity of lignin like p containing formula compounds and their molecular structures should be further investigated in future studies the generated p containing formulas were mainly protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds i e biolabile compounds and semibiolabile compounds freshly generated in surface waters chen et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 in brief p containing formulas generated after light irradiation have a high oxygen content high saturation and low aromaticity 3 3 role of ros ros play an important role in the element cycle of aquatic systems cory et al 2010 particularly 3cdom oh h2o2 1o2 and o2 are associated with the transformation of om in water under light irradiation li et al 2015 mcneill and canonica 2016 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 page et al 2011 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 to assess the effects of ros on pom photodegradation a series of ros capture experiments were performed as shown in fig 7 the release of dip decreased to varying degrees after adding various free radical scavengers after adding tmp a 3cdom scavenger the release of dip decreased by 59 2 after adding ipa an oh scavenger and cat an h2o2 scavenger the release of dip decreased by 38 8 and 32 6 respectively the order of contribution of each ros was as follows 3cdom oh h2o2 1o2 o2 fig s9 presents the time evolution of h2o2 o2 pba ffa a probe of 1o2 and tmp a probe of 3cdom during dark treatment there was no obvious transformation of probe molecules which was observed in ultrapure water especially for ffa and tmp the steady state concentrations and formation rates of 1o2 and 3cdom are summarized in table s6 the steady state concentrations and formation rates were 1 51 10 13 m and 0 76 10 7 m s respectively for 3cdom and 0 43 10 12 m and 0 11 10 6 m s respectively for 1o2 in suspension being much lower than those in filtered lake water this indicates that the presence of particles hinders the production of 1o2 and 3cdom or that the generated 1o2 and 3cdom are rapidly absorbed by particles however opposite results were observed for oh the accumulated oh content gradually increased with an increase in illumination time and those in suspension were higher than those in filtered lake water thus oh plays an important role in the photorelease of dip previous studies have revealed that both dop and particulate organic phosphorus pop can be photolyzed to release dip li et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the release of dip from dop is caused by the cleavage of p o bonds by oh zhao et al 2018 during the photodegradation of pom we found that the release of dip was accompanied by an increase in dop concentration fig s4 hence it can be inferred that pop in pom is first converted to dop and dop is then oxidized to produce dip in general oh is the main ros affecting the photochemical transformation of om in water goldstone et al 2002 we previously found that the photolytic release of p in water significantly decreased after adding an oh scavenger li et al 2017b however this phenomenon is different in lakes with different trophic states in mesotrophic lakes no3 is the main contributor of oh in water with the proliferation of lake eutrophication dissolved organic matter dom gradually becomes the main contributor of oh in water bodies guo et al 2020 lake nanhu selected in this experiment is severely affected by eutrophication and dom is the main contributor to oh generation in this lake notably the photochemical reaction of dom does not directly generate oh instead it first generates 3cdom under light irradiation and then generates oh h2o2 1o2 and o2 through a series of reactions sharpless and blough 2014 the addition of tmp cuts off the subsequent reaction process thereby inhibiting the photolytic release of dissolved phosphate 3 4 environmental implications pom generally exists in various natural aquatic ecosystems and its source and composition are extremely complex it can be divided into exogenous and endogenous types exogenous pom mainly includes terrestrial plant debris and om discharged by human activities and carried by rivers its flux into lakes exhibits great variability endogenous pom is mainly produced by the residues of phytoplankton large aquatic plants animals and their metabolites in previous studies pom and dom were mainly distinguished according to their particle size azam and malfatti 2007 roulet and moore 2006 however this classification does not fully reflect the chemical characteristics biological characteristics and ecological functions in fact part of the pom in aquatic ecosystems is relatively stable and difficult to decompose it hardly participates in the ecological process in contrast the other part is very active and has an abnormally rapid turnover rate this rapid transformation and degradation have an important impact on the distribution pattern of nutrients and the recycling process however understanding of the structural composition degradation rate and transformation mechanism of pom in aquatic ecosystems is limited resulting in a lack of important links and basis for objectively describing the eutrophication process and in turn controlling water bloom in eutrophic shallow lakes excessive phytoplankton growth results in a large amount of suspended pom with the growth of phytoplankton dissolved inorganic nutrients are gradually consumed and the mineralization and decomposition of pom become an important nutrient compensation source we found that pom exposed to light irradiation could be photodegraded and dip could be subsequently released ft icr ms revealed that the average molecular weight of p containing formulas in pom significantly decreased after light irradiation p species in pom with lower oxidation degrees and or unsaturation were preferentially photodegraded resulting in the generation of species with higher oxidation degrees and more saturation such as protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds 3cdom was chiefly responsible for the photodegradation of pom with the intensification of lake eutrophication the easily degradable components of pom and the yield of 3cdom photo induced by dom increase the interaction between pom and 3cdom can lead to the rapid degradation of p species and their transformation into dip thereby exacerbating the p transformation rate in a water body this indicates the importance of focusing on the continuous supply of endogenous p to study eutrophication and control blooms occurring in shallow lakes 4 conclusions this study investigated the mechanism underlying dip release during pom photodegradation using eem and ft icr ms pom in suspension was photodegraded and released dip under light irradiation and op in pom participated in the photochemical reactions the photodegradable p containing formulas were mainly characterized by a lower oxidation degree and unsaturation meanwhile some new p containing formula compounds particularly protein and carbohydrate like p containing formulas that had a high oxygen content and were saturated were photogenerated 3cdom was the main ros that played an important role in the photodegradation of pom these results provide new insights into the biogeochemical cycle of pom and p in aquatic ecosystems and may further deepen our

to ecological health and drinking water safety hou et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b phosphorus p is the key element involved in eutrophication and algal blooms conley et al 2009 schindler et al 2016 after the efficient control of exogenous p input the rapid transformation of endogenous p has become an important source of p compensation xu et al 2018 the transport and transformation of particulate organic matter pom a carrier of endogenous p can greatly impact the amount of bioavailable p in water joshi et al 2015 li et al 2017a accelerated eutrophication of water bodies accumulates a large amount of pom and the decomposition of pom through mineralization or abiotic processes can release a large amount of dissolved nutrients compensating for the p demand during phytoplankton growth traditionally research has been focused on the biomineralization process of pom in which microorganisms play an important role zhang et al 2022a recent studies have revealed that photochemical transformation is also important for the fate of pom harfmann et al 2021 helms et al 2014 lee et al 2021 liu and shank 2015 the photochemical transformation of pom caused by solar radiation can change its chemical composition and molecular size and ultimately affect the biogeochemical processes of carbon c nitrogen n and p hu et al 2022 lee et al 2023 mayer et al 2006 previous studies have also confirmed that pom can be photodegraded and release dissolved nutrients and that this process can be affected by irradiation conditions pom properties reactive oxygen species ros and other factors hu et al 2021 shank 2011 our previous research revealed that suspended particles in shallow lakes can release dissolved inorganic phosphate dip under sunlight exposure guo et al 2020 li et al 2019 its release mechanism involves photolysis enzymatic hydrolysis of organic phosphorus op and catalytic hydrolysis by minerals baldwin et al 1995 klein et al 2019 wan et al 2019 however the extractants used in chemical sequential extraction lack specificity zhu et al 2013 moreover the peak spectrum in 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr is easy to overlap worsfold et al 2008 resulting in insufficient understanding of the mechanism of dip release during pom photodegradation fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is a robust tool for analyzing complex organic matter om at the molecular level despite its complexity and heterogeneity this ultra high resolution technique is powerful to determine the molecular composition of complex environmental samples bahureksa et al 2021 and has been widely used for the molecular characterization of om in various types of environmental samples kellerman et al 2015 mcdonough et al 2022 singer et al 2012 wagner et al 2015 because op molecules in the environment are composed of ester co p and carbon phosphorus c p ni et al 2022 a few scholars have successfully used ft icr ms to analyze the source composition and transformation of op in the environment brooker et al 2018 gao et al 2021 ni et al 2021 the use of this technology greatly helps understand the p biogeochemical cycle at the molecular level this study aimed to investigate dip release resulting from pom photodegradation in water focusing on molecular changes occurring during this process pom photodegradation and dip release were assessed through a simulated light experiment the molecular weight distribution species and structure of p containing formulas in pom during photodegradation were analyzed using ft icr ms in addition ros involved in pom photodegradation were investigated using a reactive oxygen molecular probe to obtain key results on the molecular mechanisms underlying dip release during the photochemical transformation of pom 2 materials and methods 2 1 photodegradation experiments a suspension of lake water and sediments was used to simulate the photodegradation of pom in shallow lakes lake water and sediment samples were

then allowed to settle for 20 min and the top 20 cm was collected for conducting photodegradation experiments in a rotating photoreactor phchem iii newport corporation beijing china a schematic of the experimental setups has been provided in our previous study guo et al 2020 a high pressure mercury lamp 300 w was used to provide light and a uv light photometer uv254 newport corporation beijing china was used to measure the irradiance on the surface of the quartz tubes the irradiation intensity was measured to be approximately 3 5 mw cm2 which was close to that on the lake water surface on a midsummer day the internal temperature of the reactor was maintained at 35 2 c by connecting it with a quartz cold trap and a ventilation device before light irradiation the magnetic stirrer was turned on overnight to ensure that the particles in suspension in the photochemical reaction tubes were in a completely suspended state and weakly adsorbed p was completely released samples were collected at scheduled time intervals to analyze the concentration of dip dark treatment was set as a control and performed under the same conditions but by wrapping in tinfoil to clarify the contribution of pom photodegradation to dip concentrations in water filtered lake water samples under light and dark treatments were used as controls 2 2 determination of p content the amount of dip released from pom photodegradation was determined using the molybdenum blue colorimetric method murphy and riley 1962 the dissolved total phosphorus dtp content was measured after digestion with 5 potassium persulfate the dissolved organic phosphorus dop content was calculated by subtracting dip from dtp to assess the changes in p components during pom photodegradation the p fractions before and after light irradiation were analyzed by chemical sequential extraction as proposed by rydin 2000 details of the method can be found in fig s1 using this method p was separated into six groups

information 3 results and discussion 3 1 photodegradation of pom and variation in p content the fluorescence spectroscopy of pom under light irradiation and dark treatment is shown in fig s2 the signal intensity and region volume sharply decreased after light irradiation while almost no change was noted after dark treatment fig s2 and table s2 indicating that the fluorophoric pom components were degraded under light irradiation the concentration of toc in the pom extract decreased from 198 78 mg l to 93 68 mg l after light irradiation and the degradation rate reached to 52 87 in addition the parafac model with two to seven components was assessed based on the residual analysis and split half analysis three components including the protein like component c1 microbial humic like component c2 and terrestrial humic like component c3 were determined as the best fit fig 1 the maximum fluorescence intensity f max values of these three components significantly decreased after light irradiation the microbial humic like component c2 showed the highest decrease 55 3 followed by the terrestrial humic like component c3 50 5 and protein like component c1 42 6 indicating the photodegradation property of pom this property can affect the composition and fate of pom thereby affecting the concentration of bioavailable nutrients in aquatic environments and the eutrophication process fig 2 shows the release of dip during the photodegradation of pom in suspension the concentration of dip in the suspension increased under both light and dark treatments in the dark treatment group dip increased by 0 06 mg l mainly because of the microbial mineralization of pom in contrast dip increased by 0 35 mg l in the light treatment group this was approximately sixfold higher than that in the dark treatment group indicating that more pom was degraded during light treatment considering the amount of dip released in the filtered lake water after light treatment only 0 03 mg l fig 2a it could be confirmed that pom was a significant potential source of p in water kinetic analysis revealed that dip release during pom photodegradation fit the pseudo second order reaction table s3 and fig s3 indicating that intermediates were produced the analysis of dop concentration during the reaction process also revealed that as the irradiation time increased the dop concentration initially increased and then gradually decreased fig s4 indicating that dop may play a more intermediate role during the photodegradation of pom to further clarify the effect of microorganisms on phosphate release during pom degradation flow cytometry was performed to determine the number of microorganisms living and dead bacteria in the resuspended samples fig s5 and table s4 the number of microorganisms during light treatment was lower than that during dark treatment after 10 h indicating that the increase in dip concentration during light treatment was due to the photochemical degradation of pom to determine the p components involved in the photodegradation of pom chemical sequential extraction was performed to analyze the p components in pom the contents of bd p and naoh rp important components of the p pool in pom did not change significantly before and after light irradiation while that of naoh rp only increased slightly fig 2b these findings suggest that bd p and naoh rp are not the sources of dip release in solution the naoh nrp component organic bound p of pom significantly decreased after light irradiation fig 2b again indicating that op in pom degraded during light irradiation surprisingly the res p content also decreased significantly after light irradiation res p consists of refractory op and inert inorganic p rydin 2000 although inert op in res p is difficult to be biodegraded benitez nelson 2000 it can still undergo photochemical decomposition 3 2 variations in molecular characteristics of op the molecular weight distributions of pom and p containing formulas in pom before and after light irradiation are presented in fig 3 the median molecular mass of pom and p containing formulas decreased from 365 381 da to 339 335 da indicating that light irradiation resulted in the conversion of pom and p containing formulas into small molecules the average molecular weight of p containing formulas was 374 2 da table s5 which is close to that reported by ni et al 2021 however the number of p containing formulas detected in our sample 101 was lower than that reported by ni et al 75 670 ni et al 2021 this may be related to the sample composition pretreatment process and data analysis the changes in p containing formulas in pom before and after light irradiation are shown in fig 4 before light irradiation most p containing formulas were lipid lignin and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds with a relative abundance ra of 46 5 18 8 and 13 9 respectively this was followed by unsaturated hydrocarbon like 5 0 and protein like 2 0 p containing formula compounds no p containing formulas were detected in the tannin and condensed aromatic structure like formula compounds after light irradiation lipid unsaturated hydrocarbon and lignin like p containing formula compounds were almost removed their ra decreased by 94 6 94 4 and 48 3 respectively fig s6 some protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds with high o c were newly generated fig 4b the h cwa of p containing formulas increased from 1 78 to 2 01 and their o cwa increased from 0 20 to 0 75 after light irradiation table s5 indicating that p containing formulas exhibited higher saturation and stronger oxidation after light irradiation in summary our results indicate that photochemical degradation tended to remove p containing formula compounds in pom with a low oxygen content such as lipid and lignin like p containing formula compounds and produce p containing formula compounds with a high oxygen content such as protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds to illustrate the compositional changes occurring within each subcategory of molecules photodegradable peak lost photogenerated new peak and photoresistant peak retained p containing formulas after light irradiation are plotted in fig 5 photodegradable p containing formulas were mainly concentrated in the low o c region o c 0 3 and high h c region h c 1 0 in contrast photogenerated p containing formulas were mainly concentrated in the regions of o c 0 3 and h c 1 0 the quantitative distributions of photodegradable photogenerated and photoresistant p containing formulas are presented in fig s7 these results suggest that i less oxidized i e lower o c and more aliphatic i e higher h c compounds were preferentially degraded to generate oxygen rich molecules explaining the significant increase in o c values and ii the degradation of different o c and h c fractions in p varied greatly therefore the degradation potential of p containing formula compounds can be predicted by determining the o c and h c ratios of different p sources the transformation of p molecules can be inferred from the two dimensional display of kendrick mass defect kmd versus nominal mass in ft icr ms hughey et al 2001 molecules with the same kmd value correspond to compounds belonging to the same class and type but with different numbers of functional groups ch2 groups in this study alkyl chain length the difference between compounds with the same kmd value but different mass values can be explained by the change in the number of ch2 which represents the difference in the aliphatic properties of om riedel et al 2012 in other words the longer the alkyl chain length i e the more the number of ch2 groups the stronger is the aliphatic property of om an increase or decrease in the number of alkyl chain substituents of their homologous formula will correspondingly increase or decrease the molecular weight before light irradiation p containing formulas were evenly distributed in the range of 250 480 da fig 6 after light irradiation p containing formulas with different alkyl chain lengths were removed to varying degrees in the homologous series p containing formulas with higher mass values greater than 400 da were preferentially removed which corresponded to the decrease in their molecular weights table s5 when the kmd values were 0 25 p containing formulas were almost removed indicating lower removal selectivity by light irradiation this implies that p containing formulas with high molecular weights stronger aliphatic property and low kmd values are preferentially removed by light irradiation in addition the intensity of p containing formulas decreased to varying degrees after light irradiation also indicating the photodegradation of p containing formulas double bond equivalent dbe is an important parameter to clarify the unsaturation and aromaticity of organic compounds gao et al 2021 the distribution of dbe and carbon numbers cns can be used to analyze and compare the characteristics of oxygen containing molecules in om bae et al 2011 the relationship between the dbe and cns of p containing formulas is plotted in fig s8 before light irradiation p containing formulas had a wide dbe range of 0 9 this range is lower than that of p containing formula compounds 0 14 reported by gao et al in various treatment units of a wastewater treatment plant gao et al 2021 this indicates that the p containing formulas in our study had low unsaturation and low aromaticity which also corresponded to the lower aiwa after light irradiation formulas with dbe 5 were largely removed and the dbe value sharply decreased indicating an increase in double bonds unsaturated hydrocarbons or the opening of the benzene ring lignin carboxyl rich acyclic molecules liu et al 2014 because formulas with dbe 4 may contain one or more benzene rings moreover dbewa decreased from 2 35 to 0 63 after light irradiation indicating that the generated p containing formulas became more saturated and nonaromatic e g protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds this also explains the sharp decrease in aiwa and dbewa table s5 this result also corresponded to that of the p containing formulas presented in fig 5 p containing formulas had a cn range of 6 27 before light irradiation after light irradiation formulas with cns 15 were largely removed and the average cns decreased suggesting a decrease in the average molecular weight of p containing formulas table s5 and indicating the breakage of co p and or c p bonds by light irradiation the p containing formulas removed after light irradiation were characterized by a low oxygen content fig 5 while the generated p containing formulas were rich in oxygen and highly saturated the removed p containing formulas mainly included lipid like p containing formula compounds with a low oxygen content and some saturation unsaturated hydrocarbon like p containing formula compounds with low unsaturation and lignin like p containing formula compounds with a low oxygen content fig 4 as lipids are usually related to algae derived om with high bioavailability liu et al 2020 they can be easily removed after light irradiation previous studies considered lignin like om to be resistant hertkorn et al 2006 mesfioui et al 2012 opsahl and benner 1997 yuan et al 2017 however we found that part of the lignin like p containing formula compounds were degraded after light irradiation cf blue spheres in zone 5 fig 5 implying that lignin like p containing formula compounds were not completely inert and their reactivity could be related to their molecular structure in contrast lignin like p containing formula compounds with high o c pink spheres in fig 5 were produced after light irradiation these results suggest that lignin like p containing formula compounds with a low oxygen content are more photosensitive than those with a high oxygen content the relationship between the light sensitivity of lignin like p containing formula compounds and their molecular structures should be further investigated in future studies the generated p containing formulas were mainly protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds i e biolabile compounds and semibiolabile compounds freshly generated in surface waters chen et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 in brief p containing formulas generated after light irradiation have a high oxygen content high saturation and low aromaticity 3 3 role of ros ros play an important role in the element cycle of aquatic systems cory et al 2010 particularly 3cdom oh h2o2 1o2 and o2 are associated with the transformation of om in water under light irradiation li et al 2015 mcneill and canonica 2016 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 page et al 2011 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 to assess the effects of ros on pom photodegradation a series of ros capture experiments were performed as shown in fig 7 the release of dip decreased to varying degrees after adding various free radical scavengers after adding tmp a 3cdom scavenger the release of dip decreased by 59 2 after adding ipa an oh scavenger and cat an h2o2 scavenger the release of dip decreased by 38 8 and 32 6 respectively the order of contribution of each ros was as follows 3cdom oh h2o2 1o2 o2 fig s9 presents the time evolution of h2o2 o2 pba ffa a probe of 1o2 and tmp a probe of 3cdom during dark treatment there was no obvious transformation of probe molecules which was observed in ultrapure water especially for ffa and tmp the steady state concentrations and formation rates of 1o2 and 3cdom are summarized in table s6 the steady state concentrations and formation rates were 1 51 10 13 m and 0 76 10 7 m s respectively for 3cdom and 0 43 10 12 m and 0 11 10 6 m s respectively for 1o2 in suspension being much lower than those in filtered lake water this indicates that the presence of particles hinders the production of 1o2 and 3cdom or that the generated 1o2 and 3cdom are rapidly absorbed by particles however opposite results were observed for oh the accumulated oh content gradually increased with an increase in illumination time and those in suspension were higher than those in filtered lake water thus oh plays an important role in the photorelease of dip previous studies have revealed that both dop and particulate organic phosphorus pop can be photolyzed to release dip li et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 the release of dip from dop is caused by the cleavage of p o bonds by oh zhao et al 2018 during the photodegradation of pom we found that the release of dip was accompanied by an increase in dop concentration fig s4 hence it can be inferred that pop in pom is first converted to dop and dop is then oxidized to produce dip in general oh is the main ros affecting the photochemical transformation of om in water goldstone et al 2002 we previously found that the photolytic release of p in water significantly decreased after adding an oh scavenger li et al 2017b however this phenomenon is different in lakes with different trophic states in mesotrophic lakes no3 is the main contributor of oh in water with the proliferation of lake eutrophication dissolved organic matter dom gradually becomes the main contributor of oh in water bodies guo et al 2020 lake nanhu selected in this experiment is severely affected by eutrophication and dom is the main contributor to oh generation in this lake notably the photochemical reaction of dom does not directly generate oh instead it first generates 3cdom under light irradiation and then generates oh h2o2 1o2 and o2 through a series of reactions sharpless and blough 2014 the addition of tmp cuts off the subsequent reaction process thereby inhibiting the photolytic release of dissolved phosphate 3 4 environmental implications pom generally exists in various natural aquatic ecosystems and its source and composition are extremely complex it can be divided into exogenous and endogenous types exogenous pom mainly includes terrestrial plant debris and om discharged by human activities and carried by rivers its flux into lakes exhibits great variability endogenous pom is mainly produced by the residues of phytoplankton large aquatic plants animals and their metabolites in previous studies pom and dom were mainly distinguished according to their particle size azam and malfatti 2007 roulet and moore 2006 however this classification does not fully reflect the chemical characteristics biological characteristics and ecological functions in fact part of the pom in aquatic ecosystems is relatively stable and difficult to decompose it hardly participates in the ecological process in contrast the other part is very active and has an abnormally rapid turnover rate this rapid transformation and degradation have an important impact on the distribution pattern of nutrients and the recycling process however understanding of the structural composition degradation rate and transformation mechanism of pom in aquatic ecosystems is limited resulting in a lack of important links and basis for objectively describing the eutrophication process and in turn controlling water bloom in eutrophic shallow lakes excessive phytoplankton growth results in a large amount of suspended pom with the growth of phytoplankton dissolved inorganic nutrients are gradually consumed and the mineralization and decomposition of pom become an important nutrient compensation source we found that pom exposed to light irradiation could be photodegraded and dip could be subsequently released ft icr ms revealed that the average molecular weight of p containing formulas in pom significantly decreased after light irradiation p species in pom with lower oxidation degrees and or unsaturation were preferentially photodegraded resulting in the generation of species with higher oxidation degrees and more saturation such as protein and carbohydrate like p containing formula compounds 3cdom was chiefly responsible for the photodegradation of pom with the intensification of lake eutrophication the easily degradable components of pom and the yield of 3cdom photo induced by dom increase the interaction between pom and 3cdom can lead to the rapid degradation of p species and their transformation into dip thereby exacerbating the p transformation rate in a water body this indicates the importance of focusing on the continuous supply of endogenous p to study eutrophication and control blooms occurring in shallow lakes 4 conclusions this study investigated the mechanism underlying dip release during pom photodegradation using eem and ft icr ms pom in suspension was photodegraded and released dip under light irradiation and op in pom participated in the photochemical reactions the photodegradable p containing formulas were mainly characterized by a lower oxidation degree and unsaturation meanwhile some new p containing formula compounds particularly protein and carbohydrate like p containing formulas that had a high oxygen content and were saturated were photogenerated 3cdom was the main ros that played an important role in the photodegradation of pom these results provide new insights into the biogeochemical cycle of pom and p in aquatic ecosystems and may further deepen our

14849,as a class of synthetic persistent organic pollutants contamination of per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas in drinking water has attracted widespread concern aeration has been confirmed to enhance the removal of pfas in drinking water by activated carbon ac however the contribution of the air water interface in removing pfas is not yet to be fully understood at the molecular level in this work molecular dynamics md simulations were employed to investigate the role of nanobubble in removing pfas in the aqueous environment the result suggests that the free energies of the air water interface are about 3 7 kcal mol 1 lower than that of the bulk water region indicating that the transformation of pfas from the water phase into the air water interface is favorable from the viewpoint of thermodynamics the interface water partition coefficients p s u r w a t of pfas are in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs on the air water ac three phase interface pfbs can not only move along the interface region but also leave the interface region into water phase while pfos tended to move along the interface region until it was captured by ac finally the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e quantitative structure activity relationships qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration in aquatic systems the proposed mechanism promotes the understanding of the contribution of air water interface in removing pfas from drinking water by activated carbon graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas air water interface activated carbon molecular dynamics machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas refer to a class of synthetic persistent organic pollutants pops in which all or part of the hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms garg et al 2023 berhanu et al 2022 due to their unique structure pfas possess excellent surface activity chemical inertness and high temperature resistance li et al 2022 therefore pfas have been widely used in various industrial and civil products required for human life such as aqueous film forming foam medical equipment textiles food handling equipment and motor oil additives ye et al 2015 dasu et al 2022 more than 3000 pfas have been identified on the global market wang et al 2017 the widespread use of pfas has attracted much attention because of their omnipresent release into the environment chen et al 2023 aquatic ecosystem is an important fate of pfas in the environment zhou et al 2022 as the understanding of pfas continues various experimental results show that pfas are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic riaz et al 2023 the following studies indicated that the bioaccumulation of pfas could induce adverse effects on human or animal health such as cognitive developmental deficits viberg et al 2013 and neurobehavioral disorders lenters et al 2019 therefore removing pfas pollutants in water environment needs to be paid the greatest concern several treatment technologies were employed to remove pfas from aqueous media such as bioremediation wu et al 2022 photocatalysis abada et al 2018 membrane separation process lee et al 2022 advanced oxidative processes gar alalm and boffito 2022 and adsorption karbassiyazdi et al 2023 however many of those methods consume high energy and require advanced apparatus among them the adsorption method has been confirmed to be an environmentally friendly method for removing pfas due to its high removal rate economic viability simplicity and low cost fang et al 2021 activated carbon ac is considered to be an efficient adsorbent and it has been widely used to remove pfas xiao et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 long chain pfas have a high removal rate while short chain pfsa are more difficult to adsorb and remove by carbon based materials because of their better hydrophilicity sun et al 2016 leung et al 2022 dissolved organic matter dom in water will also affect the removal of pfas anions and cations present in water can significantly impact the adsorption of pfas by competing for available adsorption sites and forming salt bridge structures gagliano et al 2020 du et al 2015 in addition dom can play a significant role in the adsorption of pfas by forming dom pfas complexes kothawala et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to improve the performance of ac to remove pfas research suggests that nanobubbles can facilitate the adsorption process of pfas meng et al 2014 when nanobubbles are introduced into a liquid phase environment the pfas present in the liquid will be concentrated at the gas liquid interface then pfas nanobubble complexes can be taken by activated carbon and pfas subsequently transferred into activated carbon generally continuous aeration is employed during the adsorption process once the activated carbon has been introduced the removal of pfos increased by 21 0 29 2 after aeration and decreased by 27 7 after degassing jiang et al 2021 besides the removal of pfos by the graphite decreases by 74 after vacuum degassing meng et al 2014 and the removal efficiencies of pfda by ac are increased by 75 115 with the assistance of aeration meng et al 2020 adding a co foaming agent can further enhance pfas to adsorb to the air water interface and enhance the efficiency of activated carbon to remove pfas buckley et al 2023 despite the role of the air water interface in enhancing the removal of pfas has been confirmed the molecular mechanism of the removal process is not yet to be fully understood and limits the more effective application of aeration adsorption in the removal of pfas machine learning is a computational data processing system that employs data and algorithms to simulate the learning process of machines and enhance the accuracy of the system soori et al 2023 as a type of machine learning model qsar quantitative structure activity relationship model has been specifically used to predict the activity or properties of molecules based on their chemical structure for example li et al developed the qsar models to describe the second order reaction rate constants of aromatic compounds with clo 30 in this work the qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiency of pfas by aeration molecular dynamics md simulations and quantum chemical qc calculations are two favorite tools in presenting detailed information on the contribution of nanobubbles for pfas adsorption removal process at the molecular level md simulations offers advantages for studying pfas adsorption and removal in water including atomistic resolution high throughput cost effectiveness predictive capabilities and the ability to provide mechanistic understanding of the adsorption process for example du et al investigated the effect of hydrophobic natural organic matter nom on ac adsorbing pfas by using md simulations du et al 2023 in this work the qc calculations and md simulations were employed to investigate the properties of pfas with different carbon atom numbers at the air water interface the free energy change with the transformation of pfas from aqueous phase to gas phase was first calculated then the stability of different pfas foam films was studied next the dynamic behavior of pfas on gas liquid solid three phases was investigated finally the removal efficiency of pfas by aeration was predicted by the machine learning method 2 methods 2 1 properties of pfas at air water interface considering the importance of the interfacial behavior of pfas at the air water interface during the removal process the properties of pfas at the air water interface were first investigated four pfas with different functional groups and perfluoroalkyl chain lengths were chosen in this section fig s1a a water box that is too small may cause the pfas in the center to be too close to the interface area which can lead to inaccurate results on the other hand selecting a water box that is too large can lead to unnecessary waste of computing resources based on previous research yuan et al 2022 the water box of 6 6 6 nm3 with 7015 h2o molecules was constructed a pfos or pfoa pfhxs pfbs was added into the center of the water box with a random orientation then the z axis of the water box was extended to 12 nm and the water slab was put into the middle of the new box fig s1b the extension of the z direction of the box primarily serves to create a vacuum layer that mimics the behavior of pfas in the gas liquid interface region of nanobubbles if the vacuum layer is too short periodicity can cause the upper and lower liquid levels of the system to be too close which can affect the accuracy of the results conversely if the vacuum layer is too large it will increase computational costs therefore a vacuum layer of 6 nm equal to the length of the water box in the z direction is selected to strike a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency this requires extending the box to 12 nm in the z direction the energy minimization was first carried out and then nvt md simulations were subsequently performed for 100 ns 2 2 free energy calculation to generate the free energy change of pfos or pfoa pfhxs pfbs moving from the bulk water onto the gas phase the weighted histogram analysis method wham kumar et al 1992 hub et al 2010 and umbrella sampling method were employed kästner 2011 a new simulation box was created to produce the umbrella windows fig s1c the pfas was pulled from its location 3 nm 3 nm 9 nm into the center of mass com of water slab 3 nm 3 nm 3 nm the pull simulations were performed with a pull rate of 0 01 nm ps 1 and a pull force constant of 1000 kj mol 1 nm 2 to ensure sufficient sampling 45 umbrella windows were selected to calculate the free energy change for these independent windows the actual data collection simulations were performed for 10 ns to get the free energy change profile 2 3 evaluation of nanobubbles stability in this section four surfactant monolayer systems were constructed to investigate the stability of pfas bubbles as in previous work jang and goddard 2006 the water box of 4 10 4 nm3 with 5000 h2o molecules was placed in the center of the 4 10 16 nm3 then to form nanobubbles interfaces 200 pfos or pfoa pfhxs pfbs molecules were placed on the opposite sides of water slab as shown in fig s2 finally to compensate for the negative charge 200 na ions were added in the box vis using the gmx genion tool the energy minimization was carried out and then nvt md simulations were subsequently performed for 50 ns besides the steered molecular dynamics smd were applied to the process of nanobubble film burst specifically the external forces were added along the interface normal z axis to investigate the destruction process of pfas liquid film the viscosity was calculated by periodic perturbation method ppm method hess 2001 2 4 contribution of nanobubbles for pfas adsorption on ac then the dynamic behavior of pfas on the air nanobubbles ac three phase interface was investigated three ac monomer models were selected to construct the ac layer fig s3a they were widely used in previous studies as the ac model sarkisov et al 2017 di biase and sarkisov 2013 the model of accooh was built to an undissociated state on the one hand most of the carboxylic acid functional group in activated carbon accooh molecules exist in their undissociated form maneerung et al 2016 on the other hand in previous literature on simulating activated carbon the model was constructed with accooh in an un ionized state under neutral conditions nakhli et al 2020 shevade et al 2000 however it was note that ph has a significant impact on the structure of activated carbon which consequently affects its efficacy in removing pollutants from water the ac layer was constructed by the following steps fig s3b 1 65 ac monomer models 65 acoh monomer models and 65 accooh monomer models were randomly put into a box of 7 nm 7 nm 7 nm 2 a 1 ns nvt annealing simulation was carried out to obtain the high mobility state ac layer 3 10 ns npt simulation was subsequently performed and the size of the final box was 6 72 6 72 3 15 nm3 4 finally the equilibrated ac layer was added in the center of a box of 6 72 nm 6 72 nm 10 nm and solvated with water 10 ns npt simulation was subsequently performed the nanobubble pfos or pfoa or pfhxs or pfbs complex was placed on the top of ac layer to build the gas liquid solid three phase system fig s4 the energy minimization was carried out and then npt md simulations were subsequently performed for 50 ns 2 5 simulation parameters in this work gromacs software abraham et al 2015 was used to perform all md simulations using general amber force field gaff with restrained electrostatic potential resp charges wang et al 2004 tip3p model was employed for water molecules jorgensen et al 1983 all directions applied periodic boundary conditions the ambient temperature was kept constant at 298 15 k by v rescale thermostat method bussi et al 2007 in all md simulations the ambient pressure was kept constant at 1 01 105 pa by parrinello rahman method parrinello and rahman 1981 in npt simulations lincs algorithm was used to constrain all bonds connecting hydrogen atoms hess et al 1997 the cutoff distance of 1 2 nm and the time step of 2 fs were applied in all simulations the particle mesh ewald pme method darden et al 1993 was employed to calculate long range electrostatics the vmd software was used to generate the visualizations of the trajectory humphrey et al 1996 2 6 descriptors and qsar analysis as a popular machine learning method the qsar model was widely employed to describe and predict the properties of pollutants li et al 2021 murray et al 1999 in this work 23 representative descriptors were selected to develop the qsar model for the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e of pfas there were 12 constitutional descriptors c f h o f c o c c f o na m and h a c c and 11 quantum chemical descriptors e homo e lumo δe gap μ mpi v s a v v s m a x v s m i n σ t o t 2 as shown in table s1 the multiwfn lu and chen 2012 and gaussian 16 software frisch et al 2016 were used to generate these molecular descriptors at the smd m06 2x 6 311 g d p level in this work the qsar model was developed by the following approach correlation analysis genetic function approximation gfa multiple linear regression mlr neural network analysis nna and model validation text s1 in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 migration process of pfas onto the nanobubble surface previous studies have shown that the enrichment of pfas on the nanobubble water interface was crucial during the removal process meng et al 2020 therefore the dynamics behavior of pfas in air water systems was investigated in this section the time dependent snapshots of the pfos in the water box were depicted in fig 1 a initially the pfos was added in the center of the water box fig s1b and the corresponding com distance between pfos and air phase was 3 nm then the pfos moved towards the surface of the water box and then adsorbed to the surface region during the adsorption process the sulfonic group of pfos first approached the interface region and acted as an anchor to grasp the surface water layer keeping it from leaving bulk water negatively charged sulfonic acid groups can form charged hydrogen bonds with water molecules and these bonds are generally strong this property enables the sulfonic acid groups of pfos to be effectively anchored to the air water interface emamian et al 2019 at the same time the carbon chains of pfos keep swinging away from the surface finally the sulfonic group of pfos was inserted into the water box and the carbon chains pointed into the air in the subsequent simulations time it has been noted in the experiment that pfas accumulate at the air water interface during aeration vo et al 2023 a phenomenon that aligns with our observations in the simulation to clearly understand the dynamics behavior of these pfas the z coordinate of pfas over a period of 100 ns was presented in fig 1b the region of the gas phase water phase and interface were also marked in fig 1b the interface region was defined based on the definition that the interface density of water molecules is 10 90 of its bulk value 10 90 rule fig s5 as shown in fig 1b these pfas pfos pfoa pfhxs and pfbs quickly reached the interface region from the bulk water region within initial 8 ns indicating that pfas will be enriched at the air water interface region when nanobubbles or foam enter the sewage this is also the basis for the subsequent removal of pfas through foam fractionation wang et al 2023 or activated carbon treatment liu et al 2022 from fig 1b the duration time of pfsas was dominated by interface region accounts for 95 of total simulation time therefore the interface properties of pfas were investigated in this part a characteristic angle α between the vector from s1 c8 atom to c1 and the interface normal z axis was defined to study the orientation of pfas on the interface region as shown in fig 2 a the distribution range of α was most tiny for pfos compared to other pfas molecules indicating pfos was most ordered at the interface correspondingly the widespread distribution range can be found in the pfob system suggesting that pfbs was more randomly distributed on the interface in addition the highest distribution range of α is predominantly within 60 65 for pfos 55 60 for pfoa 55 60 for pfhxs and 40 45 for pfbs the corresponding adsorption orientations for all four pfas were drawn in fig 2c overall with the increase of perfluoroalkyl chain lengths the characteristic angle α of pfas in the interface was also increased the increase in the characteristic angle can be understood and explained this can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the tail of pfas which increases in degree with chain length consequently as the perfluoroalkyl chain length increases the tail chains of pfas are pushed further away from the air water interface this in turn leads to an increase in the characteristic angle α previous studies have shown that the greater the characteristic angle of the surfactant at the air water interface the greater the stability of the formed foam or nanobubble zhang et al 2023 foam stability can significantly affect the effectiveness of foam fractionation buckley et al 2022 therefore the findings provide an important perspective into why aeration is more effective in enhancing long chain pfas removal meng et al 2020 schaefer et al 2022 a deeper understanding of the pfas transformation process bulk water interface gas phase can be given by analyzing free energy changes the umbrella sampling simulations were employed to obtain the corresponding free energy changes fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the free energies of all systems were almost invariant in the bulk water within the com distance less than 2 3 nm when one pfas molecule further moved from bulk water to the gas phase the gibbs free energy started to decrease and then reached a minimum point with the further increase of the com distance the free energy increased drastically to evaluate the propensity of pfas from bulk water to interface region the free energy difference of pfas from bulk water to interface region was described as δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e g i 1 g i 0 i a b c d g i 0 is the free energy in the water phase within the com distance less than 2 3 nm while g i 1 is the maximum point of free energy on the interface region from fig 3 the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e absolute values for all pfas molecules are in the order of pfos 6 70 kcal mol 1 pfoa 5 60 kcal mol 1 pfhxs 5 10 kcal mol 1 pfbs 3 32 kcal mol 1 indicating that pfos was the easiest to reach the bubble surface from the bulk water compare other pfas to further evaluate the interface propensity of pfas the interface water partition coefficient p s u r w a t was calculated by the following equation 1 log p s u r w a t δ g interface δ g w a t e r 2 303 r t the calculated log p s u r w a t of pfos pfoa pfhxs and pfbs were 4 91 4 10 3 74 and 3 43 respectively a larger partition coefficient means that more pfas molecules will be enriched from the bulk water to the nanobubble interface region this also explains why aeration is more effective in enhancing long chain pfas removal on the one hand long chain pfas were more enriched to the nanobubble surface on the other hand the surface tension of the nanobubble was decreased with the increase of surfactants on the surface yang and sun 2014 and the reduction of surface tension will make the existence of nanobubbles more stable peng et al 2021 based on the above analysis more long chain pfas were enriched by nanobubbles to form a more stable nanobubble pfas complex due to the higher surface activity the stability of pfas nanobubble was further evaluated in the next section 3 2 evaluation of pfas nanobubble stability as mentioned above nanobubble foam stability is critical during aeration and foam fractionation however previous studies more focused on the distribution of pfas on nanobubble surfaces jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2022 therefore the stability of pfas nanobubble formed by pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs under the same surface concentration was investigated in this section to supplement former research as shown in fig s6a after 50 ns md simulations all the pfos pfhxs molecules stayed at the interface region while some pfbs molecules broke away from the interface region and enter the bulk water which is consistent with the results of log p s u r w a t and experimental observations liu et al 2022 mass density profiles were calculated to study the distribution of water and the selected part tail and head part of pfas in fig s6b based on the 10 90 rule the tail of pfas was local at the interface region while the hydrophobic tails are towards the vacuum in addition some liquid film properties such as viscosity and interfacial layer thickness of pfas foam film were calculated to study their stability zhang et al 2020 table 1 both the values of viscosity and interfacial layer thickness for all pfas molecules are in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs indicating that the stability of pfos liquid film was the highest while the stability of pfbs liquid film was the lowest the conclusion is consistent with the results of the above single molecule calculations to further the stability of pfas liquid film smd simulations were employed the pull speed of 0 1 nm ns and spring coefficient of 1000 kj mol 1 nm 1 were applied in smd simulations specifically the external forces were added along the interface normal z axis to investigate the destruction process of pfas liquid film fig 4 the external forces were calculated by the following equation kalyaanamoorthy and chen 2014 2 f t k v t r t r 0 n where v represents the pulling velocity r t is the position at time t r 0 represents the initial position n represents the pulling direction normal and k represents the constant of the force given that the rate of stretching 0 1 nm ns is constant the force required to deform the membrane can serve as a reliable indicator of membrane stability therefore a higher force requirement indicates greater stability of the liquid film as shown in fig 4 the external forces required to bend the liquid film are in order pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs indicating that the drainage process is more difficult to happen in the pfos system therefore the stability of pfos liquid film was the highest while the stability of pfbs liquid film was the lowest the stabilization of gas bubbles is critical for the removal of pfas on ac when the bubbles are unstable they can easily collapse and disappear in aqueous solution re releasing pafs into the aqueous environment the stable nanobubble pfas complex was more easily captured by adsorbate in solution like chitosan liu et al 2022 and activated carbon meng et al 2020 3 3 dynamic behavior of pfas on air nanobubbles ac three phase interface considering the contribution of the air water interface in removing pfas by ac treatment brusseau et al 2019 the dynamic behavior of pfas on the air nanobubbles ac three phase interface was investigated in this section the complete snapshots for the adsorption of pfas on ac in the presence of nanobubble were presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 nanobubble can exist stably on the surface of ac which can be attributed to the unique oleophobic property of nonpolar carbon based materials ac it is worth noting that the pfas at the initial air water interface were enriched to the ac surface the results indicate that pfas can be captured by nanobubbles and subsequently be absorbed by ac in aqueous environment meng et al 2020 liu et al 2022 in addition the adsorption tendency of pfas on the ac surface can be affected by the perfluoroalkyl chain lengths of pfas from fig 5 to further quantify the effect of perfluoroalkyl chain lengths on adsorption the number of contacts and contacting surface area between the pfas and ac surface were calculated and averaged over the last 20 ns of simulations fig s7 if the minimum atomic distance was lower than 6 å a contact was counted the surface contact s c o n t a c t was calculated by the following equation zhang et al 2022 3 s c o n t a c t s a c s p f a s s a c p f a s 2 where s a c s p f a s and s a c p f a s are the connolly surface area of ac pfac molecules and the entire adsorption configuration respectively from fig s7 the number of contacts and contacting surface area in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs indicating that the adsorption amount of pfas on ac increased with the increase of perfluoroalkyl chain lengths the observations are also consistent with the results of above experimental results meng et al 2020 why long chain pfas at the air water ac interface was more captured by ac combining fig 3 we assumed this observation should be traced back the dynamic behavior of pfas on nanobubbles fig 6 a b there are two movement modes of particles on the nanobubbles surface including moving along the interface region and leaving the interface region into the water phase whether moving along the interface or entering the solution pfas may eventually become captured by activated carbon and subsequently adsorbed onto its surface from fig 3 the transformation of pfas from the interface into the water phase was needed to overcome a free energy barrier due to the higher free energy barrier 6 7 kcal mol 1 it was difficult for pfos to escape from the interface region and enter the bulk water also see fig s6a and the pfos tended to move along the interface region until it was captured by ac fig 6a however small free energy barriers of pfbs 3 32 k kcal mol 1 was more easily overcome by the thermal motion indicating that pfbs can not only move along the interface region but also leave the interface region into water phase also see fig s6a therefore pfbs was less captured by ac fig 6b to verify the assumption the diffusion constants of pfas with time evolution were calculated by the following equation 4 d 1 2 d n α l i m t d d t i 1 n r i t r i 0 2 where n represents the number of molecules r i t and r i 0 represents the position of the i atom at time t and time 0 respectively and d is the system dimension to verify this method the diffusion constant of pure water was calculated and compared a water box of 6 6 6 nm3 with 7029 h2o molecules was constructed the energy minimization was first carried out and then npt md simulations were subsequently performed for 50 ns the calculated value 5 69 9 m2 s 1 was consistent with the results in previous studies 5 85 10 9 m2 s 1 mark and nilsson 2001 indicating that the method was reliable to calculate the diffusion coefficient of the pfas from fig 6c the diffusion constants of pfas in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs which was also confirmed our assumption further the diffusion constants of pfas along the z axis in liquid film md simulation in section3 2 were also calculated fig s8 the diffusion constants of pfas along the z axis take the same order which is consistent with the assumption in addition the transformation of pfbs from the interface region into the water phase was directly observed fig 6d next the interaction energies between pfas and ac were calculated to further understand the adsorption of pfas on ac fig 7 a b comparing fig 7a and b the interaction between pfas and ac was dominated by coul interaction which can be attributed to the negatively charged polar heads of pfas in addition the contributions of three ac monomers on the coul interaction were different fig s9 among them the contributions on the coul interaction were dominated by acoh monomer it even contributed about 50 although the contributions of ac monomer about 29 were not as important as acoh its effect cannot be ignored the electrostatic potential esp distribution was a useful tool to explain the coul interaction between complexes yuan et al 2023 therefore the esp distribution of three ac monomers was calculated and drawn in fig 7c and fig s10 by using multiwfn software lu and chen 2012 zhang and lu 2021 pfas anions are negatively charged and can have strong electrostatic interactions with the positive esp part of ac monomers as shown in fig 7c the higher coul interaction between acoh monomers and pfas molecules can be attributed to the local maxima esp position 65 10 kcal mol 1 on the acoh monomer surface although there was also a local maxima esp position 62 10 kcal mol 1 on the accooh monomer surface a negative extremum esp point 42 80 kcal mol 1 nearby prevented their further interaction the contributions of three ac monomers on the vdw interaction are in the order of ac acoh accooh fig s11 which can be attributed to the wider negative vdw potential region of the ac monomer fig s12 however pfos can be readily captured by ac while removal of pfbs is more difficult therefore how to improve the removal efficiency of pfbs by ac adsorption with nanobubbles after reviewing the research findings and related literature the efficiency of pfbs removal with nanobubbles can be enhanced by focusing on the following two aspects on the one hand starting from nanobubbles is a feasible approach the quantity and stability of bubbles in water can be increased by introducing foam co generating agents vo et al 2023 this method reduces the surface tension of water enabling the formation of a greater number of bubbles that exhibit improved resistance against collapse on the other hand we can start with the characteristics of activated carbon from the analysis of interaction energy the interaction energy between pfas and acoh is greater therefore we can increase the removal efficiency of pfbs by modifying the activated carbon acoh previous studies have shown that amine functionalization of activated carbon can also enhance the removal of pfas du et al 2023 in addition common environmental factors e g temperature ph background water constituents can affect the mechanistic insights presented in this work among them ph has a significant impact on the structure of activated carbon and pfas which consequently affects its efficacy in removing pfas from water gagliano et al 2020 maneerung et al 2016 3 4 qsar models because of the increasing diversity of pfas discharged into water environments li et al 2023 predicting the role of aeration in enhancing the removal of pfas is necessary meng et al 2020 based on the above analysis the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e valued of pfas can well reflect the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration the higher absolute value of δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e the higher removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration to further extend this assumption the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e of 19 pfas fig s13 was calculated and compared with its experimental removal efficiencies enhanced by aeration meng et al 2020 umbrella sampling simulations were employed to obtain the corresponding free energy changes and the results are presented in fig 8 a md simulations set up please see section2 2 from fig 8a all curves show the same trends with the increase of com distance the free energy firstly decreased and then increased similarly the free energy difference of pfas from bulk water to interface region was described as δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e g b g a the calculated δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e for all pfas was presented in fig 8b c and fig s14 as shown in fig 8c the absolute value of δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e for some pfas are in the order of pfbs pfhpa pfhxs pfoa pfos pfda which is consistent with the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration meng et al 2020 results suggest that it is feasible to employ δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e to evaluate the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration however using umbrella sampling simulations to generate δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e is complex and time consuming therefore the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration in aquatic systems in this work all 19 samples were divided into a verification set and a training set about 1 3 the linear correlations between δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e values and every descriptor n 23 were investigated via correlation analysis table s3 due to the higher correlation with δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e r 0 9 10 descriptors including μ v s m a x a v v s f h a c c m na δe gap were selected to further develop the qsar model then three machine learning methods mlr gfa and nna were employed to generate the standardize δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e qsar model as shown in table 2 the relevancy factor of input variables on nna model was presented in fig s15 among the three models studied nna had the highest prediction accuracy while mlr had the lowest prediction accuracy both gfa and nna models exhibited statistical criteria for good models such as r and r2 should be greater than 0 9 and q 2 loo should be greater than 0 5 for internal validation for external validation the r 2 ext should be greater than 0 6 q 2 ext greater than 0 5 and low rmseext the sensitivity of the network was calculated and presented in table s4 in addition the plot of the umbrella sampling simulations calculated versus qsar predicted δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e values are presented in fig 9 from fig 9 it can be seen that the predicted data were distributed near the diagonal indicating that the gfa and nna had good prediction accuracy 4 conclusions in this work the properties of pfas with different carbon atom numbers at the air water interface were investigated by md simulations and qm calculations research suggests that pfas will be enriched at the air water interface region when nanobubbles or foam enter the sewage to form the pfas nanobubble complex which is also the basis for the subsequent removal of pfas by ac treatment the stability of pfas nanobubble is in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs besides air water ac three simulation models were constructed to investigate the dynamic behavior of pfas on nanobubble and ac interfaces the calculated mechanism showed that pfbs can not only move along the interface region but also leave the interface region into the water phase while pfos tended to move along the interface region until it was captured by ac further research showed the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e valued of pfas can well reflect the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration therefore the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration in aquatic systems via the gfa and nna methods new insights generated from this study can help understand the contribution of the air water interface in removing pfas from drinking water and we hope a meaningful reference for the next md simulations or experiment can be obtained based on our findings further study on the aeration used to enhance the removal of pfas should focus on more adsorption substrates like graphene oxide wang et al 2022 magnetic biochars hassan et al 2022 and carbon

14849,as a class of synthetic persistent organic pollutants contamination of per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas in drinking water has attracted widespread concern aeration has been confirmed to enhance the removal of pfas in drinking water by activated carbon ac however the contribution of the air water interface in removing pfas is not yet to be fully understood at the molecular level in this work molecular dynamics md simulations were employed to investigate the role of nanobubble in removing pfas in the aqueous environment the result suggests that the free energies of the air water interface are about 3 7 kcal mol 1 lower than that of the bulk water region indicating that the transformation of pfas from the water phase into the air water interface is favorable from the viewpoint of thermodynamics the interface water partition coefficients p s u r w a t of pfas are in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs on the air water ac three phase interface pfbs can not only move along the interface region but also leave the interface region into water phase while pfos tended to move along the interface region until it was captured by ac finally the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e quantitative structure activity relationships qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration in aquatic systems the proposed mechanism promotes the understanding of the contribution of air water interface in removing pfas from drinking water by activated carbon graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas air water interface activated carbon molecular dynamics machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas refer to a class of synthetic persistent organic pollutants pops in which all or part of the hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms garg et al 2023 berhanu et al 2022 due to their unique structure pfas possess excellent surface activity chemical inertness and high temperature resistance li et al 2022 therefore pfas have been widely used in various industrial and civil products required for human life such as aqueous film forming foam medical equipment textiles food handling equipment and motor oil additives ye et al 2015 dasu et al 2022 more than 3000 pfas have been identified on the global market wang et al 2017 the widespread use of pfas has attracted much attention because of their omnipresent release into the environment chen et al 2023 aquatic ecosystem is an important fate of pfas in the environment zhou et al 2022 as the understanding of pfas continues various experimental results show that pfas are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic riaz et al 2023 the following studies indicated that the bioaccumulation of pfas could induce adverse effects on human or animal health such as cognitive developmental deficits viberg et al 2013 and neurobehavioral disorders lenters et al 2019 therefore removing pfas pollutants in water environment needs to be paid the greatest concern several treatment technologies were employed to remove pfas from aqueous media such as bioremediation wu et al 2022 photocatalysis abada et al 2018 membrane separation process lee et al 2022 advanced oxidative processes gar alalm and boffito 2022 and adsorption karbassiyazdi et al 2023 however many of those methods consume high energy and require advanced apparatus among them the adsorption method has been confirmed to be an environmentally friendly method for removing pfas due to its high removal rate economic viability simplicity and low cost fang et al 2021 activated carbon ac is considered to be an efficient adsorbent and it has been widely used to remove pfas xiao et al 2017 mccleaf et al 2017 long chain pfas have a high removal rate while short chain pfsa are more difficult to adsorb and remove by carbon based materials because of their better hydrophilicity sun et al 2016 leung et al 2022 dissolved organic matter dom in water will also affect the removal of pfas anions and cations present in water can significantly impact the adsorption of pfas by competing for available adsorption sites and forming salt bridge structures gagliano et al 2020 du et al 2015 in addition dom can play a significant role in the adsorption of pfas by forming dom pfas complexes kothawala et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to improve the performance of ac to remove pfas research suggests that nanobubbles can facilitate the adsorption process of pfas meng et al 2014 when nanobubbles are introduced into a liquid phase environment the pfas present in the liquid will be concentrated at the gas liquid interface then pfas nanobubble complexes can be taken by activated carbon and pfas subsequently transferred into activated carbon generally continuous aeration is employed during the adsorption process once the activated carbon has been introduced the removal of pfos increased by 21 0 29 2 after aeration and decreased by 27 7 after degassing jiang et al 2021 besides the removal of pfos by the graphite decreases by 74 after vacuum degassing meng et al 2014 and the removal efficiencies of pfda by ac are increased by 75 115 with the assistance of aeration meng et al 2020 adding a co foaming agent can further enhance pfas to adsorb to the air water interface and enhance the efficiency of activated carbon to remove pfas buckley et al 2023 despite the role of the air water interface in enhancing the removal of pfas has been confirmed the molecular mechanism of the removal process is not yet to be fully understood and limits the more effective application of aeration adsorption in the removal of pfas machine learning is a computational data processing system that employs data and algorithms to simulate the learning process of machines and enhance the accuracy of the system soori et al 2023 as a type of machine learning model qsar quantitative structure activity relationship model has been specifically used to predict the activity or properties of molecules based on their chemical structure for example li et al developed the qsar models to describe the second order reaction rate constants of aromatic compounds with clo 30 in this work the qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiency of pfas by aeration molecular dynamics md simulations and quantum chemical qc calculations are two favorite tools in presenting detailed information on the contribution of nanobubbles for pfas adsorption removal process at the molecular level md simulations offers advantages for studying pfas adsorption and removal in water including atomistic resolution high throughput cost effectiveness predictive capabilities and the ability to provide mechanistic understanding of the adsorption process for example du et al investigated the effect of hydrophobic natural organic matter nom on ac adsorbing pfas by using md simulations du et al 2023 in this work the qc calculations and md simulations were employed to investigate the properties of pfas with different carbon atom numbers at the air water interface the free energy change with the transformation of pfas from aqueous phase to gas phase was first calculated then the stability of different pfas foam films was studied next the dynamic behavior of pfas on gas liquid solid three phases was investigated finally the removal efficiency of pfas by aeration was predicted by the machine learning method 2 methods 2 1 properties of pfas at air water interface considering the importance of the interfacial behavior of pfas at the air water interface during the removal process the properties of pfas at the air water interface were first investigated four pfas with different functional groups and perfluoroalkyl chain lengths were chosen in this section fig s1a a water box that is too small may cause the pfas in the center to be too close to the interface area which can lead to inaccurate results on the other hand selecting a water box that is too large can lead to unnecessary waste of computing resources based on previous research yuan et al 2022 the water box of 6 6 6 nm3 with 7015 h2o molecules was constructed a pfos or pfoa pfhxs pfbs was added into the center of the water box with a random orientation then the z axis of the water box was extended to 12 nm and the water slab was put into the middle of the new box fig s1b the extension of the z direction of the box primarily serves to create a vacuum layer that mimics the behavior of pfas in the gas liquid interface region of nanobubbles if the vacuum layer is too short periodicity can cause the upper and lower liquid levels of the system to be too close which can affect the accuracy of the results conversely if the vacuum layer is too large it will increase computational costs therefore a vacuum layer of 6 nm equal to the length of the water box in the z direction is selected to strike a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency this requires extending the box to 12 nm in the z direction the energy minimization was first carried out and then nvt md simulations were subsequently performed for 100 ns 2 2 free energy calculation to generate the free energy change of pfos or pfoa pfhxs pfbs moving from the bulk water onto the gas phase the weighted histogram analysis method wham kumar et al 1992 hub et al 2010 and umbrella sampling method were employed kästner 2011 a new simulation box was created to produce the umbrella windows fig s1c the pfas was pulled from its location 3 nm 3 nm 9 nm into the center of mass com of water slab 3 nm 3 nm 3 nm the pull simulations were performed with a pull rate of 0 01 nm ps 1 and a pull force constant of 1000 kj mol 1 nm 2 to ensure sufficient sampling 45 umbrella windows were selected to calculate the free energy change for these independent windows the actual data collection simulations were performed for 10 ns to get the free energy change profile 2 3 evaluation of nanobubbles stability in this section four surfactant monolayer systems were constructed to investigate the stability of pfas bubbles as in previous work jang and goddard 2006 the water box of 4 10 4 nm3 with 5000 h2o molecules was placed in the center of the 4 10 16 nm3 then to form nanobubbles interfaces 200 pfos or pfoa pfhxs pfbs molecules were placed on the opposite sides of water slab as shown in fig s2 finally to compensate for the negative charge 200 na ions were added in the box vis using the gmx genion tool the energy minimization was carried out and then nvt md simulations were subsequently performed for 50 ns besides the steered molecular dynamics smd were applied to the process of nanobubble film burst specifically the external forces were added along the interface normal z axis to investigate the destruction process of pfas liquid film the viscosity was calculated by periodic perturbation method ppm method hess 2001 2 4 contribution of nanobubbles for pfas adsorption on ac then the dynamic behavior of pfas on the air nanobubbles ac three phase interface was investigated three ac monomer models were selected to construct the ac layer fig s3a they were widely used in previous studies as the ac model sarkisov et al 2017 di biase and sarkisov 2013 the model of accooh was built to an undissociated state on the one hand most of the carboxylic acid functional group in activated carbon accooh molecules exist in their undissociated form maneerung et al 2016 on the other hand in previous literature on simulating activated carbon the model was constructed with accooh in an un ionized state under neutral conditions nakhli et al 2020 shevade et al 2000 however it was note that ph has a significant impact on the structure of activated carbon which consequently affects its efficacy in removing pollutants from water the ac layer was constructed by the following steps fig s3b 1 65 ac monomer models 65 acoh monomer models and 65 accooh monomer models were randomly put into a box of 7 nm 7 nm 7 nm 2 a 1 ns nvt annealing simulation was carried out to obtain the high mobility state ac layer 3 10 ns npt simulation was subsequently performed and the size of the final box was 6 72 6 72 3 15 nm3 4 finally the equilibrated ac layer was added in the center of a box of 6 72 nm 6 72 nm 10 nm and solvated with water 10 ns npt simulation was subsequently performed the nanobubble pfos or pfoa or pfhxs or pfbs complex was placed on the top of ac layer to build the gas liquid solid three phase system fig s4 the energy minimization was carried out and then npt md simulations were subsequently performed for 50 ns 2 5 simulation parameters in this work gromacs software abraham et al 2015 was used to perform all md simulations using general amber force field gaff with restrained electrostatic potential resp charges wang et al 2004 tip3p model was employed for water molecules jorgensen et al 1983 all directions applied periodic boundary conditions the ambient temperature was kept constant at 298 15 k by v rescale thermostat method bussi et al 2007 in all md simulations the ambient pressure was kept constant at 1 01 105 pa by parrinello rahman method parrinello and rahman 1981 in npt simulations lincs algorithm was used to constrain all bonds connecting hydrogen atoms hess et al 1997 the cutoff distance of 1 2 nm and the time step of 2 fs were applied in all simulations the particle mesh ewald pme method darden et al 1993 was employed to calculate long range electrostatics the vmd software was used to generate the visualizations of the trajectory humphrey et al 1996 2 6 descriptors and qsar analysis as a popular machine learning method the qsar model was widely employed to describe and predict the properties of pollutants li et al 2021 murray et al 1999 in this work 23 representative descriptors were selected to develop the qsar model for the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e of pfas there were 12 constitutional descriptors c f h o f c o c c f o na m and h a c c and 11 quantum chemical descriptors e homo e lumo δe gap μ mpi v s a v v s m a x v s m i n σ t o t 2 as shown in table s1 the multiwfn lu and chen 2012 and gaussian 16 software frisch et al 2016 were used to generate these molecular descriptors at the smd m06 2x 6 311 g d p level in this work the qsar model was developed by the following approach correlation analysis genetic function approximation gfa multiple linear regression mlr neural network analysis nna and model validation text s1 in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 migration process of pfas onto the nanobubble surface previous studies have shown that the enrichment of pfas on the nanobubble water interface was crucial during the removal process meng et al 2020 therefore the dynamics behavior of pfas in air water systems was investigated in this section the time dependent snapshots of the pfos in the water box were depicted in fig 1 a initially the pfos was added in the center of the water box fig s1b and the corresponding com distance between pfos and air phase was 3 nm then the pfos moved towards the surface of the water box and then adsorbed to the surface region during the adsorption process the sulfonic group of pfos first approached the interface region and acted as an anchor to grasp the surface water layer keeping it from leaving bulk water negatively charged sulfonic acid groups can form charged hydrogen bonds with water molecules and these bonds are generally strong this property enables the sulfonic acid groups of pfos to be effectively anchored to the air water interface emamian et al 2019 at the same time the carbon chains of pfos keep swinging away from the surface finally the sulfonic group of pfos was inserted into the water box and the carbon chains pointed into the air in the subsequent simulations time it has been noted in the experiment that pfas accumulate at the air water interface during aeration vo et al 2023 a phenomenon that aligns with our observations in the simulation to clearly understand the dynamics behavior of these pfas the z coordinate of pfas over a period of 100 ns was presented in fig 1b the region of the gas phase water phase and interface were also marked in fig 1b the interface region was defined based on the definition that the interface density of water molecules is 10 90 of its bulk value 10 90 rule fig s5 as shown in fig 1b these pfas pfos pfoa pfhxs and pfbs quickly reached the interface region from the bulk water region within initial 8 ns indicating that pfas will be enriched at the air water interface region when nanobubbles or foam enter the sewage this is also the basis for the subsequent removal of pfas through foam fractionation wang et al 2023 or activated carbon treatment liu et al 2022 from fig 1b the duration time of pfsas was dominated by interface region accounts for 95 of total simulation time therefore the interface properties of pfas were investigated in this part a characteristic angle α between the vector from s1 c8 atom to c1 and the interface normal z axis was defined to study the orientation of pfas on the interface region as shown in fig 2 a the distribution range of α was most tiny for pfos compared to other pfas molecules indicating pfos was most ordered at the interface correspondingly the widespread distribution range can be found in the pfob system suggesting that pfbs was more randomly distributed on the interface in addition the highest distribution range of α is predominantly within 60 65 for pfos 55 60 for pfoa 55 60 for pfhxs and 40 45 for pfbs the corresponding adsorption orientations for all four pfas were drawn in fig 2c overall with the increase of perfluoroalkyl chain lengths the characteristic angle α of pfas in the interface was also increased the increase in the characteristic angle can be understood and explained this can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the tail of pfas which increases in degree with chain length consequently as the perfluoroalkyl chain length increases the tail chains of pfas are pushed further away from the air water interface this in turn leads to an increase in the characteristic angle α previous studies have shown that the greater the characteristic angle of the surfactant at the air water interface the greater the stability of the formed foam or nanobubble zhang et al 2023 foam stability can significantly affect the effectiveness of foam fractionation buckley et al 2022 therefore the findings provide an important perspective into why aeration is more effective in enhancing long chain pfas removal meng et al 2020 schaefer et al 2022 a deeper understanding of the pfas transformation process bulk water interface gas phase can be given by analyzing free energy changes the umbrella sampling simulations were employed to obtain the corresponding free energy changes fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the free energies of all systems were almost invariant in the bulk water within the com distance less than 2 3 nm when one pfas molecule further moved from bulk water to the gas phase the gibbs free energy started to decrease and then reached a minimum point with the further increase of the com distance the free energy increased drastically to evaluate the propensity of pfas from bulk water to interface region the free energy difference of pfas from bulk water to interface region was described as δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e g i 1 g i 0 i a b c d g i 0 is the free energy in the water phase within the com distance less than 2 3 nm while g i 1 is the maximum point of free energy on the interface region from fig 3 the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e absolute values for all pfas molecules are in the order of pfos 6 70 kcal mol 1 pfoa 5 60 kcal mol 1 pfhxs 5 10 kcal mol 1 pfbs 3 32 kcal mol 1 indicating that pfos was the easiest to reach the bubble surface from the bulk water compare other pfas to further evaluate the interface propensity of pfas the interface water partition coefficient p s u r w a t was calculated by the following equation 1 log p s u r w a t δ g interface δ g w a t e r 2 303 r t the calculated log p s u r w a t of pfos pfoa pfhxs and pfbs were 4 91 4 10 3 74 and 3 43 respectively a larger partition coefficient means that more pfas molecules will be enriched from the bulk water to the nanobubble interface region this also explains why aeration is more effective in enhancing long chain pfas removal on the one hand long chain pfas were more enriched to the nanobubble surface on the other hand the surface tension of the nanobubble was decreased with the increase of surfactants on the surface yang and sun 2014 and the reduction of surface tension will make the existence of nanobubbles more stable peng et al 2021 based on the above analysis more long chain pfas were enriched by nanobubbles to form a more stable nanobubble pfas complex due to the higher surface activity the stability of pfas nanobubble was further evaluated in the next section 3 2 evaluation of pfas nanobubble stability as mentioned above nanobubble foam stability is critical during aeration and foam fractionation however previous studies more focused on the distribution of pfas on nanobubble surfaces jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2022 therefore the stability of pfas nanobubble formed by pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs under the same surface concentration was investigated in this section to supplement former research as shown in fig s6a after 50 ns md simulations all the pfos pfhxs molecules stayed at the interface region while some pfbs molecules broke away from the interface region and enter the bulk water which is consistent with the results of log p s u r w a t and experimental observations liu et al 2022 mass density profiles were calculated to study the distribution of water and the selected part tail and head part of pfas in fig s6b based on the 10 90 rule the tail of pfas was local at the interface region while the hydrophobic tails are towards the vacuum in addition some liquid film properties such as viscosity and interfacial layer thickness of pfas foam film were calculated to study their stability zhang et al 2020 table 1 both the values of viscosity and interfacial layer thickness for all pfas molecules are in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs indicating that the stability of pfos liquid film was the highest while the stability of pfbs liquid film was the lowest the conclusion is consistent with the results of the above single molecule calculations to further the stability of pfas liquid film smd simulations were employed the pull speed of 0 1 nm ns and spring coefficient of 1000 kj mol 1 nm 1 were applied in smd simulations specifically the external forces were added along the interface normal z axis to investigate the destruction process of pfas liquid film fig 4 the external forces were calculated by the following equation kalyaanamoorthy and chen 2014 2 f t k v t r t r 0 n where v represents the pulling velocity r t is the position at time t r 0 represents the initial position n represents the pulling direction normal and k represents the constant of the force given that the rate of stretching 0 1 nm ns is constant the force required to deform the membrane can serve as a reliable indicator of membrane stability therefore a higher force requirement indicates greater stability of the liquid film as shown in fig 4 the external forces required to bend the liquid film are in order pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs indicating that the drainage process is more difficult to happen in the pfos system therefore the stability of pfos liquid film was the highest while the stability of pfbs liquid film was the lowest the stabilization of gas bubbles is critical for the removal of pfas on ac when the bubbles are unstable they can easily collapse and disappear in aqueous solution re releasing pafs into the aqueous environment the stable nanobubble pfas complex was more easily captured by adsorbate in solution like chitosan liu et al 2022 and activated carbon meng et al 2020 3 3 dynamic behavior of pfas on air nanobubbles ac three phase interface considering the contribution of the air water interface in removing pfas by ac treatment brusseau et al 2019 the dynamic behavior of pfas on the air nanobubbles ac three phase interface was investigated in this section the complete snapshots for the adsorption of pfas on ac in the presence of nanobubble were presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 nanobubble can exist stably on the surface of ac which can be attributed to the unique oleophobic property of nonpolar carbon based materials ac it is worth noting that the pfas at the initial air water interface were enriched to the ac surface the results indicate that pfas can be captured by nanobubbles and subsequently be absorbed by ac in aqueous environment meng et al 2020 liu et al 2022 in addition the adsorption tendency of pfas on the ac surface can be affected by the perfluoroalkyl chain lengths of pfas from fig 5 to further quantify the effect of perfluoroalkyl chain lengths on adsorption the number of contacts and contacting surface area between the pfas and ac surface were calculated and averaged over the last 20 ns of simulations fig s7 if the minimum atomic distance was lower than 6 å a contact was counted the surface contact s c o n t a c t was calculated by the following equation zhang et al 2022 3 s c o n t a c t s a c s p f a s s a c p f a s 2 where s a c s p f a s and s a c p f a s are the connolly surface area of ac pfac molecules and the entire adsorption configuration respectively from fig s7 the number of contacts and contacting surface area in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs indicating that the adsorption amount of pfas on ac increased with the increase of perfluoroalkyl chain lengths the observations are also consistent with the results of above experimental results meng et al 2020 why long chain pfas at the air water ac interface was more captured by ac combining fig 3 we assumed this observation should be traced back the dynamic behavior of pfas on nanobubbles fig 6 a b there are two movement modes of particles on the nanobubbles surface including moving along the interface region and leaving the interface region into the water phase whether moving along the interface or entering the solution pfas may eventually become captured by activated carbon and subsequently adsorbed onto its surface from fig 3 the transformation of pfas from the interface into the water phase was needed to overcome a free energy barrier due to the higher free energy barrier 6 7 kcal mol 1 it was difficult for pfos to escape from the interface region and enter the bulk water also see fig s6a and the pfos tended to move along the interface region until it was captured by ac fig 6a however small free energy barriers of pfbs 3 32 k kcal mol 1 was more easily overcome by the thermal motion indicating that pfbs can not only move along the interface region but also leave the interface region into water phase also see fig s6a therefore pfbs was less captured by ac fig 6b to verify the assumption the diffusion constants of pfas with time evolution were calculated by the following equation 4 d 1 2 d n α l i m t d d t i 1 n r i t r i 0 2 where n represents the number of molecules r i t and r i 0 represents the position of the i atom at time t and time 0 respectively and d is the system dimension to verify this method the diffusion constant of pure water was calculated and compared a water box of 6 6 6 nm3 with 7029 h2o molecules was constructed the energy minimization was first carried out and then npt md simulations were subsequently performed for 50 ns the calculated value 5 69 9 m2 s 1 was consistent with the results in previous studies 5 85 10 9 m2 s 1 mark and nilsson 2001 indicating that the method was reliable to calculate the diffusion coefficient of the pfas from fig 6c the diffusion constants of pfas in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs which was also confirmed our assumption further the diffusion constants of pfas along the z axis in liquid film md simulation in section3 2 were also calculated fig s8 the diffusion constants of pfas along the z axis take the same order which is consistent with the assumption in addition the transformation of pfbs from the interface region into the water phase was directly observed fig 6d next the interaction energies between pfas and ac were calculated to further understand the adsorption of pfas on ac fig 7 a b comparing fig 7a and b the interaction between pfas and ac was dominated by coul interaction which can be attributed to the negatively charged polar heads of pfas in addition the contributions of three ac monomers on the coul interaction were different fig s9 among them the contributions on the coul interaction were dominated by acoh monomer it even contributed about 50 although the contributions of ac monomer about 29 were not as important as acoh its effect cannot be ignored the electrostatic potential esp distribution was a useful tool to explain the coul interaction between complexes yuan et al 2023 therefore the esp distribution of three ac monomers was calculated and drawn in fig 7c and fig s10 by using multiwfn software lu and chen 2012 zhang and lu 2021 pfas anions are negatively charged and can have strong electrostatic interactions with the positive esp part of ac monomers as shown in fig 7c the higher coul interaction between acoh monomers and pfas molecules can be attributed to the local maxima esp position 65 10 kcal mol 1 on the acoh monomer surface although there was also a local maxima esp position 62 10 kcal mol 1 on the accooh monomer surface a negative extremum esp point 42 80 kcal mol 1 nearby prevented their further interaction the contributions of three ac monomers on the vdw interaction are in the order of ac acoh accooh fig s11 which can be attributed to the wider negative vdw potential region of the ac monomer fig s12 however pfos can be readily captured by ac while removal of pfbs is more difficult therefore how to improve the removal efficiency of pfbs by ac adsorption with nanobubbles after reviewing the research findings and related literature the efficiency of pfbs removal with nanobubbles can be enhanced by focusing on the following two aspects on the one hand starting from nanobubbles is a feasible approach the quantity and stability of bubbles in water can be increased by introducing foam co generating agents vo et al 2023 this method reduces the surface tension of water enabling the formation of a greater number of bubbles that exhibit improved resistance against collapse on the other hand we can start with the characteristics of activated carbon from the analysis of interaction energy the interaction energy between pfas and acoh is greater therefore we can increase the removal efficiency of pfbs by modifying the activated carbon acoh previous studies have shown that amine functionalization of activated carbon can also enhance the removal of pfas du et al 2023 in addition common environmental factors e g temperature ph background water constituents can affect the mechanistic insights presented in this work among them ph has a significant impact on the structure of activated carbon and pfas which consequently affects its efficacy in removing pfas from water gagliano et al 2020 maneerung et al 2016 3 4 qsar models because of the increasing diversity of pfas discharged into water environments li et al 2023 predicting the role of aeration in enhancing the removal of pfas is necessary meng et al 2020 based on the above analysis the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e valued of pfas can well reflect the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration the higher absolute value of δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e the higher removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration to further extend this assumption the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e of 19 pfas fig s13 was calculated and compared with its experimental removal efficiencies enhanced by aeration meng et al 2020 umbrella sampling simulations were employed to obtain the corresponding free energy changes and the results are presented in fig 8 a md simulations set up please see section2 2 from fig 8a all curves show the same trends with the increase of com distance the free energy firstly decreased and then increased similarly the free energy difference of pfas from bulk water to interface region was described as δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e g b g a the calculated δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e for all pfas was presented in fig 8b c and fig s14 as shown in fig 8c the absolute value of δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e for some pfas are in the order of pfbs pfhpa pfhxs pfoa pfos pfda which is consistent with the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration meng et al 2020 results suggest that it is feasible to employ δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e to evaluate the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration however using umbrella sampling simulations to generate δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e is complex and time consuming therefore the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration in aquatic systems in this work all 19 samples were divided into a verification set and a training set about 1 3 the linear correlations between δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e values and every descriptor n 23 were investigated via correlation analysis table s3 due to the higher correlation with δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e r 0 9 10 descriptors including μ v s m a x a v v s f h a c c m na δe gap were selected to further develop the qsar model then three machine learning methods mlr gfa and nna were employed to generate the standardize δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e qsar model as shown in table 2 the relevancy factor of input variables on nna model was presented in fig s15 among the three models studied nna had the highest prediction accuracy while mlr had the lowest prediction accuracy both gfa and nna models exhibited statistical criteria for good models such as r and r2 should be greater than 0 9 and q 2 loo should be greater than 0 5 for internal validation for external validation the r 2 ext should be greater than 0 6 q 2 ext greater than 0 5 and low rmseext the sensitivity of the network was calculated and presented in table s4 in addition the plot of the umbrella sampling simulations calculated versus qsar predicted δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e values are presented in fig 9 from fig 9 it can be seen that the predicted data were distributed near the diagonal indicating that the gfa and nna had good prediction accuracy 4 conclusions in this work the properties of pfas with different carbon atom numbers at the air water interface were investigated by md simulations and qm calculations research suggests that pfas will be enriched at the air water interface region when nanobubbles or foam enter the sewage to form the pfas nanobubble complex which is also the basis for the subsequent removal of pfas by ac treatment the stability of pfas nanobubble is in the order of pfos pfoa pfhxs pfbs besides air water ac three simulation models were constructed to investigate the dynamic behavior of pfas on nanobubble and ac interfaces the calculated mechanism showed that pfbs can not only move along the interface region but also leave the interface region into the water phase while pfos tended to move along the interface region until it was captured by ac further research showed the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e valued of pfas can well reflect the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration therefore the δ g w a t e r i n t e r f a c e qsar models were developed to predict the removal efficiencies of pfas enhanced by aeration in aquatic systems via the gfa and nna methods new insights generated from this study can help understand the contribution of the air water interface in removing pfas from drinking water and we hope a meaningful reference for the next md simulations or experiment can be obtained based on our findings further study on the aeration used to enhance the removal of pfas should focus on more adsorption substrates like graphene oxide wang et al 2022 magnetic biochars hassan et al 2022 and carbon
