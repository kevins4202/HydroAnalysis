2425,aapa mires are boreal peatland complexes comprised of wet typically patterned fens in the center and sphagnum bog vegetation at the margins their distribution is controlled by climate and local catchment hydrology the daily discharge of twelve aapa mires across the boreal zone was explored for 1961 2099 with the cpisnow model using observational weather data and projections based on climate models cmip5 and emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mire hydrology was assessed for climate zonal differences seasonal patterns and longer term trends the results indicated past and future changes in hydrology particularly related to the duration and magnitude of snow cover and the timing of snowmelt increasing winter discharge and decreasing spring discharge were detected in recent past in the southern sites and these trends were indicated to continue in the future throughout the study area by the end of the 21st century the typical seasonality of discharge is indicated to weaken throughout the study area and to largely disappear in the south boreal catchments in the northernmost sites a mismatch between past trends and future projections of spring discharge was discovered indicating complexity and uncertainty of snow process modeling the hydrological changes indicated in this study together with direct impacts of increasing temperatures threaten aapa mires affecting biodiversity and greenhouse gas balance in changing climate special attention should be paid to winter conditions and snow essential for the hydrological cycle in the north but under explored in mire hydrology studies keywords catchment climate change hydrological modeling patterned fen peatland snow hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biogeographic zonation of different types of mires peat accumulating wetlands is well known from scandinavia finland and northwestern russia where raised bogs have a predominantly southern distribution and fens are more common in northern boreal and alpine zones with marked local exceptions masing et al 2010 moen 1999 ruuhijärvi 1960 rydin et al 1999 ongoing climate change may alter this zonation belyea 2007 luoto et al 2004 parviainen and luoto 2007 which would have implications for biodiversity and the global greenhouse gas balance since fens and bogs differ in their diversity rydin and jeglum 2013 sjörs 1948 vitt et al 1995 as well as carbon sequestration capacity and methane emissions bridgham et al 1995 turunen et al 2002 wu and roulet 2014 zhang et al 2021 aapa mires form an ecotone type of peatland complexes between south boreal raised bogs and arctic permafrost peatlands especially in the suboceanic parts of boreal europe and canada eurola and vorren 1980 gunnarsson and löfroth 2014 masing et al 2010 nwwg 1988 robitaille et al 2021 aapa mires are characterized by concave gross topography central fens with flarks sparsely vegetated wet fen hollows and margin zones with sphagnum moss cover laitinen et al 2007 ruuhijärvi 1960 tahvanainen 2016 the central fens are fed by rich near surface runoff which is typically reflected as an alternating pattern of flarks and sphagnum strings oriented perpendicularly to the direction of water flow carrer et al 2016 couwenberg 2005 foster and fritz 1987 mccarter and price 2017 the patterned fen vegetation of aapa mire centers is dependent on minerogenic water recharge which is controlled by climate and catchment properties laitinen et al 2007 seppä 2002 the importance of local catchment hydrology is manifested by numerous examples of extra zonal mire complexes fig 1 aapa mires can be found south from the biogeographic aapa mire zone in places where catchments provide abundant snowmelt and groundwater sallantaus 2006 seppä 2002 correspondingly raised bogs commonly occur north from the climatic raised bog zone in places with a limited catchment e g on water divides within peatland complexes or inside river bends foster and glaser 1986 ruuhijärvi 1960 seppä 2002 with a relatively thin peat layer aapa mires can be seen as precursors to new raised bogs if conditions inhibiting peat growth and ombrotrophication change granlund et al 2022 robitaille et al 2021 tahvanainen 2011 according to ruuhijärvi 1960 the ecotone between the northern aapa mire zone and southern bog zone in finland coincides with the 1100 c day isocline of effective temperature sum similarly parviainen and luoto 2007 recognized the importance of thermal factors controlling the aapa mire distribution in scandinavia these findings supported by the general correlation of thermal climate growth of sphagnum mosses and peat accumulation charman et al 2013 gallego sala et al 2018 primeau and garneau 2021 suggest that the biogeography of mire complex types could be governed by differences in plant productivity low productivity in northern latitudes curbs peat accumulation and the formation of raised bogs the occurrence of extra zonal mire complexes however points to importance of hydrology governed by local catchment conditions in addition to climatic factors correlated with the thermal regime affecting plant productivity there are also important hydrological gradients across the boreal zone for instance foster and glaser 1986 proposed that moisture surplus and the amount of minerogenic water flow could explain the predominance of aapa mires in the inland parts of south eastern labrador where a cool and humid climate prevails likewise solantie 2006 pointed out that mean evapotranspiration in june is less than precipitation in the aapa mire zone in finland while the opposite is true in the raised bog zone suggesting that the humidity of the growing season could govern the distribution of mire complex types the distribution is also correlated with snow cover and related hydrological attributes foster and glaser 1986 ruuhijärvi 1960 rydin and jeglum 2013 snow and frost interrupt the growing season and because of snowmelt waters central flark fens of aapa mires are regularly inundated well into the summer inhibiting the growth of sphagnum moss carpets and sustaining the aquatic communities in the flarks ruuhijärvi 1983 the regular spring flooding also brings mineral solutes and removes humic acids preventing acidification and sphagnum success and further providing oxygenation promoting decomposition sallantaus 2006 sjörs 1990 tahvanainen et al 2003 moreover debris carried by meltwaters and caught by the strings sustains the ribbed patterning together with vegetation differentiation and ice movements ruuhijärvi 1960 seppälä and koutaniemi 1985 sjörs 1990 in many northern regions climate warming has progressed more rapidly than the global average in recent decades mikkonen et al 2015 previdi et al 2021 serreze and barry 2011 significantly changing the thermal climate of the aapa mire zone fig 2 climate scenarios predict yet higher temperatures in the future as well as decreased snow cover and more frequent summer droughts pulliainen et al 2020 räisänen 2016 ruosteenoja et al 2011 ruosteenoja et al 2018 as for hydrology veijalainen et al 2012 found a trend of increasing winter discharge in finnish rivers due to increasing precipitation and a decreasing number of snow days spring discharges were projected to decrease due to a reduced amount of snow earlier snowmelt in combination with increasing evapotranspiration were projected to decrease summer discharges the expected course of developments in the snow winter areas of north america as reviewed by ford et al 2021 is much like that described above such results suggest that significant changes in the hydrology of mires can also be expected however water flow dynamics are under explored in peatland hydrology studies often based on water level measurements alone whitfield et al 2009 the present paper explores the recent and future hydrology of aapa mires across the boreal zone focusing on finland as a study area with a long latitudinal gradient good background knowledge and available inventory data sallinen et al 2019 based on historical weather records and predicted future data from climate projections until the end of 21st century the daily discharge from twelve aapa mire catchments is simulated using a conceptual hydrological model cpisnow akanegbu et al 2017 akanegbu et al 2018 developed for boreal and subarctic settings where snow accumulation and melting form a significant part of the annual hydrology the approach allows for the exploration of annual hydrographs of daily values and the study of seasonal patterns and their long term changes the aim is to assess climatic and geographical differences of aapa mire hydrology across the climate gradient from south to north boreal zones and to identify changes and trends that may affect these ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 aapa mire delineation and measurement we selected twelve aapa mires with distinctive hydrotopographic patterns from different biogeographic regions of finland fig 1 the mires belong to a random sample of 120 mires with aapa features described by sallinen et al 2019 and are variably surrounded by forestry drainage and other anthropogenic disturbances but the central minerotrophic parts are undrained based on a digital elevation model we delineated the mire complexes mire ecosystems using the sallinen et al 2019 method the concept is that flark fen the wettest vegetation through which minerogenic water flows is the center of an aapa mire complex and the surrounding peatlands are included in the same mire complex if they form a continuous peatland with the flark fen and are located in its topographic catchment fig 3 we used arcgis 10 7 1 for the catchment delineation and the subsequent gis operations although aapa mires are defined by the occurrence of flark fens the proportion of flarks within aapa mires varies depending on climate and catchment hydrology for delineating and measuring flark areas we performed supervised classifications of color infrared aerial images from the national land survey of finland open data resolution 0 5 m years 2017 2019 first we manually digitized open treeless mire areas clipped the images along these delineations and mosaicked them so that the results comprised a single image layer of open mires then we selected training areas for two classes 1 flarks and 2 sphagnum covered open mire surface six polygons for each mire three for flarks and three for sphagnum surfaces giving a total of 961 pixels of which 50 represented flarks we applied three classification methods available in arcgis maximum likelihood ml random trees rt and support vector machine svm the best classification was selected after assessing their accuracy by visually inspecting 500 random points using color and color ir aerial images although wooded mire areas were excluded from the images before the classification parts of the image margins still contained tree shadows misclassified as flarks these were excluded manually before calculating the flark areas 2 2 hydrological modeling to investigate the past and future hydrological conditions in the study mires we used the cpisnow model which is a conceptual precipitation index based model developed for simulating hydrology in high latitude catchments akanegbu et al 2017 cpisnow couples a point snowmelt model dewalle and rango 2008 with a current precipitation index cpi formulation smakhtin and masse 2000 to simulate continuous daily runoff from catchments with seasonal snow cover the model is in other words a water balance model which includes a snow melting model snow hydrology computation is based on equations that define the melting process refreezing process snow water equivalent of the snowpack and the liquid water holding capacity of snow akanegbu et al 2017 the applicability of the model for simulating runoff in conditions similar to our study area is demonstrated by akanegbu et al 2017 akanegbu et al 2018 the daily runoff and snow water equivalent swe of the aapa mire catchments were modeled for the periods 1961 2016 and 2017 2099 the first year 1961 acting as a warmup year particular attention was paid to hydrographs of spring runoff since spring flooding over the mires during the peak discharge after snowmelt have been considered a precondition for the development and survival of aapa mires together with the conditions in the growing season as discussed in introduction thus the parameterization of the spring peak discharge period was one of the study s milestones as input data we used the 10 10 km grid data of daily precipitation and temperature finnish meteorological institute fmi open data in which the data from 1961 to 2016 was based on meteorological observations and the future data was based on five climate models of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 miroc5 hadgem2 es gfdl cm3 cnrm cm5 canesm2 taylor et al 2012 wrcp 2020 and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp representative concentration pathway with radiative forcing of 4 5 and 8 5 wm 2 at the end of the century respectively van vuuren et al 2011 under scenario rcp8 5 emissions increase throughout the century and atmospheric co2 concentration reaches 1000 ppm by 2100 under rcp4 5 the concentration stabilizes to 540 ppm the results of the five climate models were averaged to acquire mean daily values for the two scenarios previous uses of the same data include lehtonen et al 2016a lehtonen et al 2016b an overview of the climate models and scenarios was provided by ruosteenoja et al 2016a ruosteenoja et al 2016b and a recent example of their utilization in north america was provided by newton et al 2021 since none of the study catchments were gauged we estimated the model parameter value ranges for soil response and routing routines by applying the cpisnow model to the measured data from four small peatland dominated catchments of the mire restoration monitoring network of metsähallitus parks and wildlife finland menberu et al 2018 for which there was data for may november from four years fig 1 we used the monte carlo sampling procedure to optimize the parameters on set objective functions nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 5 nash sutcliffe logarithm efficiency 0 5 absolute volume error 0 5 akanegbu et al 2017 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the lowest and highest parameter values that met the functions were selected as a parameter value range for the mire catchments we optimized the snow routine parameters using the finnish environment institute syke s snow line measurements open data the closest snow water equivalent swe measurement points to the study catchments and the period 1961 1992 were used for the optimization the soil response and routing routine parameters were kept at the median values while the snow routine parameters were optimized using the monte carlo sampling procedure with set objective functions nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 5 nash sutcliffe logarithm efficiency 0 5 absolute volume error 0 5 the posterior parameter space with the highest combination of the functions was selected as the optimal parameter range while the parameter set with the highest combined functions was selected as the optimal parameters and used to validate the model with parameters of a different period 1993 2014 the last step in the modeling was to apply the optimized parameter values and parameter space across the modeling periods to predict the daily specific discharge and swe from the daily results we calculated time series of annual and seasonal average discharges and tested them for the existence of monotonic trends with the mann kendall trend test α 0 05 r package kendall mcleod 2015 daily averages for 20 year periods 1962 1981 1982 2001 2002 2016 2017 2036 2037 2056 and 2057 2096 were also calculated to facilitate the analysis and visualization of changes in annual hydrographs a specific discharge of 0 5 mm d was set as the threshold for peak discharge when studying the spring hydrograph characteristics with r package hydrostats bond 2019 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the mires in general the mires studied in the north and middle boreal zones had wide flark fens while the southern mires had somewhat drier appearance with fewer open water flarks and wider bog margins this is visually evidenced by the aerial images fig 3 and by the results of the numerical image classification fig 4 accuracy assessment of the numerical classification revealed that all three methods maximum likelihood ml random trees rt support vector machine svm succeeded well in separating flarks from sphagnum surfaces however rt had a slightly better overall accuracy rt 89 6 ml 88 4 svm 88 0 and bigger kappa value rt 0 765 ml 0 741 svm 0 731 so rt results were selected for the flark delineations the percentage cover of flarks in the catchment varied from 1 6 to 11 1 generally increasing northward and showed significant correlation with latitude r 0 697 p 0 012 fig 4 in the southern sites flarks occupied only a couple of percent of the catchment areas stormossen mire 9 was an exception with a higher flark percentage 6 8 three of the mires had most of the catchment either drained or located upslope of margin drainage mires 1 5 and 7 only one mire had a completely undrained catchment mire 11 there was no correlation between the percentage of flarks and the drainage status r 0 048 p 0 883 nor partial correlation after controlling for latitude r 0 284 p 0 397 3 2 aapa mire hydrology 1962 2016 the following results are based on cpisnow simulated daily hydrology using temperature and precipitation data as input in addition to the mean runoff and swe reported here the model output also includes upper and lower bounds based on runs with extreme parameter values within the optimal parameter space the confidence interval with set objective functions 0 5 see fig 8 and supplementary material according to the simulations based on historical weather data mean daily surface runoff specific discharge in the mire catchments had a narrow range between 0 41 mm d sd 0 81 mm d mire 2 and 0 53 mm d sd 1 02 mm d mire 4 averaged over 1962 2016 fig 5 a notably both these mires were in the north boreal zone when comparing medians latitudinal differences were more pronounced with values rising southward when discharge was related to the extent of the fen flarks through which the waters flow the three southernmost mires clearly differed having higher average discharge per flark area 18 9 30 5 l m2 d sd 31 0 49 9 l m2 d than the others 4 6 11 7 l m2 d sd 7 9 18 4 l m2 d fig 5b the specific discharge varied considerably between years which is typical for northern conditions annual discharge had slight but statistically significant increasing trends in all but the three southernmost mires in the data from 1962 to 2016 p 0 05 mann kendall trend test spring april may discharge was high with higher values in the northern sites mires 1 2 3 4 and the easternmost site mire 8 an average of 0 97 1 59 mm d sd 0 27 0 35 mm d than in the rest of the mires 0 75 0 80 mm d sd 0 23 0 58 mm d during 1962 2016 spring discharge had a significant increasing trend in the two northernmost mires fig 6 while a decreasing trend was found in two southern mires 9 and 12 in 1962 2016 fig 7 in addition there was an apparent albeit statistically insignificant downward reversal pattern of spring discharge in several mires in summer july august specific discharge was approximately similar in all the studied mires mean 0 47 0 59 mm d sd 0 14 0 19 mm d increasing trends of summer discharge were found in mires 4 5 and 7 in 1962 2016 in autumn october november discharge was lower than in summer with the southern mires having higher average values 0 46 0 54 mm d sd 0 17 0 20 mm d than the others 0 24 0 41 mm d sd 0 14 0 19 mm d increasing trends in the autumn discharge were detected in mires 5 and 7 figs 6 and 7 winter discharge january february was the smallest of the seasonal flows with the northern and eastern mires having lower average values 0 04 0 07 mm d sd 0 03 0 07 mm d than the southern or western mires 0 09 0 23 mm d sd 0 10 0 23 mm d winter discharge had an increasing trend in all but the two northernmost mires during the period 1962 2016 figs 6 and 7 3 3 future projections 2017 2099 annual discharge had slightly increasing trends for 2017 2099 in all the study mires under the rcp8 5 emission scenario p 0 05 mann kendal trend test while under the moderate rcp4 5 scenario only three middle boreal sites mires 5 6 and 8 had statistically significant increasing trends spring discharge had significant decreasing trends in all the study mires and under both emission scenarios with stronger decreases under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 6 and 7 summer discharge had no significant trends p 0 05 autumn discharges had significant increasing trends under both scenarios in most north and middle boreal mires 1 5 and 7 and towards the south mires 6 and 8 11 under the rcp8 5 scenario the southernmost mire 12 had no significant trend in autumn discharge winter discharge had increasing trends in all the study mires and under both emission scenarios with stronger increases under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 6 and 7 the results based on measured weather data 1961 2016 had more variation than the results based on climate models for example total annual discharge had standard deviations of 21 3 43 1 mm y in the observational years while in the future projections standard deviations were between 9 4 and 11 8 mm y there are apparent discontinuities between the time series also in the levels and directions of the smoothed trend lines figs 6 and 7 3 4 changes in hydrographs hydrographs of daily average discharges for the 20 year periods 1962 1981 1982 2001 2002 2016 2017 2036 2037 2056 2057 2076 and 2077 2096 showed a progressive change with diminishing seasonal variation fig 8 and supplementary material in the south and southwest winter runoff increased and snow water equivalent and spring runoff decreased already in the results based on the historical weather observations before 2017 in the north and east these changes only became apparent in the future projections in the southernmost site mire 12 discharge is uniform throughout the year at the end of the century while in the northernmost site mire 1 the seasonality of hydrology is still apparent albeit strongly reduced the projected changes are slightly stronger in the rcp8 5 scenario changes of seasonal discharges are also reflected in the cumulative curves fig 9 in general seasonality is stronger in the north and in the past than in the south and in the future comparison between east mires 8 11 and west mires 9 12 indicates stronger seasonality towards the more continental climate in eastern finland at the end of the century the cumulative discharge curves of south boreal mires become almost linear with approximately the same level of discharge throughout the year the north boreal mires and some of the middle boreal mires were indicated to experience reduced but still distinctive seasonality at the end of the century the cumulative discharge plots also indicate differences in annual discharge between the periods considered with the most recent period 2002 2016 having the lowest annual discharge 3 5 spring peak discharge attributes the onset of spring peak discharge period shifted to earlier dates at all sites during 1962 2016 and this trend apparently continues in the future under both emission scenarios fig 10 a only rcp4 5 results shown although the mann kendall trend test detected a decreasing trend in the peak discharge start date only in half of the mires 1 4 8 11 under rcp4 5 and in two more sites mires 9 10 under rcp8 5 scenario as for the length of spring peak discharge period a trend of shortening duration was detected in the southern and western mires 5 6 7 9 10 11 and 12 under rcp4 5 fig 10b and in the same mires except mire 6 under rcp8 5 in the southernmost mire 12 the spring peak discharge period was indicated to completely disappear by 2057 2076 regarding the specific discharge of the spring peak period sum of daily values during the spring peak discharge period with specific discharge above 0 5 mm significant decreasing trends were revealed in all the studied mires fig 10c except for mire 2 and 11 under rcp8 5 in mires 12 south and 9 west coast the decrease had been strongest in the historical time before 2017 while the northern and eastern mires had experienced high or increasing spring peak flows in general the strongest decrease in spring peak discharge apparently occurred with the switch from the measured historical records to the modeled future values changes in the spring peak discharge volume per flark area m3 m2 reveal the difference of southern sites mires 10 12 to other sites with markedly bigger discharge through the flark area until the present fig 10d this difference is indicated to disappear in the future these results are based on the assumption that the areal extent of the flarks does not change trend test results for this variable were similar to the results for the specific discharge 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of aapa mire hydrology modeling aapa mires rarely have precise outlets where discharge could be directly measured instead these mires typically drain through wide outlet zones and often in many directions sallinen et al 2019 some examples of successful measurements of discharge in small aapa mires have been presented carrer et al 2016 menberu et al 2018 price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 but good quality year round data let alone longer time series are rare in the present study we used the cpisnow model to produce hydrographs of daily runoff an approach that has been shown to give realistic results from ungauged catchments in boreal and subarctic settings akanegbu et al 2017 akanegbu et al 2018 the model was calibrated with measured hydrological data and used temperature and precipitation data as input the application of cmip5 models and rcp scenarios made it possible to extend the temporal scope of the study to nearly 140 years including the future until the end of the 21st century a source of uncertainty in our work was the use of only four years of may november data for the model calibration which limits the account for climate variability and lacks information of winter discharge because our study catchments had very high proportions of peatland cover calibration sites with corresponding peatland cover were needed our modeled annual discharges amounted to 200 mm y this is markedly less than what finér et al 2020 measured from forested catchments in finland about 400 mm y on the other hand hyvärinen et al 1995 reported discharges of 200 400 mm y from larger catchments in different parts of finland including many landcover types the model calibration data represented small mire catchments where gauging sites were located in main outlet streams as close as possible to the mires this data indicates smaller surface runoff components from peatlands than from larger forested catchments with mainly mineral soils in mires a large proportion of runoff is transported in near surface or near groundwater pathways that may not be captured with surface runoff monitoring while the lack of instrumental data from representative large aapa mire complexes hinders strict validation of our discharge levels our results on the general patterns of discharge seasonality and spatial differences do not conflict with the available published results on boreal mires carrer et al 2016 meriö et al 2019 price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 wenng et al 2021 sallantaus 2006 the results based on measured weather data 1961 2016 had more stochastic variation than the results based on climate models 2017 2099 and discontinuities between the past and future modelling outputs were apparent in the time series plots especially in the case of spring discharge of the north boreal sites fig 6 in general climate models and downscaling of weather data may fail to account for variations that are normally present in the weather ruosteenoja et al 2016 in our case the differences in variability are also explained by the fact that the future projections were calculated as averages from five different outputs based on different climate models while the observational results were computed from individual time series based on measurements thus including all realized stochasticity of weather events extremes are typically difficult to model seibert 2003 in our results this concerns particularly spring peak discharge variables in which extreme values play a pivotal role it is probable that the drop in the spring discharge between 2016 and 2017 fig 10 is partly due to the change of the input data from measured to modelled series in any case as seibert 2003 pointed out caution is required when applying a hydrological model to conditions that did not occur during the model development and calibration phase regarding the discontinuities between the time series in the levels and directions of the smoothed trend lines figs 6 and 7 it must be noted that the trend lines were plotted separately for the observational and future periods so they are not expected to converge nevertheless since the discontinuities were largest in the north boreal zone particularly regarding swe and spring discharge they may point to the uncertainties and complexity of predicting future snow conditions in northern latitudes this is related to the delicate balance between the changes in precipitation and temperature lehtonen et al 2016b luomaranta et al 2019 räisänen 2016 moreover variables that were not explicitly considered here such as shortwave radiation relative humidity and wind speed also affect snow accumulation and melting ishida et al 2019 musselman et al 2017 the mentioned discontinuities may thus suggest that our hydrological model would need fine tuning in connection with snow processes however swe results were calculated in the same way regardless of the source data based on temperature and precipitation therefore the discontinuities may also be in the source data and be related to the difficulty of predicting near zero temperature effects and winter precipitation in climate models it is also possible however that the apparent discontinuity reflects stochastic deviation of most recent years and the projected drop in swe will be realized as modeled with a great reduction in snow accumulation in the region concerned according to quinton and roulet 1998 patterned mires have in principle two distinct hydrological phases the first prevails when water supply exceeds the storage capacity of flarks during the spring snowmelt period or after an intense rain event flarks coalesce and water flows over and around the strings making the flow system fully connected the other phase begins when the water level descends flarks become disconnected by strings and little discharge is produced in this latter phase flarks can moderate the discharge due to their substantial storage capacity price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 however according to kvaerner and klove 2008 and carrer et al 2015 the hydrological connectivity of flarks is not as important a factor as the connectivity between the fen and its upland catchment in any case these kinds of factors are mainly related to how individual weather events appear in mire hydrology oswald et al 2011 therefore although we did not consider the mire specific runoff thresholds topographic gradients or catchment geometry we can rely on the averaged results concerning the flows of water in the mires in different seasons and years which were the focus of our study 4 2 extent of wet fen geographical differences and land use in the studied mire catchments the share of fen flarks was highest in the north boreal zone and the eastern part of the middle boreal zone with about 10 share of area in the south flarks occupied only a couple of percent of the catchments overall the percentage of flarks had strong correlation with latitude which is in line with the established view of finnish mires ruuhijärvi 1960 1983 according to which the north boreal zone is the main aapa mire zone with a large proportion of wet fens and open water flarks in mire complexes in the south boreal zone aapa mires are extra zonal and have a drier appearance with flarks commonly covered by sphagnum mosses the middle boreal zone is intermediate in character but still belongs to the aapa mire zone our results support the notion that in the climatic bog zone south boreal a larger catchment is needed for aapa mire development than in the climatic aapa mire zone north and middle boreal rehell 2017 ruuhijärvi 1960 solantie 2006 or more precisely for a given extent of flarks a larger contributing catchment is needed in the bog zone than in the aapa zone an exception was the stormossen mire 9 which had a markedly higher proportion of flarks 6 8 than the other south boreal mires 1 6 2 8 however this mire is located close to the coast which means it is a relatively young mire the post glacial land uplift phenomenon prevails on the western coast of finland where new mires are developing on the land that is exposed from the sea and mires are older the farther inland they are located rehell 2006 tuittila et al 2013 therefore it can be assumed that the exceptional results concerning the mire stormossen are influenced by its relatively early successional phase delineation of aapa mire catchments has previously been carried out manually rehell 2017 and by semi automated gis methods sallinen et al 2019 regardless of the method there are uncertainties involved since land use has extensively altered water flow directions sallinen et al 2019 it must be decided whether the catchments should be delineated based on the current surface runoff or whether efforts should be made to identify the original pre drainage water flow directions and the corresponding catchments in an ideal situation both could be identified and the impact of land use on mire hydrology could be demonstrated regarding land use there were a wide variety of situations in our study without an apparent direction of geographical variation however based on a larger data set it has been shown that peatland drainage is more common in the south 80 drained and middle 75 than in the north boreal zone 24 in finland discharge from the upper catchments to aapa mires may have commonly been disturbed sallinen et al 2019 surrounding land use can reduce the flow of minerogenic water to flark fens and it has been demonstrated that severe disturbances can trigger fen bog transitions in aapa mires resulting in loss of flark area tahvanainen 2011 severe catchment disturbances were indeed indicated in some of the study sites especially mires 5 and 7 fig 4 drainage may have affected wetness and vegetation of the mires e g occurrence of trees or coverage of sphagnum mosses may have increased possibly diminishing the extent of flarks verifying and dating these kinds of changes and relating them to the surrounding drainage would require ground validation and historical proxies e g time series of aerial or satellite images or peat cores granlund et al 2022 tahvanainen 2011 kolari et al 2022 in any case we found no correlation between the drainage status and percentage of flarks and the more disturbed sites did not deviate from the less disturbed sites in the discharge volume per flark area suggesting that the flark fen areas may not have decreased due to catchment disturbances still the highest percentages of flark fen over 10 were in the most undisturbed north and middle boreal catchments mires 4 and 8 4 3 aapa mire hydrology and its changes mean daily discharge mm d was roughly similar in the studied mire catchments with no clear geographical differences while the median discharges increased southwards this is related to the skewness of distribution of daily discharge values and the seasonality of hydrology northern mires have long winters and therefore greater part of the year with low discharge contrary to the expectations following foster and glaser 1986 we did not find evidence of particularly high moisture surplus in the northern aapa mire zone what then causes the difference between the climatic aapa mire and bog zones if not moisture surplus in terms of annual or mean daily specific discharge as the seasonal characteristics of the hydrology showed more differences between the regions it may better explain the spatial distribution of mire complex types together with the biotic effects of thermal climate variation seasonal features in hydrology can be explored using annual hydrographs of daily runoff however since runoff is highly variable on daily basis and between years it is difficult to discern the recurring seasonal pattern among the stochastic variation for smoothing out the short term variation and revealing average seasonality we calculated hydrographs of daily averages for 20 year periods see also sallantaus 2006 according to the results seasonality of runoff with low winter flow and high spring flow is stronger in the north boreal zone and in the more continental eastern parts of the middle and south boreal zones this conforms to the general pattern of the hydrological conditions in finland hyvärinen 2003 korhonen and kuusisto 2010 and demonstrates the case that regularly snowy winters and abundant meltwaters are characteristic of areas with abundant aapa mires foster and glaser 1986 ruuhijärvi 1960 seppä 2002 our analysis of aapa mire hydrology revealed long term changes some of which were already evident in the recent past according to the simulations based on historical weather data 1961 2016 cumulative annual discharge fig 9 indicated most distinct reduction already during the historical period with the most recent period 2002 2016 amounting at lowest mean level this reduction is temporally connected to non linear shift to higher levels of mean annual temperatures in finland mikkonen et al 2015 likewise a trend of increasing winter discharge was found in all but the two northernmost mires already in the recent past this increase will continue in every studied mire according to climate projections as for spring discharge a decreasing trend was evident in the southern aapa mires in the recent past while the northernmost mires had experienced increasing spring discharge for the future the spring discharge was projected to decrease in every mire the onset of the peak discharge period will shift earlier especially in the northern aapa mires and the duration will shorten especially in the south as for summer discharge few positive trends were detected for the historical period and no trends were predicted for the future increasing autumn discharge was particularly detected in the north to sum up at the end of the 21st century aapa mire catchments in the south boreal zone will have few snow days consequently diminished spring flooding and the distinctive seasonality of discharge will largely disappear similar trends are also expected for the middle and north boreal zones but the changes have not yet progressed so far by the end of the century our results are consistent with studies concerning the recent and near future changes in climate snow cover and river hydrology in finland lehtonen et al 2016b luomaranta et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 räisänen 2016 ruosteenoja et al 2011 2016a 2018 veijalainen et al 2012 and recent studies also predict similar changes in many parts of north america ford et al 2021 newton et al 2021 hale et al 2022 according to räisänen 2016 and lehtonen et al 2016b because of shortening winters the total annual snow cover is decreasing in the study area and in much of northern europe by the end of the 21st century despite increasing precipitation total annual snowfall is projected to decrease even in the areas where middle winter snowfall is projected to increase however there are uncertainties involved one of them is a possible slowdown in snowmelt due to shifting of the snowmelt to an earlier time when less energy from direct sunlight is available musselman et al 2017 newton et al 2021 overall much of the projected changes in mire hydrology are caused by rising winter temperatures when snowmelt events become more frequent in winter and precipitation falls more often as rain instead of snow winter discharge will increase and the accumulation of snow will decrease resulting in reduced and shorter spring peak discharge increasing discharge in autumn in the north and middle boreal mires can also be explained by a lengthening frost free season and decreasing number of snow days together with increasing precipitation räisänen 2016 as for summer discharges we anticipated decreasing trends based on increased evapotranspiration and lower and earlier snowmelt discharge dierauer et al 2021 hale et al 2022 veijalainen et al 2012 however no significant downward trend in summer discharge was detected suggesting that aapa mires will continue to produce discharge and perhaps also remain saturated with high water level 4 4 ecosystem responses if conditions in aapa mires remain sufficiently moist a warmer growing season can promote the growth of sphagnum mosses and their expansion in flarks and thereby increase peat accumulation dorrepaal et al 2006 kolari et al 2021 loisel et al 2012 loisel and yu 2013 a parallel effect can result from a shortened snow cover duration and lengthened growing season due to higher autumn and spring temperatures aurela et al 2004 silvan and jokinen 2016 moreover decrease in spring peak flow and flooding may affect water ph by reducing the replenishment of mineral solutes and the flushing of humic acids in the flark fens tahvanainen et al 2003 tahvanainen 2011 these changes favor sphagnum mosses which tolerate acidic conditions and can also further increase the acidity of their habitat schweiger and beierkuhnlein 2017 van breemen 1995 reducing the success of fen species and aiding ombrotrophication loisel and yu 2013 tahvanainen 2011 in our results the southern aapa mires had generally small areas of wet flark fens in relation to the size of the upper catchment and the discharge through unit flark area l m2 was particularly high in southern aapa mires fig 5b this can be explained by the climatic constraints of flark fen survival ruuhijärvi 1960 due to higher primary production extra zonal southern aapa mires need a higher amount of minerogenic water to prevent flark overgrowth by sphagnum mosses in the future because of a warmer and longer growing season even more water will probably be needed to sustain flark fens the hydrological changes projected in our results may work in the same direction as noted above and although our results did not indicate effects of land use on flark fens it should still be noted that most south and middle boreal aapa mires in finland have some ditching in the surrounding catchments sallinen et al 2019 which may also contribute to drive fen bog transitions tahvanainen 2011 with the vanishing hydrological and climatic constraints on fen bog transition changes to the biogeographic mire zonation can be expected the northern mires gaining increasingly southern characters it is unclear however to what extent the newly evolving habitats may resemble the raised bogs we are familiar with or whether they will comprise novel ecosystems hobbs et al 2006 the development could in any case affect biodiversity and global carbon balance in general bogs have lower species richness than fens sjörs 1948 vitt et al 1995 and carbon sequestration is more effective in bogs with greater peat growth rates and smaller methane emissions bridgham et al 1995 tolonen and turunen 1996 zhang et al 2021 future hydrological changes and their effects on northern mires are still partly unknown however earlier shorter and lower spring peak flows together with higher temperatures may connect to reduced soil moisture and groundwater levels in the growing season veijalainen et al 2012 although we did not find signs of decreasing summer discharge in our study mires in principle this development could expose mire vegetation and surface peat to drying promoting decomposition and thus reducing peat growth and carbon sequestration bubier et al 2003 ise et al 2008 waddington et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the mentioned studies have mostly concerned raised bogs however and focused on mire water levels minerogenic fen hydrology is more complex involving extra water source from catchment in fens the hydrological changes related to climate change may not similarly affect water levels as in bogs but instead be manifested in altered discharge levels and seasonal patterns we do not know to what extent the aapa mires have already been affected by recent climate change it is also not known how long the potential delay for ecosystem scale changes to become apparent will take are the changes linear or do they include thresholds or tipping points in any case sphagnum encroachment in aapa mire flarks and fen bog transitions have recently been reported in several cases from europe and north america granlund et al 2022 kolari et al 2021 loisel and yu 2013 magnan et al 2021 primeau and garneau 2021 robitaille et al 2021 tahvanainen 2011 kolari et al 2022 in these studies tahvanainen 2011 connected the phenomenon to hydrological change loisel and yu 2013 suggested the post industrial warming as the main driver and granlund et al 2022 robitaille et al 2021 dated the onset of the fen bog transition to the warming following the little ice age lia ca 1850 magnan et al 2021 found the same timing with increasing rates of change since the 1980s in addition to warming the referred climatic change phases have included changes in humidity and inevitably in mire hydrology the above mentioned case studies together with our results point to the interpretation that the trend of flark overgrowth and fen bog transition may be widespread in the circum boreal distribution area of aapa mires however studies have been published from some areas in canada northern québec according to which the open water pools of aapa mire flarks have recently expanded so called aqualysis due to wetter climatic conditions dissanska et al 2009 tardif et al 2015 white and payette 2016 indicating that the future of aapa mires may have regional features and local pathways likely depending on both climate and catchment hydrology 5 conclusions we studied the recent and future hydrology of twelve aapa mire complexes from north to south boreal zones in finland to assess the geographical patterns and climate change impacts in hydrology of these ecosystems modeling of daily discharge provided a dynamic approach to mire hydrology the study of which has traditionally been based mainly on water level measurements focusing on water flows is particularly relevant in minerotrophic mires where the supply of runoff water from the catchment plays a crucial role the study revealed seasonal patterns and longer term trends in aapa mire hydrology underlining the importance of winter conditions and snow which deserve special attention in northern ecosystems and warming climate the indicated hydrological changes of increasing winter discharge decreasing spring discharge and overall flattening of the seasonal discharge pattern together with the ongoing changes in thermal environment will affect aapa mires contrasting possible pathways have been suggested 1 drying of mire surfaces and increased decomposition of peat 2 sphagnum moss encroachment over fen vegetation fen bog transition and increased peat accumulation the latter alternative is supported based on a review of recent case studies and by our results which clearly showed the smoothing of seasonal differences in hydrology but did not indicate a decrease in the wetness of the mires the projected changes may significantly affect northern mires their biodiversity and carbon balance with implications for nature and human well being further research on the future of aapa mires and their hydrology is therefore timely and important credit authorship contribution statement antti sallinen methodology formal analysis investigation

2425,aapa mires are boreal peatland complexes comprised of wet typically patterned fens in the center and sphagnum bog vegetation at the margins their distribution is controlled by climate and local catchment hydrology the daily discharge of twelve aapa mires across the boreal zone was explored for 1961 2099 with the cpisnow model using observational weather data and projections based on climate models cmip5 and emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mire hydrology was assessed for climate zonal differences seasonal patterns and longer term trends the results indicated past and future changes in hydrology particularly related to the duration and magnitude of snow cover and the timing of snowmelt increasing winter discharge and decreasing spring discharge were detected in recent past in the southern sites and these trends were indicated to continue in the future throughout the study area by the end of the 21st century the typical seasonality of discharge is indicated to weaken throughout the study area and to largely disappear in the south boreal catchments in the northernmost sites a mismatch between past trends and future projections of spring discharge was discovered indicating complexity and uncertainty of snow process modeling the hydrological changes indicated in this study together with direct impacts of increasing temperatures threaten aapa mires affecting biodiversity and greenhouse gas balance in changing climate special attention should be paid to winter conditions and snow essential for the hydrological cycle in the north but under explored in mire hydrology studies keywords catchment climate change hydrological modeling patterned fen peatland snow hydrology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biogeographic zonation of different types of mires peat accumulating wetlands is well known from scandinavia finland and northwestern russia where raised bogs have a predominantly southern distribution and fens are more common in northern boreal and alpine zones with marked local exceptions masing et al 2010 moen 1999 ruuhijärvi 1960 rydin et al 1999 ongoing climate change may alter this zonation belyea 2007 luoto et al 2004 parviainen and luoto 2007 which would have implications for biodiversity and the global greenhouse gas balance since fens and bogs differ in their diversity rydin and jeglum 2013 sjörs 1948 vitt et al 1995 as well as carbon sequestration capacity and methane emissions bridgham et al 1995 turunen et al 2002 wu and roulet 2014 zhang et al 2021 aapa mires form an ecotone type of peatland complexes between south boreal raised bogs and arctic permafrost peatlands especially in the suboceanic parts of boreal europe and canada eurola and vorren 1980 gunnarsson and löfroth 2014 masing et al 2010 nwwg 1988 robitaille et al 2021 aapa mires are characterized by concave gross topography central fens with flarks sparsely vegetated wet fen hollows and margin zones with sphagnum moss cover laitinen et al 2007 ruuhijärvi 1960 tahvanainen 2016 the central fens are fed by rich near surface runoff which is typically reflected as an alternating pattern of flarks and sphagnum strings oriented perpendicularly to the direction of water flow carrer et al 2016 couwenberg 2005 foster and fritz 1987 mccarter and price 2017 the patterned fen vegetation of aapa mire centers is dependent on minerogenic water recharge which is controlled by climate and catchment properties laitinen et al 2007 seppä 2002 the importance of local catchment hydrology is manifested by numerous examples of extra zonal mire complexes fig 1 aapa mires can be found south from the biogeographic aapa mire zone in places where catchments provide abundant snowmelt and groundwater sallantaus 2006 seppä 2002 correspondingly raised bogs commonly occur north from the climatic raised bog zone in places with a limited catchment e g on water divides within peatland complexes or inside river bends foster and glaser 1986 ruuhijärvi 1960 seppä 2002 with a relatively thin peat layer aapa mires can be seen as precursors to new raised bogs if conditions inhibiting peat growth and ombrotrophication change granlund et al 2022 robitaille et al 2021 tahvanainen 2011 according to ruuhijärvi 1960 the ecotone between the northern aapa mire zone and southern bog zone in finland coincides with the 1100 c day isocline of effective temperature sum similarly parviainen and luoto 2007 recognized the importance of thermal factors controlling the aapa mire distribution in scandinavia these findings supported by the general correlation of thermal climate growth of sphagnum mosses and peat accumulation charman et al 2013 gallego sala et al 2018 primeau and garneau 2021 suggest that the biogeography of mire complex types could be governed by differences in plant productivity low productivity in northern latitudes curbs peat accumulation and the formation of raised bogs the occurrence of extra zonal mire complexes however points to importance of hydrology governed by local catchment conditions in addition to climatic factors correlated with the thermal regime affecting plant productivity there are also important hydrological gradients across the boreal zone for instance foster and glaser 1986 proposed that moisture surplus and the amount of minerogenic water flow could explain the predominance of aapa mires in the inland parts of south eastern labrador where a cool and humid climate prevails likewise solantie 2006 pointed out that mean evapotranspiration in june is less than precipitation in the aapa mire zone in finland while the opposite is true in the raised bog zone suggesting that the humidity of the growing season could govern the distribution of mire complex types the distribution is also correlated with snow cover and related hydrological attributes foster and glaser 1986 ruuhijärvi 1960 rydin and jeglum 2013 snow and frost interrupt the growing season and because of snowmelt waters central flark fens of aapa mires are regularly inundated well into the summer inhibiting the growth of sphagnum moss carpets and sustaining the aquatic communities in the flarks ruuhijärvi 1983 the regular spring flooding also brings mineral solutes and removes humic acids preventing acidification and sphagnum success and further providing oxygenation promoting decomposition sallantaus 2006 sjörs 1990 tahvanainen et al 2003 moreover debris carried by meltwaters and caught by the strings sustains the ribbed patterning together with vegetation differentiation and ice movements ruuhijärvi 1960 seppälä and koutaniemi 1985 sjörs 1990 in many northern regions climate warming has progressed more rapidly than the global average in recent decades mikkonen et al 2015 previdi et al 2021 serreze and barry 2011 significantly changing the thermal climate of the aapa mire zone fig 2 climate scenarios predict yet higher temperatures in the future as well as decreased snow cover and more frequent summer droughts pulliainen et al 2020 räisänen 2016 ruosteenoja et al 2011 ruosteenoja et al 2018 as for hydrology veijalainen et al 2012 found a trend of increasing winter discharge in finnish rivers due to increasing precipitation and a decreasing number of snow days spring discharges were projected to decrease due to a reduced amount of snow earlier snowmelt in combination with increasing evapotranspiration were projected to decrease summer discharges the expected course of developments in the snow winter areas of north america as reviewed by ford et al 2021 is much like that described above such results suggest that significant changes in the hydrology of mires can also be expected however water flow dynamics are under explored in peatland hydrology studies often based on water level measurements alone whitfield et al 2009 the present paper explores the recent and future hydrology of aapa mires across the boreal zone focusing on finland as a study area with a long latitudinal gradient good background knowledge and available inventory data sallinen et al 2019 based on historical weather records and predicted future data from climate projections until the end of 21st century the daily discharge from twelve aapa mire catchments is simulated using a conceptual hydrological model cpisnow akanegbu et al 2017 akanegbu et al 2018 developed for boreal and subarctic settings where snow accumulation and melting form a significant part of the annual hydrology the approach allows for the exploration of annual hydrographs of daily values and the study of seasonal patterns and their long term changes the aim is to assess climatic and geographical differences of aapa mire hydrology across the climate gradient from south to north boreal zones and to identify changes and trends that may affect these ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 aapa mire delineation and measurement we selected twelve aapa mires with distinctive hydrotopographic patterns from different biogeographic regions of finland fig 1 the mires belong to a random sample of 120 mires with aapa features described by sallinen et al 2019 and are variably surrounded by forestry drainage and other anthropogenic disturbances but the central minerotrophic parts are undrained based on a digital elevation model we delineated the mire complexes mire ecosystems using the sallinen et al 2019 method the concept is that flark fen the wettest vegetation through which minerogenic water flows is the center of an aapa mire complex and the surrounding peatlands are included in the same mire complex if they form a continuous peatland with the flark fen and are located in its topographic catchment fig 3 we used arcgis 10 7 1 for the catchment delineation and the subsequent gis operations although aapa mires are defined by the occurrence of flark fens the proportion of flarks within aapa mires varies depending on climate and catchment hydrology for delineating and measuring flark areas we performed supervised classifications of color infrared aerial images from the national land survey of finland open data resolution 0 5 m years 2017 2019 first we manually digitized open treeless mire areas clipped the images along these delineations and mosaicked them so that the results comprised a single image layer of open mires then we selected training areas for two classes 1 flarks and 2 sphagnum covered open mire surface six polygons for each mire three for flarks and three for sphagnum surfaces giving a total of 961 pixels of which 50 represented flarks we applied three classification methods available in arcgis maximum likelihood ml random trees rt and support vector machine svm the best classification was selected after assessing their accuracy by visually inspecting 500 random points using color and color ir aerial images although wooded mire areas were excluded from the images before the classification parts of the image margins still contained tree shadows misclassified as flarks these were excluded manually before calculating the flark areas 2 2 hydrological modeling to investigate the past and future hydrological conditions in the study mires we used the cpisnow model which is a conceptual precipitation index based model developed for simulating hydrology in high latitude catchments akanegbu et al 2017 cpisnow couples a point snowmelt model dewalle and rango 2008 with a current precipitation index cpi formulation smakhtin and masse 2000 to simulate continuous daily runoff from catchments with seasonal snow cover the model is in other words a water balance model which includes a snow melting model snow hydrology computation is based on equations that define the melting process refreezing process snow water equivalent of the snowpack and the liquid water holding capacity of snow akanegbu et al 2017 the applicability of the model for simulating runoff in conditions similar to our study area is demonstrated by akanegbu et al 2017 akanegbu et al 2018 the daily runoff and snow water equivalent swe of the aapa mire catchments were modeled for the periods 1961 2016 and 2017 2099 the first year 1961 acting as a warmup year particular attention was paid to hydrographs of spring runoff since spring flooding over the mires during the peak discharge after snowmelt have been considered a precondition for the development and survival of aapa mires together with the conditions in the growing season as discussed in introduction thus the parameterization of the spring peak discharge period was one of the study s milestones as input data we used the 10 10 km grid data of daily precipitation and temperature finnish meteorological institute fmi open data in which the data from 1961 to 2016 was based on meteorological observations and the future data was based on five climate models of the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 miroc5 hadgem2 es gfdl cm3 cnrm cm5 canesm2 taylor et al 2012 wrcp 2020 and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp representative concentration pathway with radiative forcing of 4 5 and 8 5 wm 2 at the end of the century respectively van vuuren et al 2011 under scenario rcp8 5 emissions increase throughout the century and atmospheric co2 concentration reaches 1000 ppm by 2100 under rcp4 5 the concentration stabilizes to 540 ppm the results of the five climate models were averaged to acquire mean daily values for the two scenarios previous uses of the same data include lehtonen et al 2016a lehtonen et al 2016b an overview of the climate models and scenarios was provided by ruosteenoja et al 2016a ruosteenoja et al 2016b and a recent example of their utilization in north america was provided by newton et al 2021 since none of the study catchments were gauged we estimated the model parameter value ranges for soil response and routing routines by applying the cpisnow model to the measured data from four small peatland dominated catchments of the mire restoration monitoring network of metsähallitus parks and wildlife finland menberu et al 2018 for which there was data for may november from four years fig 1 we used the monte carlo sampling procedure to optimize the parameters on set objective functions nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 5 nash sutcliffe logarithm efficiency 0 5 absolute volume error 0 5 akanegbu et al 2017 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the lowest and highest parameter values that met the functions were selected as a parameter value range for the mire catchments we optimized the snow routine parameters using the finnish environment institute syke s snow line measurements open data the closest snow water equivalent swe measurement points to the study catchments and the period 1961 1992 were used for the optimization the soil response and routing routine parameters were kept at the median values while the snow routine parameters were optimized using the monte carlo sampling procedure with set objective functions nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 5 nash sutcliffe logarithm efficiency 0 5 absolute volume error 0 5 the posterior parameter space with the highest combination of the functions was selected as the optimal parameter range while the parameter set with the highest combined functions was selected as the optimal parameters and used to validate the model with parameters of a different period 1993 2014 the last step in the modeling was to apply the optimized parameter values and parameter space across the modeling periods to predict the daily specific discharge and swe from the daily results we calculated time series of annual and seasonal average discharges and tested them for the existence of monotonic trends with the mann kendall trend test α 0 05 r package kendall mcleod 2015 daily averages for 20 year periods 1962 1981 1982 2001 2002 2016 2017 2036 2037 2056 and 2057 2096 were also calculated to facilitate the analysis and visualization of changes in annual hydrographs a specific discharge of 0 5 mm d was set as the threshold for peak discharge when studying the spring hydrograph characteristics with r package hydrostats bond 2019 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the mires in general the mires studied in the north and middle boreal zones had wide flark fens while the southern mires had somewhat drier appearance with fewer open water flarks and wider bog margins this is visually evidenced by the aerial images fig 3 and by the results of the numerical image classification fig 4 accuracy assessment of the numerical classification revealed that all three methods maximum likelihood ml random trees rt support vector machine svm succeeded well in separating flarks from sphagnum surfaces however rt had a slightly better overall accuracy rt 89 6 ml 88 4 svm 88 0 and bigger kappa value rt 0 765 ml 0 741 svm 0 731 so rt results were selected for the flark delineations the percentage cover of flarks in the catchment varied from 1 6 to 11 1 generally increasing northward and showed significant correlation with latitude r 0 697 p 0 012 fig 4 in the southern sites flarks occupied only a couple of percent of the catchment areas stormossen mire 9 was an exception with a higher flark percentage 6 8 three of the mires had most of the catchment either drained or located upslope of margin drainage mires 1 5 and 7 only one mire had a completely undrained catchment mire 11 there was no correlation between the percentage of flarks and the drainage status r 0 048 p 0 883 nor partial correlation after controlling for latitude r 0 284 p 0 397 3 2 aapa mire hydrology 1962 2016 the following results are based on cpisnow simulated daily hydrology using temperature and precipitation data as input in addition to the mean runoff and swe reported here the model output also includes upper and lower bounds based on runs with extreme parameter values within the optimal parameter space the confidence interval with set objective functions

more pronounced with values rising southward when discharge was related to the extent of the fen flarks through which the waters flow the three southernmost mires clearly differed having higher

typical for northern conditions annual discharge had slight but statistically significant increasing trends in all but the three southernmost mires in the data from 1962 to 2016 p 0 05 mann kendall

the mires 0 75 0 80 mm d sd 0 23 0 58 mm d during 1962 2016 spring discharge had a significant increasing trend in the two northernmost mires fig 6 while a decreasing trend was found in two southern mires 9 and 12 in 1962 2016 fig 7 in addition there was an apparent albeit statistically insignificant downward reversal pattern of spring discharge in several mires in summer july august specific discharge was approximately similar in all the studied mires mean 0 47 0 59 mm d sd 0 14 0 19 mm d increasing trends of summer discharge were found in mires 4 5 and 7 in 1962 2016 in autumn october

the autumn discharge were detected in mires 5 and 7 figs 6 and 7 winter discharge january february was the smallest of the seasonal flows with the northern and eastern mires having lower average

period 1962 2016 figs 6 and 7 3 3 future projections 2017 2099 annual discharge had slightly increasing trends for 2017 2099 in all the study mires under the rcp8 5 emission scenario p 0 05 mann kendal trend test while under the moderate rcp4 5 scenario only three middle boreal sites mires 5 6 and 8 had statistically significant increasing trends spring discharge had significant decreasing trends in all the study mires and under both emission scenarios with stronger decreases under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 6 and 7 summer discharge had no significant trends p 0 05 autumn discharges had significant increasing trends under both scenarios in most north and middle boreal mires 1 5 and 7 and towards the south mires 6 and 8 11 under the rcp8 5 scenario the southernmost mire 12 had no significant trend in autumn discharge winter discharge had increasing trends in all the study mires and under both emission scenarios with stronger increases under the rcp8 5 scenario figs 6 and 7 the results based on measured weather data 1961 2016 had more variation than the results based on climate models for example total annual discharge had standard deviations of 21 3 43 1 mm y in the observational years while in the future projections standard deviations were between 9 4 and 11 8 mm y there are apparent discontinuities between the time series also in the levels and directions of the smoothed trend lines figs 6 and 7 3 4 changes in hydrographs hydrographs of daily average discharges for the 20 year periods 1962 1981 1982 2001 2002 2016 2017 2036 2037 2056 2057 2076 and 2077 2096 showed a progressive change with diminishing seasonal variation fig 8 and supplementary material in the south and southwest winter runoff increased and snow water equivalent and spring runoff decreased already in the results based on the historical weather observations before 2017 in the north and east these changes only became apparent in the future projections in the southernmost site mire 12 discharge is uniform throughout the year at the end of the century while in the northernmost site mire 1 the seasonality of hydrology is still apparent albeit strongly reduced the projected changes are slightly stronger in the rcp8 5 scenario changes of seasonal discharges are also reflected in the cumulative curves fig 9 in general seasonality is stronger in the north and in the past than in the south and in the future comparison between east mires 8 11 and west mires 9 12 indicates stronger seasonality towards the more continental climate in eastern finland at the end of the century the cumulative discharge curves of south boreal mires become almost linear with approximately the same level of discharge throughout the year the north boreal mires and some of the middle boreal mires were indicated to experience reduced but still distinctive seasonality at the end of the century the cumulative discharge plots also indicate differences in annual discharge between the periods considered with the most recent period 2002 2016 having the lowest annual discharge 3 5 spring peak discharge attributes the onset of spring peak discharge period shifted to earlier dates at all sites during 1962 2016 and this trend apparently continues in the future under both emission scenarios fig 10 a only rcp4 5 results shown although the mann kendall trend test detected a decreasing trend in the peak discharge start date only in half of the mires 1 4 8 11 under rcp4 5 and in two more sites mires 9 10 under rcp8 5 scenario as for the length of spring peak discharge period a trend of shortening duration was detected in the southern and western mires 5 6 7 9 10 11 and 12 under rcp4 5 fig 10b and in the same mires except mire 6 under rcp8 5 in the southernmost mire 12 the spring peak discharge period was indicated to completely disappear by 2057 2076 regarding the specific discharge of the spring peak period sum of daily values during the spring peak discharge period with specific discharge above 0 5 mm significant decreasing trends were revealed in all the studied mires fig 10c except for mire 2 and 11 under rcp8 5 in mires 12 south and 9 west coast the decrease had been strongest in the historical time before 2017 while the northern and eastern mires had experienced high or increasing spring peak flows in general the strongest decrease in spring peak discharge apparently occurred with the switch from the measured historical records to the modeled future values changes in the spring peak discharge volume per flark area m3 m2 reveal the difference of southern sites mires 10 12 to other sites with markedly bigger discharge through the flark area until the present fig 10d this difference is indicated to disappear in the future these results are based on the assumption that the areal extent of the flarks does not change trend test results for this variable were similar to the results for the specific discharge 4 discussion 4 1 reliability of aapa mire hydrology modeling aapa mires rarely have precise outlets where discharge could be directly measured instead these mires typically drain through wide outlet zones and often in many directions sallinen et al 2019 some examples of successful measurements of discharge in small aapa mires have been presented carrer et al 2016 menberu et al 2018 price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 but good quality year round data let alone longer time series are rare in the present study we used the cpisnow model to produce hydrographs of daily runoff an approach that has been shown to give realistic results from ungauged catchments in boreal and subarctic settings akanegbu et al 2017 akanegbu et al 2018 the model was calibrated with measured hydrological data and used temperature and precipitation data as input the application of cmip5 models and rcp scenarios made it possible to extend the temporal scope of the study to nearly 140 years including the future until the end of the 21st century a source of uncertainty in our work was the use of only four years of may november data for the model calibration which limits the account for climate variability and lacks information of winter discharge because our study catchments had very high proportions of peatland cover calibration sites with corresponding peatland cover were needed our modeled annual discharges amounted to 200 mm y this is markedly less than what finér et al 2020 measured from forested catchments in finland about 400 mm y on the other hand hyvärinen et al 1995 reported discharges of 200 400 mm y from larger catchments in different parts of finland including many landcover types the model calibration data represented small mire catchments where gauging sites were located in main outlet streams as close as possible to the mires this data indicates smaller surface runoff components from peatlands than from larger forested catchments with mainly mineral soils in mires a large proportion of runoff is transported in near surface or near groundwater pathways that may not be captured with surface runoff monitoring while the lack of instrumental data from representative large aapa mire complexes hinders strict validation of our discharge levels our results on the general patterns of discharge seasonality and spatial differences do not conflict with the available published results on boreal mires carrer et al 2016 meriö et al 2019 price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 wenng et al 2021 sallantaus 2006 the results based on measured weather data 1961 2016 had more stochastic variation than the results based on climate models 2017 2099 and discontinuities between the past and future modelling outputs were apparent in the time series plots especially in the case of spring discharge of the north boreal sites fig 6 in general climate models and downscaling of weather data may fail to account for variations that are normally present in the weather ruosteenoja et al 2016 in our case the differences in variability are also explained by the fact that the future projections were calculated as averages from five different outputs based on different climate models while the observational results were computed from individual time series based on measurements thus including all realized stochasticity of weather events extremes are typically difficult to model seibert 2003 in our results this concerns particularly spring peak discharge variables in which extreme values play a pivotal role it is probable that the drop in the spring discharge between 2016 and 2017 fig 10 is partly due to the change of the input data from measured to modelled series in any case as seibert 2003 pointed out caution is required when applying a hydrological model to conditions that did not occur during the model development and calibration phase regarding the discontinuities between the time series in the levels and directions of the smoothed trend lines figs 6 and 7 it must be noted that the trend lines were plotted separately for the observational and future periods so they are not expected to converge nevertheless since the discontinuities were largest in the north boreal zone particularly regarding swe and spring discharge they may point to the uncertainties and complexity of predicting future snow conditions in northern latitudes this is related to the delicate balance between the changes in precipitation and temperature lehtonen et al 2016b luomaranta et al 2019 räisänen 2016 moreover variables that were not explicitly considered here such as shortwave radiation relative humidity and wind speed also affect snow accumulation and melting ishida et al 2019 musselman et al 2017 the mentioned discontinuities may thus suggest that our hydrological model would need fine tuning in connection with snow processes however swe results were calculated in the same way regardless of the source data based on temperature and precipitation therefore the discontinuities may also be in the source data and be related to the difficulty of predicting near zero temperature effects and winter precipitation in climate models it is also possible however that the apparent discontinuity reflects stochastic deviation of most recent years and the projected drop in swe will be realized as modeled with a great reduction in snow accumulation in the region concerned according to quinton and roulet 1998 patterned mires have in principle two distinct hydrological phases the first prevails when water supply exceeds the storage capacity of flarks during the spring snowmelt period or after an intense rain event flarks coalesce and water flows over and around the strings making the flow system fully connected the other phase begins when the water level descends flarks become disconnected by strings and little discharge is produced in this latter phase flarks can moderate the discharge due to their substantial storage capacity price and maloney 1994 quinton and roulet 1998 however according to kvaerner and klove 2008 and carrer et al 2015 the hydrological connectivity of flarks is not as important a factor as the connectivity between the fen and its upland catchment in any case these kinds of factors are mainly related to how individual weather events appear in mire hydrology oswald et al 2011 therefore although we did not consider the mire specific runoff thresholds topographic gradients or catchment geometry we can rely on the averaged results concerning the flows of water in the mires in different seasons and years which were the focus of our study 4 2 extent of wet fen geographical differences and land use in the studied mire catchments the share of fen flarks was highest in the north boreal zone and the eastern part of the middle boreal zone with about 10 share of area in the south flarks occupied only a couple of percent of the catchments overall the percentage of flarks had strong correlation with latitude which is in line with the established view of finnish mires ruuhijärvi 1960 1983 according to which the north boreal zone is the main aapa mire zone with a large proportion of wet fens and open water flarks in mire complexes in the south boreal zone aapa mires are extra zonal and have a drier appearance with flarks commonly covered by sphagnum mosses the middle boreal zone is intermediate in character but still belongs to the aapa mire zone our results support the notion that in the climatic bog zone south boreal a larger catchment is needed for aapa mire development than in the climatic aapa mire zone north and middle boreal rehell 2017 ruuhijärvi 1960 solantie 2006 or more precisely for a given extent of flarks a larger contributing catchment is needed in the bog zone than in the aapa zone an exception was the stormossen mire 9 which had a markedly higher proportion of flarks 6 8 than the other south boreal mires 1 6 2 8 however this mire is located close to the coast which means it is a relatively young mire the post glacial land uplift phenomenon prevails on the western coast of finland where new mires are developing on the land that is exposed from the sea and mires are older the farther inland they are located rehell 2006 tuittila et al 2013 therefore it can be assumed that the exceptional results concerning the mire stormossen are influenced by its relatively early successional phase delineation of aapa mire catchments has previously been carried out manually rehell 2017 and by semi automated gis methods sallinen et al 2019 regardless of the method there are uncertainties involved since land use has extensively altered water flow directions sallinen et al 2019 it must be decided whether the catchments should be delineated based on the current surface runoff or whether efforts should be made to identify the original pre drainage water flow directions and the corresponding catchments in an ideal situation both could be identified and the impact of land use on mire hydrology could be demonstrated regarding land use there were a wide variety of situations in our study without an apparent direction of geographical variation however based on a larger data set it has been shown that peatland drainage is more common in the south 80 drained and middle 75 than in the north boreal zone 24 in finland discharge from the upper catchments to aapa mires may have commonly been disturbed sallinen et al 2019 surrounding land use can reduce the flow of minerogenic water to flark fens and it has been demonstrated that severe disturbances can trigger fen bog transitions in aapa mires resulting in loss of flark area tahvanainen 2011 severe catchment disturbances were indeed indicated in some of the study sites especially mires 5 and 7 fig 4 drainage may have affected wetness and vegetation of the mires e g occurrence of trees or coverage of sphagnum mosses may have increased possibly diminishing the extent of flarks verifying and dating these kinds of changes and relating them to the surrounding drainage would require ground validation and historical proxies e g time series of aerial or satellite images or peat cores granlund et al 2022 tahvanainen 2011 kolari et al 2022 in any case we found no correlation between the drainage status and percentage of flarks and the more disturbed sites did not deviate from the less disturbed sites in the discharge volume per flark area suggesting that the flark fen areas may not have decreased due to catchment disturbances still the highest percentages of flark fen over 10 were in the most undisturbed north and middle boreal catchments mires 4 and 8 4 3 aapa mire hydrology and its changes mean daily discharge mm d was roughly similar in the studied mire catchments with no clear geographical differences while the median discharges increased southwards this is related to the skewness of distribution of daily discharge values and the seasonality of hydrology northern mires have long winters and therefore greater part of the year with low discharge contrary to the expectations following foster and glaser 1986 we did not find evidence of particularly high moisture surplus in the northern aapa mire zone what then causes the difference between the climatic aapa mire and bog zones if not moisture surplus in terms of annual or mean daily specific discharge as the seasonal characteristics of the hydrology showed more differences between the regions it may better explain the spatial distribution of mire complex types together with the biotic effects of thermal climate variation seasonal features in hydrology can be explored using annual hydrographs of daily runoff however since runoff is highly variable on daily basis and between years it is difficult to discern the recurring seasonal pattern among the stochastic variation for smoothing out the short term variation and revealing average seasonality we calculated hydrographs of daily averages for 20 year periods see also sallantaus 2006 according to the results seasonality of runoff with low winter flow and high spring flow is stronger in the north boreal zone and in the more continental eastern parts of the middle and south boreal zones this conforms to the general pattern of the hydrological conditions in finland hyvärinen 2003 korhonen and kuusisto 2010 and demonstrates the case that regularly snowy winters and abundant meltwaters are characteristic of areas with abundant aapa mires foster and glaser 1986 ruuhijärvi 1960 seppä 2002 our analysis of aapa mire hydrology revealed long term changes some of which were already evident in the recent past according to the simulations based on historical weather data 1961 2016 cumulative annual discharge fig 9 indicated most distinct reduction already during the historical period with the most recent period 2002 2016 amounting at lowest mean level this reduction is temporally connected to non linear shift to higher levels of mean annual temperatures in finland mikkonen et al 2015 likewise a trend of increasing winter discharge was found in all but the two northernmost mires already in the recent past this increase will continue in every studied mire according to climate projections as for spring discharge a decreasing trend was evident in the southern aapa mires in the recent past while the northernmost mires had experienced increasing spring discharge for the future the spring discharge was projected to decrease in every mire the onset of the peak discharge period will shift earlier especially in the northern aapa mires and the duration will shorten especially in the south as for summer discharge few positive trends were detected for the historical period and no trends were predicted for the future increasing autumn discharge was particularly detected in the north to sum up at the end of the 21st century aapa mire catchments in the south boreal zone will have few snow days consequently diminished spring flooding and the distinctive seasonality of discharge will largely disappear similar trends are also expected for the middle and north boreal zones but the changes have not yet progressed so far by the end of the century our results are consistent with studies concerning the recent and near future changes in climate snow cover and river hydrology in finland lehtonen et al 2016b luomaranta et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 räisänen 2016 ruosteenoja et al 2011 2016a 2018 veijalainen et al 2012 and recent studies also predict similar changes in many parts of north america ford et al 2021 newton et al 2021 hale et al 2022 according to räisänen 2016 and lehtonen et al 2016b because of shortening winters the total annual snow cover is decreasing in the study area and in much of northern europe by the end of the 21st century despite increasing precipitation total annual snowfall is projected to decrease even in the areas where middle winter snowfall is projected to increase however there are uncertainties involved one of them is a possible slowdown in snowmelt due to shifting of the snowmelt to an earlier time when less energy from direct sunlight is available musselman et al 2017 newton et al 2021 overall much of the projected changes in mire hydrology are caused by rising winter temperatures when snowmelt events become more frequent in winter and precipitation falls more often as rain instead of snow winter discharge will increase and the accumulation of snow will decrease resulting in reduced and shorter spring peak discharge increasing discharge in autumn in the north and middle boreal mires can also be explained by a lengthening frost free season and decreasing number of snow days together with increasing precipitation räisänen 2016 as for summer discharges we anticipated decreasing trends based on increased evapotranspiration and lower and earlier snowmelt discharge dierauer et al 2021 hale et al 2022 veijalainen et al 2012 however no significant downward trend in summer discharge was detected suggesting that aapa mires will continue to produce discharge and perhaps also remain saturated with high water level 4 4 ecosystem responses if conditions in aapa mires remain sufficiently moist a warmer growing season can promote the growth of sphagnum mosses and their expansion in flarks and thereby increase peat accumulation dorrepaal et al 2006 kolari et al 2021 loisel et al 2012 loisel and yu 2013 a parallel effect can result from a shortened snow cover duration and lengthened growing season due to higher autumn and spring temperatures aurela et al 2004 silvan and jokinen 2016 moreover decrease in spring peak flow and flooding may affect water ph by reducing the replenishment of mineral solutes and the flushing of humic acids in the flark fens tahvanainen et al 2003 tahvanainen 2011 these changes favor sphagnum mosses which tolerate acidic conditions and can also further increase the acidity of their habitat schweiger and beierkuhnlein 2017 van breemen 1995 reducing the success of fen species and aiding ombrotrophication loisel and yu 2013 tahvanainen 2011 in our results the southern aapa mires had generally small areas of wet flark fens in relation to the size of the upper catchment and the discharge through unit flark area l m2 was particularly high in southern aapa mires fig 5b this can be explained by the climatic constraints of flark fen survival ruuhijärvi 1960 due to higher primary production extra zonal southern aapa mires need a higher amount of minerogenic water to prevent flark overgrowth by sphagnum mosses in the future because of a warmer and longer growing season even more water will probably be needed to sustain flark fens the hydrological changes projected in our results may work in the same direction as noted above and although our results did not indicate effects of land use on flark fens it should still be noted that most south and middle boreal aapa mires in finland have some ditching in the surrounding catchments sallinen et al 2019 which may also contribute to drive fen bog transitions tahvanainen 2011 with the vanishing hydrological and climatic constraints on fen bog transition changes to the biogeographic mire zonation can be expected the northern mires gaining increasingly southern characters it is unclear however to what extent the newly evolving habitats may resemble the raised bogs we are familiar with or whether they will comprise novel ecosystems hobbs et al 2006 the development could in any case affect biodiversity and global carbon balance in general bogs have lower species richness than fens sjörs 1948 vitt et al 1995 and carbon sequestration is more effective in bogs with greater peat growth rates and smaller methane emissions bridgham et al 1995 tolonen and turunen 1996 zhang et al 2021 future hydrological changes and their effects on northern mires are still partly unknown however earlier shorter and lower spring peak flows together with higher temperatures may connect to reduced soil moisture and groundwater levels in the growing season veijalainen et al 2012 although we did not find signs of decreasing summer discharge in our study mires in principle this development could expose mire vegetation and surface peat to drying promoting decomposition and thus reducing peat growth and carbon sequestration bubier et al 2003 ise et al 2008 waddington et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the mentioned studies have mostly concerned raised bogs however and focused on mire water levels minerogenic fen hydrology is more complex involving extra water source from catchment in fens the hydrological changes related to climate change may not similarly affect water levels as in bogs but instead be manifested in altered discharge levels and seasonal patterns we do not know to what extent the aapa mires have already been affected by recent climate change it is also not known how long the potential delay for ecosystem scale changes to become apparent will take are the changes linear or do they include thresholds or tipping points in any case sphagnum encroachment in aapa mire flarks and fen bog transitions have recently been reported in several cases from europe and north america granlund et al 2022 kolari et al 2021 loisel and yu 2013 magnan et al 2021 primeau and garneau 2021 robitaille et al 2021 tahvanainen 2011 kolari et al 2022 in these studies tahvanainen 2011 connected the phenomenon to hydrological change loisel and yu 2013 suggested the post industrial warming as the main driver and granlund et al 2022 robitaille et al 2021 dated the onset of the fen bog transition to the warming following the little ice age lia ca 1850 magnan et al 2021 found the same timing with increasing rates of change since the 1980s in addition to warming the referred climatic change phases have included changes in humidity and inevitably in mire hydrology the above mentioned case studies together with our results point to the interpretation that the trend of flark overgrowth and fen bog transition may be widespread in the circum boreal distribution area of aapa mires however studies have been published from some areas in canada northern québec according to which the open water pools of aapa mire flarks have recently expanded so called aqualysis due to wetter climatic conditions dissanska et al 2009 tardif et al 2015 white and payette 2016 indicating that the future of aapa mires may have regional features and local pathways likely depending on both climate and catchment hydrology 5 conclusions we studied the recent and future hydrology of twelve aapa mire complexes from north to south boreal zones in finland to assess the geographical patterns and climate change impacts in hydrology of these ecosystems modeling of daily discharge provided a dynamic approach to mire hydrology the study of which has traditionally been based mainly on water level measurements focusing on water flows is particularly relevant in minerotrophic mires where the supply of runoff water from the catchment plays a crucial role the study revealed seasonal patterns and longer term trends in aapa mire hydrology underlining the importance of winter conditions and snow which deserve special attention in northern ecosystems and warming climate the indicated hydrological changes of increasing winter discharge decreasing spring discharge and overall flattening of the seasonal discharge pattern together with the ongoing changes in thermal environment will affect aapa mires contrasting possible pathways have been suggested 1 drying of mire surfaces and increased decomposition of peat 2 sphagnum moss encroachment over fen vegetation fen bog transition and increased peat accumulation the latter alternative is supported based on a review of recent case studies and by our results which clearly showed the smoothing of seasonal differences in hydrology but did not indicate a decrease in the wetness of the mires the projected changes may significantly affect northern mires their biodiversity and carbon balance with implications for nature and human well being further research on the future of aapa mires and their hydrology is therefore timely and important credit authorship contribution statement antti sallinen methodology formal analysis investigation

2426,the accurate monitoring of the surface water storage as an essential component of the global water cycle requires a realistic representation of river networks and channel characteristics since such a representation has not been available for many rivers and is becoming less available even for many gauged rivers crucial questions about the spatio temporal dynamics of freshwater in river networks cannot be answered properly the global coverage and fine temporal resolution of satellite imagery provide the opportunity to obtain time series of surface water extent at the global scale for almost all rivers however despite recent advances in satellite imaging sensors water extraction algorithms and big data processing capabilities none of the available global water extent data sets can meet the necessary requirements in terms of accuracy and spatio temporal resolutions due to the inherent complexity of monitoring the river surface extent efforts have been limited to the development of global river extent data sets with a limited number of temporal layers usually obtained from long term averaged satellite imagery in this study we propose a region based image restoration algorithm to obtain the river surface extent from a pre existing global inland water data set by incorporating temporal and spatial constraints between pixel labels we employ our algorithm on the monthly water history maps of the global surface water data set pekel et al 2016 we validate the proposed method on 98 river reaches that their average width ranges from approximately 36 m to 3400 m with in situ discharge measurements in the mississippi amazon niger and po river basins the obtained river width time series exhibit a strong monotonic relationship with discharge measurements as the spearman correlation coefficients are predominantly larger than 0 70 on average 0 74 for mississippi 0 84 for amazon 0 86 for niger and 0 77 for po rivers such a performance confirms that the proposed method can facilitate the acquisition of a global dynamic river extent data set which plays a key role in better understanding the distribution and availability of freshwater across continents graphical

billion people around the world as the severe water scarcity poses a serious threat to their life for at least one month of a year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the situation will likely worsen as the population and the demand for freshwater grows u n water 2018 increasing the importance of monitoring and observing the earth s freshwater lakes and rivers as the primary source of terrestrial freshwater cover less than 4 of the earth s nonglaciated land surface including about 1 42 million lakes and reservoirs larger than 0 1 km 2 messager et al 2016 and 2 1 million kilometers of rivers wider than 30 m on average allen and pavelsky 2018 accurate monitoring of surface water storage as an important component of the global water cycle requires homogeneous measurements of surface water extent area and water level of lakes reservoirs and rivers renssen and knoop 2000 such measurements are also essential for developing sustainable water management strategies that forecast future water stress under recent global warming conditions van beek et al 2011 gleick 2010 monitoring the freshwater dynamics is a complex undertaking that requires access to comprehensive observations with sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions over a vast area although gauging stations can measure various river hydraulic parameters e g discharge water level with good accuracy and temporal frequency they are highly site specific and not adapted to the spatial heterogeneity of hydrologic processes moreover the provision of data from in situ monitoring networks has been deteriorating over the last century especially in non industrialized regions with poor infrastructure and geopolitical problems fekete et al 2004 furthermore in situ data along rivers typically provide one dimensional information that quantifies water movement in a confined river channel but does not capture the lateral dynamics of water this is particularly problematic in hydrologically complicated areas with wetlands and floodplains such areas cannot be adequately monitored or understood with one dimensional observations but must be described as three dimensional processes the variety of remote sensing technologies with their continuous improvement has led to the development of various methods and algorithms for monitoring the different river hydraulic variables e g river water level velocity and extent from space in the last decades the capability of satellite altimetry to measure river water stage has been explored and several online data repositories like hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 dahiti schwatke et al 2015 grrats coss et al 2020 and hydrosat tourian et al 2021 provide water level time series for most of the important rivers around the world despite groundbreaking advances in satellite imagery sensors water classification algorithms and big data processing capabilities an accurate global river extent data set providing the dynamics of the river extent has not yet been developed due to the several challenges of river reach mask extraction from satellite images efforts have been limited to the development of static river masks obtained from long term averaged satellite image composites existing global river data sets are either developed based on the integration of several relevant data sets or obtained from satellite imagery for example yamazaki et al 2019 present the merit hydro data set which is a global river network at 3 arc second resolution about 90m by integrating the height information from the multi error removed improved terrain digital elevation model merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 and information of water coverage from global water extent data sets like g1wbm yamazaki et al 2015 the global surface water gsw occurrence map pekel et al 2016 and open street map on the other hand allen and pavelsky 2018 developed the global river widths from landsat grwl database which presents the river width at the mean river discharge of the global river network obtained from landsat imagery although these data sets provide very useful information about river characteristics they cannot project the temporal variation of the river surface extent meanwhile a number of existing data sets only contains the river width information at a regional scale for example allen and pavelsky 2015 and isikdogan et al 2017 developed data sets of static river width of rivers in north america yang et al 2020 introduced the multi temporal china river width data set which provides the width of rivers in china both in summer and winter at 6 temporal layers between the years 1990 2015 hou et al 2019 introduced a landsat based data set that provides river widths at different water coverage frequencies for all river reaches in australia theoretically river surface water extent can be extracted from any existing global inland water data set the obtained river extent maps are restricted to the accuracy and spatio temporal limitations of the initial data set since most of the global inland water data sets are developed based on satellite optical imagery the obtained inland water data set subjects to significant over and underestimations the main reason for underestimation of the surface water area is the contaminated pixels in the existing data sets due to 1 cloud contamination 2 cloud shadow 3 terrain shadow 4 low illumination 5 tree canopy coverage 6 scan line corrector slc failure of landsat 7 on the other hand the overestimation of river extent may occur because of the misclassification in the global inland water data set the aforementioned problems are much more pronounced in products with a high temporal resolution like the monthly water history maps of the gsw data set pekel et al 2016 a common approach to deal with the pixel contamination is to define a threshold for the contamination rate and then discard all the temporal layers which exceed the threshold vicente serrano et al 2008 huang et al 2010 a typical solution to further reduce the effect of pixel contamination is temporal averaging which automatically leads to a degradation of temporal resolution of the obtained data set for example yamazaki et al 2015 generated the 5 years average global water body map from landsat images busker et al 2019 suggested another solution for dealing with the contaminated pixels for generating time series of lake area they just consider the gsw monthly water history maps with less than 5 contamination and define the area of remaining contaminated pixels inside the subset as the uncertainty of the area estimates some studies suggest assigning a label for contaminated pixels benefiting from an additional source of information for example li et al 2013 enhanced modis based water masks using the digital elevation models zhao and gao 2018 generated a high quality lake surface water area time series by enhancing the contaminated pixels of the gsw data set integrating the information from the water occurrence map yao et al 2019 proposed a new method for enhancing the obtained surface water extent by recovering the contaminated shoreline through an efficient vector based interpolation however none of the aforementioned algorithms can accurately extract time series of river extent area due to the complex nature of river systems and their variations in time the inaccurate estimation of river width variation due to over and under estimation prevents its application in most river hydraulic and hydrologic applications this study presents an algorithm to generate a high quality time series of river reach areas from pre existing dynamic water extent data sets the proposed algorithm is not designed to improve the spatial or temporal resolution of the pre existing water extent data set but it aims to retrieve the river reach extent maps from pre existing water extent data sets by enhancing the effect of the pixel contamination to achieve this goal we propose an algorithm that automatically enhances raw water masks by repairing the contaminated pixels and reducing the classification error in the original data set we formulate the problem of extracting dynamic river extent as a maximum a posterior estimation of a markov random fields map mrf estimation within such a frame the enhanced river water extent can be obtained by incorporating the temporal and spatial constraints between pixel labels we apply our algorithm to the gsw monthly water history products from march 1984 to december 2020 and validate the obtained time series against in situ discharge measurements in 98 river reaches in the mississippi 35 reaches amazon 62 reaches niger 6 reaches and po 5 reaches river basins in order to be precise to use the terminologies the following terms are used in this paper consistently global inland water data set refers to data sets like the srtm water body data swbd nasa jpl 2013 the global inundation extent from multiple satellites giems papa et al 2010 and gsw pekel et al 2016 these raster data sets usually contain binary water no water global inundation maps with different spatial and temporal resolutions so these data sets do not directly provide the surface water area of any specific inland water body global lakes and reservoirs data set refers to data sets that are specifically developed for providing water area time series of lakes or reservoirs around the world for example hydroweb and bluedot observatory data sets provides water area time series of lakes and reservoirs globally using landsat and sentinel 2 images the global reservoir surface area data set grsad zhao and gao 2018 obtained water area time series of 6817 reservoirs from the gsw data set global river extent data set refers to data sets like grwl allen and pavelsky 2018 or merit hydro yamazaki et al 2019 which provide global river network together with additional information like average river width 2 data sets and case study 2 1 data sets the proposed algorithm is generic and can generate the enhanced river reach masks from any global inland water data set providing water no water label in this study we apply the proposed algorithm to the monthly water history maps of the gsw data set another input of the proposed algorithm for generating the river extent maps is the boundary of the river reach to benefit from the defined river reaches and nodes river centerline and river reach bounding box provided in the swot a priori river database sword altenau et al 2021 this data set is used as an auxiliary data set global inland water data set the european commission s joint research centre in the framework of the copernicus program developed a consistent monthly global surface water data set between the years 1984 2020 at 30m spatial resolution benefiting the entire archive of the landsat 5 7 and 8 imagery pekel et al 2016 the gsw data set is developed through the google earth engine platfrom and available as a gee data catalog in this platform gorelick et al 2017 the global monthly water history map which is the primary product of this data set obtained through a sophisticated classification procedure pekel et al 2016 developed a water detection algorithm consisting of expert systems visual analytics and evidential reasoning the expert system is a procedural sequential decision tree using both spectral and temporal attributes of images as well as ancillary data layers to assign an appropriate label water no water or no observation to each pixel an extensive training data set is used to capture the spectral variability of each class through visual analytics then a wide range of conditions is defined to describe the spectral behavior of each class finally the inference engine associates each pixel to a class pekel et al 2016 the monthly water history product of the gsw data set accessible through the gee catalog jrc gsw1 3 monthlyhistory constitutes the entire history of spatial dynamics of global surface water from march 1984 to december 2020 monthly pekel et al 2016 apart from this product different aspects of surface water extend variability e g monthly recurrence yearly history maximum water extent and seasonality are recorded in eight additional layers within the gsw data set auxiliary data set static river centerline the river reaches of interest are identified from the swot a priori river database sword altenau et al 2021 apart from supporting the swot measurements the major purpose for sword is to provide fixed node locations reach boundaries and high resolution river centerline from the global river width from landsat grwl data set allen and pavelsky 2018 in a way that facilitates the generation of swot vector products altenau et al 2021 in addition to a consistent topological system for global rivers wider than 30m different hydrological variables are attached to the database surface water elevation the slope at the mean river flow from merit hydro data set yamazaki et al 2019 average river reach width together with its standard deviation from grwl data set and information like the location of the dams channel lock length of the reach distance from outlet and drainage area sword also contains a unique identification id for each river reach and node the general structure of 11 digit code for each river reach and 14 digit code for each river node starting with 6 digits from the hydrobasins pfafstetter level 6 code lehner and grill 2013 after the basin code is the 4 digit reach id for nodes followed by extra 3 digit node id which is determined by the flow accumulation and elevation values finally the last digit in the sword id identifies the type of the river reach or node e g river lake off river lake on river dam no topology and ghost reach node altenau et al 2021 2 2 case study and validation data the proposed algorithm is applied to a set of river reaches that are selected in river basins with different climatology fig 1 presents the river reaches and the location of the discharge gauge stations which are selected as additional case studies 35 river reaches are selected in the mississippi river basin mrb most of the selected river reaches in the mrb are narrow and their river flow is managed and regulated as they flow in the urban areas as a result monitoring their river extent is challenging because of the fast and unexpected variations moreover we obtain average river width time series of 52 reaches along the amazon river and its tributaries amazon river system with more than 1100 tributaries is considered as the most complex and vital earth s water system in most parts of the basin the river reaches tend to meander because of the flatness of the basin therefore extracting the river mask is a challenge for the algorithm to evaluate the performance of the algorithm we select a wide variety of the river reaches in terms of river width from a few hundred meters to more than 6km and discharge from less than 0 01 km 3 day to 20 km 3 day the rest of the river reaches are selected along the niger and po rivers to evaluate obtained river reach extent average river width time series are compared to the in situ discharge measurements for the mrb examples the u s geological survey usgs gauging stations measure river discharge in each river reach tables 1 and 2 present additional information of river reaches and discharge gauges in mrb river discharge observations in the amazon basin are obtained from the national water and sanitation agency ana which is a brazilian agency responsible for providing in situ measurements in brazil additional information on the river reaches and the gauge stations in the amazon river basin are provided in table a 3 the number of available gauge stations which have been active between the years 1985 2020 is limited in the niger and po basins as a result we can only have 6 examples in the niger basin tables a 4 and 5 river reaches in the po basin table a 5 to improve the readability of the paper in the results and validation section we only discuss the examples in mrb and the rest of the results are discussed in appendix the agreement between our river width estimates and in situ discharge observations is assessed via spearman s rank correlation coefficient the rank correlation measures how well the river width discharge relationship can be described as a monotonic function independent of being linear or nonlinear because of the strong dependency between river width and the corresponding discharge in a reach with regular channel shape we expect a perfect monotonicity and accordingly a near to 1 rank correlation coefficient accordingly the correlation coefficient is expected to reduce in case of a river reach with rectangular or irregular channel shape 3 methodology the proposed algorithm for obtaining enhanced river masks has three main procedures which will be described in the following 1 data preparation 2 determination of the river surface water extent 3 connectivity check 3 1 data preparation in case of availability of the auxiliary river data set the algorithm starts with extracting the data and hydraulic parameters of the given river reach in this study sword these parameters include the reach boundary coordinate of the reach centerline location of the river nodes average river width and the variance of the river width after that the following preparation steps are performed 1 clipping the temporal stack of raw river masks from the gsw monthly water history data set based on the given river reach boundary fig 2 a e 2 defining the region of interest by masking the pixels outside the defined buffer zone fig 2 b f in this study the buffer distance equals two times the mean river width plus two times the standard deviation of river width measurements the size of the region of interest depends on the dynamic of the river reach area and must be modified according to the case study 3 discarding contaminated images from the stack if the amount of contaminated pixels in the region of interest is more than the defined threshold the image is nominated as a low quality image and removed from the stack in this study according to the average width of our case studies the images with more than 70 contamination ratio are eliminated from the image stack 4 generating the water occurrence map and the monthly water recurrence maps from the remaining images of the stack frequency maps will be later employed to develop the water no water probability functions it should be noted that here one can use the gsw water occurrence and recurrence maps but since we aim to develop a generic algorithm we prefer generating them from the raw monthly water masks the main outputs of the data preparation step are a stack of buffered monthly water masks with a contamination rate lower than the defined threshold and the water occurrence map together with monthly water recurrence maps the river width obtained from raw river masks is compared to the enhanced river mask in fig 2 the process of enhancing river mask has been described in the following section due to the pixel contamination cross sectional river width for some river reach nodes cannot be measured in the raw river masks however the cross sectional river width for all the nodes is measured in the enhanced river masks fig 2 d h 3 2 determination of river surface water extent to enhance the raw monthly river extent maps we express a binary image restoration problem to retrieve the river reach mask while preserving the spatial and temporal constraints the markov random field mrf provides a convenient framework for modeling spatial and contextual interactions between pixels veksler 1999 during the past years mrf based probabilistic models have been massively implemented and applied to various types of image problems e g image segmentation boykov and veksler 2006 kolmogorov and zabin 2004 multi camera stereo kolmogorov and zabih 2002 denoising raj and zabih 2005 image restoration besag 1986 liu and caselles 2012 in the mrf context a prior and a likelihood function are defined as the main ingredients of a bayesian framework from which a posterior outputs the goal is then to find a particular labeling structure that maximizes the posterior estimate of the mrf map mrf the posterior probability can be written as 1 p f d p d f p f p d and the aim is to find a realization of the field f which maximizes the following likelihood function 2 f arg max f f p d f p f according to the bayes rule the posterior probability of a hypothesis f given observations d is proportional to the product of the likelihood probability p d f and the prior probability p f the hammersley clifford theorem in the mrf states that the prior probability of a particular configuration equals the sum of clique potentials v over all neighboring cliques n boykov et al 1998 as a result the prior probability of any realization f can be written as 3 p f exp p p q n p v p q f p f q which is the sum of clique potentials over all pixels in this study only the clique potentials of the first order vertical and horizontal neighboring pixels are considered after that the likelihood function will be defined by considering the pixel labels and its temporal behavior if d p is the label of pixel p in the raw water mask and f is a realization of the field the likelihood function can be written as 4 p d f p p p d p f p for calculating the likelihood probability we further assume that 5 p d p l exp d p l l l where d p is defined later in this section according to the temporal behavior of the river reach and l is the set of possible labels in our implementation this set has two members water no water as a result the likelihood function can be written as 6 p d f exp p p d p f p by replacing eqs 3 and 5 into the map estimate eq 2 will be reshaped as 7 f arg max f f exp p p d p f p p p q n p v p q f p f q instead of maximizing the log likelihood of a posterior distribution it is convenient to minimize its negative log likelihood which can be viewed as minimizing an energy function e comprising of two terms geman and geman 1984 veksler 1999 szeliski et al 2008 8 e f p p d p f p p p q n p v p q f p f q the first part of this function is the sum of the individually computed energy for each pixel d p l p based on the probability of occurring a particular label l p from possible labels l water no water 9 d p log p l p p l to obtain d p for each pixel we need to predefine the probability function to have a label we obtain such a probability function based on the water occurrence and the monthly recurrence maps to avoid unnecessary smoothness the probability is derived by taking the average of the two maps fig 3 a b as a result the higher the value in the frequency map for a pixel the larger the probability of being labeled as water the second term of the energy function is the so called smoothness energy term 10 e s p p q n p v p q f p f q which is the sum of smoothness energy between each pixel p and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors q n p generally the smoothness part measures the agreement of two adjacent pixels in terms of pixel label the function v assigns high energy between two pixels with the same label and low energy in the case that two pixels have a different label the smoothness term can be defined in various ways to best model the interaction between pixels here we define a piecewise constant veksler 1999 function to model the smoothness term in the water masks 11 v p q l p l q 2 θ if l p l q θ if l p l q to minimize the defined energy function we benefit from the minimum cut maximum flow solution of a graph greig et al 1989 in the recent past this technique has been successfully used for a wide variety of vision problems from stereo and motion to image restoration and segmentation boykov and jolly 2001 boykov et al 2001 boykov and kolmogorov 2003 ishikawa 2003 kolmogorov and zabin 2004 in our implantation an undirected weighted graph g v e consists of a set of nodes v representing the image pixels and a set of weighted edges e connecting the graph nodes n links the cost of each n links are derived from the smoothness term e s the graph has two additional nodes terminals corresponding to the possible labels that can be assigned to pixels all nodes are connected to the terminals through the t links which their costs are derived from the data energy term e d within such a graph we search for a cut c to obtain an enhanced river mask a cut is a set of graph edges c e such that the terminals would be separated if they are removed from the graph g v e c veksler 1999 in the induced graph g each node only connects to a terminal either directly through a t link or indirectly through other nodes the cost of a cut equals the sum of its edge costs the aim of the minimum cut algorithm on a graph is to find a cut that has the minimum cost among all possible cuts ford and fulkerson 1962 states that the set of edges saturated by pushing the maximum flow from one terminal to the other one is equivalent to the minimum cut solution the duality relationship between minimum cut and maximum flow problem is the backbone of many algorithms that solve the graph cuts problem in polynomial time by gradually increasing the flow boykov and kolmogorov 2004 goldberg et al 2011 goldberg and tarjan 1988 in our implementation the max flow min cut problem is solved by using the max flow algorithm developed by boykov and kolmogorov 2004 e g fig 3 d here we follow the augmenting paths routine by building the search trees for detecting the augmenting paths between terminals pushing the flow through the detected paths and updating the residual graph by removing the saturated edges fig 3 d demonstrates an example of generated enhanced river water extent the right side of the river reach is heavily contaminated in the raw water mask in a way that even the river path is not recognizable our algorithm can cope with this situation by incorporating spatial and temporal information here the data energy term increases the possibility of assigning a correct label according to the long term behavior of the pixel while the smoothness term allows preserving the river shoreline the comparison between the maps e and f in fig 3 shows how the algorithm enhances the river mask in case of inconsistency between the priors and the raw river mask for example a few pixels in box 2 of fig 3 e are wrongly labeled as no water in the raw river mask since the labels are not in an agreement with the spatial and temporal priors the algorithm changes their labels to water box 4 in fig 3 f moreover box 1 of fig 3 e contains some contaminated pixels in this case the algorithm relies on the temporal and spatial constraints to define their label fig 3 f 3 3 connectivity check to obtain accurate time series of river surface water extent maps the connectivity of obtained river masks along the river reach must be evaluated to this end two filters are designed to ensure the connectivity of the river mask and to remove the isolated pixels labeled as water the first filter analyzes whether all the river reach nodes connect through a path over the river the river mask will be discarded from the stack if the filter cannot find the path the raw river mask in fig 4 a was not excluded in the data preparation step because the level of contamination is less than 70 however due to the distribution of the contaminated pixels the river extraction algorithm could not retrieve the river reach properly therefore the enhanced river mask consists of several separated water bodies instead of a continuous river mask through the river centerline as a result this river mask is discarded from the time series the second filter is designed to eliminate all the pixels labeled as water without any connection to the main body of the river these pixels could be either separated water bodies like small rivers or lakes located in the region of interest or pixels that are wrongly labeled as water the raw river mask in fig 4 c includes several contaminated pixels moreover on the north side of the river many small water bodies and isolated pixels are labeled as water since these decoupled water bodies are inconsistent with the long term behavior of the river reach the proposed algorithm labeled them as no water however still a few separated water bodies are in the enhanced river mask red areas in fig 4 d these isolated pixels are detected and removed by the second filter 4 results and validation by applying the proposed algorithm time series of enhanced surface water extent maps are obtained these maps are a base for generating various outputs to explore specific temporal and spatial variation of the river reach extent fig 5 provides a comparison between the raw and enhanced river masks for river reach a30 in amazon river basin since this river reach is in the tropical region it has suffered from cloud coverage during the monitoring period as the rate of contamination pixels are extremely high in the raw river reaches the water area estimates from raw river masks would be drastically underestimated as the major part of the river reach is contaminated e g in fig 5 e h o after the year 2003 the slc off strips in landsat 7 images further increase the amount of contaminated pixels for example in reaches of fig 5 m n the accuracy of estimated water area from raw river masks would be reduced due to the both cloud contamination and also landsat 7 slc off strips the necessity of developing such a retrieving algorithm is highlighted by looking at the enhanced pixels labeled as water dark cyan and no water sienna the algorithm overcomes the pixel contamination successfully even in the challenging examples for example fig 5 e in the raw river various parts for the river shoreline are contaminated mask due to the spatial distribution of the clouds however the algorithm can successfully retrieve the river reach and it can preserve natural shape of the river shoreline by considering the spatial and temporal constraints another interesting example is fig 5 f which the southern part of the river reach is fully covered by the cloud in the raw river mask to enhance this river reach the algorithm just relies on the temporal behavior of the reach as the direct observations are not available since the probability functions are carefully designed the river shoreline is extracted accurately in most cases the proposed algorithm successfully copes with the issue of contaminated pixels however in less than 1 of cases a retrieve is not obtained due to a complex relationship of land and water and their spatio temporal behavior water frequency coverage maps in fig 6 present the temporal variation of the river reach over the monitoring period 1985 2020 the enhanced water occurrence map fig 6 a shows the frequency of water coverage for each pixel during the whole monitoring period fig 6 b i presents the monthly water frequency maps for the months with available enhanced river masks the focus of the enhanced frequency maps is on the river reach because the connectivity check has already filtered out all water bodies that are not connected to the river reach in this river reach the water recurrence maps for january february november and december are not generated because all images of these months were discarded from the stack due to high pixel contamination the monthly recurrence maps fig 6 b i show that the extent of the river reach varies not only over a year but also within a month such a significant temporal variation casts doubt on the validity of existing static river reach centerlines for representing river networks fig 7 presents a comparison between the static centerline from sword black and dynamic river centerlines white obtained by applying the rivamap algorithm isikdogan et al 2017 on the stack of enhanced river masks the time series in fig 7 a f are some examples of the change in river cross sectional width the cross sectional width of the river depends on the location of the river centerline and the flow direction of the river so assuming a fixed location for the nodes of the river sections leads to an incorrect estimate of the channel width to avoid this problem the cross section width is calculated for each river mask along its centerline then a time series of river width is generated for each sword node by considering the cross sectional width closest to the sword node since the sword centerline represents the river at the mean annual flow altenau et al 2021 the variation between the static and dynamic centerlines represents the dynamic of the river extent for example the middle part of this section of the river has minimal temporal variation so the time varying centerlines are almost on the static centerline on the other hand the time varying centerlines produce a large variation at the beginning of the section because the river shoreline in this part of the river has a strong dynamic we obtain time series of effective river width hereafter river width for each reach by dividing the obtained river surface area by the length of the reach time series of river width for the first 15 river reaches in the mrb introduced in fig 1 are presented in fig 8 the comparison between enhanced river width and discharge time series shows a general agreement as the obtained rank correlation coefficients vary between 0 52 and 0 86 in two examples fig 8 m3 m11 the river passes through the urban area and the water flow is regulated by dams along the river reaches big dam bridge on the arkansas river and locks and dam 3 on monongahela river as a result the scatterplot of river width and discharge measurements becomes wider and consequently the rank correlation coefficients are relatively low in the examples like fig 8 m1 m5 m8 m9 the simultaneous river width and discharge measurements present the monotonic relationship and therefore the rank correlation is relatively high in these examples this means that the river width measurements can project the dynamic of the river in all percentiles in river reaches like fig 8 m2 m6 m7 m13 the width discharge measurements are severely scattered in low discharge percentiles since the river reach is not wide enough to be extracted accurately from the landsat images in the river reaches like fig 8 m7 m14 in which the river is narrow even in the high discharge the points show a wide scatter in almost all the percentiles the accuracy of the raw river width time series highly depends on the spatial distribution of the contaminated pixels if the level of contamination is not so significant and the spatial distribution of contaminated pixels does not seriously corrupt the river reach extent the improvement in river reach enhancement is not substantial fig 8 m4 m14 m15 on average we observe an improvement of more than 20 in the obtained correlation coefficients see fig 8 red values refer to the raw data and black to our estimates in some examples like fig 8 m2 m6 m7 m10 with a high pixel contamination rate the correlation coefficients have improved from negative values to positive ones these results confirm the credibility of our methodology to obtain accurate dynamic river width from a pre existing global inland water data set fig 9 presents the scatterplots of average river width versus river discharge measurements for the rest of the examples in the mrb the rank correlation coefficient between two variables suggests that the proposed algorithm can capture the river extent like the previous examples on average the rank correlation coefficient for the mrb examples is 0 74 however in some examples like fig 9 m32 m33 the river width variations do not project the discharge variation properly as their scatterplots are wide and their rank correlation is lower than the average moreover in some examples like fig 9 m25 m29 m32 the scatterplots become wide because the range of the width variation is relatively small in comparison with the landsat pixel size for evaluating the performance of the algorithm in different regions the derived reach average river width estimates of amazon niger and po rivers have been compared to the gauged discharge measurements in appendix as the river reaches in amazon and niger river basins are relatively wider and their dynamics are less regulated the rank correlation coefficients between the river width and discharge are higher 0 85 for amazon and 0 88 for niger than those in the mrb the river reaches along the po river have the same situation as the mrb examples as they mostly flow through the cities and urban areas as a result their plots are relatively scattered with the average correlation coefficients is 0 77 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with existing algorithms this study presents an algorithm specifically developed to obtain the dynamic river surface water extent from an existing global inland water data set for the first time here we compare the components of the proposed algorithm to existing water body extraction methodologies in terms of 1 defining the region of interest 2 dealing with contaminated pixels 3 classification scheme 4 river connectivity checks 1 defining the region of interest restricting the region of interest to the area that only includes the water extent makes the algorithm much more computationally efficient this data preparation step is not considered in rivwidthcloud yang et al 2019 and rivamap isikdogan et al 2017 algorithms as they consider the whole image frame as input other studies have considered either a manual region of interest around the object busker et al 2019 or a constant buffer region around a static shapefile of the water body yao et al 2019 zhao and gao 2018 in our proposed method the buffer region is defined according to the mean and standard deviation of the river width obtained from sword as a result the designated search area only includes the essential pixels that may include the river extent since the temporal variability of the river extent is considered 2 dealing with contaminated pixels this is a crucial step in extracting the water extent from optical satellite images studies like zhao and gao 2018 schwatke et al 2019 suggest defining the label for each contaminated pixel by defining a threshold on the long term water occurrence map yao et al 2019 proposed to recover the contaminated shoreline through an efficient vector based interpolation in case of using the landsat images the rivwithcloud algorithm yang et al 2019 first flags the contaminated pixels using the fmask classification algorithm zhu et al 2015 if a pixel along the river cross section is flagged then its value is replaced to the mean value of the rest of the pixels in the same river cross section the proposed algorithm in this study has a different approach to deal with the contaminated pixels by rearranging the problem as a map based image restoration in which the prior knowledge obtained from the water coverage frequency map in this frame the contaminated pixels are considered as noise and the aim of the algorithm is to construct the denoised image without losing details like edges corners or blurring the water land border 3 water extraction scheme existing algorithms for detecting the water or mapping the lakes reservoirs and rivers only rely on the variation of spectral information of pixels for example schwatke et al 2019 yao et al 2019 first generate some multispectral water indexes and then obtain the water land boundary by applying a threshold the rivamap algorithm isikdogan et al 2017 generates the modified normalized difference water index mndwi from spectral bands of landsat and extracts curvilinear structure of rivers the rivwidthcloud algorithm yang et al 2019 can generate a river mask using two built in water classification algorithms 1 the water classification algorithm developed by zou et al 2018 this algorithm also generates a number of multispectral water indices and then defines the river extent by applying thresholds to them the threshold values are defined based on the training data gathered from the landsat images across the united states 2 the dynamic surface water extent dswe classification method jones 2019 this classification algorithm defines the water extents through a spectral mixture model which is developed by using a series of multispectral water and vegetation indices all the mentioned algorithms are considered as pixel based classification methods as they do not consider the spatial correlation between adjacent pixels in their procedure elmi et al 2016 compared the performance of pixel and region based classification algorithms in generating dynamic river masks their results presented that integrating the temporal and spatial information in addition to the spectral information is significantly improve the accuracy of obtained river masks in this study the raw river masks are obtained from the monthly water history maps of the gsw data set which are generated through a pixel based water classification algorithm the image restoration algorithm proposed in this study modifies the raw river masks by incorporating the spatial and temporal constraints as a result we can conclude that in order to define the enhanced river masks we benefit from all sources of information available in the image stack spectral spatial and temporal 4 river connectivity checks the proposed algorithm in this study further improves the quality of the obtained river extent maps by removing the isolated pixels which are not connected to the river reach moreover the connectivity of each river mask along the reach is also evaluated the rivwidthcloud yang et al 2019 algorithm also applies such filters to distinguish the river from non river water pixels by checking the connectivity of each pixel to the grwl river centerline moreover the rivwidthcloud algorithm removes the islands smaller than 0 3 km 2 in the river masks to reduce the complexity of the derived centerline yang et al 2019 the other related studies do not mention the availability of any connectivity check in their algorithms however it should be mentioned that in the case of extracting lakes and reservoirs applying such filters may not be necessary designing such a filter may cause erroneous river mask estimates in case of applying to the anabranching river reaches for example if an anabranch of a river cuts off from the river and creates an oxbow lake in its way the connectivity filter considers the lake as part of the river reach if it is connected to the main body of the river reach 5 2 limitations the inherent vulnerability to cloud coverage is the main obstacle for representing the dynamics of the river extent using satellite optical imagery in the case of using landsat 7 images the rate of contaminated pixels significantly increases due to the slc error in the proposed method to ensure the accuracy of the obtained river extents raw gsw river reach masks with more than 70 of contamination rate are excluded from the image stack this comes at the cost of degrading the temporal resolution where all measurements during january and december are discarded from the time series in all validation case studies fig 8 in the case studies located in a latitude higher than 40 fig 8 m10 m15 the number of available non contaminated observations significantly decreases during the fall and winter october march it is clear that by easing the rejection condition the number of discarded river reach masks may decrease however this increment of the temporal resolution comes with the decrement of the accuracy in extracting the river extent to recover the images with a high contamination rate the algorithm relies more on the long term behavior of the river extent as it is the only source of information in this situation as a result the enhanced river reach extent only explores the temporal average of the river reach boundaries by ignoring the fast variations fig 10 presents the percentage of available river extent estimates between 2000 2020 on average over the year fig 10 a and per season fig 10 b e globally for generating these maps the ratio between the contaminated pixels and the total number of pixels is evaluated for all river reaches the river reach masks are excluded from the image stack if the contamination rate of the restricted search area is more than 70 as a result if a river reach has a value around 50 in fig 10 a it means that more than 125 enhanced river masks are available between the years 2000 2020 the maps in fig 10 b e present the temporal distribution of available enhanced river masks per season these maps indicate that rarely any raw gsw river extent can pass through the preparation step in the northern hemisphere high and mid latitude region north america europa and north asia from september till february during summer and spring the number of river extent estimates increases significantly however this frequency of enhanced river extents may not be sufficient to characterize the river reach dynamics in this region the temporal resolution of enhanced river extents in the low latitudes region is significantly higher than the mid latitude region however in some critical regions like south america and africa the interval between two estimates enlarges from june till august the coarse temporal resolution of landsat based river extents can be relieved by obtaining river extent estimates from different missions e g sentinel 1 2 and modis in the cloud prone regions employing the sar images is a viable solution for generating dense river extent time series for example mengen et al 2020 mapped the temporal variation of inundation area of the mekong river using 318 senses of sentinel 1 a b between the years 2015 2018 to benefit from both optical and sar images some studies suggest a image fusion approach to increase the temporal resolution of obtained dynamic water masks for example druce et al 2021 presents an operational data fusion approach for integrating optical and sar images in their study their benefit from sentine 1 2 and landsat 8 imagery for mapping the dynamics of the inland water bodies in mainland china another limitation of the proposed algorithm is the absence of stochastic information for the obtained river extent estimates in general the uncertainty of any product derived from remote sensing observations could be characterized in case of having a comprehensive understanding of various sources of uncertainty including the sensor atmosphere target and the classification algorithm alternatively the uncertainty can be obtained by benefiting from the properties of the probabilistic bayesian framework to this end kohli and torr 2008 tarlow and adams 2012 proposed uncertainty derivation of the map solution by obtaining the min marginal energy of the graph the studies by elmi 2019 elmi et al 2021 showed that the kohli and torr method can estimate a realistic uncertainty for river width extracted from modis images however applying the kohli and torr technique on images with a finer spatial resolution comes with a huge computational cost alternatively papandreou and yuille 2011 introduced the perturb and map method to characterize the uncertainty of the posterior estimate in this technique a set of posterior estimates is obtained by maximizing the perturbed posterior functions then the marginal density and uncertainty of each node are defined by measuring the mean and standard deviation of obtained posterior estimates both aforementioned techniques can characterize the uncertainty of river reach area estimates in the case of using pixel intensity as input in our case since the gsw monthly water history maps just provide pixel label without any information about the uncertainty a proper uncertainty estimation is not possible applying the algorithm to the pixel values provides the opportunity to estimate a realistic uncertainty for the obtained labels by marginalizing the graph or applying the perturb and map method however it is important to note that applying the algorithm to the raw satellite images will increase the computational complexity of the algorithm and make the procedure of extracting the river reach time consuming 6 conclusion we present an algorithm for obtaining high quality river reach water extent time series from a pre existing global inland water data set the main asset of the proposed method is a region based image restoration algorithm to this end we define a probabilistic bayesian frame to retrieve the enhanced river reach masks by preserving the spatial and temporal constraints we employ our algorithm on the gsw monthly water history products pekel et al 2016 and benefited from river hydraulic parameters provided in the sword data altenau et al 2021 the performance of the algorithm is validated by comparing the obtained average river reach width time series and in situ discharge measurements over 98 river reaches in the mississippi 35 examples amazon 53 examples niger 6 examples and po 5 examples river basins the high rank correlation coefficient 0 85 in the basins with natural behavior and regular channels amazon and niger river basins shows that the obtained river masks can properly capture river dynamics the monotonic dependency between discharge and width weakens if the river channels have a rectangular shape which is quite often in the urban areas as a result the average correlation decreases to less than 0 74 in the mrb and 0 77 in the po river reaches our analysis highlights that cloud contamination is the main challenge for developing time series of river width with a fine temporal resolution when only satellite optical imagery is used fig 10 the proposed method facilitates the acquisition of an accurate global data set of the dynamic river width which can play a key role in a better estimation of river discharge the key to the successful performance of any river discharge estimation algorithm from river width discharge rating curve technique e g studies by pavelsky 2014 elmi et al 2015 tourian et al 2017 to the mcfli algorithms e g studies by hagemann et al 2017 feng et al 2019 is the availability of more prior knowledge gleason et al 2017 over gauged and semi gauged river basins the availability of river width time series can increase the temporal and spatial resolution of discharge estimates by benefiting from the legacy in situ discharge gleason and durand 2020 in ungauged river basins the river width time series plays a crucial role in the calibration of the discharge estimation model in the absence of any in situ measurements moreover having an accurate dynamic river width helps to obtain a better overview of the dynamics of the surface water that

thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions that helped us to improve the manuscript appendix validation case studies in other river basins in this section we evaluate the algorithm s performance in the amazon niger and po river basins by comparing the obtained reach average river width to in situ river discharge measurements fig 1 presents the river reaches and the location of the gauge stations which are selected as additional case studies additional information of river reaches and discharge gauges are provided in table a 3 amazon table a 4 niger and table a 5 po the scatterplots of river reaches along the amazon river and its tributaries are in fig a 11 a1 a52 amazon is the most complex river system in the world including river reaches with various types of meandering rivers and braided river systems to explore the potential of the proposed algorithm we have selected a range of river reaches which their average river width varies from a few meters to a few kilometers the high rank correlation between the average river width and river discharge 0 85 on average for all 52 river reaches presents that the proposed algorithm can successfully monitor the variation of reach average river width in 13 examples over the amazon basin the scatterplots show an almost perfect agreement between river discharge and width variations as the rank correlation between them is greater than 0 9 the correlation coefficient of 24 river reaches is between 0 8 and 0 9 in some examples like fig a 11 a20 a29 a40 a52 the variation of the average river width is less than the landsat pixel size 30m therefore the scatterplot gets wider especially in low and medium discharge percentiles the average river width versus river discharge measurements scatterplots of niger river reach examples are in fig a 11 n1 n6 in these examples the number of available simultaneous measurements is limited mainly because of the high rate of cloud contamination and also lack of river discharge measurements as most of the gauges stopped measuring discharge before 2010 the high correlation coefficient between average river width and river discharge shows that the algorithm can extract the river extent accurately in this river basin finally scatterplots in figs a 11 p1 p5 are the simultaneous river width and discharge measurements of the river reaches along the po river the average river width only varies a few tens of meters in fig a 11 p1 p4 and p5 examples as a result their scatterplots are relatively wide and noisy on the other hands the range of width variation in fig a 11 p2 p3 is about 0 5km as their scatterplot are narrow and their rank correlations are relatively high 
2426,the accurate monitoring of the surface water storage as an essential component of the global water cycle requires a realistic representation of river networks and channel characteristics since such a representation has not been available for many rivers and is becoming less available even for many gauged rivers crucial questions about the spatio temporal dynamics of freshwater in river networks cannot be answered properly the global coverage and fine temporal resolution of satellite imagery provide the opportunity to obtain time series of surface water extent at the global scale for almost all rivers however despite recent advances in satellite imaging sensors water extraction algorithms and big data processing capabilities none of the available global water extent data sets can meet the necessary requirements in terms of accuracy and spatio temporal resolutions due to the inherent complexity of monitoring the river surface extent efforts have been limited to the development of global river extent data sets with a limited number of temporal layers usually obtained from long term averaged satellite imagery in this study we propose a region based image restoration algorithm to obtain the river surface extent from a pre existing global inland water data set by incorporating temporal and spatial constraints between pixel labels we employ our algorithm on the monthly water history maps of the global surface water data set pekel et al 2016 we validate the proposed method on 98 river reaches that their average width ranges from approximately 36 m to 3400 m with in situ discharge measurements in the mississippi amazon niger and po river basins the obtained river width time series exhibit a strong monotonic relationship with discharge measurements as the spearman correlation coefficients are predominantly larger than 0 70 on average 0 74 for mississippi 0 84 for amazon 0 86 for niger and 0 77 for po rivers such a performance confirms that the proposed method can facilitate the acquisition of a global dynamic river extent data set which plays a key role in better understanding the distribution and availability of freshwater across continents graphical

billion people around the world as the severe water scarcity poses a serious threat to their life for at least one month of a year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the situation will likely worsen as the population and the demand for freshwater grows u n water 2018 increasing the importance of monitoring and observing the earth s freshwater lakes and rivers as the primary source of terrestrial freshwater cover less than 4 of the earth s nonglaciated land surface including about 1 42 million lakes and reservoirs larger than 0 1 km 2 messager et al 2016 and 2 1 million kilometers of rivers wider than 30 m on average allen and pavelsky 2018 accurate monitoring of surface water storage as an important component of the global water cycle requires homogeneous measurements of surface water extent area and water level of lakes reservoirs and rivers renssen and knoop 2000 such measurements are also essential for developing sustainable water management strategies that forecast future water stress under recent global warming conditions van beek et al 2011 gleick 2010 monitoring the freshwater dynamics is a complex undertaking that requires access to comprehensive observations with sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions over a vast area although gauging stations can measure various river hydraulic parameters e g discharge water level with good accuracy and temporal frequency they are highly site specific and not adapted to the spatial heterogeneity of hydrologic processes moreover the provision of data from in situ monitoring networks has been deteriorating over the last century especially in non industrialized regions with poor infrastructure and geopolitical problems fekete et al 2004 furthermore in situ data along rivers typically provide one dimensional information that quantifies water movement in a confined river channel but does not capture the lateral dynamics of water this is particularly problematic in hydrologically complicated areas with wetlands and floodplains such areas cannot be adequately monitored or understood with one dimensional observations but must be described as three dimensional processes the variety of remote sensing technologies with their continuous improvement has led to the development of various methods and algorithms for monitoring the different river hydraulic variables e g river water level velocity and extent from space in the last decades the capability of satellite altimetry to measure river water stage has been explored and several online data repositories like hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 dahiti schwatke et al 2015 grrats coss et al 2020 and hydrosat tourian et al 2021 provide water level time series for most of the important rivers around the world despite groundbreaking advances in satellite imagery sensors water classification algorithms and big data processing capabilities an accurate global river extent data set providing the dynamics of the river extent has not yet been developed due to the several challenges of river reach mask extraction from satellite images efforts have been limited to the development of static river masks obtained from long term averaged satellite image composites existing global river data sets are either developed based on the integration of several relevant data sets or obtained from satellite imagery for example yamazaki et al 2019 present the merit hydro data set which is a global river network at 3 arc second resolution about 90m by integrating the height information from the multi error removed improved terrain digital elevation model merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 and information of water coverage from global water extent data sets like g1wbm yamazaki et al 2015 the global surface water gsw occurrence map pekel et al 2016 and open street map on the other hand allen and pavelsky 2018 developed the global river widths from landsat grwl database which presents the river width at the mean river discharge of the global river network obtained from landsat imagery although these data sets provide very useful information about river characteristics they cannot project the temporal variation of the river surface extent meanwhile a number of existing data sets only contains the river width information at a regional scale for example allen and pavelsky 2015 and isikdogan et al 2017 developed data sets of static river width of rivers in north america yang et al 2020 introduced the multi temporal china river width data set which provides the width of rivers in china both in summer and winter at 6 temporal layers between the years 1990 2015 hou et al 2019 introduced a landsat based data set that provides river widths at different water coverage frequencies for all river reaches in australia theoretically river surface water extent can be extracted from any existing global inland water data set the obtained river extent maps are restricted to the accuracy and spatio temporal limitations of the initial data set since most of the global inland water data sets are developed based on satellite optical imagery the obtained inland water data set subjects to significant over and underestimations the main reason for underestimation of the surface water area is the contaminated pixels in the existing data sets due to 1 cloud contamination 2 cloud shadow 3 terrain shadow 4 low illumination 5 tree canopy coverage 6 scan line corrector slc failure of landsat 7 on the other hand the overestimation of river extent may occur because of the misclassification in the global inland water data set the aforementioned problems are much more pronounced in products with a high temporal resolution like the monthly water history maps of the gsw data set pekel et al 2016 a common approach to deal with the pixel contamination is to define a threshold for the contamination rate and then discard all the temporal layers which exceed the threshold vicente serrano et al 2008 huang et al 2010 a typical solution to further reduce the effect of pixel contamination is temporal averaging which automatically leads to a degradation of temporal resolution of the obtained data set for example yamazaki et al 2015 generated the 5 years average global water body map from landsat images busker et al 2019 suggested another solution for dealing with the contaminated pixels for generating time series of lake area they just consider the gsw monthly water history maps with less than 5 contamination and define the area of remaining contaminated pixels inside the subset as the uncertainty of the area estimates some studies suggest assigning a label for contaminated pixels benefiting from an additional source of information for example li et al 2013 enhanced modis based water masks using the digital elevation models zhao and gao 2018 generated a high quality lake surface water area time series by enhancing the contaminated pixels of the gsw data set integrating the information from the water occurrence map yao et al 2019 proposed a new method for enhancing the obtained surface water extent by recovering the contaminated shoreline through an efficient vector based interpolation however none of the aforementioned algorithms can accurately extract time series of river extent area due to the complex nature of river systems and their variations in time the inaccurate estimation of river width variation due to over and under estimation prevents its application in most river hydraulic and hydrologic applications this study presents an algorithm to generate a high quality time series of river reach areas from pre existing dynamic water extent data sets the proposed algorithm is not designed to improve the spatial or temporal resolution of the pre existing water extent data set but it aims to retrieve the river reach extent maps from pre existing water extent data sets by enhancing the effect of the pixel contamination to achieve this goal we propose an algorithm that automatically enhances raw water masks by repairing the contaminated pixels and reducing the classification error in the original data set we formulate the problem of extracting dynamic river extent as a maximum a posterior estimation of a markov random fields map mrf estimation within such a frame the enhanced river water extent can be obtained by incorporating the temporal and spatial constraints between pixel labels we apply our algorithm to the gsw monthly water history products from march 1984 to december 2020 and validate the obtained time series against in situ discharge measurements in 98 river reaches in the mississippi 35 reaches amazon 62 reaches niger 6 reaches and po 5 reaches river basins in order to be precise to use the terminologies the following terms are used in this paper consistently global inland water data set refers to data sets like the srtm water body data swbd nasa jpl 2013 the global inundation extent from multiple satellites giems papa et al 2010 and gsw pekel et al 2016 these raster data sets usually contain binary water no water global inundation maps with different spatial and temporal resolutions so these data sets do not directly provide the surface water area of any specific inland water body global lakes and reservoirs data set refers to data sets that are specifically developed for providing water area time series of lakes or reservoirs around the world for example hydroweb and bluedot observatory data sets provides water area time series of lakes and reservoirs globally using landsat and sentinel 2 images the global reservoir surface area data set grsad zhao and gao 2018 obtained water area time series of 6817 reservoirs from the gsw data set global river extent data set refers to data sets like grwl allen and pavelsky 2018 or merit hydro yamazaki et al 2019 which provide global river network together with additional information like average river width 2 data sets and case study 2 1 data sets the proposed algorithm is generic and can generate the enhanced river reach masks from any global inland water data set providing water no water label in this study we apply the proposed algorithm to the monthly water history maps of the gsw data set another input of the proposed algorithm for generating the river extent maps is the boundary of the river reach to benefit from the defined river reaches and nodes river centerline and river reach bounding box provided in the swot a priori river database sword altenau et al 2021 this data set is used as an auxiliary data set global inland water data set the european commission s joint research centre in the framework of the copernicus program developed a consistent monthly global surface water data set between the years 1984 2020 at 30m spatial resolution benefiting the entire archive of the landsat 5 7 and 8 imagery pekel et al 2016 the gsw data set is developed through the google earth engine platfrom and available as a gee data catalog in this platform gorelick et al 2017 the global monthly water history map which is the primary product of this data set obtained through a sophisticated classification procedure pekel et al 2016 developed a water detection algorithm consisting of expert systems visual analytics and evidential reasoning the expert system is a procedural sequential decision tree using both spectral and temporal attributes of images as well as ancillary data layers to assign an appropriate label water no water or no observation to each pixel an extensive training data set is used to capture the spectral variability of each class through visual analytics then a wide range of conditions is defined to describe the spectral behavior of each class finally the inference engine associates each pixel to a class pekel et al 2016 the monthly water history product of the gsw data set accessible through the gee catalog jrc gsw1 3 monthlyhistory constitutes the entire history of spatial dynamics of global surface water from march 1984 to december 2020 monthly pekel et al 2016 apart from this product different aspects of surface water extend variability e g monthly recurrence yearly history maximum water extent and seasonality are recorded in eight additional layers within the gsw data set auxiliary data set static river centerline the river reaches of interest are identified from the swot a priori river database sword altenau et al 2021 apart from supporting the swot measurements the major purpose for sword is to provide fixed node locations reach boundaries and high resolution river centerline from the global river width from landsat grwl data set allen and pavelsky 2018 in a way that facilitates the generation of swot vector products altenau et al 2021 in addition to a consistent topological system for global rivers wider than 30m different hydrological variables are attached to the database surface water elevation the slope at the mean river flow from merit hydro data set yamazaki et al 2019 average river reach width together with its standard deviation from grwl data set and information like the location of the dams channel lock length of the reach distance from outlet and drainage area sword also contains a unique identification id for each river reach and node the general structure of 11 digit code for each river reach and 14 digit code for each river node starting with 6 digits from the hydrobasins pfafstetter level 6 code lehner and grill 2013 after the basin code is the 4 digit reach id for nodes followed by extra 3 digit node id which is determined by the flow accumulation and elevation values finally the last digit in the sword id identifies the type of the river reach or node e g river lake off river lake on river dam no topology and ghost reach node altenau et al 2021 2 2 case study and validation data the proposed algorithm is applied to a set of river reaches that are selected in river basins with different climatology fig 1 presents the river reaches and the location of the discharge gauge stations which are selected as additional case studies 35 river reaches are selected in the mississippi river basin mrb most of the selected river reaches in the mrb are narrow and their river flow is managed and regulated as they flow in the urban areas as a result monitoring their river extent is challenging because of the fast and unexpected variations moreover we obtain average river width time series of 52 reaches along the amazon river and its tributaries amazon river system with more than 1100 tributaries is considered as the most complex and vital earth s water system in most parts of the basin the river reaches tend to meander because of the flatness of the basin therefore extracting the river mask is a challenge for the algorithm to evaluate the performance of the algorithm we select a wide variety of the river reaches in terms of river width from a few hundred meters to more than 6km and discharge from less than 0 01 km 3 day to 20 km 3 day the rest of the river reaches are selected along the niger and po rivers to evaluate obtained river reach extent average river width time series are compared to the in situ discharge measurements for the mrb examples the u s geological survey usgs gauging stations measure river discharge in each river reach tables 1 and 2 present additional information of river reaches and discharge gauges in mrb river discharge observations in the amazon basin are obtained from the national water and sanitation agency ana which is a brazilian agency responsible for providing in situ measurements in brazil additional information on the river reaches and the gauge stations in the amazon river basin are provided in table a 3 the number of available gauge stations which have been active between the years 1985 2020 is limited in the niger and po basins as a result we can only have 6 examples in the niger basin tables a 4 and 5 river reaches in the po basin table a 5 to improve the readability of the paper in the results and validation section we only discuss the examples in mrb and the rest of the results are discussed in appendix the agreement between our river width estimates and in situ discharge observations is assessed via spearman s rank correlation coefficient the rank correlation measures how well the river width discharge relationship can be described as a monotonic function independent of being linear or nonlinear because of the strong dependency between river width and the corresponding discharge in a reach with regular channel shape we expect a perfect monotonicity and accordingly a near to 1 rank correlation coefficient accordingly the correlation coefficient is expected to reduce in case of a river reach with rectangular or irregular channel shape 3 methodology the proposed algorithm for obtaining enhanced river masks has three main procedures which will be described in the following 1 data preparation 2 determination of the river surface water extent 3 connectivity check 3 1 data preparation in case of availability of the auxiliary river data set the algorithm starts with extracting the data and hydraulic parameters of the given river reach in this study sword these parameters include the reach boundary coordinate of the reach centerline location of the river nodes average river width and the variance of the river width after that the following preparation steps are performed 1 clipping the temporal stack of raw river masks from the gsw monthly water history data set based on the given river reach boundary fig 2 a e 2 defining the region of interest by masking the pixels outside the defined buffer zone fig 2 b f in this study the buffer distance equals two times the mean river width plus two times the standard deviation of river width measurements the size of the region of interest depends on the dynamic of the river reach area and must be modified according to the case study 3 discarding contaminated images from the stack if the amount of contaminated pixels in the region of interest is more than the defined threshold the image is nominated as a low quality image and removed from the stack in this study according to the average width of our case studies the images with more than 70 contamination ratio are eliminated from the image stack 4 generating the water occurrence map and the monthly water recurrence maps from the remaining images of the stack frequency maps will be later employed to develop the water no water probability functions it should be noted that here one can use the gsw water occurrence and recurrence maps but since we aim to develop a generic algorithm we prefer generating them from the raw monthly water masks the main outputs of the data preparation step are a stack of buffered monthly water masks with a contamination rate lower than the defined threshold and the water occurrence map together with monthly water recurrence maps the river width obtained from raw river masks is compared to the enhanced river mask in fig 2 the process of enhancing river mask has been described in the following section due to the pixel contamination cross sectional river width for some river reach nodes cannot be measured in the raw river masks however the cross sectional river width for all the nodes is measured in the enhanced river masks fig 2 d h 3 2 determination of river surface water extent to enhance the raw monthly river extent maps we express a binary image restoration problem to retrieve the river reach mask while preserving the spatial and temporal constraints the markov random field mrf provides a convenient framework for modeling spatial and contextual interactions between pixels veksler 1999 during the past years mrf based probabilistic models have been massively implemented and applied to various types of image problems e g image segmentation boykov and veksler 2006 kolmogorov and zabin 2004 multi camera stereo kolmogorov and zabih 2002 denoising raj and zabih 2005 image restoration besag 1986 liu and caselles 2012 in the mrf context a prior and a likelihood function are defined as the main ingredients of a bayesian framework from which a posterior outputs the goal is then to find a particular labeling structure that maximizes the posterior estimate of the mrf map mrf the posterior probability can be written as 1 p f d p d f p f p d and the aim is to find a realization of the field f which maximizes the following likelihood function 2 f arg max f f p d f p f according to the bayes rule the posterior probability of a hypothesis f given observations d is proportional to the product of the likelihood probability p d f and the prior probability p f the hammersley clifford theorem in the mrf states that the prior probability of a particular configuration equals the sum of clique potentials v over all neighboring cliques n boykov et al 1998 as a result the prior probability of any realization f can be written as 3 p f exp p p q n p v p q f p f q which is the sum of clique potentials over all pixels in this study only the clique potentials of the first order vertical and horizontal neighboring pixels are considered after that the likelihood function will be defined by considering the pixel labels and its temporal behavior if d p is the label of pixel p in the raw water mask and f is a realization of the field the likelihood function can be written as 4 p d f p p p d p f p for calculating the likelihood probability we further assume that 5 p d p l exp d p l l l where d p is defined later in this section according to the temporal behavior of the river reach and l is the set of possible labels in our implementation this set has two members water no water as a result the likelihood function can be written as 6 p d f exp p p d p f p by replacing eqs 3 and 5 into the map estimate eq 2 will be reshaped as 7 f arg max f f exp p p d p f p p p q n p v p q f p f q instead of maximizing the log likelihood of a posterior distribution it is convenient to minimize its negative log likelihood which can be viewed as minimizing an energy function e comprising of two terms geman and geman 1984 veksler 1999 szeliski et al 2008 8 e f p p d p f p p p q n p v p q f p f q the first part of this function is the sum of the individually computed energy for each pixel d p l p based on the probability of occurring a particular label l p from possible labels l water no water 9 d p log p l p p l to obtain d p for each pixel we need to predefine the probability function to have a label we obtain such a probability function based on the water occurrence and the monthly recurrence maps to avoid unnecessary smoothness the probability is derived by taking the average of the two maps fig 3 a b as a result the higher the value in the frequency map for a pixel the larger the probability of being labeled as water the second term of the energy function is the so called smoothness energy term 10 e s p p q n p v p q f p f q which is the sum of smoothness energy between each pixel p and its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors q n p generally the smoothness part measures the agreement of two adjacent pixels in terms of pixel label the function v assigns high energy between two pixels with the same label and low energy in the case that two pixels have a different label the smoothness term can be defined in various ways to best model the interaction between pixels here we define a piecewise constant veksler 1999 function to model the smoothness term in the water masks 11 v p q l p l q 2 θ if l p l q θ if l p l q to minimize the defined energy function we benefit from the minimum cut maximum flow solution of a graph greig et al 1989 in the recent past this technique has been successfully used for a wide variety of vision problems from stereo and motion to image restoration and segmentation boykov and jolly 2001 boykov et al 2001 boykov and kolmogorov 2003 ishikawa 2003 kolmogorov and zabin 2004 in our implantation an undirected weighted graph g v e consists of a set of nodes v representing the image pixels and a set of weighted edges e connecting the graph nodes n links the cost of each n links are derived from the smoothness term e s the graph has two additional nodes terminals corresponding to the possible labels that can be assigned to pixels all nodes are connected to the terminals through the t links which their costs are derived from the data energy term e d within such a graph we search for a cut c to obtain an enhanced river mask a cut is a set of graph edges c e such that the terminals would be separated if they are removed from the graph g v e c veksler 1999 in the induced graph g each node only connects to a terminal either directly through a t link or indirectly through other nodes the cost of a cut equals the sum of its edge costs the aim of the minimum cut algorithm on a graph is to find a cut that has the minimum cost among all possible cuts ford and fulkerson 1962 states that the set of edges saturated by pushing the maximum flow from one terminal to the other one is equivalent to the minimum cut solution the duality relationship between minimum cut and maximum flow problem is the backbone of many algorithms that solve the graph cuts problem in polynomial time by gradually increasing the flow boykov and kolmogorov 2004 goldberg et al 2011 goldberg and tarjan 1988 in our implementation the max flow min cut problem is solved by using the max flow algorithm developed by boykov and kolmogorov 2004 e g fig 3 d here we follow the augmenting paths routine by building the search trees for detecting the augmenting paths between terminals pushing the flow through the detected paths and updating the residual graph by removing the saturated edges fig 3 d demonstrates an example of generated enhanced river water extent the right side of the river reach is heavily contaminated in the raw water mask in a way that even the river path is not recognizable our algorithm can cope with this situation by incorporating spatial and temporal information here the data energy term increases the possibility of assigning a correct label according to the long term behavior of the pixel while the smoothness term allows preserving the river shoreline the comparison between the maps e and f in fig 3 shows how the algorithm enhances the river mask in case of inconsistency between the priors and the raw river mask for example a few pixels in box 2 of fig 3 e are wrongly labeled as no water in the raw river mask since the labels are not in an agreement with the spatial and temporal priors the algorithm changes their labels to water box 4 in fig 3 f moreover box 1 of fig 3 e contains some contaminated pixels in this case the algorithm relies on the temporal and spatial constraints to define their label fig 3 f 3 3 connectivity check to obtain accurate time series of river surface water extent maps the connectivity of obtained river masks along the river reach must be evaluated to this end two filters are designed to ensure the connectivity of the river mask and to remove the isolated pixels labeled as water the first filter analyzes whether all the river reach nodes connect through a path over the river the river mask will be discarded from the stack if the filter cannot find the path the raw river mask in fig 4 a was not excluded in the data preparation step because the level of contamination is less than 70 however due to the distribution of the contaminated pixels the river extraction algorithm could not retrieve the river reach properly therefore the enhanced river mask consists of several separated water bodies instead of a continuous river mask through the river centerline as a result this river mask is discarded from the time series the second filter is designed to eliminate all the pixels labeled as water without any connection to the main body of the river these pixels could be either separated water bodies like small rivers or lakes located in the region of interest or pixels that are wrongly labeled as water the raw river mask in fig 4 c includes several contaminated pixels moreover on the north side of the river many small water bodies and isolated pixels are labeled as water since these decoupled water bodies are inconsistent with the long term behavior of the river reach the proposed algorithm labeled them as no water however still a few separated water bodies are in the enhanced river mask red areas in fig 4 d these isolated pixels are detected and removed by the second filter 4 results and validation by applying the proposed algorithm time series of enhanced surface water extent maps are obtained these maps are a base for generating various outputs to explore specific temporal and spatial variation of the river reach extent fig 5 provides a comparison between the raw and enhanced river masks for river reach a30 in amazon river basin since this river reach is in the tropical region it has suffered from cloud coverage during the monitoring period as the rate of contamination pixels are extremely high in the raw river reaches the water area estimates from raw river masks would be drastically underestimated as the major part of the river reach is contaminated e g in fig 5 e h o after the year 2003 the slc off strips in landsat 7 images further increase the amount of contaminated pixels for example in reaches of fig 5 m n the accuracy of estimated water area from raw river masks would be reduced due to the both cloud contamination and also landsat 7 slc off strips the necessity of developing such a retrieving algorithm is highlighted by looking at the enhanced pixels labeled as water dark cyan and no water sienna the algorithm overcomes the pixel contamination successfully even in the challenging examples for example fig 5 e in the raw river various parts for the river shoreline are contaminated mask due to the spatial distribution of the clouds however the algorithm can successfully retrieve the river reach and it can preserve natural shape of the river shoreline by considering the spatial and temporal constraints another interesting example is fig 5 f which the southern part of the river reach is fully covered by the cloud in the raw river mask to enhance this river reach the algorithm just relies on the temporal behavior of the reach as the direct observations are not available since the probability functions are carefully designed the river shoreline is extracted accurately in most cases the proposed algorithm successfully copes with the issue of contaminated pixels however in less than 1 of cases a retrieve is not obtained due to a complex relationship of land and water and their spatio temporal behavior water frequency coverage maps in fig 6 present the temporal variation of the river reach over the monitoring period 1985 2020 the enhanced water occurrence map fig 6 a shows the frequency of water coverage for each pixel during the whole monitoring period fig 6 b i presents the monthly water frequency maps for the months with available enhanced river masks the focus of the enhanced frequency maps is on the river reach because the connectivity check has already filtered out all water bodies that are not connected to the river reach in this river reach the water recurrence maps for january february november and december are not generated because all images of these months were discarded from the stack due to high pixel contamination the monthly recurrence maps fig 6 b i show that the extent of the river reach varies not only over a year but also within a month such a significant temporal variation casts doubt on the validity of existing static river reach centerlines for representing river networks fig 7 presents a comparison between the static centerline from sword black and dynamic river centerlines white obtained by applying the rivamap algorithm isikdogan et al 2017 on the stack of enhanced river masks the time series in fig 7 a f are some examples of the change in river cross sectional width the cross sectional width of the river depends on the location of the river centerline and the flow direction of the river so assuming a fixed location for the nodes of the river sections leads to an incorrect estimate of the channel width to avoid this problem the cross section width is calculated for each river mask along its centerline then a time series of river width is generated for each sword node by considering the cross sectional width closest to the sword node since the sword centerline represents the river at the mean annual flow altenau et al 2021 the variation between the static and dynamic centerlines represents the dynamic of the river extent for example the middle part of this section of the river has minimal temporal variation so the time varying centerlines are almost on the static centerline on the other hand the time varying centerlines produce a large variation at the beginning of the section because the river shoreline in this part of the river has a strong dynamic we obtain time series of effective river width hereafter river width for each reach by dividing the obtained river surface area by the length of the reach time series of river width for the first 15 river reaches in the mrb introduced in fig 1 are presented in fig 8 the comparison between enhanced river width and discharge time series shows a general agreement as the obtained rank correlation coefficients vary between 0 52 and 0 86 in two examples fig 8 m3 m11 the river passes through the urban area and the water flow is regulated by dams along the river reaches big dam bridge on the arkansas river and locks and dam 3 on monongahela river as a result the scatterplot of river width and discharge measurements becomes wider and consequently the rank correlation coefficients are relatively low in the examples like fig 8 m1 m5 m8 m9 the simultaneous river width and discharge measurements present the monotonic relationship and therefore the rank correlation is relatively high in these examples this means that the river width measurements can project the dynamic of the river in all percentiles in river reaches like fig 8 m2 m6 m7 m13 the width discharge measurements are severely scattered in low discharge percentiles since the river reach is not wide enough to be extracted accurately from the landsat images in the river reaches like fig 8 m7 m14 in which the river is narrow even in the high discharge the points show a wide scatter in almost all the percentiles the accuracy of the raw river width time series highly depends on the spatial distribution of the contaminated pixels if the level of contamination is not so significant and the spatial distribution of contaminated pixels does not seriously corrupt the river reach extent the improvement in river reach enhancement is not substantial fig 8 m4 m14 m15 on average we observe an improvement of more than 20 in the obtained correlation coefficients see fig 8 red values refer to the raw data and black to our estimates in some examples like fig 8 m2 m6 m7 m10 with a high pixel contamination rate the correlation coefficients have improved from negative values to positive ones these results confirm the credibility of our methodology to obtain accurate dynamic river width from a pre existing global inland water data set fig 9 presents the scatterplots of average river width versus river discharge measurements for the rest of the examples in the mrb the rank correlation coefficient between two variables suggests that the proposed algorithm can capture the river extent like the previous examples on average the rank correlation coefficient for the mrb examples is 0 74 however in some examples like fig 9 m32 m33 the river width variations do not project the discharge variation properly as their scatterplots are wide and their rank correlation is lower than the average moreover in some examples like fig 9 m25 m29 m32 the scatterplots become wide because the range of the width variation is relatively small in comparison with the landsat pixel size for evaluating the performance of the algorithm in different regions the derived reach average river width estimates of amazon niger and po rivers have been compared to the gauged discharge measurements in appendix as the river reaches in amazon and niger river basins are relatively wider and their dynamics are less regulated the rank correlation coefficients between the river width and discharge are higher 0 85 for amazon and 0 88 for niger than those in the mrb the river reaches along the po river have the same situation as the mrb examples as they mostly flow through the cities and urban areas as a result their plots are relatively scattered with the average correlation coefficients is 0 77 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with existing algorithms this study presents an algorithm specifically developed to obtain the dynamic river surface water extent from an existing global inland water data set for the first time here we compare the components of the proposed algorithm to existing water body extraction methodologies in terms of 1 defining the region of interest 2 dealing with contaminated pixels 3 classification scheme 4 river connectivity checks 1 defining the region of interest restricting the region of interest to the area that only includes the water extent makes the algorithm much more computationally efficient this data preparation step is not considered in rivwidthcloud yang et al 2019 and rivamap isikdogan et al 2017 algorithms as they consider the whole image frame as input other studies have considered either a manual region of interest around the object busker et al 2019 or a constant buffer region around a static shapefile of the water body yao et al 2019 zhao and gao 2018 in our proposed method the buffer region is defined according to the mean and standard deviation of the river width obtained from sword as a result the designated search area only includes the essential pixels that may include the river extent since the temporal variability of the river extent is considered 2 dealing with contaminated pixels this is a crucial step in extracting the water extent from optical satellite images studies like zhao and gao 2018 schwatke et al 2019 suggest defining the label for each contaminated pixel by defining a threshold on the long term water occurrence map yao et al 2019 proposed to recover the contaminated shoreline through an efficient vector based interpolation in case of using the landsat images the rivwithcloud algorithm yang et al 2019 first flags the contaminated pixels using the fmask classification algorithm zhu et al 2015 if a pixel along the river cross section is flagged then its value is replaced to the mean value of the rest of the pixels in the same river cross section the proposed algorithm in this study has a different approach to deal with the contaminated pixels by rearranging the problem as a map based image restoration in which the prior knowledge obtained from the water coverage frequency map in this frame the contaminated pixels are considered as noise and the aim of the algorithm is to construct the denoised image without losing details like edges corners or blurring the water land border 3 water extraction scheme existing algorithms for detecting the water or mapping the lakes reservoirs and rivers only rely on the variation of spectral information of pixels for example schwatke et al 2019 yao et al 2019 first generate some multispectral water indexes and then obtain the water land boundary by applying a threshold the rivamap algorithm isikdogan et al 2017 generates the modified normalized difference water index mndwi from spectral bands of landsat and extracts curvilinear structure of rivers the rivwidthcloud algorithm yang et al 2019 can generate a river mask using two built in water classification algorithms 1 the water classification algorithm developed by zou et al 2018 this algorithm also generates a number of multispectral water indices and then defines the river extent by applying thresholds to them the threshold values are defined based on the training data gathered from the landsat images across the united states 2 the dynamic surface water extent dswe classification method jones 2019 this classification algorithm defines the water extents through a spectral mixture model which is developed by using a series of multispectral water and vegetation indices all the mentioned algorithms are considered as pixel based classification methods as they do not consider the spatial correlation between adjacent pixels in their procedure elmi et al 2016 compared the performance of pixel and region based classification algorithms in generating dynamic river masks their results presented that integrating the temporal and spatial information in addition to the spectral information is significantly improve the accuracy of obtained river masks in this study the raw river masks are obtained from the monthly water history maps of the gsw data set which are generated through a pixel based water classification algorithm the image restoration algorithm proposed in this study modifies the raw river masks by incorporating the spatial and temporal constraints as a result we can conclude that in order to define the enhanced river masks we benefit from all sources of information available in the image stack spectral spatial and temporal 4 river connectivity checks the proposed algorithm in this study further improves the quality of the obtained river extent maps by removing the isolated pixels which are not connected to the river reach moreover the connectivity of each river mask along the reach is also evaluated the rivwidthcloud yang et al 2019 algorithm also applies such filters to distinguish the river from non river water pixels by checking the connectivity of each pixel to the grwl river centerline moreover the rivwidthcloud algorithm removes the islands smaller than 0 3 km 2 in the river masks to reduce the complexity of the derived centerline yang et al 2019 the other related studies do not mention the availability of any connectivity check in their algorithms however it should be mentioned that in the case of extracting lakes and reservoirs applying such filters may not be necessary designing such a filter may cause erroneous river mask estimates in case of applying to the anabranching river reaches for example if an anabranch of a river cuts off from the river and creates an oxbow lake in its way the connectivity filter considers the lake as part of the river reach if it is connected to the main body of the river reach 5 2 limitations the inherent vulnerability to cloud coverage is the main obstacle for representing the dynamics of the river extent using satellite optical imagery in the case of using landsat 7 images the rate of contaminated pixels significantly increases due to the slc error in the proposed method to ensure the accuracy of the obtained river extents raw gsw river reach masks with more than 70 of contamination rate are excluded from the image stack this comes at the cost of degrading the temporal resolution where all measurements during january and december are discarded from the time series in all validation case studies fig 8 in the case studies located in a latitude higher than 40 fig 8 m10 m15 the number of available non contaminated observations significantly decreases during the fall and winter october march it is clear that by easing the rejection condition the number of discarded river reach masks may decrease however this increment of the temporal resolution comes with the decrement of the accuracy in extracting the river extent to recover the images with a high contamination rate the algorithm relies more on the long term behavior of the river extent as it is the only source of information in this situation as a result the enhanced river reach extent only explores the temporal average of the river reach boundaries by ignoring the fast variations fig 10 presents the percentage of available river extent estimates between 2000 2020 on average over the year fig 10 a and per season fig 10 b e globally for generating these maps the ratio between the contaminated pixels and the total number of pixels is evaluated for all river reaches the river reach masks are excluded from the image stack if the contamination rate of the restricted search area is more than 70 as a result if a river reach has a value around 50 in fig 10 a it means that more than 125 enhanced river masks are available between the years 2000 2020 the maps in fig 10 b e present the temporal distribution of available enhanced river masks per season these maps indicate that rarely any raw gsw river extent can pass through the preparation step in the northern hemisphere high and mid latitude region north america europa and north asia from september till february during summer and spring the number of river extent estimates increases significantly however this frequency of enhanced river extents may not be sufficient to characterize the river reach dynamics in this region the temporal resolution of enhanced river extents in the low latitudes region is significantly higher than the mid latitude region however in some critical regions like south america and africa the interval between two estimates enlarges from june till august the coarse temporal resolution of landsat based river extents can be relieved by obtaining river extent estimates from different missions e g sentinel 1 2 and modis in the cloud prone regions employing the sar images is a viable solution for generating dense river extent time series for example mengen et al 2020 mapped the temporal variation of inundation area of the mekong river using 318 senses of sentinel 1 a b between the years 2015 2018 to benefit from both optical and sar images some studies suggest a image fusion approach to increase the temporal resolution of obtained dynamic water masks for example druce et al 2021 presents an operational data fusion approach for integrating optical and sar images in their study their benefit from sentine 1 2 and landsat 8 imagery for mapping the dynamics of the inland water bodies in mainland china another limitation of the proposed algorithm is the absence of stochastic information for the obtained river extent estimates in general the uncertainty of any product derived from remote sensing observations could be characterized in case of having a comprehensive understanding of various sources of uncertainty including the sensor atmosphere target and the classification algorithm alternatively the uncertainty can be obtained by benefiting from the properties of the probabilistic bayesian framework to this end kohli and torr 2008 tarlow and adams 2012 proposed uncertainty derivation of the map solution by obtaining the min marginal energy of the graph the studies by elmi 2019 elmi et al 2021 showed that the kohli and torr method can estimate a realistic uncertainty for river width extracted from modis images however applying the kohli and torr technique on images with a finer spatial resolution comes with a huge computational cost alternatively papandreou and yuille 2011 introduced the perturb and map method to characterize the uncertainty of the posterior estimate in this technique a set of posterior estimates is obtained by maximizing the perturbed posterior functions then the marginal density and uncertainty of each node are defined by measuring the mean and standard deviation of obtained posterior estimates both aforementioned techniques can characterize the uncertainty of river reach area estimates in the case of using pixel intensity as input in our case since the gsw monthly water history maps just provide pixel label without any information about the uncertainty a proper uncertainty estimation is not possible applying the algorithm to the pixel values provides the opportunity to estimate a realistic uncertainty for the obtained labels by marginalizing the graph or applying the perturb and map method however it is important to note that applying the algorithm to the raw satellite images will increase the computational complexity of the algorithm and make the procedure of extracting the river reach time consuming 6 conclusion we present an algorithm for obtaining high quality river reach water extent time series from a pre existing global inland water data set the main asset of the proposed method is a region based image restoration algorithm to this end we define a probabilistic bayesian frame to retrieve the enhanced river reach masks by preserving the spatial and temporal constraints we employ our algorithm on the gsw monthly water history products pekel et al 2016 and benefited from river hydraulic parameters provided in the sword data altenau et al 2021 the performance of the algorithm is validated by comparing the obtained average river reach width time series and in situ discharge measurements over 98 river reaches in the mississippi 35 examples amazon 53 examples niger 6 examples and po 5 examples river basins the high rank correlation coefficient 0 85 in the basins with natural behavior and regular channels amazon and niger river basins shows that the obtained river masks can properly capture river dynamics the monotonic dependency between discharge and width weakens if the river channels have a rectangular shape which is quite often in the urban areas as a result the average correlation decreases to less than 0 74 in the mrb and 0 77 in the po river reaches our analysis highlights that cloud contamination is the main challenge for developing time series of river width with a fine temporal resolution when only satellite optical imagery is used fig 10 the proposed method facilitates the acquisition of an accurate global data set of the dynamic river width which can play a key role in a better estimation of river discharge the key to the successful performance of any river discharge estimation algorithm from river width discharge rating curve technique e g studies by pavelsky 2014 elmi et al 2015 tourian et al 2017 to the mcfli algorithms e g studies by hagemann et al 2017 feng et al 2019 is the availability of more prior knowledge gleason et al 2017 over gauged and semi gauged river basins the availability of river width time series can increase the temporal and spatial resolution of discharge estimates by benefiting from the legacy in situ discharge gleason and durand 2020 in ungauged river basins the river width time series plays a crucial role in the calibration of the discharge estimation model in the absence of any in situ measurements moreover having an accurate dynamic river width helps to obtain a better overview of the dynamics of the surface water that is essential for drawing any conclusion about the land ecosystem atmosphere interactions and freshwater availability credit authorship contribution statement omid elmi conceptualization methodology

thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions that helped us to improve the manuscript appendix validation case studies in other river basins in this section we evaluate the algorithm s performance in the amazon niger and po river basins by comparing the obtained reach average river width to in situ river discharge measurements fig 1 presents the river reaches and the location of the gauge stations which are selected as additional case studies additional information of river reaches and discharge gauges are provided in table a 3 amazon table a 4 niger and table a 5 po the scatterplots of river reaches along the amazon river and its tributaries are in fig a 11 a1 a52 amazon is the most complex river system in the world including river reaches with various types of meandering rivers and braided river systems to explore the potential of the proposed algorithm we have selected a range of river reaches which their average river width varies from a few meters to a few kilometers the high rank correlation between the average river width and river discharge 0 85 on average for all 52 river reaches presents that the proposed algorithm can successfully monitor the variation of reach average river width in 13 examples over the amazon basin the scatterplots show an almost perfect agreement between river discharge and width variations as the rank correlation between them is greater than 0 9 the correlation coefficient of 24 river reaches is between 0 8 and 0 9 in some examples like fig a 11 a20 a29 a40 a52 the variation of the average river width is less than the landsat pixel size 30m therefore the scatterplot gets wider especially in low and medium discharge percentiles the average river width versus river discharge measurements scatterplots of niger river reach examples are in fig a 11 n1 n6 in these examples the number of available simultaneous measurements is limited mainly because of the high rate of cloud contamination and also lack of river discharge measurements as most of the gauges stopped measuring discharge before 2010 the high correlation coefficient between average river width and river discharge shows that the algorithm can extract the river extent accurately in this river basin finally scatterplots in figs a 11 p1 p5 are the simultaneous river width and discharge measurements of the river reaches along the po river the average river width only varies a few tens of meters in fig a 11 p1 p4 and p5 examples as a result their scatterplots are relatively wide and noisy on the other hands the range of width variation in fig a 11 p2 p3 is about 0 5km as their scatterplot are narrow and their rank correlations are relatively high 
2427,the permafrost headwater catchments in the tibetan plateau tp have experienced extensive permafrost degradation which may cause major changes in riverine solutes however surface water hydrochemistry and its influencing factors in such catchments are poorly understood hydrochemistry data for different surface waters were obtained for the yakou catchment in the northeastern tp the results indicate that the ionic and organic concentrations of frozen soil seeps fss were higher on the north facing slope compared to the south facing slope and that fss may be involved in streamflow generation processes and in determining the spatial pattern of riverine solutes the north facing slope of the catchment has a thin active layer and wet moisture conditions compared to the south facing slope hence supra permafrost water with high ionic concentrations can drain to the ground surface as fss in the riparian zone and then recharge the surface ponding water and the main stream water the high ionic concentrations of the supra permafrost water and fss can be attributed to intense rock weathering and evaporative effect together with the high mobility of elements and the transport of organic matter the tributaries with low ionic concentrations comprise a mixture of infiltrating precipitation and diluted supra permafrost water carbonate weathering is the dominant weathering type within the catchment but the weathering of evaporite and silicate is more important on the north facing and south facing slopes respectively and chemical weathering on the north facing slope may be enhanced by strong physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles due to the wet conditions the results indicate that the surface water hydrochemistry is heterogeneous on the different hillslope units and that a thicker active layer under climate change may lead to a shift of hydrological and hydrochemical pathways and thus a decrease in water and solute flux from the hillslopes with underlying permafrost to the river channel keywords hydrochemistry stream water frozen soil seep surface ponding water permafrost catchments tibetan plateau data availability all the data used in this study can be accessed in the supplementary material 1 introduction permafrost is soil material that remains frozen for at least two years and it covers 24 of the terrestrial surface of the northern hemisphere and the permafrost area is 128 76 104 km2 in the tibetan plateau tp alone zhang et al 1999 ran et al 2018 permafrost catchments in the tp experience repeated interannual and intra annual freeze thaw cycles which affect catchment hydrological and hydrochemical processes wang et al 2016 deng et al 2017 in response to global climate change over the past five decades the tp has experienced a rate of temperature increase that is twice that observed globally and is as much as 0 3 0 4 c per decade chen et al 2015 yao et al 2015 yao et al 2019 permafrost degradation occurs under global warming with the associated deepening of the active layer and melting of near surface ground ice which may affect the ionic and organic concentration in surface waters in arctic regions moreover the increased interaction time between water flow and soil rock due to the rapid permafrost changes may lead to an increase in the contents of major ions nutrients and organic matter of the surface waters malone et al 2013 abbott et al 2015 spencer et al 2015 harms et al 2016 due to permafrost degradation the ionic concentrations in streams and lakes in permafrost regions may be increased by a factor of several tens kokelj et al 2005 roberts et al 2017 given the wide distribution of permafrost in the tp and global climate change studies on the surface water hydrochemistry under different permafrost conditions e g active layer thickness ground ice type and supra permafrost water may help predict future catchment hydrochemical regimes in permafrost headwater catchments much effort has been devoted to analyzing the hydrochemistry of permafrost related waters e g stream water ground ice and supra permafrost water in permafrost headwater catchments in the tp wang et al 2018a yu et al 2019 supra permafrost water is defined as the saturated water above the permafrost table with the permafrost layer serving as an aquitard as the base it is also called water in the seasonally thawed layer i e the active layer which is typically situated in between the frozen and thawed parts of the soil profile and may promote the runoff generation processes in the permafrost headwater catchments cheng and jin 2013 xiao et al 2020a b in addition the supra permafrost water may show high dissolved contents which may be related to the following reasons first the soil water in the surface layers will return to the atmosphere during evaporation while the solutes remain in the soil thus the soil water in the surface layers shows the gradual enrichment of solutes koch et al 2014 throckmorton et al 2016 second due to soil leaching and desalination effects during freeze thaw processes the soil pore water of the surface layers with high ionic concentrations may move to the deeper soil layers and become ground ice in the permafrost or supra permafrost water cheng 1983 wang et al 1996 wang et al 2018b third as clay is the main soil textural component along the permafrost underlain hillslope the long residence time of the soil water in the soil layers with high clay contents may have an enhanced positive effect of ions exchange or chemical weathering on the dissolved contents charfi et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 gao et al 2017 these factors may have led to the high solute concentrations of the supra permafrost water and the related surface waters and thus may play a very important role in the catchment hydrochemical regimes in permafrost headwater catchments it has been found that supra permafrost water and near surface ice meltwater may drain directly over the land surface as frozen soil seeps fss as shown in fig 1 d and the conceptual diagrams in cheng and jin 2013 and xiao et al 2020a fss is the seeps draining from the active layer especially at the junction of steep slopes and flat terrain and hence they are the primary sources of water and solutes to stream water and lakes owing to the absence of groundwater discharge in permafrost regions bosson et al 2013 li et al 2016 gao et al 2017 however the thermal perturbation of permafrost conditions and disturbed terrain due to the accelerating permafrost degradation may modify the hydrological and hydrochemical regimes in permafrost headwater catchments luo et al 2019 mu et al 2020 ci et al 2020 the subsidence pit is a type of disturbed terrain caused by permafrost change as shown in fig 1e such as the loss of water and soil ice and is widely distributed in the lower valleys and riparian zone of permafrost catchments in the tp these subsidence pits usually have a diameter of a few meters and a depth of some tens of centimeters while surface ponding water spw caused by physical changes associated with the repeating freeze thaw cycles is common within them jones et al 2011 liljedahl et al 2016 lafrenière and lamoureux 2019 however based on what we know so far few studies have focused on the hydrochemistry of the fss and spw in subsidence pits and the spatial variations of surface water hydrochemistry in the tp stream water is usually regarded as a natural integrator of catchment hydrochemical processes ollivier et al 2010 das et al 2016 donnini et al 2016 most studies focusing on stream water hydrochemistry have simplified the weathering processes and assumed that the catchment geology and soil chemistry are homogeneous and then estimated catchment chemical weathering rates based on ionic concentrations usually calculated as the sum of the ionic mass of stream water at the catchment outlet asano et al 2009 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however in reality permafrost catchment attributes such as active layer thickness vegetation cover topography and soil texture are usually spatially heterogeneous first the stream water hydrochemistry may change as a result of recharge by different hillslope units or be controlled by hotspots such as groundwater or soil seeps zimmer et al 2013 peralta tapia et al 2015a lintern et al 2018 sullivan et al 2019 second several studies have shown that the groundwater or soil seeps flow may have different flow paths especially in permafrost regions that exhibit seasonal changes in the major flow pathway with changes in the depth of the frozen front xiao et al 2020a moreover dissolved organic carbon doc exports to surface runoff are mostly driven by the unfrozen zones during permafrost thawing and doc is regarded as the major carrier of major elements in permafrost influenced organic rich surface waters kodama and schnitzer 1980 pokrovsky et al 2016a pokrovsky et al 2016b raudina et al 2018 ji et al 2021 for example the transfer of geochemical compositions from arctic soils to surface water was found to be related to freezing processes from surface to deep soil layers which may be due to plant activity involved in the leaching of moss litter and release of micronutrients ji et al 2021 and ions such as ca2 and mg2 are usually present as an organic complex in soil solutions leckie 1986 therefore the permafrost thawing will result in different ionic or organic concentrations because of the interactions between water flow and soil or rock at different depths thereby leading to distinct spatial patterns of riverine solutes on the catchment scale peralta tapia et al 2015b tetzlaff et al 2015 exner kittridge et al 2016 xiao et al 2020c however the influences of permafrost conditions on the spatial pattern of surface water hydrochemistry remain unclear and the factors controlling recharge from frozen soil water to stream water need to be determined therefore finer scale sampling of different surface water types e g stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss is needed to better understand the hydrochemical regimes within permafrost headwater catchments based on the above existing understanding and unsolved problems the aims of the study were 1 to identify the hydrochemistry characteristics and spatial patterns of the different surface water types 2 to reveal the provenance of dissolved solutes in different surface water types 3 and to reveal the potential factors that influencing hydrochemical regimes in different hillslope units information on major ionic concentrations has been widely used in studies focusing on the hydrochemistry of different water types because the ratios of major ions can help identify the rocks involved in chemical weathering and provide qualitative and quantitative information about the formation and evolution of different water types and the factors controlling these processes gaillardet et al 1999 das et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore various surface water samples were obtained at a relatively high density in the yakou catchment which is a permafrost headwater catchment in the northeastern tp and their dissolved ionic and organic concentrations were measured 2 site description the study was conducted in the yakou catchment 100 15 100 16 e 38 00 38 01 n a permafrost headwater catchment with an area of 1 4 km2 located in the middle segment of the qilian mountain in the northeastern tp fig 1 the elevation range of the yakou catchment is 3 900 4 300 m a s l and the average elevation is 4 050 m a s l the climate of the study area is continental and the annual average temperature is around 4 7 c the average annual precipitation is 405 mm with the majority 84 falling from may to september the monthly average air temperature is 0 c from june to september as shown by xiao et al 2020a the yakou catchment has a relatively small water volume as streamflow discharge at the outlet was usually 0 1 m3 s and may increase to above 1 0 m3 s during heavy snowmelt and rainfall events the long hillslopes in the yakou catchment can be divided into four segments the slope top upper slope middle slope and the riparian zone with respective average gradients of 7 20 12 and 7 xiao et al 2020b the slope top and riparian zone have relatively flat terrain and the slope gradient gradually decreases from the upper slope to the riparian zone the soil thickness is strongly heterogeneous with the upper slopes having thinner soils e g the slope top has a soil layer 1 m thick whereas the lower slopes have thicker soils e g the riparian zone has a soil layer 2 m thick because of differences in snow cover and topography between hillslope positions and hillslope units the thickness of the active layer is spatially heterogeneous the yakou catchment is dominated by permafrost and the maximum thickness of the active layer on the north facing slope varies from 100 cm in the riparian zone to 160 cm at the slope top xiao et al 2020a b moreover as shown by satellite imagery during the winter dry period fig 1b the areas to the west and south of the main stem which is dominated by a north facing slope had a higher snow cover compared to the areas to the east and north of the main stem which is dominated by a south facing slope and thus was more recharged by snowmelt input during the spring snowmelt period moreover the south facing slope may have a stronger solar radiation receipt than the north facing slope due to its orientation fig 1b these two factors lead to drier soil moisture conditions and a lower vegetation cover on the south facing slope compared to the north facing slope as shown by the drone aerial photo in fig 1c permafrost has more stable thermodynamic characteristics under humid soil moisture conditions cheng and jin 2013 xiao et al 2020c and therefore dry soil moisture conditions may lead to an earlier initial thawing time and a thicker active layer on the south facing slope the major soil types at the slope top and upper slope are cryogenic cambisols and mat cryic cambisols with organic cryic gleysols in the middle slope and riparian zone respectively based on field observations the soil of the yakou catchment is mainly fine grained with 85 silty sand and clay and the proportions of clay at each hillslope position and soil depth are generally 65 except in the 0 10 cm soil layer in the riparian zone which has a higher silt sand content 31 85 thus clay is the main soil textural component in the yakou catchment xiao et al 2020b the vegetation coverage of the slope top upper slope middle slope and riparian zone is around 30 60 90 and 98 respectively based on field observations xiao et al 2020b the main land cover types of the slope top and upper slope are alpine deserts and alpine meadow with alpine swamp meadow in the middle slope and riparian zone respectively the dominant plant species along the hillslope are rhodiola tangutica carex moorcroftii and kobresia humilis alpine meadow and alpine swamp meadow soils are usually characterized by a higher soil organic matter content a finer soil structure and denser root biomass compared to the alpine steppe soil thereby leading to a lower soil water permeability and higher soil water retention capacity wang et al 2018a niu et al 2019 more details about the distribution of the soil and vegetation types are given in xiao et al 2020b surveys of the geological background of the area such as the fault system tectonic division and mineralogy of the qilian mountains reveal the following the yakou catchment is located on the middle qilian uplift belt sand the catchment is dominated by an upper ordovician stratum ol the bedrock mainly comprises neutral volcanic rocks volcanic breccia tuff and clastic rocks and siliceous rocks are therefore dominant in the study area wei 1978 feng 1997 wang et al 2011 subsurface sulfate bearing evaporates in the qilian mountain area likely associated with paleogene metasediments fang et al 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sampling high density spatial sampling of the main stream tributary spw in a subsidence pit and fss was conducted on july 15 2021 and the sampling sites are shown in fig 1a the methods used are summarized below stream water sampling stream water samples were collected from the main stream and tributary of the yakou catchment the stream water samples were sampled every 100 m along with the main stream network and four samples were collected from each of the four tributaries fig 1a 13 samples were collected from the main stream and 16 from the tributary a hydrophilic membrane filter millipore with a pore size of 0 45 μm was used to filter the samples during sampling to prevent mineral dissolution the filtered water samples were stored in three 15 ml polyethylene pe bottles two of which were used for the measurement of solutes and the other was a standby sterile rubber gloves were worn when collecting the water samples and transferring them to the pe bottles the pe bottles were rinsed in ultrapure water and dried before use to prevent contamination of the samples by the material inside the bottles and the bottles were rinsed 2 3 times with the water to be sampled before the actual samples were taken according to the conventions of previous studies e g yu et al 2019 the other 15 ml pe bottles containing water samples were acidified to ph 2 with three drops of ultrapure hno3 to prevent algal growth and carbonate precipitation spw in subsidence pits and fss sampling subsidence pits are widely distributed in the yakou catchment fig 1c and e the size of the subsidence pits in the yakou catchment varies from 1 m2 to 10 m2 and the depth of subsidence pits is usually from 10 to 40 cm while the spw depth may vary substantially under metrological and hydrological forcing fig 1e most of the subsidence pits are located on the north facing slope which has a relatively thin active layer due to the strong physical disturbance of the freezing thaw processes most of the spw and fss samples on the south facing slope were collected in the riparian zone fig 1b and the relatively thick snow cover and humid soil moisture conditions accompanied by the relatively low elevations and flat terrain facilitated the generation of subsidence pits and fss in this slope position fss usually occur in the flat terrain at the base of steep hillslopes and they recharge the stream water as surface runoff that is the return flow occurs because of the sudden drop in the terrain as shown in fig 1c and d fss occurs continuously after the thawing of the surface soil layer under the recharge of precipitation input and frozen soil meltwater the fss has a relatively low temperature due to the water supply from the frozen soil layer samples of spw and fss were collected in the yakou catchment at a relatively high spatial resolution fig 1a and b the sampling and treatment methods used for spw and fss were the same as for the stream water and a total of 18 fss samples including 14 on the north facing slope and 4 on the south facing slope and 17 spw samples including 11 on the north facing slope and 6 on the south facing slope were collected on july 15 2021 precipitation sampling precipitation samples collected in july 2017 were used to correct the solute contents in stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss from atmospheric input precipitation samples were collected from flat open unsheltered areas with no signs of external interference around the yakou ams all precipitation samples were collected in standard pe bags 70 cm 67 cm the standard pe bags were vacuumed before use to avoid external interference and to eliminate external contamination in the transportation processes before using the standard pe bags to collect the precipitation samples several of them were rinsed with a small amount of distilled water and the major cation and anion concentrations of this rinse were found to be lower than the detection limit of the instrumentation this confirmed that the precipitation samples were not affected by any solutes from the standard pe bags which ensured the quality of these samples during persistent rainfall events the bag was folded into a rounded shape and placed in a plastic bucket using rubber gloves after the rainfall ceased the bag was immediately retrieved and the collected rainfall was poured into pe bottles the samples were stored at 0 c and transported to the laboratory for analysis a total of 13 precipitation samples were collected in july 2017 3 2 sample analysis the electrical conductivity ec of different water types was measured with a water quality monitor hanna h198119 during sampling since the ec values of these samples were high the main stream water spw and fss samples were diluted five times with ultrapure water before testing for the concentrations of major ions this is standard practice as the samples with high ec usually have high ionic concentrations compared to the ionic concentrations of standard samples and the analytical error may be high if these samples are not diluted the tributary and precipitation samples were tested directly due to the low ec values of these water types major cations ca2 mg2 k and na together with si in the acidified samples were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes with a detection limit of 0 001 mg l major anions cl no3 and so4 2 in the non acidified filtered samples were measured by ion chromatography ic 900 dionex with a detection limit of 0 01 mg l the analytical error was 5 as indicated by repeated measurements of standards of known concentration doc measurements of the acidified filtered samples were conducted using a total carbon analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan 3 3 statistical analyses the statistical differences among the water types were analyzed by one way anova with a significance level of p 0 05 analysis of variance and the significant differences among the different water types are indicated by the different letters hco3 concentrations were calculated via the cation anion charge balance while the total dissolved solids tds were calculated as the sum of the concentrations of the major cations and anions k na ca2 mg2 sio2 cl no3 so4 2 alkalinity yu et al 2019 the ordinate of the gibbs plot can be used to identify solute sources that is atmospheric precipitation rock weathering or evaporative crystallization gibbs 1970 the chemical composition of low salinity water is mainly supplied by precipitation which is mainly located in the lower left corner of the gibbs plot that of medium salinity water mainly comes from rock weathering and with increased evaporation the concentration of ions continuously increases when the concentrations of ca2 hco3 and other ions reach the solubility product of calcium carbonate and other mineral components that is the minerals precipitated out from the water and the control of the water hydrochemistry is shifted from the weathering of the rocks to evaporative crystallization and gradually approaches high salt and high sodium concentrations in the upper right corner of the gibbs plot the na mixing plot which shows the molar ratios of ca2 na and mg2 na in the water samples after precipitation correction represented by the superscript x can be used to identify the chemical weathering sources such as the carbonate silicate and evaporites end members gaillardet et al 1999 goldsmith et al 2010 the cl content from atmospheric input was assumed to be equal to the cl concentration of the stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss samples and the contribution of each cation was equal to the dissolved cation in precipitation and the molar ratio of cl multiplied by the riverine cl content from rainfall grosbois et al 2000 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 specifically the corrected ca2 mg2 and na concentrations derived from precipitation were calculated from x x cl clref where x cl and clref were the measured ions cl concentration and reference cl concentration in precipitation clref is calculated by multiplying the weighted average cl content of precipitation by the concentration factor f which is calculated by precipitation amount and runoff volume in the same period that is f p r 4 results 4 1 hydrochemistry of stream water frozen soil seeps and surface ponding water in subsidence pits the average tds doc and major ionic concentrations measured for the different water types are presented in table 1 and fig 2 the measured ec and calculated tds had an overall similar relationship with tdscalculated 0 756 ecmeasured and r2 0 93 which is close to the relationship between the measured ec and tds 0 75 obtained by the water quality monitor supporting the data quality of the measured major ions and the calculation methods of the hco3 concentrations and the tds values however there is a certain amount of doc in the different water types for example the average doc concentrations of the main stream water tributaries spw on the north facing slope spw on the south facing slope fss on the north facing slope and fss on the south facing slope were 2 6 1 4 5 5 2 3 5 3 and 1 5 mg l respectively table 1 and fig 2 this indicates that alkalinity is not the only missing anion because cations may bind with organic acids which can be attributed to the high levels of doc or other dissolved organic matter in the organic soils in the middle slope and riparian zone it was found that the hco3 concentrations in the south tibetan plateau streamflow obtained by charge balance were 10 higher than the values measured in situ when the doc contents were low qu et al 2017 yu et al 2021 in this study the low doc concentrations of the stream water and spw and fss on the south facing slope table 1 and fig 2 indicate the similar impacts of doc or other dissolved organic matter on the calculated alkalinity but the over estimated alkalinity in the samples collected from the fss and spw on the north facing slope may exceed 10 due to the relatively high doc contents of these water types therefore the hco3 in the different water types is not used in the following discussion in the hydrochemical classification of a large number of samples percentages of cations and anions are usually plotted in a piper diagram to show the properties of the different water types fig 3 the major cationic concentrations in the precipitation are ordered as ca2 na k mg2 with ca2 and na dominating and accounting for 72 of total cations table 1 and fig 3 the precipitation had low ionic concentrations with the k concentrations of partial precipitation samples being below the detection limit table s1 the major cation concentrations of the main stream water are ordered as ca2 mg2 na k with ca2 contributing over 70 of the total cations table 1 and fig 3 for the tributaries the major cationic concentrations are ordered as ca2 na mg2 k ca2 mg2 and na contribute 65 15 and 18 of total cations respectively table 1 and fig 3 the tds of the main stream water and tributaries have respective ranges of 71 1043 mg l and 31 88 mg l with corresponding averages of 418 and 58 mg l 1 for the main stream water and tributaries respectively these values are respectively 6 4 and 0 9 times the global median of 65 mg l gaillardet et al 1999 the major ionic concentrations and hydrochemical types of the spw and fss on the north facing slope are like those of the main stream water while those of the spw and fss on the south facing slope are close to those of the tributaries table 1 and fig 2 for example ca2 and mg2 contributed 55 and 35 of total cations in the spw and fss on the north facing slope respectively with ca2 dominating contributing 66 and 18 of total cations in the spw and fss on the south facing slope table 1 and fig 3 the tds and ionic concentrations are low for spw and fss on the south facing slope and tributaries for example the average tds values of tributaries spw on the south facing slope and fss on the south facing slope are 58 91 and 93 mg l respectively these values are much lower than the average tds of the main stream water and spw and fss on the south facing slope which has averages of 418 480 and 926 mg l respectively table 1 tds doc and the high concentration ions i e ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the tributaries and the spw and fss on the south facing slope are significantly lower p 0 05 than those of the main stream water and spw and fss on the north facing slope and the ions with low concentrations i e k na cl and no3 did not show significant differences p 0 05 between the main stream water and tributaries or between the surface waters sampled on the different hillslope units fig 2 the reasons for this may be related to different chemical weathering processes on the different hillslope units which results in differing chemical weathering products and hence in differences in the hydrochemistry of the various water types as follows first the fraction of the na and sio2 contents in the tributary stream water is 13 and higher than the values in the main stream water table 1 which is 3 in the piper plot fig 3 the samples from the tributary to the main stream shift from the na and k corner to the mg2 and ca2 corner second the so4 2 content of the main stream water is much higher than in the tributary table 1 these observations indicate the occurrence of stronger weathering of na and si containing silicates on the south facing slope than on the north facing slope and that the high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the main stream water may be related to the weathering of more calcite dolomite and gypsum in this study area the alpine meadow and alpine swamp meadow all have a surface organic layer ao with a thickness of 15 30 cm this surface sod layer has a high root density and high organic matter content because the deeper layers are frozen for most of the year additionally results show the high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and doc in the fss and spw on the north facing slope and the main stream water table 1 and fig 2 and the strong power law relationship between ca2 and doc fig 4 a and between mg2 and doc fig 4b these lead to the high mobility of elements and the translocation of organic matter from the surface organic rich layers to the deeper soil layers and the supra permafrost water and then to the spw and stream water therefore the large flux of doc from the surrounding permafrost soils and supra permafrost water to the adjacent hydrological systems may facilitate the transport of major elements 4 2 spatial variations of the hydrochemistry of stream water frozen soil seeps and surface ponding water in subsidence pits the spatial patterns of tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the stream water fss and spw in subsidence pits are shown in fig 5 the reasons for showing the distributions of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are related to the high fractions of ca2 and mg2 among the total cations 80 for the different water types and the high so4 2 concentrations in different water types table 1 and fig 3 there are large spatial variations in tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the different water types and on the different hillslope units figs 2 and 3 first high values of tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are typical of the upper main stream sites and spw and fss on the north facing slope for example the tds values at the main stream sites decrease from 1043 mg l at the highest site to 546 mg l at the main stream site before the confluences of the tributaries table s1 sampling site nos from 9 to 13 in table s1 and the tds values of the spw and fss on the north facing slope have averages of 480 and 926 mg l respectively table 1 the high and large variation of the tds values in the main stream water indicated that the fss may determine the spatial patterns of stream water hydrochemistry like hotspots second the tributaries show almost no gradients in tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 and the tributaries show uniform and low values compared with the main stream water for example the tds values of the tributaries have the range of 31 88 mg l the ca2 concentrations have a range of 6 17 mg l and mg2 and so4 2 have the ranges of 1 3 mg l and 2 7 mg l respectively fig 5 and table s1 third the tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the main stream sites below the confluences of the tributaries are lower than the values of the upper main stream sites for example the tds values of the main stream sites after the tributary confluences have the range of 71 238 mg l and the ranges of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are 14 47 mg l 2 15 mg l and 2 93 mg l respectively fig 5 and table s1 sample nos 1 to 8 in table s1 the low tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the main stream sites below the confluences of the tributaries may be due to dilution by the tributary inputs which have relatively low tds and ionic concentrations table 1 and fig 5 and the upper main stream water may be 8 times diluted from 546 mg l table s1 sample no 9 to 71 mg l table s1 sample no 8 before and after the confluences of the tributaries respectively therefore due to the downstream dilution in yakou stream water average values of tds doc and most of the ionic concentrations of the main stream samples are lower than those of spw and fss on the north facing slope table 1 figs 2 and 5 these results indicate that the hydrochemistry of the surface waters is heterogeneous within the permafrost headwater catchment with differences evident between the main stream sites and the tributaries and between different hillslope units fss may be involved in streamflow generation processes thus influencing the riverine solutes for example the high tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 values of the main stream sites above the confluences of the tributaries may reflect the influence of the adjacent fss sites as the fss adjacent to the main stream sites have relatively high values fig 5 and table s1 also the tds values and ionic concentrations of the tributaries and the adjacent spw and fss have similar low values table 1 figs 2 and 5 suggesting they are influenced by similar chemical weathering processes 5 discussion 5 1 provenance of solutes in different water types the gibbs plot of the main stream water tributaries spw in subsidence pits and fss is shown in fig 6 and four main observations can be made first the distribution of precipitation in the study area is scattered and mostly concentrated in the lower middle of the gibbs plot with low tds values and the concentration ratio of na na ca2 varied between 0 1 and 1 0 indicating the solute sources from atmospheric precipitation and rock weathering such as the remote marine sources and the atmospheric dust from rock weathering second the distributions for main stream water are concentrated in the center of the plot with the tds values within the range of 71 1043 mg l and the concentration ratios of na na ca2 within the range of 0 0 2 these values indicate that the main stream water is influenced mainly by rock weathering third the tributaries have lower tds values and high na na ca2 values compared to the main stream water and they are distributed between the rock weathering and precipitation zones this indicates that although the tributaries are also influenced by rock weathering they are more influenced by the input of precipitation than the main stream water moreover in the gibbs plot the distributions of spw and fss on the south facing slope are close to those of the tributaries indicating that these water types have similar solute sources fourth spw and fss on the north facing slope have higher tds values than for the other water types and low values of na na ca2 they are distributed between the rock weathering and evaporation crystallization zones indicating the strong influences of evaporation on the spw and fss on the north facing slope overall it can be qualitatively concluded that the hydrochemistry of all the surface waters was dominated by rock weathering however the higher ionic concentrations of spw and fss on the north facing slope may be attributed to the stronger influences of rock weathering and evaporation processes while the relatively low ionic concentrations of spw and fss on the north facing slope may indicate the stronger influences of precipitation input most of the water samples collected from the yakou catchment fall among the end members of carbonate silicate and evaporate in the na mixing plot suggesting that the chemical weathering products of these three rock types are important sources for stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss fig 7 the chemical weathering of silicates appear to be more important in the tributaries and spw and fss on the south facing slope because of the proximity of these samples to the silicate end member moreover the sample distributions for main stream water and spw and fss on the north facing slope are very close to the carbonate end member suggesting contributions from carbonate rock to these water types such as from the dissolution of calcite and dolomite which are common in the basin additionally the distribution of the stream water samples is close to that of the adjacent spw and fss samples in the na mixing plot indicating similar sources for stream water and the adjacent spw and fss for carbonate dissolution with carbonic acid and sulfuric acid e g produced by sulfide oxidation the reactions mainly follow 1 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 h 2 c o 3 x c a 2

or evaporite can be depicted by ionic molar ratios after precipitation correction as indicated by yu et al 2019 and colombo et al 2019 the total cationic charge tz was calculated as the sum of cations na k 2ca2 2 mg2 in μmolc l and μmolc l denotes micromoles of charges and can be used to identify the chemical weathering types that is if carbonic acid is involved in carbonate weathering the theoretically equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 so4 2 and tz so4 2 would be positive infinity and the values of these ratios would be 2 0 and 1 0 for the reactions with sulfuric acids involved in carbonate weathering and dissolution of the evaporite if carbonic acid is involved in silicate weathering tz so4 2 would be positive infinity and the value would be 1 0 for the reactions with sulfuric acids involved in the silicate weathering in this study the ca2 mg2 so4 2 and tz so4 2 values of the tributaries and the spw and fss on the south facing slope are close to positive infinity fig 8 a and b the inset panel the high ca2 mg2 so4 2 and tz so4 2 values indicate very low so4 2 concentrations in these water types fig 8a and b the inset panel overall these observations suggest that carbonate and silicate weathering with carbonic acid are the dominant chemical weathering type on the south facing slope the main stream water and the spw and fss on the north facing slope have significantly p 0 05 higher ionic concentrations and distinctive distributions compared to the tributaries and spw and fss on the south facing slope table 1 figs 2 and 8 several points can be made first the main stream water and the spw and fss on the north facing slope are mainly distributed between the 2 1 line and 1 1 line in the ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 plot fig 8a and the tz versus so4 2 plot fig 8b also the relationship between the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 is close for the main stream water and spw and fss on the north facing slope fig 8a the r2 values of the linear fits for these three water types are 0 99 0 95 and 0 97 respectively with p 0 01 this indicates that the north facing slope is dominated by coupled carbonate and sulfide or evaporite weathering and that caso4 and mgso4 are the dominant products of the reactions which is supported by the domination of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the total cation solutes in these water types table 1 most samples of the main stream water and the spw and fss on the north facing slope are neutral to basic with ph values ranging from 7 1 to 9 5 with an average of 8 1 table s1 in addition as demonstrated by fang et al 2019 subsurface gypsum deposits are widely distributed in the qilian mountain area probably associated with paleogene metasediments which therefore supports this alternative assumption therefore it is more reasonable to assume that most of the riverine so4 2 is derived from the dissolution of evaporite rather than being the product of the dissolution of sulfide minerals riverine cl is usually derived mainly from atmospheric inputs and the dissolution of evaporites such as halite galy and france lanord 1999 the correlations between cl and so4 2 in different water types are weak the r2 values for the linear correlations for the main stream water tributaries spw in subsidence pits and fss are 0 03 0 24 0 05 and 0 03 respectively also the ionic ratios of the samples indicate a contribution from silicate weathering fig 7 these observations support the conclusion that the riverine cl mainly originates from atmospheric inputs and na mainly derived from silicate weathering e g albite or plagioclase rather than being the product of halite dissolution 5 2 potential factors influencing hydrochemical regimes in different hillslope units as discussed above there are strong heterogeneous hydrochemical regimes within the yakou catchment especially for the different hillslope units that is between the north facing slope and the south facing slope the reasons for these differences may be related to permafrost conditions and the effects on hydrological and hydrochemical regimes as demonstrated before because of differences in snow cover and topography between hillslope units the north facing slope had wetter soil moisture conditions and higher vegetation cover than the south facing slope and varying permafrost conditions such as active layer thickness leading to distinct hydrological and hydrochemical regimes in the different hillslope units as illustrated in the conceptual diagrams fig 9 for the north facing slope the thin active layer may lead to a shallower flow pathway and the water levels of spw in subsidence pits were maintained by the underlying frozen soil and the input of precipitation as shown by xiao et al 2020a b during intense precipitation events the spw and fss could be pressurized to recharge stream water leading to a higher water flux from the supra permafrost water with high ionic concentrations to the surface waters i e the spw and the main stream water fig 9a for the south facing slope the thick active layer may have high permeability leading to the greater leaching of soil solutes from the surface soil to the soil near the permafrost table cheng and jin 2013 huang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b this would cause a decrease in the water contents and ionic concentrations in the surface soil layers and the spw fig 9b additionally the tributaries may be recharged mainly by shallow subsurface runoff as a result of precipitation input and increases in the supra permafrost water level in the shallow soil layers that is the rapid subsurface runoff in the highly transmissive soil layer could convert a large amount of water to streamflow xiao et al 2020c therefore the tributaries with low ionic concentrations are a mixture of infiltrating precipitation and diluted supra permafrost water fig 9b the tributary samples are mainly distributed in lower positions within the gibbs diagram fig 6 supporting the stronger influence of a precipitation input against the background of the generally similar mineral composition within the catchment the different chemical weathering types in the different hillslope units may also be related to the spatial heterogeneity of physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles the wetter soil moisture conditions promote the chemical weathering on the north facing slope which may be enhanced by the weathering of highly weatherable minerals produced by repeated freeze thaw cycles ji et al 2021 steingruber et al 2021 that is the humid soil moisture status of the north facing slope leads to stronger physical disturbance of the underlying bedrock for the north facing slope the main stream water spw and fss are close to the carbonate weathering end member in the na mixing plot fig 7 which also indicates a contribution from evaporites such as gypsum fig 8 this may be because carbonates and evaporites dissolve at a rate several orders of magnitude greater than that of silicates and even small amounts of calcite in stratum can dominate the fluxes of ca2 in streamflow chamberlain et al 2005 fan et al 2014 sun et al 2019 for example the trace quantities 0 7 of sulfides and carbonates found in silicate bedrock dissolve five times more carbonate than silicate tranter et al 2002 therefore although siliceous rocks are dominant in the yakou catchment the dissolution of carbonates is the most important form of chemical weathering on the north facing slope fig 7 also more carbonic acid may be produced by the higher vegetation coverage on the north facing slope compared to the south facing slope which would increase the chemical weathering intensity on the former therefore the longer residence time rock water interactions and the abundance of freshly exposed mineral surfaces caused by physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles can increase the overall weathering rate and riverine solute concentrations these results are consistent with the finding that more ice and cryoturbation existing in polygon rim and buried talik would lead to more unfrozen water and cause elements to move to the surrounding surface water and stream networks ji et al 2021 the insights gained in this study may be generally applicable to the tp and wider permafrost regions because the landscapes of the yakou catchment e g alpine meadow alpine swamp meadow subsidence pits and fss are widely distributed in other permafrost headwater catchments in this region however our findings differ from those of studies in arctic regions which indicate increases in ionic concentrations in surface waters associated with the deepening of the active layer and the melting of near surface ground ice e g malone et al 2013 abbott et al 2015 roberts et al 2017 these differences may be due to the complex runoff generation processes on the hillslope in the mountainous headwater catchments therefore further long term investigations of the temporal variations of different surface water types are needed and measurements of ionic and organic concentrations in soil water and ground ice should be conducted in different hillslope units and hillslope positions moreover it is important to identify mineralogy by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf x ray diffraction xrd and microscopy in future studies this may increase our understanding based on water chemical data and further characterize the potential factors controlling multiple riverine dissolved fluxes such investigations may lead to an improved understanding of the effects of climatic warming on surface water hydrochemistry and solute transport pathways in permafrost headwater catchments and further enable us to characterize the factors dominating catchment hydrochemical regimes 6 conclusions the hydrochemistry of different surface water types was studied in the yakou catchment in the northeastern tp a headwater catchment underlain by permafrost the results showed that the surface water hydrochemistry is spatially heterogeneous within the yakou catchment especially in different hillslope units that is the north facing and south facing slopes the principal findings are as follows 1 the tds and ionic concentrations were higher in the main stream water compared to the tributaries and the main stream sites were influenced by the adjacent supra permafrost water i e the supra permafrost with high ionic concentrations the average tds value of the tributaries was low and close to those of the spw and fss on the south facing slope with low ionic concentrations and the main stream water may be 8 times diluted after the confluences of the tributaries 2 the higher ionic concentrations of the supra permafrost water and fss on the north facing compared to those on the south facing slope can be attributed to the stronger rock weathering and evaporation effect moreover the transport of organic matter may carry the highly mobile ions from surrounding permafrost soils and supra permafrost water to the adjacent hydrological systems and promote the transport of major elements 3 the north facing slope has a thin active layer and a wet moisture status and the fss with high ionic concentrations may drain to the ground surface in the riparian zone and recharge the spw and main stream water for the south facing slope with a thick active layer a shallow subsurface runoff was the major flow pathway and therefore the tributaries are a mixture of infiltrating precipitation and diluted supra permafrost water and export a lower solute flux to the river channel 4 carbonate and evaporite weathering are the dominant weathering types on the north facing slope which may be enhanced by the strong physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles which are more intense with wetter moisture condition and better vegetation cover compared with the south facing slope for the tributaries and spw and fss on the south facing slope carbonate and silicate weathering are dominated by carbonic acid in this study we have for the first time systematically investigated the hydrochemistry of surface water types with a relatively high spatial density in a permafrost headwater catchment the results emphasize the important role of topography e g hillslope aspect and permafrost conditions e g active layer thickness and physical erosion during freeze thaw cycles in controlling catchment hydrochemical regimes in particular the hillslope aspect may have indirect influences on catchment hydrochemical regimes by directly influencing soil moisture soil temperature vegetation cover and the resulting permafrost conditions we have also shown that spw and fss may be involved in streamflow generation processes and hence they may determine the spatial patterns of stream water hydrochemistry like hotspots the spatially variable water hydrochemistry shown by this study can shed light on potentially changing hydrological pathways of solutes under climate change scenarios as permafrost degradation may not only decrease the water flux from the permafrost hillslope to the river channel but also decrease the dissolved fluxes from spw and fss with high ionic and organic concentrations due to decreases in water flux and physical and chemical weathering intensity finally further long term investigations of the hydrochemistry of surface waters soil water and ground ice and the identification of the mineralogy in the different hillslope units are needed to fully determine the influencing processes credit authorship contribution statement xiong xiao data

2427,the permafrost headwater catchments in the tibetan plateau tp have experienced extensive permafrost degradation which may cause major changes in riverine solutes however surface water hydrochemistry and its influencing factors in such catchments are poorly understood hydrochemistry data for different surface waters were obtained for the yakou catchment in the northeastern tp the results indicate that the ionic and organic concentrations of frozen soil seeps fss were higher on the north facing slope compared to the south facing slope and that fss may be involved in streamflow generation processes and in determining the spatial pattern of riverine solutes the north facing slope of the catchment has a thin active layer and wet moisture conditions compared to the south facing slope hence supra permafrost water with high ionic concentrations can drain to the ground surface as fss in the riparian zone and then recharge the surface ponding water and the main stream water the high ionic concentrations of the supra permafrost water and fss can be attributed to intense rock weathering and evaporative effect together with the high mobility of elements and the transport of organic matter the tributaries with low ionic concentrations comprise a mixture of infiltrating precipitation and diluted supra permafrost water carbonate weathering is the dominant weathering type within the catchment but the weathering of evaporite and silicate is more important on the north facing and south facing slopes respectively and chemical weathering on the north facing slope may be enhanced by strong physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles due to the wet conditions the results indicate that the surface water hydrochemistry is heterogeneous on the different hillslope units and that a thicker active layer under climate change may lead to a shift of hydrological and hydrochemical pathways and thus a decrease in water and solute flux from the hillslopes with underlying permafrost to the river channel keywords hydrochemistry stream water frozen soil seep surface ponding water permafrost catchments tibetan plateau data availability all the data used in this study can be accessed in the supplementary material 1 introduction permafrost is soil material that remains frozen for at least two years and it covers 24 of the terrestrial surface of the northern hemisphere and the permafrost area is 128 76 104 km2 in the tibetan plateau tp alone zhang et al 1999 ran et al 2018 permafrost catchments in the tp experience repeated interannual and intra annual freeze thaw cycles which affect catchment hydrological and hydrochemical processes wang et al 2016 deng et al 2017 in response to global climate change over the past five decades the tp has experienced a rate of temperature increase that is twice that observed globally and is as much as 0 3 0 4 c per decade chen et al 2015 yao et al 2015 yao et al 2019 permafrost degradation occurs under global warming with the associated deepening of the active layer and melting of near surface ground ice which may affect the ionic and organic concentration in surface waters in arctic regions moreover the increased interaction time between water flow and soil rock due to the rapid permafrost changes may lead to an increase in the contents of major ions nutrients and organic matter of the surface waters malone et al 2013 abbott et al 2015 spencer et al 2015 harms et al 2016 due to permafrost degradation the ionic concentrations in streams and lakes in permafrost regions may be increased by a factor of several tens kokelj et al 2005 roberts et al 2017 given the wide distribution of permafrost in the tp and global climate change studies on the surface water hydrochemistry under different permafrost conditions e g active layer thickness ground ice type and supra permafrost water may help predict future catchment hydrochemical regimes in permafrost headwater catchments much effort has been devoted to analyzing the hydrochemistry of permafrost related waters e g stream water ground ice and supra permafrost water in permafrost headwater catchments in the tp wang et al 2018a yu et al 2019 supra permafrost water is defined as the saturated water above the permafrost table with the permafrost layer serving as an aquitard as the base it is also called water in the seasonally thawed layer i e the active layer which is typically situated in between the frozen and thawed parts of the soil profile and may promote the runoff generation processes in the permafrost headwater catchments cheng and jin 2013 xiao et al 2020a b in addition the supra permafrost water may show high dissolved contents which may be related to the following reasons first the soil water in the surface layers will return to the atmosphere during evaporation while the solutes remain in the soil thus the soil water in the surface layers shows the gradual enrichment of solutes koch et al 2014 throckmorton et al 2016 second due to soil leaching and desalination effects during freeze thaw processes the soil pore water of the surface layers with high ionic concentrations may move to the deeper soil layers and become ground ice in the permafrost or supra permafrost water cheng 1983 wang et al 1996 wang et al 2018b third as clay is the main soil textural component along the permafrost underlain hillslope the long residence time of the soil water in the soil layers with high clay contents may have an enhanced positive effect of ions exchange or chemical weathering on the dissolved contents charfi et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 gao et al 2017 these factors may have led to the high solute concentrations of the supra permafrost water and the related surface waters and thus may play a very important role in the catchment hydrochemical regimes in permafrost headwater catchments it has been found that supra permafrost water and near surface ice meltwater may drain directly over the land surface as frozen soil seeps fss as shown in fig 1 d and the conceptual diagrams in cheng and jin 2013 and xiao et al 2020a fss is the seeps draining from the active layer especially at the junction of steep slopes and flat terrain and hence they are the primary sources of water and solutes to stream water and lakes owing to the absence of groundwater discharge in permafrost regions bosson et al 2013 li et al 2016 gao et al 2017 however the thermal perturbation of permafrost conditions and disturbed terrain due to the accelerating permafrost degradation may modify the hydrological and hydrochemical regimes in permafrost headwater catchments luo et al 2019 mu et al 2020 ci et al 2020 the subsidence pit is a type of disturbed terrain caused by permafrost change as shown in fig 1e such as the loss of water and soil ice and is widely distributed in the lower valleys and riparian zone of permafrost catchments in the tp these subsidence pits usually have a diameter of a few meters and a depth of some tens of centimeters while surface ponding water spw caused by physical changes associated with the repeating freeze thaw cycles is common within them jones et al 2011 liljedahl et al 2016 lafrenière and lamoureux 2019 however based on what we know so far few studies have focused on the hydrochemistry of the fss and spw in subsidence pits and the spatial variations of surface water hydrochemistry in the tp stream water is usually regarded as a natural integrator of catchment hydrochemical processes ollivier et al 2010 das et al 2016 donnini et al 2016 most studies focusing on stream water hydrochemistry have simplified the weathering processes and assumed that the catchment geology and soil chemistry are homogeneous and then estimated catchment chemical weathering rates based on ionic concentrations usually calculated as the sum of the ionic mass of stream water at the catchment outlet asano et al 2009 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however in reality permafrost catchment attributes such as active layer thickness vegetation cover topography and soil texture are usually spatially heterogeneous first the stream water hydrochemistry may change as a result of recharge by different hillslope units or be controlled by hotspots such as groundwater or soil seeps zimmer et al 2013 peralta tapia et al 2015a lintern et al 2018 sullivan et al 2019 second several studies have shown that the groundwater or soil seeps flow may have different flow paths especially in permafrost regions that exhibit seasonal changes in the major flow pathway with changes in the depth of the frozen front xiao et al 2020a moreover dissolved organic carbon doc exports to surface runoff are mostly driven by the unfrozen zones during permafrost thawing and doc is regarded as the major carrier of major elements in permafrost influenced organic rich surface waters kodama and schnitzer 1980 pokrovsky et al 2016a pokrovsky et al 2016b raudina et al 2018 ji et al 2021 for example the transfer of geochemical compositions from arctic soils to surface water was found to be related to freezing processes from surface to deep soil layers which may be due to plant activity involved in the leaching of moss litter and release of micronutrients ji et al 2021 and ions such as ca2 and mg2 are usually present as an organic complex in soil solutions leckie 1986 therefore the permafrost thawing will result in different ionic or organic concentrations because of the interactions between water flow and soil or rock at different depths thereby leading to distinct spatial patterns of riverine solutes on the catchment scale peralta tapia et al 2015b tetzlaff et al 2015 exner kittridge et al 2016 xiao et al 2020c however the influences of permafrost conditions on the spatial pattern of surface water hydrochemistry remain unclear and the factors controlling recharge from frozen soil water to stream water need to be determined therefore finer scale sampling of different surface water types e g stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss is needed to better understand the hydrochemical regimes within permafrost headwater catchments based on the above existing understanding and unsolved problems the aims of the study were 1 to identify the hydrochemistry characteristics and spatial patterns of the different surface water types 2 to reveal the provenance of dissolved solutes in different surface water types 3 and to reveal the potential factors that influencing hydrochemical regimes in different hillslope units information on major ionic concentrations has been widely used in studies focusing on the hydrochemistry of different water types because the ratios of major ions can help identify the rocks involved in chemical weathering and provide qualitative and quantitative information about the formation and evolution of different water types and the factors controlling these processes gaillardet et al 1999 das et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore various surface water samples were obtained at a relatively high density in the yakou catchment which is a permafrost headwater catchment in the northeastern tp and their dissolved ionic and organic concentrations were measured 2 site description the study was conducted in the yakou catchment 100 15 100 16 e 38 00 38 01 n a permafrost headwater catchment with an area of 1 4 km2 located in the middle segment of the qilian mountain in the northeastern tp fig 1 the elevation range of the yakou catchment is 3 900 4 300 m a s l and the average elevation is 4 050 m a s l the climate of the study area is continental and the annual average temperature is around 4 7 c the average annual precipitation is 405 mm with the majority 84 falling from may to september the monthly average air temperature is 0 c from june to september as shown by xiao et al 2020a the yakou catchment has a relatively small water volume as streamflow discharge at the outlet was usually 0 1 m3 s and may increase to above 1 0 m3 s during heavy snowmelt and rainfall events the long hillslopes in the yakou catchment can be divided into four segments the slope top upper slope middle slope and the riparian zone with respective average gradients of 7 20 12 and 7 xiao et al 2020b the slope top and riparian zone have relatively flat terrain and the slope gradient gradually decreases from the upper slope to the riparian zone the soil thickness is strongly heterogeneous with the upper slopes having thinner soils e g the slope top has a soil layer 1 m thick whereas the lower slopes have thicker soils e g the riparian zone has a soil layer 2 m thick because of differences in snow cover and topography between hillslope positions and hillslope units the thickness of the active layer is spatially heterogeneous the yakou catchment is dominated by permafrost and the maximum thickness of the active layer on the north facing slope varies from 100 cm in the riparian zone to 160 cm at the slope top xiao et al 2020a b moreover as shown by satellite imagery during the winter dry period fig 1b the areas to the west and south of the main stem which is dominated by a north facing slope had a higher snow cover compared to the areas to the east and north of the main stem which is dominated by a south facing slope and thus was more recharged by snowmelt input during the spring snowmelt period moreover the south facing slope may have a stronger solar radiation receipt than the north facing slope due to its orientation fig 1b these two factors lead to drier soil moisture conditions and a lower vegetation cover on the south facing slope compared to the north facing slope as shown by the drone aerial photo in fig 1c permafrost has more stable thermodynamic characteristics under humid soil moisture conditions cheng and jin 2013 xiao et al 2020c and therefore dry soil moisture conditions may lead to an earlier initial thawing time and a thicker active layer on the south facing slope the major soil types at the slope top and upper slope are cryogenic cambisols and mat cryic cambisols with organic cryic gleysols in the middle slope and riparian zone respectively based on field observations the soil of the yakou catchment is mainly fine grained with 85 silty sand and clay and the proportions of clay at each hillslope position and soil depth are generally 65 except in the 0 10 cm soil layer in the riparian zone which has a higher silt sand content 31 85 thus clay is the main soil textural component in the yakou catchment xiao et al 2020b the vegetation coverage of the slope top upper slope middle slope and riparian zone is around 30 60 90 and 98 respectively based on field observations xiao et al 2020b the main land cover types of the slope top and upper slope are alpine deserts and alpine meadow with alpine swamp meadow in the middle slope and riparian zone respectively the dominant plant species along the hillslope are rhodiola tangutica carex moorcroftii and kobresia humilis alpine meadow and alpine swamp meadow soils are usually characterized by a higher soil organic matter content a finer soil structure and denser root biomass compared to the alpine steppe soil thereby leading to a lower soil water permeability and higher soil water retention capacity wang et al 2018a niu et al 2019 more details about the distribution of the soil and vegetation types are given in xiao et al 2020b surveys of the geological background of the area such as the fault system tectonic division and mineralogy of the qilian mountains reveal the following the yakou catchment is located on the middle qilian uplift belt sand the catchment is dominated by an upper ordovician stratum ol the bedrock mainly comprises neutral volcanic rocks volcanic breccia tuff and clastic rocks and siliceous rocks are therefore dominant in the study area wei 1978 feng 1997 wang et al 2011 subsurface sulfate bearing evaporates in the qilian mountain area likely associated with paleogene metasediments fang et al 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 field sampling high density spatial sampling of the main stream tributary spw in a subsidence pit and fss was conducted on july 15 2021 and the sampling sites are shown in fig 1a the methods used are summarized below stream water sampling stream water samples were collected from the main stream and tributary of the yakou catchment the stream water samples were sampled every 100 m along with the main stream network and four samples were collected from each of the four tributaries fig 1a 13 samples were collected from the main stream and 16 from the tributary a hydrophilic membrane filter millipore with a pore size of 0 45 μm was used to filter the samples during sampling to prevent mineral dissolution the filtered water samples were stored in three 15 ml polyethylene pe bottles two of which were used for the measurement of solutes and the other was a standby sterile rubber gloves were worn when collecting the water samples and transferring them to the pe bottles the pe bottles were rinsed in ultrapure water and dried before use to prevent contamination of the samples by the material inside the bottles and the bottles were rinsed 2 3 times with the water to be sampled before the actual samples were taken according to the conventions of previous studies e g yu et al 2019 the other 15 ml pe bottles containing water samples were acidified to ph 2 with three drops of ultrapure hno3 to prevent algal growth and carbonate precipitation spw in subsidence pits and fss sampling subsidence pits are widely distributed in the yakou catchment fig 1c and e the size of the subsidence pits in the yakou catchment varies from 1 m2 to 10 m2 and the depth of subsidence pits is usually from 10 to 40 cm while the spw depth may vary substantially under metrological and hydrological forcing fig 1e most of the subsidence pits are located on the north facing slope which has a relatively thin active layer due to the strong physical disturbance of the freezing thaw processes most of the spw and fss samples on the south facing slope were collected in the riparian zone fig 1b and the relatively thick snow cover and humid soil moisture conditions accompanied by the relatively low elevations and flat terrain facilitated the generation of subsidence pits and fss in this slope position fss usually occur in the flat terrain at the base of steep hillslopes and they recharge the stream water as surface runoff that is the return flow occurs because of the sudden drop in the terrain as shown in fig 1c and d fss occurs continuously after the thawing of the surface soil layer under the recharge of precipitation input and frozen soil meltwater the fss has a relatively low temperature due to the water supply from the frozen soil layer samples of spw and fss were collected in the yakou catchment at a relatively high spatial resolution fig 1a and b the sampling and treatment methods used for spw and fss were the same as for the stream water and a total of 18 fss samples including 14 on the north facing slope and 4 on the south facing slope and 17 spw samples including 11 on the north facing slope and 6 on the south facing slope were collected on july 15 2021 precipitation sampling precipitation samples collected in july 2017 were used to correct the solute contents in stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss from atmospheric input precipitation samples were collected from flat open unsheltered areas with no signs of external interference around the yakou ams all precipitation samples were collected in standard pe bags 70 cm 67 cm the standard pe bags were vacuumed before use to avoid external interference and to eliminate external contamination in the transportation processes before using the standard pe bags to collect the precipitation samples several of them were rinsed with a small amount of distilled water and the major cation and anion concentrations of this rinse were found to be lower than the detection limit of the instrumentation this confirmed that the precipitation samples were not affected by any solutes from the standard pe bags which ensured the quality of these samples during persistent rainfall events the bag was folded into a rounded shape and placed in a plastic bucket using rubber gloves after the rainfall ceased the bag was immediately retrieved and the collected rainfall was poured into pe bottles the samples were stored at 0 c and transported to the laboratory for analysis a total of 13 precipitation samples were collected in july 2017 3 2 sample analysis the electrical conductivity ec of different water types was measured with a water quality monitor hanna h198119 during sampling since the ec values of these samples were high the main stream water spw and fss samples were diluted five times with ultrapure water before testing for the concentrations of major ions this is standard practice as the samples with high ec usually have high ionic concentrations compared to the ionic concentrations of standard samples and the analytical error may be high if these samples are not diluted the tributary and precipitation samples were tested directly due to the low ec values of these water types major cations ca2 mg2 k and na together with si in the acidified samples were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes with a detection limit of 0 001 mg l major anions cl no3 and so4 2 in the non acidified filtered samples were measured by ion chromatography ic 900 dionex with a detection limit of 0 01 mg l the analytical error was 5 as indicated by repeated measurements of standards of known concentration doc measurements of the acidified filtered samples were conducted using a total carbon analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan 3 3 statistical analyses the statistical differences among the water types were analyzed by one way anova with a significance level of p 0 05 analysis of variance and the significant differences among the different water types are indicated by the different letters hco3 concentrations were calculated via the cation anion charge balance while the total dissolved solids tds were calculated as the sum of the concentrations of the major cations and anions k na ca2 mg2 sio2 cl no3 so4 2 alkalinity yu et al 2019 the ordinate of the gibbs plot can be used to identify solute sources that is atmospheric precipitation rock weathering or evaporative crystallization gibbs 1970 the chemical composition of low salinity water is mainly supplied by precipitation which is mainly located in the lower left corner of the gibbs plot that of medium salinity water mainly comes from rock weathering and with increased evaporation the concentration of ions continuously increases when the concentrations of ca2 hco3 and other ions reach the solubility product of calcium carbonate and other mineral components that is the minerals precipitated out from the water and the control of the water hydrochemistry is shifted from the weathering of the rocks to evaporative crystallization and gradually approaches high salt and high sodium concentrations in the upper right corner of the gibbs plot the na mixing plot which shows the molar ratios of ca2 na and mg2 na in the water samples after precipitation correction represented by the superscript x can be used to identify the chemical weathering sources such as the carbonate silicate and evaporites end members gaillardet et al 1999 goldsmith et al 2010 the cl content from atmospheric input was assumed to be equal to the cl concentration of the stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss samples and the contribution of each cation was equal to the dissolved cation in precipitation and the molar ratio of cl multiplied by the riverine cl content from rainfall grosbois et al 2000 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 specifically the corrected ca2 mg2 and na concentrations derived from precipitation were calculated from x x cl clref where x cl and clref were the measured ions cl concentration and reference cl concentration in precipitation clref is calculated by multiplying the weighted average cl content of precipitation by the concentration factor f which is calculated by precipitation amount and runoff volume in the same period that is f p r 4 results 4 1 hydrochemistry of stream water frozen soil seeps and surface ponding water in subsidence pits the average tds doc and major ionic concentrations measured for the different water types are presented in table 1 and fig 2 the measured ec and calculated tds had an overall similar relationship with tdscalculated 0 756 ecmeasured and r2 0 93 which is close to the relationship between the measured ec and tds 0 75 obtained by the water quality monitor supporting the data quality of the measured major ions and the calculation methods of the hco3 concentrations and the tds values however there is a certain amount of doc in the different water types for example the average doc concentrations of the main stream water tributaries spw on the north facing slope spw on the south facing slope fss on the north facing slope and fss on the south facing slope were 2 6 1 4 5 5 2 3 5 3 and 1 5 mg l respectively table 1 and fig 2 this indicates that alkalinity is not the only missing anion because cations may bind with organic acids which can be attributed to the high levels of doc or other dissolved organic matter in the organic soils in the middle slope and riparian zone it was found that the hco3 concentrations in the south tibetan plateau streamflow obtained by charge balance were 10 higher than the values measured in situ when the doc contents were low qu et al 2017 yu et al 2021 in this study the low doc concentrations of the stream water and spw and fss on the south facing slope table 1 and fig 2 indicate the similar impacts of doc or other dissolved organic matter on the calculated alkalinity but the over estimated alkalinity in the samples collected from the fss and spw on the north facing slope may exceed 10 due to the relatively high doc contents of these water types therefore the hco3 in the different water types is not used in the following discussion in the hydrochemical classification of a large number of samples percentages of cations and anions are usually plotted in a piper diagram to show the properties of the different water types fig 3 the major cationic concentrations in the precipitation are ordered as ca2 na k mg2 with ca2 and na dominating and accounting for 72 of total cations table 1 and fig 3 the precipitation had low ionic concentrations with the k concentrations of partial precipitation samples being below the detection limit table s1 the major cation concentrations of the main stream water are ordered as ca2 mg2 na k with ca2 contributing over 70 of the total cations table 1 and fig 3 for the tributaries the major cationic concentrations are ordered as ca2 na mg2 k ca2 mg2 and na contribute 65 15 and 18 of total cations respectively table 1 and fig 3 the tds of the main stream water and tributaries have respective ranges of 71 1043 mg l and 31 88 mg l with corresponding averages of 418 and 58 mg l 1 for the main stream water and tributaries respectively these values are respectively 6 4 and 0 9 times the global median of 65 mg l gaillardet et al 1999 the major ionic concentrations and hydrochemical types of the spw and fss on the north facing slope are like those of the main stream water while those of the spw and fss on the south facing slope are close to those of the tributaries table 1 and fig 2 for example ca2 and mg2 contributed 55 and 35 of total cations in the spw and fss on the north facing slope respectively with ca2 dominating contributing 66 and 18 of total cations in the spw and fss on the south facing slope table 1 and fig 3 the tds and ionic concentrations are low for spw and fss on the south facing slope and tributaries for example the average tds values of tributaries spw on the south facing slope and fss on the south facing slope are 58 91 and 93 mg l respectively these values are much lower than the average tds of the main stream water and spw and fss on the south facing slope which has averages of 418 480 and 926 mg l respectively table 1 tds doc and the high concentration ions i e ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the tributaries and the spw and fss on the south facing slope are significantly lower p 0 05 than those of the main stream water and spw and fss on the north facing slope and the ions with low concentrations i e k na cl and no3 did not show significant differences p 0 05 between the main stream water and tributaries or between the surface waters sampled on the different hillslope units fig 2 the reasons for this may be related to different chemical weathering processes on the different hillslope units which results in differing chemical weathering products and hence in differences in the hydrochemistry of the various water types as follows first the fraction of the na and sio2 contents in the tributary stream water is 13 and higher than the values in the main stream water table 1 which is 3 in the piper plot fig 3 the samples from the tributary to the main stream shift from the na and k corner to the mg2 and ca2 corner second the so4 2 content of the main stream water is much higher than in the tributary table 1 these observations indicate the occurrence of stronger weathering of na and si containing silicates on the south facing slope than on the north facing slope and that the high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the main stream water may be related to the weathering of more calcite dolomite and gypsum in this study area the alpine meadow and alpine swamp meadow all have a surface organic layer ao with a thickness of 15 30 cm this surface sod layer has a high root density and high organic matter content because the deeper layers are frozen for most of the year additionally results show the high concentrations of ca2 mg2 and doc in the fss and spw on the north facing slope and the main stream water table 1 and fig 2 and the strong power law relationship between ca2 and doc fig 4 a and between mg2 and doc fig 4b these lead to the high mobility of elements and the translocation of organic matter from the surface organic rich layers to the deeper soil layers and the supra permafrost water and then to the spw and stream water therefore the large flux of doc from the surrounding permafrost soils and supra permafrost water to the adjacent hydrological systems may facilitate the transport of major elements 4 2 spatial variations of the hydrochemistry of stream water frozen soil seeps and surface ponding water in subsidence pits the spatial patterns of tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the stream water fss and spw in subsidence pits are shown in fig 5 the reasons for showing the distributions of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are related to the high fractions of ca2 and mg2 among the total cations 80 for the different water types and the high so4 2 concentrations in different water types table 1 and fig 3 there are large spatial variations in tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the different water types and on the different hillslope units figs 2 and 3 first high values of tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are typical of the upper main stream sites and spw and fss on the north facing slope for example the tds values at the main stream sites decrease from 1043 mg l at the highest site to 546 mg l at the main stream site before the confluences of the tributaries table s1 sampling site nos from 9 to 13 in table s1 and the tds values of the spw and fss on the north facing slope have averages of 480 and 926 mg l respectively table 1 the high and large variation of the tds values in the main stream water indicated that the fss may determine the spatial patterns of stream water hydrochemistry like hotspots second the tributaries show almost no gradients in tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 and the tributaries show uniform and low values compared with the main stream water for example the tds values of the tributaries have the range of 31 88 mg l the ca2 concentrations have a range of 6 17 mg l and mg2 and so4 2 have the ranges of 1 3 mg l and 2 7 mg l respectively fig 5 and table s1 third the tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the main stream sites below the confluences of the tributaries are lower than the values of the upper main stream sites for example the tds values of the main stream sites after the tributary confluences have the range of 71 238 mg l and the ranges of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 are 14 47 mg l 2 15 mg l and 2 93 mg l respectively fig 5 and table s1 sample nos 1 to 8 in table s1 the low tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 of the main stream sites below the confluences of the tributaries may be due to dilution by the tributary inputs which have relatively low tds and ionic concentrations table 1 and fig 5 and the upper main stream water may be 8 times diluted from 546 mg l table s1 sample no 9 to 71 mg l table s1 sample no 8 before and after the confluences of the tributaries respectively therefore due to the downstream dilution in yakou stream water average values of tds doc and most of the ionic concentrations of the main stream samples are lower than those of spw and fss on the north facing slope table 1 figs 2 and 5 these results indicate that the hydrochemistry of the surface waters is heterogeneous within the permafrost headwater catchment with differences evident between the main stream sites and the tributaries and between different hillslope units fss may be involved in streamflow generation processes thus influencing the riverine solutes for example the high tds ca2 mg2 and so4 2 values of the main stream sites above the confluences of the tributaries may reflect the influence of the adjacent fss sites as the fss adjacent to the main stream sites have relatively high values fig 5 and table s1 also the tds values and ionic concentrations of the tributaries and the adjacent spw and fss have similar low values table 1 figs 2 and 5 suggesting they are influenced by similar chemical weathering processes 5 discussion 5 1 provenance of solutes in different water types the gibbs plot of the main stream water tributaries spw in subsidence pits and fss is shown in fig 6 and four main observations can be made first the distribution of precipitation in the study area is scattered and mostly concentrated in the lower middle of the gibbs plot with low tds values and the concentration ratio of na na ca2 varied between 0 1 and 1 0 indicating the solute sources from atmospheric precipitation and rock weathering such as the remote marine sources and the atmospheric dust from rock weathering second the distributions for main stream water are concentrated in the center of the plot with the tds values within the range of 71 1043 mg l and the concentration ratios of na na ca2 within the range of 0 0 2 these values indicate that the main stream water is influenced mainly by rock weathering third the tributaries have lower tds values and high na na ca2 values compared to the main stream water and they are distributed between the rock weathering and precipitation zones this indicates that although the tributaries are also influenced by rock weathering they are more influenced by the input of precipitation than the main stream water moreover in the gibbs plot the distributions of spw and fss on the south facing slope are close to those of the tributaries indicating that these water types have similar solute sources fourth spw and fss on the north facing slope have higher tds values than for the other water types and low values of na na ca2 they are distributed between the rock weathering and evaporation crystallization zones indicating the strong influences of evaporation on the spw and fss on the north facing slope overall it can be qualitatively concluded that the hydrochemistry of all the surface waters was dominated by rock weathering however the higher ionic concentrations of spw and fss on the north facing slope may be attributed to the stronger influences of rock weathering and evaporation processes while the relatively low ionic concentrations of spw and fss on the north facing slope may indicate the stronger influences of precipitation input most of the water samples collected from the yakou catchment fall among the end members of carbonate silicate and evaporate in the na mixing plot suggesting that the chemical weathering products of these three rock types are important sources for stream water spw in subsidence pits and fss fig 7 the chemical weathering of silicates appear to be more important in the tributaries and spw and fss on the south facing slope because of the proximity of these samples to the silicate end member moreover the sample distributions for main stream water and spw and fss on the north facing slope are very close to the carbonate end member suggesting contributions from carbonate rock to these water types such as from the dissolution of calcite and dolomite which are common in the basin additionally the distribution of the stream water samples is close to that of the adjacent spw and fss samples in the na mixing plot indicating similar sources for stream water and the adjacent spw and fss for carbonate dissolution with carbonic acid and sulfuric acid e g produced by sulfide oxidation the reactions mainly follow 1 c a x m g 1 x c o 3 h 2 c o 3 x c a 2

or evaporite can be depicted by ionic molar ratios after precipitation correction as indicated by yu et al 2019 and colombo et al 2019 the total cationic charge tz was calculated as the sum of cations na k 2ca2 2 mg2 in μmolc l and μmolc l denotes micromoles of charges and can be used to identify the chemical weathering types that is if carbonic acid is involved in carbonate weathering the theoretically equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 so4 2 and tz so4 2 would be positive infinity and the values of these ratios would be 2 0 and 1 0 for the reactions with sulfuric acids involved in carbonate weathering and dissolution of the evaporite if carbonic acid is involved in silicate weathering tz so4 2 would be positive infinity and the value would be 1 0 for the reactions with sulfuric acids involved in the silicate weathering in this study the ca2 mg2 so4 2 and tz so4 2 values of the tributaries and the spw and fss on the south facing slope are close to positive infinity fig 8 a and b the inset panel the high ca2 mg2 so4 2 and tz so4 2 values indicate very low so4 2 concentrations in these water types fig 8a and b the inset panel overall these observations suggest that carbonate and silicate weathering with carbonic acid are the dominant chemical weathering type on the south facing slope the main stream water and the spw and fss on the north facing slope have significantly p 0 05 higher ionic concentrations and distinctive distributions compared to the tributaries and spw and fss on the south facing slope table 1 figs 2 and 8 several points can be made first the main stream water and the spw and fss on the north facing slope are mainly distributed between the 2 1 line and 1 1 line in the ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 plot fig 8a and the tz versus so4 2 plot fig 8b also the relationship between the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 is close for the main stream water and spw and fss on the north facing slope fig 8a the r2 values of the linear fits for these three water types are 0 99 0 95 and 0 97 respectively with p 0 01 this indicates that the north facing slope is dominated by coupled carbonate and sulfide or evaporite weathering and that caso4 and mgso4 are the dominant products of the reactions which is supported by the domination of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the total cation solutes in these water types table 1 most samples of the main stream water and the spw and fss on the north facing slope are neutral to basic with ph values ranging from 7 1 to 9 5 with an average of 8 1 table s1 in addition as demonstrated by fang et al 2019 subsurface gypsum deposits are widely distributed in the qilian mountain area probably associated with paleogene metasediments which therefore supports this alternative assumption therefore it is more reasonable to assume that most of the riverine so4 2 is derived from the dissolution of evaporite rather than being the product of the dissolution of sulfide minerals riverine cl is usually derived mainly from atmospheric inputs and the dissolution of evaporites such as halite galy and france lanord 1999 the correlations between cl and so4 2 in different water types are weak the r2 values for the linear correlations for the main stream water tributaries spw in subsidence pits and fss are 0 03 0 24 0 05 and 0 03 respectively also the ionic ratios of the samples indicate a contribution from silicate weathering fig 7 these observations support the conclusion that the riverine cl mainly originates from atmospheric inputs and na mainly derived from silicate weathering e g albite or plagioclase rather than being the product of halite dissolution 5 2 potential factors influencing hydrochemical regimes in different hillslope units as discussed above there are strong heterogeneous hydrochemical regimes within the yakou catchment especially for the different hillslope units that is between the north facing slope and the south facing slope the reasons for these differences may be related to permafrost conditions and the effects on hydrological and hydrochemical regimes as demonstrated before because of differences in snow cover and topography between hillslope units the north facing slope had wetter soil moisture conditions and higher vegetation cover than the south facing slope and varying permafrost conditions such as active layer thickness leading to distinct hydrological and hydrochemical regimes in the different hillslope units as illustrated in the conceptual diagrams fig 9 for the north facing slope the thin active layer may lead to a shallower flow pathway and the water levels of spw in subsidence pits were maintained by the underlying frozen soil and the input of precipitation as shown by xiao et al 2020a b during intense precipitation events the spw and fss could be pressurized to recharge stream water leading to a higher water flux from the supra permafrost water with high ionic concentrations to the surface waters i e the spw and the main stream water fig 9a for the south facing slope the thick active layer may have high permeability leading to the greater leaching of soil solutes from the surface soil to the soil near the permafrost table cheng and jin 2013 huang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b this would cause a decrease in the water contents and ionic concentrations in the surface soil layers and the spw fig 9b additionally the tributaries may be recharged mainly by shallow subsurface runoff as a result of precipitation input and increases in the supra permafrost water level in the shallow soil layers that is the rapid subsurface runoff in the highly transmissive soil layer could convert a large amount of water to streamflow xiao et al 2020c therefore the tributaries with low ionic concentrations are a mixture of infiltrating precipitation and diluted supra permafrost water fig 9b the tributary samples are mainly distributed in lower positions within the gibbs diagram fig 6 supporting the stronger influence of a precipitation input against the background of the generally similar mineral composition within the catchment the different chemical weathering types in the different hillslope units may also be related to the spatial heterogeneity of physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles the wetter soil moisture conditions promote the chemical weathering on the north facing slope which may be enhanced by the weathering of highly weatherable minerals produced by repeated freeze thaw cycles ji et al 2021 steingruber et al 2021 that is the humid soil moisture status of the north facing slope leads to stronger physical disturbance of the underlying bedrock for the north facing slope the main stream water spw and fss are close to the carbonate weathering end member in the na mixing plot fig 7 which also indicates a contribution from evaporites such as gypsum fig 8 this may be because carbonates and evaporites dissolve at a rate several orders of magnitude greater than that of silicates and even small amounts of calcite in stratum can dominate the fluxes of ca2 in streamflow chamberlain et al 2005 fan et al 2014 sun et al 2019 for example the trace quantities 0 7 of sulfides and carbonates found in silicate bedrock dissolve five times more carbonate than silicate tranter et al 2002 therefore although siliceous rocks are dominant in the yakou catchment the dissolution of carbonates is the most important form of chemical weathering on the north facing slope fig 7 also more carbonic acid may be produced by the higher vegetation coverage on the north facing slope compared to the south facing slope which would increase the chemical weathering intensity on the former therefore the longer residence time rock water interactions and the abundance of freshly exposed mineral surfaces caused by physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles can increase the overall weathering rate and riverine solute concentrations these results are consistent with the finding that more ice and cryoturbation existing in polygon rim and buried talik would lead to more unfrozen water and cause elements to move to the surrounding surface water and stream networks ji et al 2021 the insights gained in this study may be generally applicable to the tp and wider permafrost regions because the landscapes of the yakou catchment e g alpine meadow alpine swamp meadow subsidence pits and fss are widely distributed in other permafrost headwater catchments in this region however our findings differ from those of studies in arctic regions which indicate increases in ionic concentrations in surface waters associated with the deepening of the active layer and the melting of near surface ground ice e g malone et al 2013 abbott et al 2015 roberts et al 2017 these differences may be due to the complex runoff generation processes on the hillslope in the mountainous headwater catchments therefore further long term investigations of the temporal variations of different surface water types are needed and measurements of ionic and organic concentrations in soil water and ground ice should be conducted in different hillslope units and hillslope positions moreover it is important to identify mineralogy by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf x ray diffraction xrd and microscopy in future studies this may increase our understanding based on water chemical data and further characterize the potential factors controlling multiple riverine dissolved fluxes such investigations may lead to an improved understanding of the effects of climatic warming on surface water hydrochemistry and solute transport pathways in permafrost headwater catchments and further enable us to characterize the factors dominating catchment hydrochemical regimes 6 conclusions the hydrochemistry of different surface water types was studied in the yakou catchment in the northeastern tp a headwater catchment underlain by permafrost the results showed that the surface water hydrochemistry is spatially heterogeneous within the yakou catchment especially in different hillslope units that is the north facing and south facing slopes the principal findings are as follows 1 the tds and ionic concentrations were higher in the main stream water compared to the tributaries and the main stream sites were influenced by the adjacent supra permafrost water i e the supra permafrost with high ionic concentrations the average tds value of the tributaries was low and close to those of the spw and fss on the south facing slope with low ionic concentrations and the main stream water may be 8 times diluted after the confluences of the tributaries 2 the higher ionic concentrations of the supra permafrost water and fss on the north facing compared to those on the south facing slope can be attributed to the stronger rock weathering and evaporation effect moreover the transport of organic matter may carry the highly mobile ions from surrounding permafrost soils and supra permafrost water to the adjacent hydrological systems and promote the transport of major elements 3 the north facing slope has a thin active layer and a wet moisture status and the fss with high ionic concentrations may drain to the ground surface in the riparian zone and recharge the spw and main stream water for the south facing slope with a thick active layer a shallow subsurface runoff was the major flow pathway and therefore the tributaries are a mixture of infiltrating precipitation and diluted supra permafrost water and export a lower solute flux to the river channel 4 carbonate and evaporite weathering are the dominant weathering types on the north facing slope which may be enhanced by the strong physical erosion during repeated freeze thaw cycles which are more intense with wetter moisture condition and better vegetation cover compared with the south facing slope for the tributaries and spw and fss on the south facing slope carbonate and silicate weathering are dominated by carbonic acid in this study we have for the first time systematically investigated the hydrochemistry of surface water types with a relatively high spatial density in a permafrost headwater catchment the results emphasize the important role of topography e g hillslope aspect and permafrost conditions e g active layer thickness and physical erosion during freeze thaw cycles in controlling catchment hydrochemical regimes in particular the hillslope aspect may have indirect influences on catchment hydrochemical regimes by directly influencing soil moisture soil temperature vegetation cover and the resulting permafrost conditions we have also shown that spw and fss may be involved in streamflow generation processes and hence they may determine the spatial patterns of stream water hydrochemistry like hotspots the spatially variable water hydrochemistry shown by this study can shed light on potentially changing hydrological pathways of solutes under climate change scenarios as permafrost degradation may not only decrease the water flux from the permafrost hillslope to the river channel but also decrease the dissolved fluxes from spw and fss with high ionic and organic concentrations due to decreases in water flux and physical and chemical weathering intensity finally further long term investigations of the hydrochemistry of surface waters soil water and ground ice and the identification of the mineralogy in the different hillslope units are needed to fully determine the influencing processes credit authorship contribution statement xiong xiao data

calgary london and halifax respectively importantly et rates were shown to be a strong function of substrate moisture content as well as atmospheric forcing with the relative importance of each varying between the different cities et rates were typically greater in the mixed species treatment in comparison to the three monoculture treatments sedum spurium sporobolus heterolepis and aquilegia

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extensive green roofs have been proposed to provide a non intrusive solution to reduce stormwater runoff through rainfall retention as well as mitigate the urban heat island effect carter and rasmussen 2006 cuthbert et al 2022 fassman beck et al 2013 talebi et al 2019 vesuviano et al 2014 evapotranspiration et is the primary driver governing the ability of a green roof to achieve these objectives as it frees up water storage space for precipitation rainfall retention in green roof substrate soil while also

conditions this includes studies examining et in controlled laboratory or greenhouse settings as well as under field conditions where climate and rainfall are not controlled under controlled

relative contribution of the various factors to measured et rates the impact of climate on green roof et rates has been evaluated in modeling and field studies cascone et al 2019 in experimental studies this has been achieved by investigating the impact of season or atmospheric forcing e g temperature and humidity on et rates at an individual site e g poe et al 2015 for example under well watered climate controlled conditions poe et al 2015 found that et rates are higher during the summer months when there is more energy available for et in contrast et rates in the spring are lower due to lower available energy for et berretta et al 2014 marasco et al 2014 while these prior studies provide valuable insights related to the impact of climate on green roof et they are limited by the range of climatological conditions at the study sites the seasonal behaviour described here would be consistent with natural environments however with green roofs variability in et is likely higher on short time scales especially in the summer given the systems limited ability to store water as well as the types of plants used as such it is important to study et on green roofs as we can t necessarily use knowledge from other environments as a direct analogue quantification of et with a similar green roof design in a broader range of climates would enable a broader assessment of the impact of climate on et the depth of green roof substrate is an important design parameter as it can impact retention directly by increasing overall water holding capacity yilmaz et al 2016 or indirectly by increasing plant leaf biomass rowe et al 2012 and transpiration thus total et leading to lower substrate water content between rain events prior studies have reported increased rainfall retention with increased substrate depth mentens et al 2006 soulis et al 2017 vanwoert et al 2005a yilmaz et al 2016 the extent to which rainfall retention increases with substrate depth varies in the literature with the study of vanwoert et al 2005a only reporting a few difference in total retention in their field green roof study that had substrate depths ranging from 2 5 to 6 cm on the other hand other studies reported cumulative rainfall retention increased by 10 with increasing substrate depth e g soulis et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2016 notably the latter studies used larger substrate depths including larger minimum substrate depth i e 8 cm differences in prior study findings could be due to a range of reasons including the extent to which et freed up pore space for rainfall retention differences in depth and type of substrates used and differences in vegetation these studies were completed under different climatic conditions e g detroit usa nantes france and athens greece so differences in et rates and associated rainfall retention would be expected given that these studies were completed in different locations and different green roof design it is not possible to adequately determine the extent to which substrate characteristics and climate impact et rates and thus rainfall retention plant morphological traits are important contributors to the processes governing green roof et and subsequent rainfall retention and cooling performance brandão et al 2017 farrell et al 2015 farrell et al 2013 gong et al 2021 heim and lundholm 2014 lundholm et al 2015

enhance et lundholm and williams 2015 in terms of specific plant species used many previous green roof studies used sedum species succulents which are mostly non native to north america due to their ability to survive and grow under harsh roof microclimatic conditions vanwoert et al 2005b however there is significant interest in using a broader range of plant species including native species in

mixture of species with different and yet complementary plant traits heim and lundholm 2014 lundholm et al 2010b lundholm 2015 nagase and dunnett 2012 the extent to which a mixture of species improves green roof rainfall retention performance has been investigated with conflicting results dunnett et al 2008 lundholm et al 2010a macivor and lundholm 2011 nagase and dunnett 2012 some studies reported no additional benefits from having a mixture of species dunnett et al 2008 nagase and dunnett 2012 whereas other studies found some positive benefits on rainfall retention lundholm et al 2010a and substrate cooling macivor and lundholm 2011 additionally selection of plants with complementary functional traits can potentially enhance the effectiveness at which green roofs provide ecosystem services the environmental and design factors synergistically affect et rates in that various vegetation types respond to ambient climate conditions differently and various plant root structures can also interact with substrate depths differently dunnett et al 2008 kazemi and mohorko 2017 zhang et al 2018 to date there is limited knowledge on the rate at which the rainfall retention capacity is regenerated i e et rate for green roofs with different vegetation types planted in varying substrate depths and climate conditions the aim of this study is to evaluate how green roof et varies in response to different green roof design configurations in different climate regions the study uses a novel experimental design to quantitatively investigate the influence of green roof substrate depth and vegetation types including mixed species on et rates from extensive modular green roofs in different climate regions this understanding is needed to inform green roof design aimed at enhancing rainfall retention performance of this increasingly popular low impact development option for urban areas 2 materials and methods three experimental green roofs with identical extensive modular design were constructed in london on calgary ab and halifax ns in july 2012 fig 1 table 1 sims et al 2016 tran et al 2019 in london on the green roof was installed on the 4th floor of talbot college at the university of western ontario campus in calgary ab the green roof was located on the 3rd floor of the earth sciences building at the university of calgary campus in halifax ns the green roof was located on the roof of a five storey office building in a business park each city had a unique climate table 1 and fig a1 the green roof system was supplied by liveroof and consisted of extensive 30 cm 30 cm square modules with a depth of 10 cm or 15 cm liveroof mount brydges on canada these green roof modules included built in drainage flow paths at the base of the module to facilitate runoff modules were separated from each other by 1 2 cm at the top edges to facilitate individual modules to be weighed the centre of the experimental green roof array was elevated at a height of 0 2 m surrounding the elevated array were modules sloped at 12 which were then bordered by other modules lying flat on the building s roof surface all 15 cm depth modules that were lying flat on the roof surface were underlain by 2 5 cm styrofoam insulation sheets and 10 cm modules were underlain by an additional 5 cm styrofoam the configuration of the green roofs were similar at all three sites fig 1 the same substrate soil which was provided by liveroof was used at all three sites consisting of a mixture of fine and coarse hadite crushed dolostone bark peat moss and some fertilizer hydraulic properties of the substrate were quantified by perelli 2014 thesubstrate satisfied the requirements set out by the german fll for green roofs fll 2002 green roof modules were planted with one of the three plant species or a mixture of all three the three plant species selected were sedum spurium s spurium aquilegia canadensis a canadensis and sporobolus heterolepis s heterolepis all plants were grown in a nursery before being transplanted into the green roof modules each species come from different lifeform groups with distinguishable traits fig 2 s spurium is a succulent low lying species with an upright branch structure and relatively small broad leaves a canadensis is a herbaceous species with upright branches and has relatively larger leaves which spans over a smaller total leaf area compared to s spurium s heterolepis is a densely tufted graminoid species with a mixture of short upright thin leaves and longer drooping leaves visual observations suggest that s spurium and a canadensis on average have leaves which are relatively parallel to the ground planophile leaf angle distribution lad and s heterolepis has vertically angled leaves erectophile lad a series of unplanted modules were also included to evaluate the effect of plants on the et rates data were collected to capture the full cycle of plant growth for all three species i e coming out of dormancy in late april the photosynthetically active period spanning from early may to late august the flowering period which varies for each species and the return to dormancy in late september and early october fig 2 table a2 plant coverage and the root mass distribution were quantified to assess their impact on et the pin frame method lundholm et al 2010a tran et al 2019 was used to quantitatively assess plant coverage for individual modules for all vegetated treatments monthly over the 2013 field season and biweekly over the 2014 field season the pin frame sampling area 30 cm 30 cm was divided evenly into 16 sampling points and the total number of leaves touched from each point was used to estimate the plant coverage for each module treatment destructive root mass analysis was conducted at the end of the 2014 field season in london on using one 15 cm substrate depth module of each vegetation type the method used was similar to kabganian et al 2002 here each module was sectioned into four quadrants which were then sectioned into four depth intervals 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 13 cm and 13 15 cm for each depth interval the substrate was rinsed off the roots which were then oven dried at 70 c until the root mass remained constant the dry weights from each depth interval were used for the root mass analysis continuous and daily weight measurements of vegetated and unplanted modules from which et and water storage could be calculated were collected using lysimeters and a portable electronic scale chestnut tools lee valley respectively the lysimeters used an interface spi 25 or spi 50 load cell durham instruments which measured the continuous changes in module weight at high resolution lysimeters were connected to a cr3000 campbell scientific data logger to allow for continuous data collection data were then averaged at one and five minute intervals each site had lysimeters installed under at least two s spurium modules with 15 cm substrate depth a portable electronic scale was used to measure the daily changes in module weight for all other modules the number of manually weighed modules ranged from 40 to 42 depending on the site to allow for comparison between the two methods used 15 cm s spurium modules were also weighed manually to check for discrepancies between the lysimeter and electronic scale measurements the modules were manually weighed daily during the spring and summer months following snow melt and when the modules were not frozen to the ground table a2 manual weighing was not consistently conducted daily and in some cases drying periods were missed as such cumulative moisture loss quantified from the lysimeter measurements cannot be directly compared to manually weighed data however manual weighing data were ideal for comparison of et from different vegetation types and substrate depths in a given city the et rates reported in this study were quantified as the change in weight over a certain duration during which time there was no rainfall rainfall was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges te525ws texas electronics inc connected to the dataloggers and installed at the height of the vegetation within the elevated centre area of the green roof an additional rain gauge was installed adjacent to the green roof to quantify any spatial variability in rainfall tipping buckets mounted beneath the elevated platform were also used to measure drainage from s spurium 15 cm modules sims et al 2019 sims et al 2016 net radiation net radiometer kipp zonen nr lite 2 wind speed rm young wind sentry as well as air temperature and relative humidity campbell scientific hc3 s3 data were also recorded on the dataloggers these data were used to quantify penman monteith potential evapotranspiration pet 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of climatological conditions on evapotranspiration rates cumulative et over the growing seasons for each city was calculated as a means to compare the total et loss between climates each city is located in distinct climate regions with calgary located within the prairie climate region london the south eastern climate region and halifax the atlantic maritime climate region in this analysis lysimeter data for s spurium with 15 cm substrate depth was used as it provides nearly continuous quantification of moisture loss i e et over the observation reporting period i e may to sept table a2 moisture gain due to precipitation was filtered out of the calculation cumulative et from may to sept averaged over the two years i e 2013 and 2014 was notably lower in calgary 251 mm water with 255 mm in 2013 and 247 mm in 2014 than in london 360 mm water with 369 mm in 2013 and 351 mm in 2014 due to instrument issues in halifax data for may 2014 as well as june and july 2013 were unavailable cumulative et for the seven months with complete et data in halifax i e may june and sept 2013 and june to sept 2014 was 364 mm water in comparison to 331 mm water for calgary and 490 m water for london for the same months averaged over the observation period this represents an et rate of 2 4 mm day for london compared to an et rate of 1 7 mm day for halifax when data are available and 1 6 mm day for calgary these ranges in et rates are comparable to berghage et al 2007 berretta et al 2014 poe et al 2015 as expected et was not constant at each site during the observation period due to changes in climatological conditions e g average air temperature relative humidity rainfall volume and rainfall frequency and available substrate moisture the extent to which cumulative monthly et decreased through the growing season differed in each city for example average cumulative et decreased from 86 mm in june to 60 mm in september in london mean cumulative monthly et considering two study years decreases in halifax i e from 81 mm to 28 mm and calgary i e from 81 mm to 37 mm were larger between these months fig 3 a daily et rates were ranked to quantify the distribution of et rates during the observation periods for days when data are available for all three sites fig 4 a this analysis suggests that daily et rates are generally similar for calgary and halifax as would be expected given similar cumulative et for example daily et rates were less than 2 0 mm day 70 and 64 of the time in calgary and halifax respectively daily et rates were consistently larger in london with daily et rates less than 2 0 mm day in london on only 46 of reporting days over the observation period may to september 2013 and 2014 london received 1081 mm rainfall and as such et represented 67 of rainfall received similarly et in calgary represented 73 of 682 mm of rainfall received finally halifax received 1102 mm rainfall in the seven months when data were measured i e may june and sept 2013 june to sept 2014 with et representing 33 of rainfall these data suggest that both in calgary and london et returned a large amount of rainfall to the atmosphere reducing the volume of water discharged to storm sewers and providing evaporative cooling in halifax the percentage is less than that of london and calgary but the volume of et is similar to calgary where precipitation is lower it further suggests that climate and substrate moisture have a strong impact on et rates with et in london 50 greater than calgary and halifax 3 2 influence of soil moisture availability water saturation provides a quantitative means to determine the amount of water available for et and has been found to be an important factor controlling green roof et e g berretta et al 2014 poe et al 2015 in this study water saturation is defined as 1 w a t e r s a t u r a t i o n h h wp h fc h wp where h is the moisture available in the green roof module in mm hwp is wilting point in mm and hfc is the field capacity in mm wilting point and field capacity were determined from field studies that used the same substrate sims et al 2019 sims et al 2016 average water saturation for the three cities decreased from 0 57 in may to 0 41 in august but increased in september to 0 58 fig 3b similar to et the water saturation differed in each city with calgary systematically exhibiting the driest conditions with 78 of calculated water saturations less than 0 5 in comparison to 45 of calculated water saturations in london and 43 of calculated water saturations in halifax fig 4b water saturation was found to have a significant moderate correlation with daily et rates in calgary r 0 57 p 0 005 pearson correlation minitab 17 1 0 and significant weak correlation in london r 0 30 p 0 005 pearson water saturation and daily et rates were not correlated in halifax r 0 07 p 0 358 pearson given that et was not significantly correlated with water saturation in halifax but was significantly correlated to water saturation in calgary and that both cities exhibited similar et rates suggests that additional processes play an important controlling factor e g atmospheric forcing to evaluate the extent to which atmospheric forcing was responsible for observed et rates penman monteith potential et pet was calculated ranked and plotted fig 4c pet was consistently larger in calgary followed by halifax and then london this shows that greater pet in calgary did not translate to greater et rates given moisture limited conditions as suggested by the significant correlation to water saturation this analysis suggests that while halifax was not limited by water saturation it was likely limited by atmospheric forcing given the lower pet in comparison to calgary halifax had similar or greater pet compared to london and similar or greater water saturation yet et rates were typically larger in london importantly however larger pet and equivalent water saturations may not have occurred on the same day for example these graphs show ranked data so pet may have been large on one day while water saturation was low on that day to evaluate the impact of both water saturation and pet on the same day the product of water saturation and pet was calculated and then ranked for each city fig 4d use of the product of water saturation and pet has been used in other studies that investigated et in one location to assess reduction on et due to soil moisture limitations e g berretta et al 2014 poe et al 2015 in our study the curves for all cities are similar suggesting that while et is a function of both water saturation and atmospheric forcing pet pet governs et in wet humid climates e g halifax whereas moisture availability governs et in dry climates e g calgary in other climates e g london both factors drive green roof et this suggests consideration of solely pet or moisture availability will lead to poor et predictions 3 3 plant functional traits during observation period as discussed plant traits are important contributors to green roof performance to assess the extent to which plant traits impacted et rates plant coverage i e pin frame measurements and below ground biomass i e root mass were measured variation in plant coverage in london on over the 2014 field season is qualitatively shown in fig 2 peak plant coverage generally occurred between june to july at all sites with plant coverage generally greater or similar for the mixed treatment in comparison to the monoculture s spurium treatment fig a2 plant coverage for a canadensis and s heterolepis was typically sparser than the s spurium and mixed species treatments increased water stress conditions in calgary resulted in permanent wilting of a canadensis and s heterolepis for both plant species no 10 cm substrate depth treatments survived both the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons it is not clear if freezing during the winter months played a role in decreasing the viability of both species it should be noted that both a canadensis and s heterolepis survived in the mixed species treatments for a longer duration than the monoculture treatments these observations suggests that a canadensis and s heterolepis are likely not suitable for installation on green roofs in calgary due to its climatic conditions root mass decreased with substrate depth for all vegetation treatments fig 5 while the s spurium and the mixed species treatments had similar aboveground structure i e plant coverage their belowground structure specifically their root structure fig 5 differed for the monoculture s spurium treatment the majority of the roots were within the top 10 cm of the substrate as it has shallow fibrous roots these root characteristics have been previously noted for sedum species lu et al 2014 nagase and dunnett 2012 in comparison for the mixed species treatment root mass was present from the substrate surface to 15 cm depth the root mass for the monoculture s heterolepis treatment had a similar profile trend to the mixed species treatment between 5 cm and 15 cm depth within the first 5 cm depth of substrate the s heterolepis treatment 10 29 3 01 g had a lower root mass compared to the mixed species treatment due to the lack of s spurium which had a root mass of 25 78 3 15 g within this depth at a substrate depth deeper than 5 cm the presence of s heterolepis in the mixed species treatment resulted in an increase in root biomass due to the deep dense root biomass of s heterolepis fig 5 3 4 influence of plant functional traits and substrate depth on et rates manually weighed modules were used to evaluate the impact of vegetation type and substrate depth on et as only select s spurium modules were continually weighed on lysimeters at each site there were notable differences in cumulative et among the vegetation and substrate depth treatments fig 6 table a3 for the 15 cm substrate depth the mixed species treatments consistently had the highest cumulative et e g 224 mm in london 2014 compared to the monoculture species e g 182 197 mm in london 2014 table a3 cumulative et from the 15 cm substrate depth treatments were typically greater than the cumulate et from the 10 cm substrate depth treatments however in many instances et enhancements with increased depth were relatively small e g 10 of cumulative et the enhancement of et for the deeper treatment depth was consistently greater for the mixed treatment modules in comparison to s spurium irrespective of the city or year et enhancement for the increased depths was also typically greater for the mixed treatments in comparison to a canadensis and s heterolepis however there were measurement periods when deeper substrate depth led to greater et enhancement in the latter two cases these differences in et enhancement with depth may help inform some of the discrepancies in rainfall retention results in prior studies mentens et al 2006 soulis et al 2017 vanwoert et al 2005a yilmaz et al 2016 as our data suggest the amount of et enhancement with increased substrate depth is also a function of plant traits and climate the wilcoxon signed rank test conducted in minitab 17 1 0 was used to determine if daily et rates were statistically different between vegetation treatments daily et rates for each vegetation treatment for both years were combined for the analysis the et rates for the mixed species treatment were significantly different to the et rates for the s spurium s heterolepis and a canadensis treatments in all cities for the 15 cm substrate depth with daily et rates greater for the mixed species treatments table a4 as an example for the 15 cm depth treatments in london median differences in daily et rate between the mixed species treatment and the s spurium s heterolepis and a canadensis treatments over both field seasons were 0 36 mm day 0 47 mm day and 0 50 mm day respectively for the 10 cm depth treatments in calgary and halifax the daily et rate for the mixed species treatment was significantly different from the daily et rate for the s spurium treatment with median daily et rate 0 11 mm day higher for the mixed species treatment for both sites table a4 however in london there was no significant difference in et rates between the 10 cm depth mixed and s spurium treatments table a4 the extent to which plants enhance et was examined by comparing the mean cumulative et fig a3 table a3 and testing whether the daily et rates were significantly different between the vegetated treatments and unplanted modules i e no plants for the 2014 field season table a5 wilcoxon signed rank test in london and halifax the daily et rates for the 15 cm treatment depth were significantly different between the unplanted modules and all vegetated treatments with the exception of the a canadensis table a5 with et rates being higher for the vegetated treatments fig a3 table a3 in calgary daily et rates were not significantly different between the vegetated and unplanted modules which was likely due to lower moisture availability for evaporation and transpiration fig 2b as well as decreased plant health given this dataset it is difficult to definitively determine the rate limiting process for example the unplanted modules do not have a canopy shading on the substrate surface so it is in direct contact with incoming radiation energy and overlying atmospheric conditions for the vegetated modules a combination of evaporation and transpiration contributes to the observed et prior studies have also reported that the inclusion of vegetation consistently enhances green roof et berretta et al 2014 lundholm et al 2010b macivor and lundholm 2011 poe et al 2015 given the enhanced et from the vegetated treatments compared with the unplanted modules in london and halifax it can be concluded that plants provide significant benefits in regenerating the rainfall retention capacity of the substrate particularly in the mixed species treatments except in cities with drier climates where et is strongly limited by moisture content comparison between plant traits and et rates suggest that plant traits impacted the measured et rates in this study previous studies have examined the link between plant traits and green roof rainfall retention for example a study showed that plant species with extremely dense fibrous roots retained less water macivor and lundholm 2011 however other studies have found that the addition of roots results in higher porosity enhancing retention dunnett et al 2008 nagase and dunnett 2012 and detention poe et al 2015 in our study the mixed species treatments had the greatest root biomass at all depths the greatest plant coverage as well as the greatest et monoculture treatments were unable to occupy as much rooting space as the mixed treatment likely leading to greater exploitation of substrate resources and higher aboveground productivity s spurium had the largest root biomass close to the surface plant coverage similar or less than the mixed species treatment and typically the second largest et these data suggest that root mass distribution alone is not a good predictor of et rates given that s heterolepis and a canadensis generally had similar et rates but a canadensis had a relatively lower root mass further work is required to explore the cause of the higher et observed for the mixed species treatment modules compared to the monoculture treatments many sedum species reduce transpiration rates during drought periods leading to lower transpiration rates so combining sedums with grasses and broad leaved plants that have higher transpiration rates might increase et especially if the non sedum species gain some advantage of growing together with sedum matsuoka et al 2020 the movement of water from different depths of substrate to the surface was not quantified in this study it is possible that greater et rates for the mixed species treatment could be due to the greater canopy coverage for the mixed species particularly in london as well as moisture from deeper substrate layers being distributed to the shallower layers by the deep s heterolepis roots during prolonged drying periods through hydraulic lift the deep s heterolepis roots would provide water to shallow s spurium roots for subsequent transpiration after shallow moisture from a rainfall event was transpired the combination of shallow and deep roots in the mixed species treatment provides additional insight to the importance of selecting green roof plants with complementary functional traits to optimize the regeneration of the substrate s retention capacity during drying periods through et 4 conclusions et is an important driver for green roof performance this study has provided new insights on how climatological conditions influence et for example available moisture in green roof substrate limited et rates in calgary arid climate whereas atmospheric forcing rather than moisture content limited et rates in halifax wet and humid climate the percentage of cumulative rainfall that was returned to the atmosphere by et was greatest for calgary 73 and london 67 compared with halifax 33 whereas the amount returned to atmosphere was greatest in london 724 mm followed by calgary 498 mm this study also illustrated the importance of selecting suitable vegetation types to enhance et and subsequently the hydrologic performance of green roofs of the vegetation treatments used in this study the mixed species treatments typically had the greatest et followed by s spurium at each site and for both 15 cm and 10 cm depth treatments both the mixed species and s spurium treatments generally had higher et rates than a canadensis and s heterolepis treatments throughout the field season as such in similar climates green roofs with monoculture of s spurium or a mixture of s spurium s heterolepis and a canadensis will more readily restore the retention capacity of the green roof substrate faster than a green roof with only s heterolepis and a canadensis if structural load on roofs is of concern our results suggest that while 10 cm substrate depth will provide slightly less et and therefore rainfall retention in comparison to 15 cm substrate depth the 10 cm substrate depth still provides very good et performance finally this study indicates the need to consider plant health and survivability in different climates for example the calgary green roof suffered from poor plant health as such the vegetation did not enhance et and subsequently did not improve the hydrologic and cooling performance of the green roof system in summary this study has provided new insights of the importance of both moisture availability and atmospheric conditions for prediction of et as well as the benefits of using plant mixtures in green roof systems additional work is required to further improve our et predictions including long term quantification of et in a range of climates as well as determine optimal green roof plant mixtures for a given climatic condition and desired function declaration of competing interest the authors

2428,evapotranspiration et is the key hydrologic process governing the capacity of a green roof to retain rainfall as it regenerates available water storage space in the green roof substrate soil between rainfall events in this field study the impact of climatological conditions vegetation type and substrate depth on et rates were evaluated from experimental modular extensive green roofs installed in three climate regions in canada calgary ab prairies london on great lakes st lawrence and halifax ns atlantic maritime daily et rates and cumulative et over two field seasons were quantified for two substrate depths 10 and 15 cm substrate only treatments no vegetation and four vegetation treatments monoculture treatments of sedum spurium sporobolus heterolepis and aquilegia canadensis and a mixed species treatment consisting of the three aforementioned species 73 67 and 33 of the cumulative rainfall was returned to the atmosphere via et over the two field seasons in calgary london and halifax respectively importantly et rates were shown to be a strong function of substrate moisture content as well as atmospheric forcing with the relative importance of each varying between the different cities et rates were typically greater in the mixed species treatment in comparison to the three monoculture treatments sedum spurium sporobolus heterolepis and aquilegia

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extensive green roofs have been proposed to provide a non intrusive solution to reduce stormwater runoff through rainfall retention as well as mitigate the urban heat island effect carter and rasmussen 2006 cuthbert et al 2022 fassman beck et al 2013 talebi et al 2019 vesuviano et al 2014 evapotranspiration et is the primary driver governing the ability of a green roof to achieve these objectives as it frees up water storage space for precipitation rainfall retention in green roof substrate soil while also

conditions this includes studies examining et in controlled laboratory or greenhouse settings as well as under field conditions where climate and rainfall are not controlled under controlled

and atmospheric forcing e g humidity and temperature nagase and dunnett 2012 poe et al 2015 under field conditions the initial moisture content depends on the antecedent drying period and the size of

substrate type and depth vegetation type and study design i e field greenhouse or laboratory comparison of et results between literature studies is difficult cascone et al 2019 as is determining the relative contribution of the various factors to measured et rates the impact of climate on green roof et rates has been evaluated in modeling and field studies cascone et al 2019 in experimental studies this has been achieved by investigating the impact of season or atmospheric forcing e g temperature and humidity on et rates at an individual site e g poe et al 2015 for example under well watered climate controlled conditions poe et al 2015 found that et rates are higher during the summer months when there is more energy available for et in contrast et rates in the spring are lower due to lower available energy for et berretta et al 2014 marasco et al 2014 while these prior studies provide valuable insights related to the impact of climate on green roof et they are limited by the range of climatological conditions at the study sites the seasonal behaviour described here would be consistent with natural environments however with green roofs variability in et is likely higher on short time scales especially in the summer given the systems limited ability to store water as well as the types of plants used as such it is important to study et on green roofs as we can t necessarily use knowledge from other environments as a direct analogue quantification of et with a similar green roof design in a broader range of climates would enable a broader assessment of the impact of climate on et the depth of green roof substrate is an important design parameter as it can impact retention directly by increasing overall water holding capacity yilmaz et al 2016 or indirectly by increasing plant leaf biomass rowe et al 2012 and transpiration thus total et leading to lower substrate water content between rain events prior studies have reported increased rainfall retention with increased substrate depth mentens et al 2006 soulis et al 2017 vanwoert et al 2005a yilmaz et al 2016 the extent to which rainfall retention increases with substrate depth varies in the literature with the study of vanwoert et al 2005a only reporting a few difference in total retention in their field green roof study that had substrate depths ranging from 2 5 to 6 cm on the other hand other studies reported cumulative rainfall retention increased by 10 with increasing substrate depth e g soulis et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2016 notably the latter studies used larger substrate depths including larger minimum substrate depth i e 8 cm differences in prior study findings could be due to a range of reasons including the extent to which et freed up pore space for rainfall retention differences in depth and type of substrates used and differences in vegetation these studies were completed under different climatic conditions e g detroit usa nantes france and athens greece so differences in et rates and associated rainfall retention would be expected given that these studies were completed in different locations and different green roof design it is not possible to adequately determine the extent to which substrate characteristics and climate impact et rates and thus rainfall retention plant morphological traits are important contributors to the processes

ability to survive and grow under harsh roof microclimatic conditions vanwoert et al 2005b however there is significant interest in using a broader range of plant species including native species in

mixture of species with different and yet complementary plant traits heim and lundholm 2014 lundholm et al 2010b lundholm 2015 nagase and dunnett 2012 the extent to which a mixture of species improves green roof rainfall retention performance has been investigated with conflicting results dunnett et al 2008 lundholm et al 2010a macivor and lundholm 2011 nagase and dunnett 2012 some studies reported no additional benefits from having a mixture of species dunnett et al 2008 nagase and dunnett 2012 whereas other studies found some positive benefits on rainfall retention lundholm et al 2010a and substrate cooling macivor and lundholm 2011 additionally selection of plants with complementary functional traits can potentially enhance the effectiveness at which green roofs provide ecosystem services the environmental and design factors synergistically affect et rates in that various vegetation types respond to ambient climate conditions differently and various plant root structures can also interact with substrate depths differently dunnett et al 2008 kazemi and mohorko 2017 zhang et al 2018 to date there is limited knowledge on the rate at which the rainfall retention capacity is regenerated i e et rate for green roofs with different vegetation types planted in varying substrate depths and climate conditions the aim of this study is to evaluate how green roof et varies in response to different green roof design configurations in different climate regions the study uses a novel experimental design to quantitatively investigate the influence of green roof substrate depth and vegetation types including mixed species on et rates from extensive modular green roofs in different climate regions this understanding is needed to inform green roof design aimed at enhancing rainfall retention performance of this increasingly popular low impact development option for urban areas 2 materials and methods three experimental green roofs with identical extensive modular design were constructed in london on calgary ab and halifax ns in july 2012 fig 1 table 1 sims et al 2016 tran et al 2019 in london on the green roof was installed on the 4th floor of talbot college at the university of western ontario campus in calgary ab the green roof was located on the 3rd floor of the earth sciences building at the university of calgary campus in halifax ns the green roof was located on the roof of a five storey office building in a business park each city had a unique climate table 1 and fig a1 the green roof system was supplied by liveroof and consisted of extensive 30 cm 30 cm square modules with a depth of 10 cm or 15 cm liveroof mount brydges on canada these green roof modules included built in drainage flow paths at the base of the module to facilitate runoff modules were separated from each other by 1 2 cm at the top edges to facilitate individual modules to be weighed the centre of the experimental green roof array was elevated at a height of 0 2 m surrounding the elevated array were modules sloped at 12 which were then bordered by other modules lying flat on the building s roof surface all 15 cm depth modules that were lying flat on the roof surface were underlain by 2 5 cm styrofoam insulation sheets and 10 cm modules were underlain by an additional 5 cm styrofoam the configuration of the green roofs were similar at all three sites fig 1 the same substrate soil which was provided by liveroof was used at all three sites consisting of a mixture of fine and coarse hadite crushed dolostone bark peat moss and some fertilizer hydraulic properties of the substrate were quantified by perelli 2014 thesubstrate satisfied the requirements set out by the german fll for green roofs fll 2002 green roof modules were planted with one of the three plant species or a mixture of all three the three plant species selected were sedum spurium s spurium aquilegia canadensis a canadensis and sporobolus heterolepis s heterolepis all plants were grown in a nursery before being transplanted into the green roof modules each species come from different lifeform groups with distinguishable traits fig 2 s spurium is a succulent low lying species with an upright branch structure and relatively small broad leaves a canadensis is a herbaceous species with upright branches and has relatively larger leaves which spans over a smaller total leaf area compared to s spurium s heterolepis is a densely tufted graminoid species with a mixture of short upright thin leaves and longer drooping leaves visual observations suggest that s spurium and a canadensis on average have leaves which are relatively parallel to the ground planophile leaf angle distribution lad and s heterolepis has vertically angled leaves erectophile lad a series of unplanted modules were also included to evaluate the effect of plants on the et rates data were collected to capture the full cycle of plant growth for all three species i e coming out of dormancy in late april the photosynthetically active period spanning from early may to late august the flowering period which varies for each species and the return to dormancy in late september and early october fig 2 table a2 plant coverage and the root mass distribution were quantified to assess their impact on et the pin frame method lundholm et al 2010a tran et al 2019 was used to quantitatively assess plant coverage for individual modules for all vegetated treatments monthly over the 2013 field season and biweekly over the 2014 field season the pin frame sampling area 30 cm 30 cm was divided evenly into 16 sampling points and the total number of leaves touched from each point was used to estimate the plant coverage for each module treatment destructive root mass analysis was conducted at the end of the 2014 field season in london on using one 15 cm substrate depth module of each vegetation type the method used was similar to kabganian et al 2002 here each module was sectioned into four quadrants which were then sectioned into four depth intervals 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 13 cm and 13 15 cm for each depth interval the substrate was rinsed off the roots which were then oven dried at 70 c until the root mass remained constant the dry weights from each depth interval were used for the root mass analysis continuous and daily weight measurements of vegetated and unplanted modules from which et and water storage could be calculated were collected using lysimeters and a portable electronic scale chestnut tools lee valley respectively the lysimeters used an interface spi 25 or spi 50 load cell durham instruments which measured the continuous changes in module weight at high resolution lysimeters were connected to a cr3000 campbell scientific data logger to allow for continuous data collection data were then averaged at one and five minute intervals each site had lysimeters installed under at least two s spurium modules with 15 cm substrate depth a portable electronic scale was used to measure the daily changes in module weight for all other modules the number of manually weighed modules ranged from 40 to 42 depending on the site to allow for comparison between the two methods used 15 cm s spurium modules were also weighed manually to check for discrepancies between the lysimeter and electronic scale measurements the modules were manually weighed daily during the spring and summer months following snow melt and when the modules were not frozen to the ground table a2 manual weighing was not consistently conducted daily and in some cases drying periods were missed as such cumulative moisture loss quantified from the lysimeter measurements cannot be directly compared to manually weighed data however manual weighing data were ideal for comparison of et from different vegetation types and substrate depths in a given city the et rates reported in this study were quantified as the change in weight over a certain duration during which time there was no rainfall rainfall was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges te525ws texas electronics inc connected to the dataloggers and installed at the height of the vegetation within the elevated centre area of the green roof an additional rain gauge was installed adjacent to the green roof to quantify any spatial variability in rainfall tipping buckets mounted beneath the elevated platform were also used to measure drainage from s spurium 15 cm modules sims et al 2019 sims et al 2016 net radiation net radiometer kipp zonen nr lite 2 wind speed rm young wind sentry as well as air temperature and relative humidity campbell scientific hc3 s3 data were also recorded on the dataloggers these data were used to quantify penman monteith potential evapotranspiration pet 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of climatological conditions on evapotranspiration rates cumulative et over the growing seasons for each city was calculated as a means to compare the total et loss between climates each city is located in distinct climate regions with calgary located within the prairie climate region london the south eastern climate region and halifax the atlantic maritime climate region in this analysis lysimeter data for s spurium with 15 cm substrate depth was used as it provides nearly continuous quantification of moisture loss i e et over the observation reporting period i e may to sept table a2 moisture gain due to precipitation was filtered out of the calculation cumulative et from may to sept averaged over the two years i e 2013 and 2014 was notably lower in calgary 251 mm water with 255 mm in 2013 and 247 mm in 2014 than in london 360 mm water with 369 mm in 2013 and 351 mm in 2014 due to instrument issues in halifax data for may 2014 as well as june and july 2013 were unavailable cumulative et for the seven months with complete et data in halifax i e may june and sept 2013 and june to sept 2014 was 364 mm water in comparison to 331 mm water for calgary and 490 m water for london for the same months averaged over the observation period this represents an et rate of 2 4 mm day for london compared to an et rate of 1 7 mm day for halifax when data are available and 1 6 mm day for calgary these ranges in et rates are comparable to berghage et al 2007 berretta et al 2014 poe et al 2015 as expected et was not constant at each site during the observation period due to changes in climatological conditions e g average air temperature relative humidity rainfall volume and rainfall frequency and available substrate moisture the extent to which cumulative monthly et decreased through the growing season differed in each city for example average cumulative et decreased from 86 mm in june to 60 mm in september in london mean cumulative monthly et considering two study years decreases in halifax i e from 81 mm to 28 mm and calgary i e from 81 mm to 37 mm were larger between these months fig 3 a daily et rates were ranked to quantify the distribution of et rates during the observation periods for days when data are available for all three sites fig 4 a this analysis suggests that daily et rates are generally similar for calgary and halifax as would be expected given similar cumulative et for example daily et rates were less than 2 0 mm day 70 and 64 of the time in calgary and halifax respectively daily et rates were consistently larger in london with daily et rates less than 2 0 mm day in london on only 46 of reporting days over the observation period may to september 2013 and 2014 london received 1081 mm rainfall and as such et represented 67 of rainfall received similarly et in calgary represented 73 of 682 mm of rainfall received finally halifax received 1102 mm rainfall in the seven months when data were measured i e may june and sept 2013 june to sept 2014 with et representing 33 of rainfall these data suggest that both in calgary and london et returned a large amount of rainfall to the atmosphere reducing the volume of water discharged to storm sewers and providing evaporative cooling in halifax the percentage is less than that of london and calgary but the volume of et is similar to calgary where precipitation is lower it further suggests that climate and substrate moisture have a strong impact on et rates with et in london 50 greater than calgary and halifax 3 2 influence of soil moisture availability water saturation provides a quantitative means to determine the amount of water available for et and has been found to be an important factor controlling green roof et e g berretta et al 2014 poe et al 2015 in this study water saturation is defined as 1 w a t e r s a t u r a t i o n h h wp h fc h wp where h is the moisture available in the green roof module in mm hwp is wilting point in mm and hfc is the field capacity in mm wilting point and field capacity were determined from field studies that used the same substrate sims et al 2019 sims et al 2016 average water saturation for the three cities decreased from 0 57 in may to 0 41 in august but increased in september to 0 58 fig 3b similar to et the water saturation differed in each city with calgary systematically exhibiting the driest conditions with 78 of calculated water saturations less than 0 5 in comparison to 45 of calculated water saturations in london and 43 of calculated water saturations in halifax fig 4b water saturation was found to have a significant moderate correlation with daily et rates in calgary r 0 57 p 0 005 pearson correlation minitab 17 1 0 and significant weak correlation in london r 0 30 p 0 005 pearson water saturation and daily et rates were not correlated in halifax r 0 07 p 0 358 pearson given that et was not significantly correlated with water saturation in halifax but was significantly correlated to water saturation in calgary and that both cities exhibited similar et rates suggests that additional processes play an important controlling factor e g atmospheric forcing to evaluate the extent to which atmospheric forcing was responsible for observed et rates penman monteith potential et pet was calculated ranked and plotted fig 4c pet was consistently larger in calgary followed by halifax and then london this shows that greater pet in calgary did not translate to greater et rates given moisture limited conditions as suggested by the significant correlation to water saturation this analysis suggests that while halifax was not limited by water saturation it was likely limited by atmospheric forcing given the lower pet in comparison to calgary halifax had similar or greater pet compared to london and similar or greater water saturation yet et rates were typically larger in london importantly however larger pet and equivalent water saturations may not have occurred on the same day for example these graphs show ranked data so pet may have been large on one day while water saturation was low on that day to evaluate the impact of both water saturation and pet on the same day the product of water saturation and pet was calculated and then ranked for each city fig 4d use of the product of water saturation and pet has been used in other studies that investigated et in one location to assess reduction on et due to soil moisture limitations e g berretta et al 2014 poe et al 2015 in our study the curves for all cities are similar suggesting that while et is a function of both water saturation and atmospheric forcing pet pet governs et in wet humid climates e g halifax whereas moisture availability governs et in dry climates e g calgary in other climates e g london both factors drive green roof et this suggests consideration of solely pet or moisture availability will lead to poor et predictions 3 3 plant functional traits during observation period as discussed plant traits are important contributors to green roof performance to assess the extent to which plant traits impacted et rates plant coverage i e pin frame measurements and below ground biomass i e root mass were measured variation in plant coverage in london on over the 2014 field season is qualitatively shown in fig 2 peak plant coverage generally occurred between june to july at all sites with plant coverage generally greater or similar for the mixed treatment in comparison to the monoculture s spurium treatment fig a2 plant coverage for a canadensis and s heterolepis was typically sparser than the s spurium and mixed species treatments increased water stress conditions in calgary resulted in permanent wilting of a canadensis and s heterolepis for both plant species no 10 cm substrate depth treatments survived both the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons it is not clear if freezing during the winter months played a role in decreasing the viability of both species it should be noted that both a canadensis and s heterolepis survived in the mixed species treatments for a longer duration than the monoculture treatments these observations suggests that a canadensis and s heterolepis are likely not suitable for installation on green roofs in calgary due to its climatic conditions root mass decreased with substrate depth for all vegetation treatments fig 5 while the s spurium and the mixed species treatments had similar aboveground structure i e plant coverage their belowground structure specifically their root structure fig 5 differed for the monoculture s spurium treatment the majority of the roots were within the top 10 cm of the substrate as it has shallow fibrous roots these root characteristics have been previously noted for sedum species lu et al 2014 nagase and dunnett 2012 in comparison for the mixed species treatment root mass was present from the substrate surface to 15 cm depth the root mass for the monoculture s heterolepis treatment had a similar profile trend to the mixed species treatment between 5 cm and 15 cm depth within the first 5 cm depth of substrate the s heterolepis treatment 10 29 3 01 g had a lower root mass compared to the mixed species treatment due to the lack of s spurium which had a root mass of 25 78 3 15 g within this depth at a substrate depth deeper than 5 cm the presence of s heterolepis in the mixed species treatment resulted in an increase in root biomass due to the deep dense root biomass of s heterolepis fig 5 3 4 influence of plant functional traits and substrate depth on et rates manually weighed modules were used to evaluate the impact of vegetation type and substrate depth on et as only select s spurium modules were continually weighed on lysimeters at each site there were notable differences in cumulative et among the vegetation and substrate depth treatments fig 6 table a3 for the 15 cm substrate depth the mixed species treatments consistently had the highest cumulative et e g 224 mm in london 2014 compared to the monoculture species e g 182 197 mm in london 2014 table a3 cumulative et from the 15 cm substrate depth treatments were typically greater than the cumulate et from the 10 cm substrate depth treatments however in many instances et enhancements with increased depth were relatively small e g 10 of cumulative et the enhancement of et for the deeper treatment depth was consistently greater for the mixed treatment modules in comparison to s spurium irrespective of the city or year et enhancement for the increased depths was also typically greater for the mixed treatments in comparison to a canadensis and s heterolepis however there were measurement periods when deeper substrate depth led to greater et enhancement in the latter two cases these differences in et enhancement with depth may help inform some of the discrepancies in rainfall retention results in prior studies mentens et al 2006 soulis et al 2017 vanwoert et al 2005a yilmaz et al 2016 as our data suggest the amount of et enhancement with increased substrate depth is also a function of plant traits and climate the wilcoxon signed rank test conducted in minitab 17 1 0 was used to determine if daily et rates were statistically different between vegetation treatments daily et rates for each vegetation treatment for both years were combined for the analysis the et rates for the mixed species treatment were significantly different to the et rates for the s spurium s heterolepis and a canadensis treatments in all cities for the 15 cm substrate depth with daily et rates greater for the mixed species treatments table a4 as an example for the 15 cm depth treatments in london median differences in daily et rate between the mixed species treatment and the s spurium s heterolepis and a canadensis treatments over both field seasons were 0 36 mm day 0 47 mm day and 0 50 mm day respectively for the 10 cm depth treatments in calgary and halifax the daily et rate for the mixed species treatment was significantly different from the daily et rate for the s spurium treatment with median daily et rate 0 11 mm day higher for the mixed species treatment for both sites table a4 however in london there was no significant difference in et rates between the 10 cm depth mixed and s spurium treatments table a4 the extent to which plants enhance et was examined by comparing the mean cumulative et fig a3 table a3 and testing whether the daily et rates were significantly different between the vegetated treatments and unplanted modules i e no plants for the 2014 field season table a5 wilcoxon signed rank test in london and halifax the daily et rates for the 15 cm treatment depth were significantly different between the unplanted modules and all vegetated treatments with the exception of the a canadensis table a5 with et rates being higher for the vegetated treatments fig a3 table a3 in calgary daily et rates were not significantly different between the vegetated and unplanted modules which was likely due to lower moisture availability for evaporation and transpiration fig 2b as well as decreased plant health given this dataset it is difficult to definitively determine the rate limiting process for example the unplanted modules do not have a canopy shading on the substrate surface so it is in direct contact with incoming radiation energy and overlying atmospheric conditions for the vegetated modules a combination of evaporation and transpiration contributes to the observed et prior studies have also reported that the inclusion of vegetation consistently enhances green roof et berretta et al 2014 lundholm et al 2010b macivor and lundholm 2011 poe et al 2015 given the enhanced et from the vegetated treatments compared with the unplanted modules in london and halifax it can be concluded that plants provide significant benefits in regenerating the rainfall retention capacity of the substrate particularly in the mixed species treatments except in cities with drier climates where et is strongly limited by moisture content comparison between plant traits and et rates suggest that plant traits impacted the measured et rates in this study previous studies have examined the link between plant traits and green roof rainfall retention for example a study showed that plant species with extremely dense fibrous roots retained less water macivor and lundholm 2011 however other studies have found that the addition of roots results in higher porosity enhancing retention dunnett et al 2008 nagase and dunnett 2012 and detention poe et al 2015 in our study the mixed species treatments had the greatest root biomass at all depths the greatest plant coverage as well as the greatest et monoculture treatments were unable to occupy as much rooting space as the mixed treatment likely leading to greater exploitation of substrate resources and higher aboveground productivity s spurium had the largest root biomass close to the surface plant coverage similar or less than the mixed species treatment and typically the second largest et these data suggest that root mass distribution alone is not a good predictor of et rates given that s heterolepis and a canadensis generally had similar et rates but a canadensis had a relatively lower root mass further work is required to explore the cause of the higher et observed for the mixed species treatment modules compared to the monoculture treatments many sedum species reduce transpiration rates during drought periods leading to lower transpiration rates so combining sedums with grasses and broad leaved plants that have higher transpiration rates might increase et especially if the non sedum species gain some advantage of growing together with sedum matsuoka et al 2020 the movement of water from different depths of substrate to the surface was not quantified in this study it is possible that greater et rates for the mixed species treatment could be due to the greater canopy coverage for the mixed species particularly in london as well as moisture from deeper substrate layers being distributed to the shallower layers by the deep s heterolepis roots during prolonged drying periods through hydraulic lift the deep s heterolepis roots would provide water to shallow s spurium roots for subsequent transpiration after shallow moisture from a rainfall event was transpired the combination of shallow and deep roots in the mixed species treatment provides additional insight to the importance of selecting green roof plants with complementary functional traits to optimize the regeneration of the substrate s retention capacity during drying periods through et 4 conclusions et is an important driver for green roof performance this study has provided new insights on how climatological conditions influence et for example available moisture in green roof substrate limited et rates in calgary arid climate whereas atmospheric forcing rather than moisture content limited et rates in halifax wet and humid climate the percentage of cumulative rainfall that was returned to the atmosphere by et was greatest for calgary 73 and london 67 compared with halifax 33 whereas the amount returned to atmosphere was greatest in london 724 mm followed by calgary 498 mm this study also illustrated the importance of selecting suitable vegetation types to enhance et and subsequently the hydrologic performance of green roofs of the vegetation treatments used in this study the mixed species treatments typically had the greatest et followed by s spurium at each site and for both 15 cm and 10 cm depth treatments both the mixed species and s spurium treatments generally had higher et rates than a canadensis and s heterolepis treatments throughout the field season as such in similar climates green roofs with monoculture of s spurium or a mixture of s spurium s heterolepis and a canadensis will more readily restore the retention capacity of the green roof substrate faster than a green roof with only s heterolepis and a canadensis if structural load on roofs is of concern our results suggest that while 10 cm substrate depth will provide slightly less et and therefore rainfall retention in comparison to 15 cm substrate depth the 10 cm substrate depth still provides very good et performance finally this study indicates the need to consider plant health and survivability in different climates for example the calgary green roof suffered from poor plant health as such the vegetation did not enhance et and subsequently did not improve the hydrologic and cooling performance of the green roof system in summary this study has provided new insights of the importance of both moisture availability and atmospheric conditions for prediction of et as well as the benefits of using plant mixtures in green roof systems additional work is required to further improve our et predictions including long term quantification of et in a range of climates as well as determine optimal green roof plant mixtures for a given climatic condition and desired function declaration of competing interest the authors

2429,predicting the dispersion process of environmental transport in wetland flows is significant to some ecological engineering applications by extending a previous study guo and chen 2022 an analytical solution of the steady state concentration field for solute transport from a continuous release source in a submerged vegetated flow with the effect of bed absorption is presented in this work results illustrate that adopting different orthogonal basis functions does not affect the result but affects the convergence rate of the solution near the release source under the bed absorption concentration approaches zero at the far field concentration is affected by different bed absorption rates when the absorption rates are small while it is hardly affected by different absorption rates when the bed absorption rates are large when the release position is above the bed wall different bed absorption rates do not affect the near field concentration where the vertical dispersion of solute has not arrived at the bed wall under the same bed absorption rate concentration decays more quickly along the downstream distance when the release position is near the bed wall but the release positions almost do not affect the downstream distance where the concentration tends to zero keywords submerged vegetated flow steady state concentration field bed absorption continuous release source environmental dispersion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation widely exists in rivers open channel flows and wetlands which has many ecological functions such as improving water quality and increasing species diversity nepf 2012 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 the presence of vegetation in flow can affect the law of conveyance sediment erosion and deposition and element cycling huai et al 2021 knowledge of the pollutant dispersion process in vegetated flows is significant to some ecological engineering applications such as wastewater treatment and ecological environment management dotro et al 2017 von sperling and sperling 2007 solute dispersion in vegetated wetland flows has been extensively studied in recent years by different models due to the existence of vegetation the hydrodynamic structure of a vegetated flow is inherently characterized with multi scales according to flow conditions different models are adopted to depict the flow and mass transport in vegetated flows when the flow is slow basic equations for momentum and mass transport for a vegetated flow can be depicted at the phase average scale liu and masliyah 2005 zeng and chen 2011 under the framework of phase averaged models solute dispersion in vegetated wetland flows has been substantially explored by different analytical methods for example solute dispersion in depth dominated wetland flows wu et al 2011b zeng et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 wang and huai 2018 width dominated wetland flows wu et al 2011a zeng et al 2014 multi layer wetland flows jiang and chen 2019 wang et al 2013 2014 and wetland flow with rectangular cross sections guo et al 2018 have been investigated active particles dispersion in wetland flows has been recently explored guan et al 2022 when the reynolds number of the vegetated flow is large the double averaging time spatial averaging method is usually applied nikora et al 2007a b under the double averaging framework solute dispersion in vegetated flows has been further explored solute dispersion from an instantaneous release source in a flow with modeled submerged vegetation rooted vegetation with a vertical extent less than the water depth was experimentally studied by murphy et al 2007 then measurements of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for solute dispersion in a channel with living vegetation were also conducted shucksmith et al 2011 2010 research on the velocity and turbulent diffusivity profiles of the submerged vegetated flow is hot and various models are presented such as the two layer velocity model battiato et al 2011 three layer velocity model huai et al 2009 mixing layer velocity model ghisalberti and nepf 2002 and three layer eddy diffusivity model ghisalberti and nepf 2008 liang and wu 2014 follett et al 2019 moreover the hydrodynamics of turbulent flow through submerged flexible vegetation is experimentally investigated to better simulate the real wetland situation huai et al 2019 based on prescribed velocity and turbulent diffusivity profiles solute dispersion in a submerged vegetated flow can be analytically and numerically analyzed a simplified two zone model murphy et al 2007 and n zone model shucksmith et al 2011 have been adopted to predict the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the submerged vegetated flow guo et al 2020 analytically explored the solute dispersion process in a submerged vegetated flow by asymptotic expansion method based on a mixing layer velocity model and a four zone vertical turbulent diffusivity profile furthermore numerical simulations of solute dispersion in submerged vegetated flows by the random displacement method have also been conducted liang and wu 2014 follett et al 2019 the above studies focused on the transient dispersion due to an instantaneous release source in a submerged vegetated flow dispersion of solute from a continuous source which is another common release type in practical applications also deserves attention under the condition of continuous release a steady state concentration field can be obtained finally the steady state vertical concentration profiles of solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow were experimentally measured by ghisalberti and nepf 2005 analytical effort in the steady state concentration field has also been done based on a generalized integral transform technique cotta and mikhailov 1993 which is widely adopted to explore solute transport in rivers de barros et al 2006 de barros and cotta 2007 the steady state concentration distribution in a submerged vegetated flow has been studied rubol et al 2016 with obtained system of coupled ordinary differential equations solved numerically rubol et al 2016 s work is referred to as a semi analytical study recently guo and chen 2022 analytically explored the steady state concentration field for solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow where relations between transient dispersion and steady dispersion were discussed and the specific concentration distribution was detailedly described these studies help us to comprehend the transport process of solutes in vegetated flows nevertheless in terms of solute transport in a vegetated flow with bed absorption which can characterize the ecological effect of degrading pollutants there are few studies actually there is a lot of research on solute dispersion in flows with the effect of wall absorption sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 smith 1983 ng and yip 2001 ng 2006 nguyen and papavassiliou 2008 wang et al 2022 recently transient dispersion of solute from an instantaneous release source in the wetland flow with bed absorption has been studied under the framework of phase averaged models wang et al 2020 2019 guo et al 2019 wang and chen 2017 however the steady state concentration field due to a continuous release source under the effect of bed absorption for solute transport in a vegetated flow has not been studied so far therefore to fill this gap the present work aims to comprehensively explore the steady state concentration field under the effect of bed absorption for solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow by extending the previous work guo and chen 2022 concentration distributions with different bed absorption rates and under different release positions will be detailedly characterized the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the mathematical formulation section 3 illustrates the method and solutions results and discussion including comparison with previous work and specific steady state concentration distribution are illustrated in section 4 summary and conclusions are provided in the final section 2 formulation by extending the previous work guo and chen 2022 we study solute transport in an open channel flow with uniform dense rigid submerged vegetation in considering the effect of bed absorption as shown in fig 1 2 1 governing equations when a solute is continuously released a steady state concentration field can be obtained finally the steady state concentration field can be described by guo and chen 2022 rubol et al 2016 1 u y c s

2019 following the previous work guo and chen 2022 a mixing layer velocity model ghisalberti and nepf 2002 2006 follett et al 2019 and a spatially dependent vertical turbulent dispersivity liang and wu 2014 follett et al 2019 are adopted as illustrated in fig 1 the mixing layer velocity profile follows a hyperbolic tangent shape which is described as ghisalberti and nepf 2006 13 u y u 1 u 2 2 u 2

the middle mixing layer the above parameters can be estimated by the experiments and empirical formulas as discussed in section 4 4 in the previous work guo and chen 2022 3 method and solutions since the boundary conditions are homogeneous a basis of linearly independent normalized vectors satisfying the below eigenvalue problem 15 d 2 φ n d y 2 β n 2 φ n 16 d y 0 d φ n d y y 0 α φ n 17 d φ n d y y 1 0 where β n 2 is an eigenvalue and φ n y is the corresponding eigenfunction by solving the above equations we can obtain the transcendental equation for eigenvalues β n n 1 2 3 18 β n tan β n α d y 0 the corresponding eigenfunctions are 19 φ n y cos β n 1 y the norm of each eigenfunction is 20 n φ n 0 1 φ n 2 y d y 0 1 cos 2 β n 1 y d y β n 2 h 2 h 2 β n 2 h 2 where h α d y 0 then we can obtain the normalized eigenfunctions as φ n φ n n φ n the analytical solution of eqs 9 12 can be expressed as rubol et al 2016 21 c s x y n 1 a n x φ n y where a n x n 1 2 3 are the unknown coefficients to be determined submitting the solution eq 21 into the governing eq 9 we get 22 n 1 u y φ n y d a n x d x n 1 d d y d y y d φ n y d y a n x considering the eigenfunction eq 15 we obtain

to the same upper integer value of n notice that b n n is a symmetric matrix due to 29 r b r m 1 n n 1 n 0 1 u y φ m y φ n y r m r n d y 0 1 u y m 1 n φ m y r m 2 d y 0 where r is an arbitrary non zero vector and means conjugate transposition therefore b n n is a positive definite matrix which is invertible and its inverse matrix b n n 1 is also a positive definite matrix horn and johnson 2013 kumar and sharan 2010 moreover coefficients of matrix e n n can be rewritten as 30 e m n 0 1 d d y d y y d φ n y d y φ m y d y 0 1 d d y d y y d φ n y d y φ m y d y 0 1 d y y d φ n y d y d φ m y d y d

implies that e n n is a negative definite matrix whose all eigenvalues are negative and real the product of a positive definite matrix b n n 1 and a negative definite matrix e n n i e m n n has all negative eigenvalues same number as matrix e n n horn and johnson 2013 the above obtained eq 25 is a linear homogeneous system with constant coefficients which can be analytically solved using the fundamental solution matrix q x the fundamental solution matrix of eq 25 can be obtained through solving the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the constant coefficient matrix m i e 32 m z λ z where z is the eigenvector and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue which can be obtained through calculation software because the number of z of m equals n as illustrated above we have 33 q x exp λ 1 x z 1 exp λ 2 x z 2 exp λ n x z n then the general solution of a x can be obtained as 34 a x q x c where c is a vector with n arbitrary constants with a known which contains n undetermined constant coefficients the general solution of c s can be obtained as 35 c s x y m 1 n a m x φ m y the unique solution can be obtained using the boundary condition eq 12 to determine the arbitrary coefficients that is 36 m 1 n a m 0 φ m y δ y h 0 u y integrating the above equation with φ n y from y 0 to 1 we obtain 37 a n 0 0 1 φ n y δ y h 0 u y d y which are linear algebraic equations with the solutions of n undetermined constant coefficients by vertically integrating eq 35 vertical mean concentration distribution c s x can be obtained as 38 c s x 0 1 c s x y d y 4 results and discussion in this section the reliability of the above analytical model is to be discussed first and then the steady state concentration fields with different bed absorption rates and under different release positions are to be characterized respectively flow conditions and parameters of a submerged vegetated flow are collected from the previous experimental study ghisalberti and nepf 2005 as illustrated in table 1 run i in ghisalberti and nepf 2005 4 1 validation of the above analytical model 4 1 1 comparison with a simplified case to test the reliability of the above analytical model and codes we used a comparison with a simplified case with constant u y and d y is conducted when u and d y are constant and α 0 the dimensionless analytical solution can be easily obtained as eigenvalue problem without the bed absorption is illustrated in appendix a 39 c s x y 1 2 n 1 cos β n h 0 cos β n y exp β n 2 x comparisons of longitudinal concentration distribution at y 0 5 and vertical concentration distribution at x 0 01 between the above analytical model and direct analytical solution are illustrated in fig 2 where h 0 h y 0 298 as seen the results obtained by the above analytical model are consistent well with those calculated directly by the analytical solution eq 39 our model and codes are reliable 4 1 2 convergence analysis because the above analytical model is a series solution convergence analysis is conducted to determine the appropriate number of terms for the series solution vertical concentration distributions at different locations from the release source and under different series solution terms are shown in fig 3 where h 0 h y and α 1 0 near the release source x 0 0001 vertical concentration oscillates in the small concentration zones and series term n 80 is still not enough at x 0 001 the results with n 30 are consistent for downstream concentrations far away from the release source the result with n 20 is sufficient longitudinal concentration distributions at different heights and under different series solution terms are shown in fig 4 where h 0 h y and α 1 0 the effect of the number of series solution terms on the concentration is larger at the bed wall than those above the bed wall at about x 0 01 series term n 50 is enough near the free water surface the results with n 30 agree well with each other notice that in the previous work guo and chen 2022 concentration distributions obtained by a similar analytical model have been compared with the experimental results for solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow without the effect of bed absorption based on the present vertical turbulent diffusivity profile the analytical solution of the concentration is appropriate to depict the concentration distribution from the downstream distance of x x 2 corresponding to the dimensionless distance of x 0 016 as presented in guo and chen 2022 adopting the present vertical turbulent diffusivity profile will underestimate the concentration near the release source because the vertical turbulent diffusivity is actually smaller near the release source as illustrated in rubol et al 2016 thus in the present work we focus on the steady state concentration field from the downstream distance of x 0 01 in this condition a specific convergence analysis is listed in table 2 where the truncation error is calculated by c n 80 c n 50 c n 50 100 therefore a series solution with terms n 50 is suitable 4 1 3 comparison with previous work as mentioned above solute transport from a continuous release source in a submerged vegetated flow has been studied in our previous work based on a series of eigenfunctions that are different from those adopted in the present work as shown in b to discuss the effect of adopting different basis functions on the results and simultaneously validate the reliability of results presented in this work concentrations obtained here are compared with those based on the eigenfunctions adopted in the previous work guo and chen 2022 a comparison of vertical concentration distribution at the downstream location x 0 001 between the solution in the present work and the solution in the previous work under the different series solution terms is depicted in fig 5 where h 0 h y and α 0 the results in the present work agree well with those in the previous study when n 30 which indicates that adopting different orthogonal basis functions satisfying the same boundary conditions does not affect the results but affects the rate of convergence of the solution moreover a comparison of longitudinal concentration distribution at the height y 0 0 between the solution in the present work and the solution in the previous work under the different series solution terms is shown in fig 6 where h 0 h y and α 0 the longitudinal concentrations in the present work agree well with those in the previous study when the series solution terms n 30 when the series solution terms are sufficient adopting different eigenfunctions does not affect the results the above results illustrate the reliability of the above analytical model presented in this work 4 2 steady state concentration field the above section discusses the reliability of the analytical model presented in this work this section will discuss the specific steady state concentration distribution for a continuous release source with bed absorption the effect of bed absorption on the concentration distribution is to be explored 4 2 1 vertical mean concentration distribution the steady state vertical mean concentration distribution is illustrated in fig 7 without the bed absorption the vertical mean concentration approaches 1 at about x 0 5 which is consistent with the previous result guo and chen 2022 at the location of x 0 01 the mean concentrations are almost unaffected by the bed absorption rates with the bed absorption the mean concentration decreases with the downstream distance from the release source increasing and tends to zero at a location downstream as can be seen the mean concentration approaches zero at about x 80 under the condition of bed absorption rate α 0 1 when α 1 0 the mean concentration tends to zero at about x 20 when α 10 0 the mean concentration distribution is almost unaffected by the different bed absorption rates reasons can be explained from the eigenvalue eq 18 when the bed absorption rate is large the eigenvalues change very slowly with the bed absorption rate increasing therefore the solutions are almost identical when the bed absorption rate is determined to discuss the effect of release position on the steady state concentration field vertical mean concentration distribution under different release positions with α 1 0 is illustrated in fig 8 as we can see the vertical mean concentration decreases quickly when the release source position is at the bed wall values of the mean concentration at the origin can be obtained from eq 12 where c s 0 h 0 1 u h 0 at the downstream location x 0 2 the mean concentration is larger when the release position is higher vertical mean concentration distribution can be explained from the point of transient dispersion because the steady state concentration is the superposition of transient dispersion as discussed in guo and chen 2022 the dimensionless time is corresponding to the displacement of x as illustrated in ai et al 2022 the asymptotic value of the dispersion coefficient and the time scale to arrive the asymptotic state are unaffected by the solute release position in this asymptotic scale the vertical mean concentration distributions are similar for different solute release positions considering the effect of bed absorption the mean concentration is smaller when the release position is lower because the lower the release position the higher concentration at the bed wall which will be absorbed more quickly the distance scales for the mean concentration close to 0 are similar although the solute release positions are different the vertical mean concentration distributions for different solute release positions are explained more concretely from the point of transient dispersion the transient dispersion processes can be roughly characterized by three stages advection dominated advection and vertical diffusion combined dispersion stage vertical diffusion dominated vertical concentration relative uniformity stage as depicted in guo et al 2022 with bed absorption the time scale for the effect of absorption is related to the solute release position for the solute release position of h 0 1 0 the velocity is large and the velocity gradient is zero as shown in fig 1 in the zone of 0 8 y 1 0 the velocity and vertical turbulent diffusivity are nearly constant therefore the mean concentration keeps constant over a short period of time as time increases part of solutes diffuses to the lower layer where the velocity and velocity gradient are smaller therefore the men concentration increases advection dominated over time the vertical diffusion effect is strengthened causing the dispersion coefficient increases and the effect of bed absorption also begins to work which both result in a decrease in the mean concentration advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains unchanged and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero with the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption for the solute release position of h 0 0 5 there is velocity gradient and the vertical turbulent diffusivity is larger at the lower layer at small times more solutes diffuse to the lower layer where the velocity is smaller therefore the mean concentration is increased advection dominated as time increases solute diffuses more fully in the vertical direction and the dispersion coefficient begins to increase therefore the mean concentration starts to decrease advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains constant and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero under the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption for the solute release position of h 0 h y there is velocity gradient and the vertical turbulent diffusivity is larger at the upper layer at small times more solutes diffuse to the upper layer where the velocity is larger therefore the mean concentration is decreased advection dominated as time increases solute diffuses more fully in the vertical direction and the dispersion coefficient begins to increase therefore the mean concentration starts to decrease advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains constant and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero under the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption for the solute release position of h 0 0 0 the velocity is small and the velocity gradient is zero in the zone of 0 0 y 0 2 the velocity is almost constant but with the effect of bed absorption the mean concentration keeps decreased as time increases part of solutes diffuses to the upper layer where the velocity is large therefore the men concentration is still decreased advection dominated bed absorption over time the dispersion coefficient increases causing the mean concentration decreasing advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains constant and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero under the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption 4 2 2 two dimensional concentration distribution to be more specific the steady state two dimensional concentration distribution is shown in fig 9 there is a high concentration zone near the top of the canopy because the release position is at the top of the vegetation the steady state concentration distributions are different when the bed absorption rates are small as presented in fig 9 a b c when α 10 0 the different bed absorption rates have little effect on the two dimensional concentration field as shown in fig 9 d e f for clarity the steady state concentration distributions along the longitudinal direction at different heights under the different bed absorption rates where h 0 h y are presented in fig 10 without the bed absorption the concentration is equal to 1 from the downstream location at about x 0 5 which has been discussed in our previous work guo and chen 2022 under the effect of bed absorption the longitudinal concentration at the bed wall increases first and then keeps decreasing downstream and approaches zero at about x 50 for α 0 1 and about x 20 for α 1 0 near the release heights the longitudinal concentration decreases with the distance from the release source increasing under the effect of bed absorption as seen in fig 10 b the longitudinal concentration at y 0 6 is unaffected by the bed absorption rates when x 0 05 as shown in fig 10 c near the free water surface the longitudinal concentration increases with the distance far away from the release source and then decreases in consideration of the bed absorption without the bed absorption the downstream concentrations far away from the release source remain constant and are equal to 1 considering the bed absorption the downstream concentrations far away from the release source are equal to 0 the longitudinal concentration distributions are almost identical for α 10 0 furthermore the steady state vertical concentration distributions under the different bed absorption rates where h 0 h y are presented in fig 11 at the location x 0 01 the vertical concentration distributions are almost identical under the different bed absorption rates namely when the release position is above the bed wall the effect of bed absorption does not affect the near field concentration where the vertical dispersion of solute has not arrived at the bed wall but it affects the downstream concentration field at the location x 0 1 the vertical concentration distributions are non uniform without bed absorption the concentration is higher at the bed wall and lower at the free water surface with the effect of bed absorption the vertical concentration is higher near the release source than that at the bed wall and free water surface at the far downstream location the vertical concentration distributions are uniform without the effect of bed absorption as shown in fig 11 c f with the bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution is non uniform near the bed wall the concentration is smaller at the bed wall than that at the free water surface and decreases with the distance from the release source increasing at the downstream location x 20 0 the vertical concentration tends to be very small when α 1 0 the vertical concentration distributions are almost identical for α 10 0 moreover the steady state two dimensional concentration distributions under the different release positions with the same bed absorption rate α 1 0 are illustrated in fig 12 when the bed absorption rate is constant the continuous release positions affect the steady state concentration field the locations of the high concentration zones are different specifically the longitudinal concentration distributions at different heights under the different release positions where α 1 0 are depicted in fig 13 as can be seen the longitudinal concentration is higher near the release source and decreases as the distance from the release source increases namely the longitudinal concentration at the bed wall is highest when the release position is at the bed wall h 0 0 0 as shown in fig 13 a longitudinal concentration at the free water surface is highest when the release position is also at the free water surface h 0 1 0 as illustrated in fig 13 d etc at other positions the longitudinal concentration increases with the downstream distance increasing and then decreases which all tend to be very small values at the downstream location about x 20 when the bed absorption rate is constant the release positions almost do not affect the distance where the concentration tends to zero vertical concentration distributions at different locations under the different release positions are presented in fig 14 at the location x 0 01 when the release position is at the bed wall h 0 0 0 the vertical concentration is decreased near the bed wall due to the effect of bed absorption and the maximum value of the concentration is higher than that at the bed wall when the release position at y 0 5 the vertical concentration is equal to 0 near the bed zone and near the free water surface due to the limitation of vertical diffusion where the solute has not been diffused here at the location x 0 1 the vertical concentration distributions under the two release positions h 0 h y and h 0 0 5 are similar and the vertical concentration is large when the release position is at the free water surface where h 0 1 0 in the far field the vertical concentration is smaller when the release position is close to the bed wall at the downstream location x 20 0 the vertical concentrations are very small where the magnitude of the concentrations is at 0 1 note that the present model considers solute from a continuous release source dispersion in a uniform dense rigid submerged vegetated flow where the mixing layer velocity profile and the four zone vertical turbulent diffusivity profile are applicable and with bed absorption the time to reach a steady state concentration field has been discussed in appendix b in guo and chen 2022 in most natural vegetated flow plant presents a complex seasonally variable morphology with flexible stems and leaves and is often non uniformly distributed or in patches of finite length in these cases flow structure and turbulent diffusivity profile require re determined in addition due to the additional scales of heterogeneity the definition of the spatial averaging scale needs to be carefully reinvestigated 5 summary and conclusions vegetation widely exists in rivers channel flows and wetlands in this work dispersion of solute from a continuous source in a submerged vegetated flow is explored by extending the previous work in consideration of the effect of bed absorption convergence analysis of the obtained series solution is conducted results based on the different orthogonal functions are compared moreover the specific steady state concentration fields with different bed absorption rates and under different release positions are described the results illustrate that the number of terms for the series solution is enough when n 50 for depicting the downstream concentration distribution from x 0 01 the result is unaffected by adopting different orthogonal basis functions but it affects the rate of convergence of solution near the release source under the bed absorption concentration approaches zero at the far field concentration is affected by different bed absorption rates when the absorption rates are small but it is almost unaffected by different absorption rates when the bed absorption rates are large when the release position is above the bed wall different bed absorption rates do not affect the near field concentration where the vertical dispersion of solute has not arrived at the bed wall under the same bed absorption rate concentration decays more quickly along the downstream distance when the release position is near the bed wall but the release positions almost do not affect the downstream distance where the concentration tends to zero the above results help us deepen the understanding of the pollutant dispersion process in wetland flows with bed absorption and can provide a reference for solute transport in other complicated vegetated flows credit authorship contribution statement jinlan guo writing original

2429,predicting the dispersion process of environmental transport in wetland flows is significant to some ecological engineering applications by extending a previous study guo and chen 2022 an analytical solution of the steady state concentration field for solute transport from a continuous release source in a submerged vegetated flow with the effect of bed absorption is presented in this work results illustrate that adopting different orthogonal basis functions does not affect the result but affects the convergence rate of the solution near the release source under the bed absorption concentration approaches zero at the far field concentration is affected by different bed absorption rates when the absorption rates are small while it is hardly affected by different absorption rates when the bed absorption rates are large when the release position is above the bed wall different bed absorption rates do not affect the near field concentration where the vertical dispersion of solute has not arrived at the bed wall under the same bed absorption rate concentration decays more quickly along the downstream distance when the release position is near the bed wall but the release positions almost do not affect the downstream distance where the concentration tends to zero keywords submerged vegetated flow steady state concentration field bed absorption continuous release source environmental dispersion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction vegetation widely exists in rivers open channel flows and wetlands which has many ecological functions such as improving water quality and increasing species diversity nepf 2012 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 the presence of vegetation in flow can affect the law of conveyance sediment erosion and deposition and element cycling huai et al 2021 knowledge of the pollutant dispersion process in vegetated flows is significant to some ecological engineering applications such as wastewater treatment and ecological environment management dotro et al 2017 von sperling and sperling 2007 solute dispersion in vegetated wetland flows has been extensively studied in recent years by different models due to the existence of vegetation the hydrodynamic structure of a vegetated flow is inherently characterized with multi scales according to flow conditions different models are adopted to depict the flow and mass transport in vegetated flows when the flow is slow basic equations for momentum and mass transport for a vegetated flow can be depicted at the phase average scale liu and masliyah 2005 zeng and chen 2011 under the framework of phase averaged models solute dispersion in vegetated wetland flows has been substantially explored by different analytical methods for example solute dispersion in depth dominated wetland flows wu et al 2011b zeng et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 wang and huai 2018 width dominated wetland flows wu et al 2011a zeng et al 2014 multi layer wetland flows jiang and chen 2019 wang et al 2013 2014 and wetland flow with rectangular cross sections guo et al 2018 have been investigated active particles dispersion in wetland flows has been recently explored guan et al 2022 when the reynolds number of the vegetated flow is large the double averaging time spatial averaging method is usually applied nikora et al 2007a b under the double averaging framework solute dispersion in vegetated flows has been further explored solute dispersion from an instantaneous release source in a flow with modeled submerged vegetation rooted vegetation with a vertical extent less than the water depth was experimentally studied by murphy et al 2007 then measurements of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for solute dispersion in a channel with living vegetation were also conducted shucksmith et al 2011 2010 research on the velocity and turbulent diffusivity profiles of the submerged vegetated flow is hot and various models are presented such as the two layer velocity model battiato et al 2011 three layer velocity model huai et al 2009 mixing layer velocity model ghisalberti and nepf 2002 and three layer eddy diffusivity model ghisalberti and nepf 2008 liang and wu 2014 follett et al 2019 moreover the hydrodynamics of turbulent flow through submerged flexible vegetation is experimentally investigated to better simulate the real wetland situation huai et al 2019 based on prescribed velocity and turbulent diffusivity profiles solute dispersion in a submerged vegetated flow can be analytically and numerically analyzed a simplified two zone model murphy et al 2007 and n zone model shucksmith et al 2011 have been adopted to predict the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the submerged vegetated flow guo et al 2020 analytically explored the solute dispersion process in a submerged vegetated flow by asymptotic expansion method based on a mixing layer velocity model and a four zone vertical turbulent diffusivity profile furthermore numerical simulations of solute dispersion in submerged vegetated flows by the random displacement method have also been conducted liang and wu 2014 follett et al 2019 the above studies focused on the transient dispersion due to an instantaneous release source in a submerged vegetated flow dispersion of solute from a continuous source which is another common release type in practical applications also deserves attention under the condition of continuous release a steady state concentration field can be obtained finally the steady state vertical concentration profiles of solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow were experimentally measured by ghisalberti and nepf 2005 analytical effort in the steady state concentration field has also been done based on a generalized integral transform technique cotta and mikhailov 1993 which is widely adopted to explore solute transport in rivers de barros et al 2006 de barros and cotta 2007 the steady state concentration distribution in a submerged vegetated flow has been studied rubol et al 2016 with obtained system of coupled ordinary differential equations solved numerically rubol et al 2016 s work is referred to as a semi analytical study recently guo and chen 2022 analytically explored the steady state concentration field for solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow where relations between transient dispersion and steady dispersion were discussed and the specific concentration distribution was detailedly described these studies help us to comprehend the transport process of solutes in vegetated flows nevertheless in terms of solute transport in a vegetated flow with bed absorption which can characterize the ecological effect of degrading pollutants there are few studies actually there is a lot of research on solute dispersion in flows with the effect of wall absorption sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 smith 1983 ng and yip 2001 ng 2006 nguyen and papavassiliou 2008 wang et al 2022 recently transient dispersion of solute from an instantaneous release source in the wetland flow with bed absorption has been studied under the framework of phase averaged models wang et al 2020 2019 guo et al 2019 wang and chen 2017 however the steady state concentration field due to a continuous release source under the effect of bed absorption for solute transport in a vegetated flow has not been studied so far therefore to fill this gap the present work aims to comprehensively explore the steady state concentration field under the effect of bed absorption for solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow by extending the previous work guo and chen 2022 concentration distributions with different bed absorption rates and under different release positions will be detailedly characterized the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the mathematical formulation section 3 illustrates the method and solutions results and discussion including comparison with previous work and specific steady state concentration distribution are illustrated in section 4 summary and conclusions are provided in the final section 2 formulation by extending the previous work guo and chen 2022 we study solute transport in an open channel flow with uniform dense rigid submerged vegetation in considering the effect of bed absorption as shown in fig 1 2 1 governing equations

2019 following the previous work guo and chen 2022 a mixing layer velocity model ghisalberti and nepf 2002 2006 follett et al 2019 and a spatially dependent vertical turbulent dispersivity liang and wu 2014 follett et al 2019 are adopted as illustrated in fig 1 the mixing layer velocity profile follows a hyperbolic tangent shape which is described as ghisalberti and nepf 2006 13 u y u 1 u 2 2 u 2

the middle mixing layer the above parameters can be estimated by the experiments and empirical formulas as discussed in section 4 4 in the previous work guo and chen 2022 3 method and solutions since the boundary conditions are homogeneous a basis of linearly independent normalized vectors satisfying the below eigenvalue problem 15 d 2 φ n d y 2 β n 2 φ n 16 d y 0 d φ n d y y 0 α φ n 17 d φ n d y

obtain the normalized eigenfunctions as φ n φ n n φ n the analytical solution of eqs 9 12 can be expressed as rubol et al 2016 21 c s x y n 1 a n x φ n y where a n x n 1 2 3 are the unknown

zero vector and means conjugate transposition therefore b n n is a positive definite matrix which is invertible and its inverse matrix b n n 1 is also a positive definite matrix horn and johnson 2013 kumar and sharan 2010 moreover coefficients of matrix e n n can be rewritten as 30 e m n 0 1 d d y d y y d φ n y d y φ m y d y 0 1 d d y d y y d φ n y d y φ m y d y 0 1 d y y d φ n y d y d φ m y d y d

implies that e n n is a negative definite matrix whose all eigenvalues are negative and real the product of a positive definite matrix b n n 1 and a negative definite matrix e n n i e m n n has all negative eigenvalues same number as matrix e n n horn and johnson 2013 the above obtained eq 25 is a linear homogeneous system with constant coefficients which can be analytically solved using the fundamental solution matrix q x the fundamental solution matrix of eq 25 can be obtained through solving the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the constant coefficient matrix m i e 32 m z λ z where z is the eigenvector and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue which can be obtained through calculation software because the number of z of m equals n as illustrated above we have 33 q x exp λ 1 x z 1 exp λ 2 x z 2 exp λ n x z n then the general solution of a x can be obtained as 34 a x q x c where c is a vector with n arbitrary constants with a known which contains n undetermined constant coefficients the general solution of c s can be obtained as 35 c s x y m 1 n a m x φ m y the unique solution can be obtained using the boundary condition eq 12 to determine the arbitrary coefficients that is 36 m 1 n

constant coefficients by vertically integrating eq 35 vertical mean concentration distribution c s x can be obtained as 38 c s x 0 1 c s x y d y 4 results and discussion in this section the reliability of the above analytical model is to be discussed first and then the steady state concentration fields with different bed absorption rates and under different release positions are to be characterized respectively flow conditions and parameters of a submerged vegetated flow are collected from the previous experimental study ghisalberti and nepf 2005 as illustrated in table 1 run i in ghisalberti and nepf 2005 4 1 validation of the above analytical model 4 1 1 comparison with a simplified case to test the reliability of the above analytical model and codes we used a comparison with a simplified case with constant u y and d y is conducted when u and d y are constant and α 0 the dimensionless analytical solution can be easily obtained as eigenvalue problem without the bed absorption is illustrated in appendix a 39 c s x y 1 2 n 1 cos β n h 0 cos β n y exp β n 2 x comparisons of longitudinal concentration distribution at y 0 5 and vertical concentration distribution at x 0 01 between the above analytical model and direct analytical solution are illustrated in fig 2 where h 0 h y 0 298 as seen the results obtained by the above analytical model are consistent well with those calculated directly by the analytical solution eq 39 our model and codes are reliable 4 1 2 convergence analysis because the above analytical model is a series solution convergence analysis is conducted to determine the appropriate number of terms for the series solution vertical concentration distributions at different locations from the release source and under different series solution terms are shown in fig 3 where h 0 h y and α 1 0 near the release source x 0 0001 vertical concentration oscillates in the small concentration zones and series term n 80 is still not enough at x 0 001 the results with n 30 are consistent for downstream concentrations far away from the release source the result with n 20 is sufficient longitudinal concentration distributions at different heights and under different series solution terms are shown in fig 4 where h 0 h y and α 1 0 the effect of the number of series solution terms on the concentration is larger at the bed wall than those above the bed wall at about x 0 01 series term n 50 is enough near the free water surface the results with n 30 agree well with each other notice that in the previous work guo and chen 2022 concentration distributions obtained by a similar analytical model have been compared with the experimental results for solute transport in a submerged vegetated flow without the effect of bed absorption based on the present vertical turbulent diffusivity profile the analytical solution of the concentration is appropriate to depict the concentration distribution from the downstream distance of x x 2 corresponding to the dimensionless distance of x 0 016 as presented in guo and chen 2022 adopting the present vertical turbulent diffusivity profile will underestimate the concentration near the release source because the vertical turbulent diffusivity is actually smaller near the release source as illustrated in rubol et al 2016 thus in the present work we focus on the steady state concentration field from the downstream distance of x 0 01 in this condition a specific convergence analysis is listed in table 2 where the truncation error is calculated by c n 80 c n 50 c n 50 100 therefore a series solution with terms n 50 is suitable 4 1 3 comparison with previous work as mentioned above solute transport from a continuous release source in a submerged vegetated flow has been studied in our previous work based on a series of eigenfunctions that are different from those adopted in the present work as shown in b to discuss the effect of adopting different basis functions on the results and simultaneously validate the reliability of results presented in this work concentrations obtained here are compared with those based on the eigenfunctions adopted in the previous work guo and chen 2022 a comparison of vertical concentration distribution at the downstream location x 0 001 between the solution in the present work and the solution in the previous work under the different series solution terms is depicted in fig 5 where h 0 h y and α 0 the results in the present work agree well with those in the previous study when n 30 which indicates that adopting different orthogonal basis functions satisfying the same boundary conditions does not affect the results but affects the rate of convergence of the solution moreover a comparison of longitudinal concentration distribution at the height y 0 0 between the solution in the present work and the solution in the previous work under the different series solution terms is shown in fig 6 where h 0 h y and α 0 the longitudinal concentrations in the present work agree well with those in the previous study when the series solution terms n 30 when the series solution terms are sufficient adopting different eigenfunctions does not affect the results the above results illustrate the reliability of the above analytical model presented in this work 4 2 steady state concentration field the above section discusses the reliability of the analytical model presented in this work this section will discuss the specific steady state concentration distribution for a continuous release source with bed absorption the effect of bed absorption on the concentration distribution is to be explored 4 2 1 vertical mean concentration distribution the steady state vertical mean concentration distribution is illustrated in fig 7 without the bed absorption the vertical mean concentration approaches 1 at about x 0 5 which is consistent with the previous result guo and chen 2022 at the location of x 0 01 the mean concentrations are almost unaffected by the bed absorption rates with the bed absorption the mean concentration decreases with the downstream distance from the release source increasing and tends to zero at a location downstream as can be seen the mean concentration approaches zero at about x 80 under the condition of bed absorption rate α 0 1 when α 1 0 the mean concentration tends to zero at about x 20 when α 10 0 the mean concentration distribution is almost unaffected by the different bed absorption rates reasons can be explained from the eigenvalue eq 18 when the bed absorption rate is large the eigenvalues change very slowly with the bed absorption rate increasing therefore the solutions are almost identical when the bed absorption rate is determined to discuss the effect of release position on the steady state concentration field vertical mean concentration distribution under different release positions with α 1 0 is illustrated in fig 8 as we can see the vertical mean concentration decreases quickly when the release source position is at the bed wall values of the mean concentration at the origin can be obtained from eq 12 where c s 0 h 0 1 u h 0 at the downstream location x 0 2 the mean concentration is larger when the release position is higher vertical mean concentration distribution can be explained from the point of transient dispersion because the steady state concentration is the superposition of transient dispersion as discussed in guo and chen 2022 the dimensionless time is corresponding to the displacement of x as illustrated in ai et al 2022 the asymptotic value of the dispersion coefficient and the time scale to arrive the asymptotic state are unaffected by the solute release position in this asymptotic scale the vertical mean concentration distributions are similar for different solute release positions considering the effect of bed absorption the mean concentration is smaller when the release position is lower because the lower the release position the higher concentration at the bed wall which will be absorbed more quickly the distance scales for the mean concentration close to 0 are similar although the solute release positions are different the vertical mean concentration distributions for different solute release positions are explained more concretely from the point of transient dispersion the transient dispersion processes can be roughly characterized by three stages advection dominated advection and vertical diffusion combined dispersion stage vertical diffusion dominated vertical concentration relative uniformity stage as depicted in guo et al 2022 with bed absorption the time scale for the effect of absorption is related to the solute release position for the solute release position of h 0 1 0 the velocity is large and the velocity gradient is zero as shown in fig 1 in the zone of 0 8 y 1 0 the velocity and vertical turbulent diffusivity are nearly constant therefore the mean concentration keeps constant over a short period of time as time increases part of solutes diffuses to the lower layer where the velocity and velocity gradient are smaller therefore the men concentration increases advection dominated over time the vertical diffusion effect is strengthened causing the dispersion coefficient increases and the effect of bed absorption also begins to work which both result in a decrease in the mean concentration advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains unchanged and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero with the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption for the solute release position of h 0 0 5 there is velocity gradient and the vertical turbulent diffusivity is larger at the lower layer at small times more solutes diffuse to the lower layer where the velocity is smaller therefore the mean concentration is increased advection dominated as time increases solute diffuses more fully in the vertical direction and the dispersion coefficient begins to increase therefore the mean concentration starts to decrease advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains constant and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero under the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption for the solute release position of h 0 h y there is velocity gradient and the vertical turbulent diffusivity is larger at the upper layer at small times more solutes diffuse to the upper layer where the velocity is larger therefore the mean concentration is decreased advection dominated as time increases solute diffuses more fully in the vertical direction and the dispersion coefficient begins to increase therefore the mean concentration starts to decrease advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains constant and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero under the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption for the solute release position of h 0 0 0 the velocity is small and the velocity gradient is zero in the zone of 0 0 y 0 2 the velocity is almost constant but with the effect of bed absorption the mean concentration keeps decreased as time increases part of solutes diffuses to the upper layer where the velocity is large therefore the men concentration is still decreased advection dominated bed absorption over time the dispersion coefficient increases causing the mean concentration decreasing advection and diffusion combined bed absorption at large times the dispersion coefficient remains constant and the mean concentration keeps decreased to zero under the effect of bed absorption diffusion dominated bed absorption 4 2 2 two dimensional concentration distribution to be more specific the steady state two dimensional concentration distribution is shown in fig 9 there is a high concentration zone near the top of the canopy because the release position is at the top of the vegetation the steady state concentration distributions are different when the bed absorption rates are small as presented in fig 9 a b c when α 10 0 the different bed absorption rates have little effect on the two dimensional concentration field as shown in fig 9 d e f for clarity the steady state concentration distributions along the longitudinal direction at different heights under the different bed absorption rates where h 0 h y are presented in fig 10 without the bed absorption the concentration is equal to 1 from the downstream location at about x 0 5 which has been discussed in our previous work guo and chen 2022 under the effect of bed absorption the longitudinal concentration at the bed wall increases first and then keeps decreasing downstream and approaches zero at about x 50 for α 0 1 and about x 20 for α 1 0 near the release heights the longitudinal concentration decreases with the distance from the release source increasing under the effect of bed absorption as seen in fig 10 b the longitudinal concentration at y 0 6 is unaffected by the bed absorption rates when x 0 05 as shown in fig 10 c near the free water surface the longitudinal concentration increases with the distance far away from the release source and then decreases in consideration of the bed absorption without the bed absorption the downstream concentrations far away from the release source remain constant and are equal to 1 considering the bed absorption the downstream concentrations far away from the release source are equal to 0 the longitudinal concentration distributions are almost identical for α 10 0 furthermore the steady state vertical concentration distributions under the different bed absorption rates where h 0 h y are presented in fig 11 at the location x 0 01 the vertical concentration distributions are almost identical under the different bed absorption rates namely when the release position is above the bed wall the effect of bed absorption does not affect the near field concentration where the vertical dispersion of solute has not arrived at the bed wall but it affects the downstream concentration field at the location x 0 1 the vertical concentration distributions are non uniform without bed absorption the concentration is higher at the bed wall and lower at the free water surface with the effect of bed absorption the vertical concentration is higher near the release source than that at the bed wall and free water surface at the far downstream location the vertical concentration distributions are uniform without the effect of bed absorption as shown in fig 11 c f with the bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution is non uniform near the bed wall the concentration is smaller at the bed wall than that at the free water surface and decreases with the distance from the release source increasing at the downstream location x 20 0 the vertical concentration tends to be very small when α 1 0 the vertical concentration distributions are almost identical for α 10 0 moreover the steady state two dimensional concentration distributions under the different release positions with the same bed absorption rate α 1 0 are illustrated in fig 12 when the bed absorption rate is constant the continuous release positions affect the steady state concentration field the locations of the high concentration zones are different specifically the longitudinal concentration distributions at different heights under the different release positions where α 1 0 are depicted in fig 13 as can be seen the longitudinal concentration is higher near the release source and decreases as the distance from the release source increases namely the longitudinal concentration at the bed wall is highest when the release position is at the bed wall h 0 0 0 as shown in fig 13 a longitudinal concentration at the free water surface is highest when the release position is also at the free water surface h 0 1 0 as illustrated in fig 13 d etc at other positions the longitudinal concentration increases with the downstream distance increasing and then decreases which all tend to be very small values at the downstream location about x 20 when the bed absorption rate is constant the release positions almost do not affect the distance where the concentration tends to zero vertical concentration distributions at different locations under the different release positions are presented in fig 14 at the location x 0 01 when the release position is at the bed wall h 0 0 0 the vertical concentration is decreased near the bed wall due to the effect of bed absorption and the maximum value of the concentration is higher than that at the bed wall when the release position at y 0 5 the vertical concentration is equal to 0 near the bed zone and near the free water surface due to the limitation of vertical diffusion where the solute has not been diffused here at the location x 0 1 the vertical concentration distributions under the two release positions h 0 h y and h 0 0 5 are similar and the vertical concentration is large when the release position is at the free water surface where h 0 1 0 in the far field the vertical concentration is smaller when the release position is close to the bed wall at the downstream location x 20 0 the vertical concentrations are very small where the magnitude of the concentrations is at 0 1 note that the present model considers solute from a continuous release source dispersion in a uniform dense rigid submerged vegetated flow where the mixing layer velocity profile and the four zone vertical turbulent diffusivity profile are applicable and with bed absorption the time to reach a steady state concentration field has been discussed in appendix b in guo and chen 2022 in most natural vegetated flow plant presents a complex seasonally variable morphology with flexible stems and leaves and is often non uniformly distributed or in patches of finite length in these cases flow structure and turbulent diffusivity profile require re determined in addition due to the additional scales of heterogeneity the definition of the spatial averaging scale needs to be carefully reinvestigated 5 summary and conclusions vegetation widely exists in rivers channel flows and wetlands in this work dispersion of solute from a continuous source in a submerged vegetated flow is explored by extending the previous work in consideration of the effect of bed absorption convergence analysis of the obtained series solution is conducted results based on the different orthogonal functions are compared moreover the specific steady state concentration fields with different bed absorption rates and under different release positions are described the results illustrate that the number of terms for the series solution is enough when n 50 for depicting the downstream concentration distribution from x 0 01 the result is unaffected by adopting different orthogonal basis functions but it affects the rate of convergence of solution near the release source under the bed absorption concentration approaches zero at the far field concentration is affected by different bed absorption rates when the absorption rates are small but it is almost unaffected by different absorption rates when the bed absorption rates are large when the release position is above the bed wall different bed absorption rates do not affect the near field concentration where the vertical dispersion of solute has not arrived at the bed wall under the same bed absorption rate concentration decays more quickly along the downstream distance when the release position is near the bed wall but the release positions almost do not affect the downstream distance where the concentration tends to zero the above results help us deepen the understanding of the pollutant dispersion process in wetland flows with bed absorption and can provide a reference for solute transport in other complicated vegetated flows credit authorship contribution statement jinlan guo writing original
