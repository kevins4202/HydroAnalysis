19005,sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have proven effective for simultaneously removing refractory dissolved organic matter dom and ammonia in municipal landfill leachates however the knowledge on the competition of leachate dom and ammonia for so4 the utilization efficiency of persulfate as well as the reaction pathways and final products of ammonia oxidation during the sr aop treatment remains little known thereby leading to a lack of a comprehensive evaluation of the emerging leachate treatment technology the objective of this study was to further investigate the performance of a thermally activated persulfate system for treatment of a mature landfill leachate and re evaluate the benefits and restrictions of sr aops for leachate treatment the laboratory experimental results showed that removal patterns of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia relied heavily upon the dose of persulfate that could be thermally activated to produce reactive sulfate radicals reflecting the competition of leachate dom ammonia and non target leachate constituents for so4 the utilization efficiency of the added persulfate could be more efficiently utilized for removing the two target leachate pollutants at a lower persulfate dose whereas more persulfate was wasted due to the reactions with non target leachate constituents e g cl and co3 2 and or self decomposition with the increasing persulfate dose during the treatment ammonia was oxidized via the direct attack of so4 and or by molecular chlorine produced from the reactions of chloride and sulfate radicals into nitrate and nitrogen gas while nitrite was not detected of importance this study highlighted three potentially negative impacts of sr aops on the quality of treated leachate including accumulation of total dissolved solids the production of undesirable nitrate and the ph decrease due to the continuous formation of hydrochloric acid therefore the three issues should be carefully evaluated when a sr aop is selected for leachate treatment because these impacts become less pronounced with a decreasing persulfate dose sr aops as a pre treatment which is achieved at a relatively low persulfate dose may be an appropriate option for the sr aop application to leachate treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords landfill leachate sulfate radicals dissolved organic

kreith 2002 it will continue to be a major environmental problem in urbanized areas considering that 54 of the world s population is residing in cities and the fraction is predicted to increase to 66 by 2050 un 2014 as one of the most important municipal services msw management serves as a prerequisite for other municipal actions hoornweg and bhada tata 2012 among different msw management strategies landfilling has been the most popular one in the most countries for example the united states landfilled 52 5 of 262 million tons of msw generated in 2015 usepa 2018 however landfill leachate a highly polluted liquid is continuously generated as a consequence of rainwater percolating through msw within a landfill cell successful management of landfill leachate is key to archiving the sustainability of urban msw management due to two reasons firstly leachate management has a high capital and operations maintenance o m cost the highest single landfill operating expense in the united states walker 2013 torrens 2013 secondly various leachate pollutants such as refractory dissolve organic matter dom toxic heavy metals and ammonia can cause soil surface water and groundwater pollution kjeldsen et al 2002 treatment of municipal landfill leachate began in the 1970s boyle and ham 1974 ho et al 1974 chian and dewalle 1976 since then a variety of physicochemical and biological treatment technologies have been investigated and applied among the different treatment options chemical oxidation technologies are highly attractive due to a relatively short treatment duration and the possibility to transform toxic pollutants into less and even non toxic substances deng 2009 deng and zhao 2015 wiszniowski et al 2006 considering that dom in many mature leachates a primary landfill leachate pollutant is mostly biologically recalcitrant hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation processes hr aops such as the fenton reactions gau and chang 1996 lopez et al 2004 deng and englehardt 2006 deng 2007 zhang et al 2005 ozone o3 h2o2 tizaoui et al 2007 wu et al 2004 titanium dioxide tio2 catalyzed uv oxidation jia et al 2011 and ultrasound irradiation wang et al 2008 have been extensively studied due to the high reduction potential and unselective oxidative property of oh deng and zhao 2015 however the hr aops poorly remove ammonia another principal landfill leachate pollutant due to the slow reaction rate between oh and ammonia huang et al 2008 besides hr aops the other aops are achieved through the generation of sufficient sulfate radicals so4 as a principal oxidizing agent so4 can be produced through the activation of persulfate anions s2o8 2 or peroxymonosulfate anions hso5 with heat metals elevated ph uv irradiation or other methods antoniou et al 2010 tsitonaki et al 2010 so4 is a strong chemical oxidant with a standard redox potential e o between 2 5 and 3 1 vvs nhe neta et al 1988 it is a selective chemical oxidant related to oh during the reactions with target pollutants in water neta et al 1978 1988 xiao et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 ye et al 2017 the so called sulfate radical based aops sr aops were early demonstrated to be effective for in situ chemical oxidation of subsurface organic pollutants for groundwater cleanup huling and pivetz 2006 and for the destruction of micro pollutants in water antoniou et al 2010 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 we first evaluated sr aops for the treatment of a municipal landfill leachate deng and ezyske 2011 results show that so4 was advantageous over oh because so4 could simultaneously and effectively remove both refractory dom and ammonia in landfill leachate thereafter many other studies were carried out to investigate the treatment of landfill leachate with the addition of persulfate a major purpose in the treatment designs was to produce so4 as a primary or supplementary oxidizing agent for improving the treatment efficiency the treatment designs include the combination of ozone and persulfate amr et al 2013a 2013b an electro fe2 persulfate process zhang et al 2014 a combined persulfate and hydrogen peroxide process hilles et al 2015 2016a 2016b granular activated carbon supported iron for catalyzing persulfate li et al 2016 a ferrous ion activated persulfate process asha et al 2016 microwave irradiation with persulfate kim and ahn 2015 and an ultrasonic activated persulfate system yang et al 2015 encouraging results from the aforementioned treatments validate the positive role of sulfate radicals in the destruction of leachate pollutants most of these studies focused on maximization of the removal efficiencies for target leachate pollutants e g leachate dom through the optimization of different operating factors although sr aops have proven effective for improving the removals of cod and ammonia from landfill leachate four key questions are not well answered so that we cannot have a comprehensive evaluation on sr aops for the treatment of municipal landfill leachate particularly in comparison with the hr aops the questions include 1 how do leachate dom and ammonia compete with each other for the oxidizing agents in a sr aop system 2 what are the utilization efficiencies of persulfate under different operating conditions 3 what are the oxidation products of ammonia after the sr aop treatment and 4 what are the plausible mechanisms for the so4 removal of ammonia the objective of this study was to re examine the removals of leachate dom and ammonia during thermally activated persulfate treatment of a typical mature municipal landfill leachate at different operating conditions data collected would be used to determine the competition of leachate organics and ammonia analyze the utilization efficiencies of persulfate identify the transformation products of ammonia and explore the reaction mechanisms behind the abatement of ammonia benefits and concerns of the sr aop technologies for leachate treatment were subsequently discussed finally this study would allow for re evaluation of sr aops for the treatment of municipal landfill leachate and comparison of them with hr aops for the removal of leachate pollutants of concern it should be noted that the effect of pretreatment was not investigated in this study due to two reasons though appropriate pre treatment may improve the performance of sulfate radical oxidation through alleviation of pollutant loadings firstly pre treatment is often unavailable in many countries e g the united states in which raw leachate is directly discharged into local wastewater treatment plants secondly leachate pre treatment mostly focuses on the mitigation of a major leachate pollutant e g ammonia and refractory dom the unique advantage of sulfate radical oxidative technologies over other oxidative processes e g hr aops is that sulfate radicals has a potential to directly and simultaneously address leachate dom and ammonia therefore it is of more interest to examine the treatment performance of sulfate radical oxidation with raw mature leachate 2 material and method chemical reagents leachate sample for the treatment experiments was a mixture of landfill leachates collected from landfill 1 a kearny nj usa and landfill 1 e north arlington nj usa operated by the new jersey meadowland commissions once collected the sample was stored in a zero headspace plastic bottle immediately transported to the innovative water treatment and reuse technology iwtrt laboratory at montclair state university montclair nj usa and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until use chemical parameters of the leachate are as follows ph 8 2 alkalinity 3300 mg l caco3 initial cod cod0 1096 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 560 mg l chloride cl 980 mg l nitrate nitrogen no3 n 0 mg l and nitrite nitrogen no2 n 0 mg l all the chemicals used were at least analytical grade except as noted sodium persulfate na2s2o8 98 fisher scientific fair lawn nj usa and sodium chloride nacl 99 0 alfa aesar ward hill ma usa were purchased from the fisher scientific in the tests to examine the treatment performance at different cl concentrations appropriate weights of nacl were added to the leachate to achieve designated cl levels before the treatment treatment experiments an aliquot of 40 ml of leachate was dispensed into a 60 ml serum vials capped with a rubber septum and installed in a water bath vwr scientific model 1205 cornelius or usa at a controlled temperature of 60 c our previous studies show that higher temperature could achieve better removals of cod and ammonia from landfill leachate deng and ezyske 2011 the temperature of 60 c was chosen based on our preliminary studies and the laboratory safety concern if needed solution ph was adjusted to a desirable level with 1 n naoh and 5 n h2so4 solutions before the treatment was initiated a 1 h warm up duration allowed the leachate solution to reach the desirable reaction temperature of 60 c once appropriate amounts of na2s2o8 were added the reactors were shaken manually to ensure that na2s2o8 was uniformly dissolved in the leachate in this study dimensionless oxidant dose dod was used to indicate the dose of sodium persulfate which is defined as below jung et al 2017 1 dod eq na 2 s 2 o 8 eq cod 0 eq nh 3 n 0 where e q n a 2 s 2 o 8 e q c o d 0 and e q n h 3 n 0 were the equivalents of the added na2s2o8 initial cod and initial nh3 n concentrations respectively dod provides the information on an oxidant dose relative to the quantities of target pollutants this indicator facilitates comparison of the treatment performances of an oxidation treatment technology for different leachate samples because initial pollutant strengths are always different among different landfill leachates jung et al 2017 proposed that the added oxidant theoretically eliminates all the target pollutants i e cod and ammonia in this study at dod 1 00 only when the oxidant can completely oxidize these target pollutants via electron transfer and the oxidant does not react with other co existing chemical species or decompose by itself presence or absence of persulfate in the reactors was qualitatively determined as follows 0 5 ml of sample was collected and added to 20 ml nai 1 0 g l and starch 1 0 g l mixed solution residual persulfate was present in the solution if the water became blue whereas persulfate all decomposed when the solution color was not changed after all the oxidizing agents were depleted the remaining leachate samples in the reactors were collected for further sample analysis all the tests were run in duplicate at least sample analysis solution ph was measured using a ph meter thermo scientific orion 2 star thermo scientific singapore cod was colorimetrically measured using the hach test kits hr cod digestion vials 0 1500 mg l nh3 n was analyzed using the nessler method with the hach ammonia nitrogen reagent set 0 02 2 50 mg l nh3 n no3 n was measured using the hach test kits nitraver 5 nitrate reagent powder pillows 0 3 30 0 mg l no3 n no2 n was measured using the diazotization method with the hach test kits nitriver 3 nitrite reagent powder pillows 0 002 0 300 mg l no2 n chloride was analyzed using the mercuric thiocyanate method with the hach chloride reagent set 0 0 25 0 mg l when the concentration of a measured chemical parameter exceeded its detection range the leachate samples were appropriately diluted with ultrapure water produced from a milli q direct 8 water purification system all the samples were analyzed at least in triplicates the mean values of the measurements are presented with error bars indicating one standard deviation in the figures 3 results removals of cod and nh3 n with different dods at ph 5 3 and 8 2 the original ph are shown in fig 1 the reduction of cod and nh3 n with the increasing dod shared similar three stage treatment patterns at the both ph during the first stage as the dod was increased from 0 0 to 0 5 the cod removal was increased from 0 to 76 and 81 at ph 5 3 and ph 8 2 respectively while the nh3 n abatement was insignificant 10 the decline in leachate dom and ammonia was ascribed to the production of active so4 from persulfate deng and ezyske 2011 as follows 2 s 2 o 8 2 δ 2 so 4 in the first phase the better removal of cod suggests that leachate dom was more competitive for so4 than nh3 n in this study however in the second stage as the dod further increased from 0 5 to 2 0 the cod removal was gradually increased to 96 at ph 5 3 and to 99 at ph 8 2 respectively in contrast the nh3 n removal was dramatically increased from 11 to 99 and from 4 to 93 at ph 5 3 and 8 2 respectively obviously nh3 n more rapidly reacted with so4 produced during this stage likely due to the two following reasons firstly dom had been largely removed after the first phase dod 0 0 0 5 so that the reaction rate of the residual dom with so4 dramatically dropped down for example the mass ratio of cod to nh3 n cod nh3 n was 2 04 1 00 for untreated leachate dod 0 0 but significantly went down to 0 55 1 00 at dod 0 5 from which the second stage began consequently the residual dom had a lower reaction rate for so4 produced secondly the residual dom as the oxidation products of raw leachate dom after the so4 oxidation became more recalcitrant to the so4 induced oxidation in the third stage dod 2 0 3 0 the removal efficiencies in both cod and nh3 n were insignificant likely because most of the so4 was scavenged by co existing chemical species e g cl and hco3 present in the complicated leachate matrix when the concentrations of the remaining dom and nh3 n were both extremely low scavenging of so4 with leachate matrix constituents would be discussed in detail later concentrations of nh3 n no3 n no2 n and residual cod with different dods at ph 5 3 and 8 2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively at dod 0 0 0 5 the abatement of nh3 n was insignificant while cod was dramatically removed from 1096 mg l to 266 and 214 mg l at initial ph 5 3 and 8 2 respectively suggesting that the most so4 produced reacted with doms in agreement with the observations in fig 1 when dod was increased from 0 5 to 3 0 no3 n was gradually accumulated in leachate accompanied with the removal of nh3 n but the formation of no2 n was not noticed at all the tested conditions at a high dod 0 5 the formation patterns of no3 n were different between ph 5 3 and 8 2 for ph 5 3 at dod 0 5 1 5 nh3 n was dramatically removed from 480 to 80 mg l while the yield of no3 n greatly went up from 120 to 290 mg l respectively of note no3 n was not further produced when dod was over 1 5 in contrast at ph 8 2 the nh3 n concentration was decreased from 540 to 72 mg l at dod 0 5 1 5 and then almost stabilized at dod 1 5 meanwhile no3 n was constantly increased from 19 to 455 mg l at dod 0 5 to 3 0 these findings indicate that nitrate was a major oxidation product of ammonia after the leachate treatment with sr aop it should be noted that nitrogen gas produced from so4 oxidation of ammonia could not be quantitatively determined in terms of mass balance in this study because we did not measure organic nitrogen in the leachate before and after the treatment however after the treatment at any specific dod the decreased ammonia nitrogen was much greater than the increased nitrate nitrogen moreover so4 hardly transforms inorganic nitrogen into its organic form therefore we conclude that nitrogen gas was significantly produced from the sulfate radical oxidation of ammonia our study also indicates that the sr aops slightly better removed cod and ammonia fig 1 and produced more nitrate fig 2 at an alkaline condition than at an acidic environment in the most cases these findings may be ascribed to two reasons firstly additional sulfate radicals could be produced through alkaline activation of persulfate at a high ph tsitonaki et al 2010 secondly oh can transform part of so4 into oh that can oxidize organic matter via different reaction mechanisms 3 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h 4 discussion 4 1 utilization efficiency of persulfate although so4 produced during sr aops is known to concurrently oxidize leachate dom and ammonia the efficiency of the added oxidant i e persulfate during the treatment is rarely investigated once dosed persulfate is consumed through at least three pathways firstly persulfate is subject to self decomposition tsitonaki et al 2010 as follows 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 2 s o 4 2 secondly persulfate may react with certain reducing agents in leachate thirdly persulfate is activated to produce much more reactive so4 eq 2 which can immediately react with many reducing agents in landfill leachate compared with highly reactive so4 persulfate slowly reacts with many leachate species such as dom and ammonia due to its relative stability and selective oxidation property therefore the persulfate consumption in leachate is primarily caused due to self decomposition and the formation of so4 for reacting with leachate dom and ammonia sulfate radicals are a short lived chemical oxidant with high reactivity and low selectivity like hydroxyl radicals though their reaction mechanisms with organic contaminants may be very different hydroxyl radicals preferably attack these compounds through hydrogen abstraction from organic compounds or oh radical addition to organic molecules neta et al 1988 in contrast so4 typically more rapidly transforms organic molecules into organic radicals via electron transfer tsitonaki et al 2010 in order to understand how efficiently the added persulfate was used for the removal of target pollutants in the aforementioned sr aop treatment tests we determined electron equivalents of the removed cod and nh3 n and electron utilization efficiencies against electron equivalents of the added persulfate fig 3 as seen the electron equivalent of removed target leachate contaminants cod and nh3 n were considerably increased from 0 meq l to 216 and 251 meq l at ph 5 3 and 8 2 respectively when the electron equivalent of the added oxidant was increased from 0 to 480 meq l however as the equivalent of added persulfate further went up to 960 meq l the increase in the equivalent of the eliminated target contaminants was almost marginal 248 meq l at ph 5 3 and 259 meq l at ph 8 2 to comprehend the utilization efficiency of the added persulfate under different treatment conditions electron utilization efficiency was used in this study as defined below 5 utilization efficiency eq of the oxidized cod and nh 3 n eq of the added oxidant 100 as shown in fig 3 the electron utilization efficiencies of added persulfate almost stabilized at a high range 70 73 at ph 5 3 and 77 78 at ph 8 2 at a low oxidant dose 80 160 meq l however with the increasing equivalent of persulfate from 160 to 960 meq l the utilization efficiencies significantly dropped down to 26 at either ph these findings indicate that so4 was more efficiently utilized for target leachate pollutants at a low chemical dose but the waste in the oxidant became gradually pronounced as the oxidant dose went up the observation was ascribed to the kinetic competition of target contaminants and co existing leachate matrix constituents species for so4 the strengths of the both target pollutants in untreated leachate were high having the more rapid reaction rates with so4 at a low persulfate dose the produced sulfate radicals preferentially react with these target pollutants leading to a high utilization efficiency however at a high persulfate dose part of the oxidants produced rapidly degrade dom and or ammonia to reduce their concentrations in leachate as a consequence of their decreased concentrations their reaction rates with the oxidants are reduced so that the consumption of so4 by leachate dom and ammonia became less in a municipal landfill leachate many other leachate matrix constituents largely present in landfill leachate may promptly react with so4 such as cl lutze et al 2015 co3 2 and hco3 with the rate constants of 1 3 6 6 108 m 1 s 1 1 6 9 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 2 6 9 1 106 m 1 s 1 respectively tsitonaki et al 2010 wacławek et al 2017 the consumption of sulfate radicals by the non target constituents led to the decrease of the utilization efficiency of persulfate 4 2 role of chloride and mechanisms for the ammonia removal chloride is a principal non target constituent abundantly present in a municipal landfill leachate it is reported to vary broadly between 0 and 77 000 mg l capable of inhibiting the treatment efficiency of hr aops during leachate treatment deng et al 2010 however it remains unknown how the anion influences the sr aops for the treatment of landfill leachate the effect of chloride on the treatment performance of sr aop is shown in fig 4 at a specific dod between 0 0 and 0 5 a low cod removal was observed at a higher cl concentration indicating that chloride suppressed the degradation of leachate dom by so4 however it is of interest that a better removal of ammonia nitrogen was achieved at 2095 mg l cl than at 980 mg l cl at any specific dod suggesting that cl could improve the abatement of nh3 n removal of leachate cod is ascribed to the degradation of leachate dom by so4 sulfate radicals are an extremely reactive oxidizing species capable of mineralizing dissolved organic compounds in water the sulfate radical chemistry has been utilized to develop persulfate based total organic carbon toc analyzers peyton 1993 however in the presence of cl so4 can react with chloride for producing chlorine radicals which are little generated from the reactions with hydroxyl radicals neta et al 1988 lutze et al 2015 chawla and fessenden 1975 6 s o 4 c l s o 4 2 c l k 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 cl can combine cl to produce dichloride radicals cl2 yu et al 2004 liang et al 2006 bennedsen et al 2012 7 c l c l c l 2 k 7 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 the both new radicals are much less reactive than so4 thereby leading to a relatively low cod removal for example the second order rate constants of cl reacting with organic molecules range within 103 1010 m 1 s 1 lower than those in the reactions of so4 with organic compounds 106 109 m 1 s 1 tsitonaki et al 2010 huie and clifton 1989 clifton and huie 1989 the inhibiting mechanisms of cl in the sr aops for the removal of leachate dom is similar to those of cl during the hr aop treatment deng et al 2010 the inhibiting effect of cl in sulfate radical oxidation of organic compounds have been reported elsewhere peyton 1993 liang et al 2006 bennedsen et al 2012 fang et al 2012 the enhanced effect of cl on the ammonia removal might be achieved through two reaction pathways firstly different from oh reacting slowly with ammonia so4 is capable of directly oxidizing ammonia and ammonium as follows neta et al 1978 8 s o 4 n h 3 n h 4 p r o d u c t s k 3 0 10 5 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 in the second plausible pathway the alleviation of ammonia is due to the formation of chlorine species and molecular chloride cl2 anipsitakis et al 2008 cl2 in the leachate may be produced through the recombination of cl2 eq 9 and or the reaction between cl2 and cl eq 10 yu et al 2004 9 c l 2 c l 2 c l 2 2 c l k 9 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 10 c l 2 c l c l 2 c l k 2 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 it is well known that h can be accumulated during a thermally activated persulfate system in this study we noticed that the leachate ph after the sr aop treatment dropped from 8 11 at dod 0 00 to 6 28 at dod 0 25 indirectly validating the occurrence of eq 11 during the sr aop treatment after produced hocl can promptly oxidize ammonia into different chloramines depending on their stochiometric ratios 11 nh 3 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o 12 n h 2 c l h o c l n h c l 2 h 2 o 13 nh cl 2 hocl ncl 3 h 2 o it is well known that the aforementioned reactions between ammonia and chlorine occur during chlorination of drinking water in the presence of ammonia crittenden et al 2012 4 3 re evaluation of sr aop for leachate treatment it is of importance to provide an in depth evaluation of sr aops for the treatment of landfill leachate particularly in comparison with hr aops that have been widely investigated and begun to be employed in the leachate treatment practices although the both aop types can effectively alleviate refractory dom in leachate via chemical oxidation the sr aops are capable of largely removing ammonia another representative leachate pollutant which is poorly removed by hr aops in the engineering practices biological treatment typically serves as an on site treatment option for the mitigation of ammonia in landfill leachate prior to other on site advanced treatments for the abatement of leachate cod however the treatment train sequentially consisting of two or more treatment steps increases the capital and o m costs as well as the complexity of system design and operation therefore the benefit of sr aops distinct from hr aops is that they can concurrently remove the two major leachate pollutants i e refractory leachate dom and ammonia in a single treatment step enabling a simple treatment design and potentially saving the treatment costs however three aspects possibly restricting the sr aop application should be carefully considered before an sr aop is selected for the treatment of landfill leachate firstly the addition of persulfate into leachate can eventually lead to the increase of total dissolved solids tds because the final reduction product of persulfate is inert sulfate anion in contrast change in the leachate tds is not a concern for hr aops because hydroxyl radicals cannot produce a large number of dissolved salts the increase extent of tds after the sr aop treatment relies upon the dose of persulfate added for example in this study the tds increase due to the formation of sulfate at dod 1 0 was approximately 2 4 g l the increase of tds may bring about two negative impacts 1 the effluent tds may violate the local leachate discharge limit and 2 sulfate abundantly present in effluent may be biologically reduced to hydrogen sulfide e g in sewers that can corrode concrete release obnoxious odors and threaten sewer workers due to the toxicity of sulfide gas zhang et al 2008 secondly nitrate can be produced along with chemical oxidation of ammonia for this study the level of nitrate nitrogen reached a few tens several hundreds of mg l if the sr aop treated landfill leachate is directly discharged into natural receiving water bodies the nitrate can cause harmful algal blooming to degrade the quality of natural water furthermore nitrate is a pollutant itself long term exposure to nitrate may cause diuresis increased starchy deposits and hemorrhaging of the spleen whereas a short term uptake of excessive nitrate can interfere with the oxygen carrying capacity of the child s blood mccasland et al 1985 us environmental protection agency epa regulates its maximum contaminant level at 10 mg l therefore alleviation of nitrate in the sr aop treated leachate should be considered before discharge biological denitrification is an economically affordable and technically effective process for the removal of nitrate but the method is adopted only after biological treatability of the treated leachate is carefully evaluated because some leachate matrix constituents e g toxic metals and probably more toxic organic degradation compounds after sulfate radical oxidation may significantly inhibit microbial activity during denitrification thirdly the ph decrease due to formation of hcl has a potential to significantly reduce the effluent ph so that additional ph adjustment with lime is likely required to recover ph back to a neutral range mature landfill leachate typically has a neutral to weakly alkaline ph kjeldsen et al 2002 the presence of bicarbonate at a high concentration typically several hundred a few thousands of mg l as caco3 can provide a strong ph buffer capacity to maintain leachate ph during treatment however h may be continuously produced via eqs 6 and 7 and 9 11 as long as persulfate remains in a leachate containing cl the final leachate ph relies heavily upon the initial leachate alkalinity persulfate dose and chloride concentration in leachate it is possible that the treated leachate required an additional ph adjustment after sr aop which can increase the treatment complexity and costs for example in this study the final leachate ph dropped below 4 0 at dod 0 50 the three aforementioned outcomes can limit the application of sr aops to leachate treatments in practice generally their negative impacts become worse as the persulfate dose is increased hence the selection of an appropriate persulfate dose for treatment of a specific landfill leachate is key to maximizing chemical oxidative capability of sulfate radicals while restricting the effluent tds nitrate and ph within their respective acceptable levels on the other hand because these negative impacts are minimal when sr aops serve as pre treatment typically with a low persulfate dose the design of sr aops as a supplementary treatment prior to other treatments may be encouraged 5 conclusions this laboratory study on the performance of a thermally activated persulfate system for treatment of a mature landfill leachate answered key questions for in depth evaluations of the emerging sr aop leachate treatment technology the study shows that reactive oxidizing agents are competed among leachate dom ammonia and other leachate matrix constituents during the sr aop treatment and the removal efficiencies of cod and ammonia nitrogen depend heavily upon persulfate dose in addition to solution ph the added persulfate is more efficiently utilized for the two leachate pollutants at a low dose whereas more persulfate is consumed by other leachate constituents e g cl and co3 2 and or self decomposition as the persulfate dose is increased the final products of ammonia oxidation include nitrate and nitrogen gas but nitrite is undetectable after the treatment although sr aops can concurrently alleviate leachate dom and ammonia in a single treatment step three outcomes which are not concerns for the hr aop treatment of landfill leachate may restrict their application including the accumulation of effluent tds the production of undesirable nitrate from ammonia and the ph decrease due to the formation of hcl therefore the three potentially negative impacts should be carefully evaluated when a sr aop system is applied for treatment of a specific landfill leachate on the other hand sr aops as pre treatment may be another promising approach to applying the technology to leachate treatment because much less persulfate is typically dosed for pre treatment of a landfill leachate acknowledgments this study was supported in part by chinese scholarship council csc the

strategies landfilling has been the most popular one in the most countries for example the united states landfilled 52 5 of 262 million tons of msw generated in 2015 usepa 2018 however landfill leachate a highly polluted liquid is continuously generated as a consequence of rainwater percolating through msw within a landfill cell successful management of landfill leachate is key to archiving the sustainability of urban msw management due to two reasons firstly leachate management has a high capital and operations maintenance o m cost the highest single landfill operating expense in the united states walker 2013 torrens 2013 secondly various leachate pollutants such as refractory dissolve organic matter dom toxic heavy metals and ammonia can cause soil surface water and groundwater pollution kjeldsen et al 2002 treatment of municipal landfill leachate began in the 1970s boyle and ham 1974 ho et al 1974 chian and dewalle 1976 since then a variety of physicochemical and biological treatment technologies have been investigated and applied among the different treatment options chemical oxidation technologies are highly attractive due to a relatively short treatment duration and the possibility to transform toxic pollutants into less and even non toxic substances deng 2009 deng and zhao 2015 wiszniowski et al 2006 considering that dom in many mature leachates a primary landfill leachate pollutant is mostly biologically recalcitrant hydroxyl radical oh based advanced oxidation processes hr aops such as the fenton reactions gau and chang 1996 lopez et al 2004 deng and englehardt 2006 deng 2007 zhang et al 2005 ozone o3 h2o2 tizaoui et al 2007 wu et al 2004 titanium dioxide tio2 catalyzed uv oxidation jia et al 2011 and ultrasound irradiation wang et al 2008 have been extensively studied due to the high reduction potential and unselective oxidative property of oh deng and zhao 2015 however the hr aops poorly remove ammonia another principal landfill leachate pollutant due to the slow reaction rate between oh and ammonia huang et al 2008 besides hr aops the other aops are achieved through the generation of sufficient sulfate radicals so4 as a principal oxidizing agent so4 can be produced through the activation of persulfate anions s2o8 2 or peroxymonosulfate anions hso5 with heat metals elevated ph uv irradiation or other methods antoniou et al 2010 tsitonaki et al 2010 so4 is a strong chemical oxidant with a standard redox potential e o between 2 5 and 3 1 vvs nhe neta et al 1988 it is a selective chemical oxidant related to oh during the reactions with target pollutants in water neta et al 1978 1988 xiao et al 2018 xiao et al 2015 ye et al 2017 the so called sulfate radical based aops sr aops were early demonstrated to be effective for in situ chemical oxidation of subsurface organic pollutants for groundwater cleanup huling and pivetz 2006 and for the destruction of micro pollutants in water antoniou et al 2010 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 we first evaluated sr aops for the treatment of a municipal landfill leachate deng and ezyske 2011 results show that so4 was advantageous over oh because so4 could simultaneously and effectively remove both refractory dom and ammonia in landfill leachate thereafter many other studies were carried out to investigate the treatment of landfill leachate with the addition of persulfate a major purpose in the treatment designs was to produce so4 as a primary or supplementary oxidizing agent for improving the treatment efficiency the treatment designs include the combination of ozone and persulfate amr et al 2013a 2013b an electro fe2 persulfate process zhang et al 2014 a combined persulfate and hydrogen peroxide process hilles et al 2015 2016a 2016b granular activated carbon supported iron for catalyzing persulfate li et al 2016 a ferrous ion activated persulfate process asha et al 2016 microwave irradiation with persulfate kim and ahn 2015 and an ultrasonic activated persulfate system yang et al 2015 encouraging results from the aforementioned treatments validate the positive role of sulfate radicals in the destruction of leachate pollutants most of these studies focused on maximization of the removal efficiencies for target leachate pollutants e g leachate dom through the optimization of different operating factors although sr aops have proven effective for improving the removals of cod and ammonia from landfill leachate four key questions are not well answered so that we cannot have a comprehensive evaluation on sr aops for the treatment of municipal landfill leachate particularly in comparison with the hr aops the questions include 1 how do leachate dom and ammonia compete with each other for the oxidizing agents in a sr aop system 2 what are the utilization efficiencies of persulfate under different operating conditions 3 what are the oxidation products of ammonia after the sr aop treatment and 4 what are the plausible mechanisms for the so4 removal of ammonia the objective of this study was to re examine the removals of leachate dom and ammonia during thermally activated persulfate treatment of a typical mature municipal landfill leachate at different operating conditions data collected would be used to determine the competition of leachate organics and ammonia analyze the utilization efficiencies of persulfate identify the transformation products of ammonia and explore the reaction mechanisms behind the abatement of ammonia benefits and concerns of the sr aop technologies for leachate treatment were subsequently discussed finally this study would allow for re evaluation of sr aops for the treatment of municipal landfill leachate and comparison of them with hr aops for the removal of leachate pollutants of concern it should be noted that the effect of pretreatment was not investigated in this study due to two reasons though appropriate pre treatment may improve the performance of sulfate radical oxidation through alleviation of pollutant loadings firstly pre treatment is often unavailable in many countries e g the united states in which raw leachate is directly discharged into local wastewater treatment plants secondly leachate pre treatment mostly focuses on the mitigation of a major leachate pollutant e g ammonia and refractory dom the unique advantage of sulfate radical oxidative technologies over other oxidative processes e g hr aops is that sulfate radicals has a potential to directly and simultaneously address leachate dom and ammonia therefore it is of more interest to examine the treatment performance of sulfate radical oxidation with raw mature leachate 2 material and method chemical reagents leachate sample for the treatment experiments was a mixture of landfill leachates collected from landfill 1 a kearny nj usa and landfill 1 e north arlington nj usa operated by the new jersey meadowland commissions once collected the sample was stored in a zero headspace plastic bottle immediately transported to the innovative water treatment and reuse technology iwtrt laboratory at montclair state university montclair nj usa and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until use chemical parameters of the leachate are as follows ph 8 2 alkalinity 3300 mg l caco3 initial cod cod0 1096 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 560 mg l chloride cl 980 mg l nitrate nitrogen no3 n 0 mg l and nitrite nitrogen no2 n 0 mg l all the chemicals used were at least analytical grade except as noted sodium persulfate na2s2o8 98 fisher scientific fair lawn nj usa and sodium chloride nacl 99 0 alfa aesar ward hill ma usa were purchased from the fisher scientific in the tests to examine the treatment performance at different cl concentrations appropriate weights of nacl were added to the leachate to achieve designated cl levels before the treatment treatment experiments an aliquot of 40 ml of leachate was dispensed into a 60 ml serum vials capped with a rubber septum and installed in a water bath vwr scientific model 1205 cornelius or usa at a controlled temperature of 60 c our previous studies show that higher temperature could achieve better removals of cod and ammonia from landfill leachate deng and ezyske 2011 the temperature of 60 c was chosen based on our preliminary studies and the laboratory safety concern if needed solution ph was adjusted to a desirable level with 1 n naoh and 5 n h2so4 solutions before the treatment was initiated a 1 h warm up duration allowed the leachate solution to reach the desirable reaction temperature of 60 c once appropriate amounts of na2s2o8 were added the reactors were shaken manually to ensure that na2s2o8 was uniformly dissolved in the leachate in this study dimensionless oxidant dose dod was used to indicate the dose of sodium persulfate which is defined as below jung et al 2017 1 dod eq na 2 s 2 o 8 eq cod 0 eq nh 3 n 0 where e q n a 2 s 2 o 8 e q c o d 0 and e q n h 3 n 0 were the equivalents of the added na2s2o8 initial cod and initial nh3 n concentrations respectively dod provides the information on an oxidant dose relative to the quantities of target pollutants this indicator facilitates comparison of the treatment performances of an oxidation treatment technology for different leachate samples because initial pollutant strengths are always different among different landfill leachates jung et al 2017 proposed that the added oxidant theoretically eliminates all the target pollutants i e cod and ammonia in this study at dod 1 00 only when the oxidant can completely oxidize these target pollutants via electron transfer and the oxidant does not react with other co existing chemical species or decompose by itself presence or absence of persulfate in the reactors was qualitatively determined as follows 0 5 ml of sample was collected and added to 20 ml nai 1 0 g l and starch 1 0 g l mixed solution residual persulfate was present in the solution if the water became blue whereas persulfate all decomposed when the solution color was not changed after all the oxidizing agents were depleted the remaining leachate samples in the reactors were collected for further sample analysis all the tests were run in duplicate at least sample analysis solution ph was measured using a ph meter thermo scientific orion 2 star thermo scientific singapore cod was colorimetrically measured using the hach test kits hr cod digestion vials 0 1500 mg l nh3 n was analyzed using the nessler method with the hach ammonia nitrogen reagent set 0 02 2 50 mg l nh3 n no3 n was measured using the hach test kits nitraver 5 nitrate reagent powder pillows 0 3 30 0 mg l no3 n no2 n was measured using the diazotization method with the hach test kits nitriver 3 nitrite reagent powder pillows 0 002 0 300 mg l no2 n chloride was analyzed using the mercuric thiocyanate method with the hach chloride reagent set 0 0 25 0 mg l when the concentration of a measured chemical parameter exceeded its detection range the leachate samples were appropriately diluted with ultrapure water produced from a milli q direct 8 water purification system all the samples were analyzed at least in triplicates the mean values of the measurements are presented with error bars indicating one standard deviation in the figures 3 results removals of cod and nh3 n with different dods at ph 5 3 and 8 2 the original ph are shown in fig 1 the reduction of cod and nh3 n with the increasing dod shared similar three stage treatment patterns at the both ph during the first stage as the dod was increased from 0 0 to 0 5 the cod removal was increased from 0 to 76 and 81 at ph 5 3 and ph 8 2 respectively while the nh3 n abatement was insignificant 10 the decline in leachate dom and ammonia was ascribed to the production of active so4 from persulfate deng and ezyske 2011 as follows 2 s 2 o 8 2 δ 2 so 4 in the first phase the better removal of cod suggests that leachate dom was more competitive for so4 than nh3 n in this study however in the second stage as the dod further increased from 0 5 to 2 0 the cod removal was gradually increased to 96 at ph 5 3 and to 99 at ph 8 2 respectively in contrast the nh3 n removal was dramatically increased from 11 to 99 and from 4 to 93 at ph 5 3 and 8 2 respectively obviously nh3 n more rapidly reacted with so4 produced during this stage likely due to the two following reasons firstly dom had been largely removed after the first phase dod 0 0 0 5 so that the reaction rate of the residual dom with so4 dramatically dropped down for example the mass ratio of cod to nh3 n cod nh3 n was 2 04 1 00 for untreated leachate dod 0 0 but significantly went down to 0 55 1 00 at dod 0 5 from which the second stage began consequently the residual dom had a lower reaction rate for so4 produced secondly the residual dom as the oxidation products of raw leachate dom after the so4 oxidation became more recalcitrant to the so4 induced oxidation in the third stage dod 2 0 3 0 the removal efficiencies in both cod and nh3 n were insignificant likely because most of the so4 was scavenged by co existing chemical species e g cl and hco3 present in the complicated leachate matrix when the concentrations of the remaining dom and nh3 n were both extremely low scavenging of so4 with leachate matrix constituents would be discussed in detail later concentrations of nh3 n no3 n no2 n and residual cod with different dods at ph 5 3 and 8 2 are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively at dod 0 0 0 5 the abatement of nh3 n was insignificant while cod was dramatically removed from 1096 mg l to 266 and 214 mg l at initial ph 5 3 and 8 2 respectively suggesting that the most so4 produced reacted with doms in agreement with the observations in fig 1 when dod was increased from 0 5 to 3 0 no3 n was gradually accumulated in leachate accompanied with the removal of nh3 n but the formation of no2 n was not noticed at all the tested conditions at a high dod 0 5 the formation patterns of no3 n were different between ph 5 3 and 8 2 for ph 5 3 at dod 0 5 1 5 nh3 n was dramatically removed from 480 to 80 mg l while the yield of no3 n greatly went up from 120 to 290 mg l respectively of note no3 n was not further produced when dod was over 1 5 in contrast at ph 8 2 the nh3 n concentration was decreased from 540 to 72 mg l at dod 0 5 1 5 and then almost stabilized at dod 1 5 meanwhile no3 n was constantly increased from 19 to 455 mg l at dod 0 5 to 3 0 these findings indicate that nitrate was a major oxidation product of ammonia after the leachate treatment with sr aop it should be noted that nitrogen gas produced from so4 oxidation of ammonia could not be quantitatively determined in terms of mass balance in this study because we did not measure organic nitrogen in the leachate before and after the treatment however after the treatment at any specific dod the decreased ammonia nitrogen was much greater than the increased nitrate nitrogen moreover so4 hardly transforms inorganic nitrogen into its organic form therefore we conclude that nitrogen gas was significantly produced from the sulfate radical oxidation of ammonia our study also indicates that the sr aops slightly better removed cod and ammonia fig 1 and produced more nitrate fig 2 at an alkaline condition than at an acidic environment in the most cases these findings may be ascribed to two reasons firstly additional sulfate radicals could be produced through alkaline activation of persulfate at a high ph tsitonaki et al 2010 secondly oh can transform part of so4 into oh that can oxidize organic matter via different reaction mechanisms 3 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h 4 discussion 4 1 utilization efficiency of persulfate although so4 produced during sr aops is known to concurrently oxidize leachate dom and ammonia the efficiency of the added oxidant i e persulfate during the treatment is rarely investigated once dosed persulfate is consumed through at least three pathways firstly persulfate is subject to self decomposition tsitonaki et al 2010 as follows 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 e 2 s o 4 2 secondly persulfate may react with certain reducing agents in leachate thirdly persulfate is activated to produce much more reactive so4 eq 2 which can immediately react with many reducing agents in landfill leachate compared with highly reactive so4 persulfate slowly reacts with many leachate species such as dom and ammonia due to its relative stability and selective oxidation property therefore the persulfate consumption in leachate is primarily caused due to self decomposition and the formation of so4 for reacting with leachate dom and ammonia sulfate radicals are a short lived chemical oxidant with high reactivity and low selectivity like hydroxyl radicals though their reaction mechanisms with organic contaminants may be very different hydroxyl radicals preferably attack these compounds through hydrogen abstraction from organic compounds or oh radical addition to organic molecules neta et al 1988 in contrast so4 typically more rapidly transforms organic molecules into organic radicals via electron transfer tsitonaki et al 2010 in order to understand how efficiently the added persulfate was used for the removal of target pollutants in the aforementioned sr aop treatment tests we determined electron equivalents of the removed cod and nh3 n and electron utilization efficiencies against electron equivalents of the added persulfate fig 3 as seen the electron equivalent of removed target leachate contaminants cod and nh3 n were considerably increased from 0 meq l to 216 and 251 meq l at ph 5 3 and 8 2 respectively when the electron equivalent of the added oxidant was increased from 0 to 480 meq l however as the equivalent of added persulfate further went up to 960 meq l the increase in the equivalent of the eliminated target contaminants was almost marginal 248 meq l at ph 5 3 and 259 meq l at ph 8 2 to comprehend the utilization efficiency of the added persulfate under different treatment conditions electron utilization efficiency was used in this study as defined below 5 utilization efficiency eq of the oxidized cod and nh 3 n eq of the added oxidant 100 as shown in fig 3 the electron utilization efficiencies of added persulfate almost stabilized at a high range 70 73 at ph 5 3 and 77 78 at ph 8 2 at a low oxidant dose 80 160 meq l however with the increasing equivalent of persulfate from 160 to 960 meq l the utilization efficiencies significantly dropped down to 26 at either ph these findings indicate that so4 was more efficiently utilized for target leachate pollutants at a low chemical dose but the waste in the oxidant became gradually pronounced as the oxidant dose went up the observation was ascribed to the kinetic competition of target contaminants and co existing leachate matrix constituents species for so4 the strengths of the both target pollutants in untreated leachate were high having the more rapid reaction rates with so4 at a low persulfate dose the produced sulfate radicals preferentially react with these target pollutants leading to a high utilization efficiency however at a high persulfate dose part of the oxidants produced rapidly degrade dom and or ammonia to reduce their concentrations in leachate as a consequence of their decreased concentrations their reaction rates with the oxidants are reduced so that the consumption of so4 by leachate dom and ammonia became less in a municipal landfill leachate many other leachate matrix constituents largely present in landfill leachate may promptly react with so4 such as cl lutze et al 2015 co3 2 and hco3 with the rate constants of 1 3 6 6 108 m 1 s 1 1 6 9 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 2 6 9 1 106 m 1 s 1 respectively tsitonaki et al 2010 wacławek et al 2017 the consumption of sulfate radicals by the non target constituents led to the decrease of the utilization efficiency of persulfate 4 2 role of chloride and mechanisms for the ammonia removal chloride is a principal non target constituent abundantly present in a municipal landfill leachate it is reported to vary broadly between 0 and 77 000 mg l capable of inhibiting the treatment efficiency of hr aops during leachate treatment deng et al 2010 however it remains unknown how the anion influences the sr aops for the treatment of landfill leachate the effect of chloride on the treatment performance of sr aop is shown in fig 4 at a specific dod between 0 0 and 0 5 a low cod removal was observed at a higher cl concentration indicating that chloride suppressed the degradation of leachate dom by so4 however it is of interest that a better removal of ammonia nitrogen was achieved at 2095 mg l cl than at 980 mg l cl at any specific dod suggesting that cl could improve the abatement of nh3 n removal of leachate cod is ascribed to the degradation of leachate dom by so4 sulfate radicals are an extremely reactive oxidizing species capable of mineralizing dissolved organic compounds in water the sulfate radical chemistry has been utilized to develop persulfate based total organic carbon toc analyzers peyton 1993 however in the presence of cl so4 can react with chloride for producing chlorine radicals which are little generated from the reactions with hydroxyl radicals neta et al 1988 lutze et al 2015 chawla and fessenden 1975 6 s o 4 c l s o 4 2 c l k 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 8 cl can combine cl to produce dichloride radicals cl2 yu et al 2004 liang et al 2006 bennedsen et al 2012 7 c l c l c l 2 k 7 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 the both new radicals are much less reactive than so4 thereby leading to a relatively low cod removal for example the second order rate constants of cl reacting with organic molecules range within 103 1010 m 1 s 1 lower than those in the reactions of so4 with organic compounds 106 109 m 1 s 1 tsitonaki et al 2010 huie and clifton 1989 clifton and huie 1989 the inhibiting mechanisms of cl in the sr aops for the removal of leachate dom is similar to those of cl during the hr aop treatment deng et al 2010 the inhibiting effect of cl in sulfate radical oxidation of organic compounds have been reported elsewhere peyton 1993 liang et al 2006 bennedsen et al 2012 fang et al 2012 the enhanced effect of cl on the ammonia removal might be achieved through two reaction pathways firstly different from oh reacting slowly with ammonia so4 is capable of directly oxidizing ammonia and ammonium as follows neta et al 1978 8 s o 4 n h 3 n h 4 p r o d u c t s k 3 0 10 5 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 in the second plausible pathway the alleviation of ammonia is due to the formation of chlorine species and molecular chloride cl2 anipsitakis et al 2008 cl2 in the leachate may be produced through the recombination of cl2 eq 9 and or the reaction between cl2 and cl eq 10 yu et al 2004 9 c l 2 c l 2 c l 2 2 c l k 9 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 10 c l 2 c l c l 2 c l k 2 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 it is well known that h can be accumulated during a thermally activated persulfate system in this study we noticed that the leachate ph after the sr aop treatment dropped from 8 11 at dod 0 00 to 6 28 at dod 0 25 indirectly validating the occurrence of eq 11 during the sr aop treatment after produced hocl can promptly oxidize ammonia into different chloramines depending on their stochiometric ratios 11 nh 3 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o 12 n h 2 c l h o c l n h c l 2 h 2 o 13 nh cl 2 hocl ncl 3 h 2 o it is well known that the aforementioned reactions between ammonia and chlorine occur during chlorination of drinking water in the presence of ammonia crittenden et al 2012 4 3 re evaluation of sr aop for leachate treatment it is of importance to provide an in depth evaluation of sr aops for the treatment of landfill leachate particularly in comparison with hr aops that have been widely investigated and begun to be employed in the leachate treatment practices although the both aop types can effectively alleviate refractory dom in leachate via chemical oxidation the sr aops are capable of largely removing ammonia another representative leachate pollutant which is poorly removed by hr aops in the engineering practices biological treatment typically serves as an on site treatment option for the mitigation of ammonia in landfill leachate prior to other on site advanced treatments for the abatement of leachate cod however the treatment train sequentially consisting of two or more treatment steps increases the capital and o m costs as well as the complexity of system design and operation therefore the benefit of sr aops distinct from hr aops is that they can concurrently remove the two major leachate pollutants i e refractory leachate dom and ammonia in a single treatment step enabling a simple treatment design and potentially saving the treatment costs however three aspects possibly restricting the sr aop application should be carefully considered before an sr aop is selected for the treatment of landfill leachate firstly the addition of persulfate into leachate can eventually lead to the increase of total dissolved solids tds because the final reduction product of persulfate is inert sulfate anion in contrast change in the leachate tds is not a concern for hr aops because hydroxyl radicals cannot produce a large number of dissolved salts the increase extent of tds after the sr aop treatment relies upon the dose of persulfate added for example in this study the tds increase due to the formation of sulfate at dod 1 0 was approximately 2 4 g l the increase of tds may bring about two negative impacts 1 the effluent tds may violate the local leachate discharge limit and 2 sulfate abundantly present in effluent may be biologically reduced to hydrogen sulfide e g in sewers that can corrode concrete release obnoxious odors and threaten sewer workers due to the toxicity of sulfide gas zhang et al 2008 secondly nitrate can be produced along with chemical oxidation of ammonia for this study the level of nitrate nitrogen reached a few tens several hundreds of mg l if the sr aop treated landfill leachate is directly discharged into natural receiving water bodies the nitrate can cause harmful algal blooming to degrade the quality of natural water furthermore nitrate is a pollutant itself long term exposure to nitrate may cause diuresis increased starchy deposits and hemorrhaging of the spleen whereas a short term uptake of excessive nitrate can interfere with the oxygen carrying capacity of the child s blood mccasland et al 1985 us environmental protection agency epa regulates its maximum contaminant level at 10 mg l therefore alleviation of nitrate in the sr aop treated leachate should be considered before discharge biological denitrification is an economically affordable and technically effective process for the removal of nitrate but the method is adopted only after biological treatability of the treated leachate is carefully evaluated because some leachate matrix constituents e g toxic metals and probably more toxic organic degradation compounds after sulfate radical oxidation may significantly inhibit microbial activity during denitrification thirdly the ph decrease due to formation of hcl has a potential to significantly reduce the effluent ph so that additional ph adjustment with lime is likely required to recover ph back to a neutral range mature landfill leachate typically has a neutral to weakly alkaline ph kjeldsen et al 2002 the presence of bicarbonate at a high concentration typically several hundred a few thousands of mg l as caco3 can provide a strong ph buffer capacity to maintain leachate ph during treatment however h may be continuously produced via eqs 6 and 7 and 9 11 as long as persulfate remains in a leachate containing cl the final leachate ph relies heavily upon the initial leachate alkalinity persulfate dose and chloride concentration in leachate it is possible that the treated leachate required an additional ph adjustment after sr aop which can increase the treatment complexity and costs for example in this study the final leachate ph dropped below 4 0 at dod 0 50 the three aforementioned outcomes can limit the application of sr aops to leachate treatments in practice generally their negative impacts become worse as the persulfate dose is increased hence the selection of an appropriate persulfate dose for treatment of a specific landfill leachate is key to maximizing chemical oxidative capability of sulfate radicals while restricting the effluent tds nitrate and ph within their respective acceptable levels on the other hand because these negative impacts are minimal when sr aops serve as pre treatment typically with a low persulfate dose the design of sr aops as a supplementary treatment prior to other treatments may be encouraged 5 conclusions this laboratory study on the performance of a thermally activated persulfate system for treatment of a mature landfill leachate answered key questions for in depth evaluations of the emerging sr aop leachate treatment technology the study shows that reactive oxidizing agents are competed among leachate dom ammonia and other leachate matrix constituents during the sr aop treatment and the removal efficiencies of cod and ammonia nitrogen depend heavily upon persulfate dose in addition to solution ph the added persulfate is more efficiently utilized for the two leachate pollutants at a low dose whereas more persulfate is consumed by other leachate constituents e g cl and co3 2 and or self decomposition as the persulfate dose is increased the final products of ammonia oxidation include nitrate and nitrogen gas but nitrite is undetectable after the treatment although sr aops can concurrently alleviate leachate dom and ammonia in a single treatment step three outcomes which are not concerns for the hr aop treatment of landfill leachate may restrict their application including the accumulation of effluent tds the production of undesirable nitrate from ammonia and the ph decrease due to the formation of hcl therefore the three potentially negative impacts should be carefully evaluated when a sr aop system is applied for treatment of a specific landfill leachate on the other hand sr aops as pre treatment may be another promising approach to applying the technology to leachate treatment because much less persulfate is typically dosed for pre treatment of a landfill leachate acknowledgments this study was supported in part by chinese scholarship council csc the

the places of samplers deployment using flow tracker device sontek san diego ca flow velocities measured in the field were used as inputs into the linear regression model for rs and flow velocities

dwtps their identification cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality agreements with the companies operating these dwtps thus they will be referred to as locality reservoir dwtp a b or c characteristics of the localities and dwtps are summarized in table a 1 briefly raw water for dwtp a was collected by gravity flow from the dam intake wells located in the depths 13 m 28 m and 46 m

approximately in the middle of the epilimnion surface mixed layer which represents the major niche for mc producing planktonic cyanobacteria in the reservoir c passive samplers were placed also into the depths 10 m 20 m and 25 m bwl the bottom depth was 25 31 m depending on the water level in all dwtps passive samplers were deployed after the major treatment steps raw water intake of untreated water from the reservoirs coagulation after mixing with the coagulant clarification after clarification with daf or sedimentation filtration after rapid sand filtration gac after gac filtration final treated drinking water after disinfection due to mechanical constraints closed pipelines samplers could not be deployed after sand filtration steps in dwtps a and b and after gac filtration in dwtp c the samplers were exchanged biweekly simultaneously with discrete sampling and in situ measurements in the reservoirs depth integrated 0 4 m bwl water samples were collected using a hosepipe sampler

photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a total phytoplankton marker and phycocyanin cyanobacteria marker were measured in situ by ysi 6600 v2 multiparameter probe ysi yellow springs oh along with several physicochemical parameters methods a 2 2 tables b 1 3 vertical profile data were obtained for the reservoirs fig c 1 4 and used to calculate a depth weighted average of each parameter for the horizon

centrifugation methods a 3 2 monoclonal anti mc antibody mc10e7 enzo biochemicals new york ny recognizing major mc variants including mc rr mc yr and mc lr was used for the immunochemical detection methods a 4 2 based on a previously published protocol blahova et al 2007 jancula et al 2014 water samples 1 l for analysis of extracellular and intracellular mcs were filtered through a 1 μm glass fiber filter filpap pernstejn czech republic prior to freezing methods a 3 3 the filters were extracted with 50 v v aqueous methanol using an ultrasonic probe 10 ml aliquots of the filtrates were concentrated 10 times by lyophilization and redissolved in 50 v v methanol mcs were analyzed by lc ms ms membranes and sorbent from disassembled passive samplers were extracted with pure methanol on an ultrasonic bath and the extracts were concentrated by evaporation methods a 3 4 hplc dad analyses were done using agilent 1100 series hplc agilent technologies waldbronn germany coupled to a diode

information about method lod loq values for all mc variants is provided in table a 6 2 4 4 data analysis correlation analyses contour graphs and statistical comparisons were calculated using sigma plot systat software london uk for the statistical analyses values below loq were substituted with loq 2 values below lod were zero substituted unless stated otherwise concentrations of photosynthetic pigments or mcs in the top surface layer of the reservoirs significantly correlated with the depth integrated values for the horizon of 0 4 m bwl derived from either vertical profile ysi measurements or hosepipe sampling fig c 5 tables b 1 3 for the simplicity only the depth integrated values will be presented in the main text 3 results and discussion 3 1 passive sampler calibration the uptake of mc rr yr and lr by the samplers was linear for at least 14 d and up to 0 4 m s flow velocity since only minor differences in rs values were observed with increasing exposure time table a 2 which indicates the kinetic sampling regime vrana et al 2006 skodova et al 2016 rs values were dependent on the flow velocity and mc structure for 0 0 4 m s flow velocities rs values 4 14 d averages ranged between 0 03 and 0 21 l d for mc rr 0 01 0 1 l d for mc yr and 0 02 0 11 l d for mc lr similarly pocis based passive samplers were previously reported to work in the kinetic regime during 28 d sampling of mc rr and mc lr with rs values 0 02 l d for static and 0 1 l d for turbulent condition kohoutek et al 2010 3 2 phytoplankton in the reservoirs during the sampling period chlorophyll a concentrations in the epilimnion 0 4 m bwl oscillated between 1 7 and 15 9 μg l in a eutrophic reservoir a fig 1 a fig c 1 2 4 52 0 μg l in a eutrophic hypertrophic reservoir b fig 1b and c 2 3 and 1 4 9 0 μg l in a mesotrophic reservoir c fig 1c fig c 4 phycocyanin fluorescence reached up to 1 9 3 7 rfu relative fluorescence units equivalent to 4000 7700 cell ml of microcystis culture tables b 1 3 with maximal phycocyanin concentrations detected early in the season reservoir a and then during late summer all reservoirs fig 1a c fig c 1 4 vertical profiling revealed a metalimnetic cyanobacterial population developing in the depths 5 10 m bwl of the reservoir c in early august fig c 4 correspondingly to pigment measurements phytoplankton communities were mostly dominated by dinoflagellates ceratium sp diatoms fragilaria sp asterionella sp and various green algae at the beginning of the sampling while the abundance of cyanobacteria increased during the season tables b 4 6 cyanobacteria microcystis sp m aeruginosa m viridis became dominant and accounted for 70 80 of phytoplankton biomass in august september in all reservoirs in the reservoir b microcystis sp was accompanied with picocyanobacterium aphanocapsa sp while woronichinia sp and chroococcus sp were subdominant in the reservoir c microcystis sp has been repeatedly identified as the major genera associated with mc contamination in the czech republic where the toxins can be detected in 70 90 of reservoirs blahova et al 2007 jancula et al 2014 znachor et al 2006 3 3 microcystins in phytoplankton biomass there are 200 known mc structural variants spoof and arnaud 2017 and different mcs might be dominant in different cyanobacterial samples pekar et al 2016 yen et al 2011 mc rr yr and lr commonly produced by microcystis sp belong to environmentally most prevalent mcs blahova et al 2007 buratti et al 2017 su et al 2015 which was confirmed by hplc dad analyses in this study mc rr yr or lr accounted for more than 90 of the combined area of all peaks possessing characteristic mc like uv spectra in the phytoplankton samples from all studied reservoirs fig c 6a c mc rr yr and lr were thus detected and quantified in lc ms ms target analyses with a good correlation with hplc dad data fig c 6d according to lc ms ms mc levels in the phytoplankton biomass ranged between 131 and 2161 μg g d w median 941 μg g d w in the reservoir a 43 688 μg g d w median 332 μg g d w in the reservoir b and 10 391 μg g d w median 61 μg g d w in the reservoir c seasonal changes in mc concentrations in phytoplankton biomass were specific for each reservoir fig c 6a c such mc levels and spatiotemporal variations are comparable with previous reports including studies in the czech republic reporting median values between 51 and 830 μg g d w max 2438 6171 μg g d w for biomasses collected from 21 to 210 reservoirs during 1998 2008 blaha et al 2010 3 4 spatial variations and seasonal dynamics of microcystins in the reservoirs elisa screening apparently all major variables affecting mc concentration in the water namely i phytoplankton and cyanobacteria concentration ii occurrence of mc producing species and iii mc concentration in phytoplankton biomass displayed their own reservoir specific variations and seasonal dynamics consequently mc concentrations and their seasonal trends also varied between the reservoirs fig 1a c elisa screening detected mcs in 82 91 of water samples from the studied reservoirs the highest concentrations were found in the reservoir a max 16 9 μg l median 2 3 μg l which corresponds to the highest phycocyanin levels fig 1a dominance of mc producing genus microcystis table b 4 and the highest levels of mcs in phytoplankton biomass fig c 6a mc concentrations observed in the reservoir b were lower max 6 7 μg l median 1 μg l than in the reservoir a coinciding with lower phycocyanine fluorescence fig 1b and mc levels in the net plankton fig c 6b in the reservoir c maximal detected concentration of mcs was 0 95 μg l median 0 17 μg l which reflects relatively low phycocyanin levels fig 1c low concentrations of mcs in the seston fig c 6c and a higher share of genera woronichinia and chroococcus table b 6 which do not produce mcs bernard et al 2017 these concentrations of mcs were comparable to those detected in surface waters in other countries buratti et al 2017 including the czech republic with reported seasonal median values between 0 2 and 1 0 μg l and maxima 18 5 37 μg l blahova et al 2007 jancula et al 2014 in this study higher concentrations of mcs were mostly observed during the late summer however it has been documented that seasonal dynamics of mc concentrations can be highly variable and difficult to predict blaha et al 2010 blahova et al 2008 westrick et al 2010 with respect to the complexity of ecological and ecophysiological factors controlling growth and abundance of mc producing cyanobacteria cellular production of mcs and also their further environmental fate corbel et al 2014 kardinaal and visser 2005 3 5 distribution of microcystins between intracellular and extracellular fraction distribution of mcs between the intracellular compartment and the extracellular soluble phase represents one of the most important factors affecting environmental fate of mcs and also their removal in drinking water treatment buratti et al 2017 he et al 2016 merel et al 2013 westrick et al 2010 under normal ecophysiological conditions the majority of mcs is present inside the cyanobacterial cells and the fraction of extracellular toxins usually accounts for less than 30 of total mcs blahova et al 2007 buratti et al 2017 in our study extracellular mcs represented 9 reservoirs a and b seasonal average or 14 reservoir c of mc sum in the epilimnion according to lc ms ms analyses fig 1d g concentrations of extracellular toxins significantly correlated with intracellular mcs but levels of extracellular mcs oscillated within a much narrower range fig c 7 3 6 passive sampling of microcystins in the reservoirs spatiotemporal variations in all three reservoirs twa concentrations estimated from the passive samplers reflected general seasonal trends of both total and extracellular mc concentrations determined by discrete sampling fig 1d f although extracellular mcs represent the toxin fraction available for the sequestration by passive sampling kohoutek et al 2008 2010 concentrations of extracellular toxins significantly correlated with intracellular and total mcs see section 3 5 fig c 7 thus twa concentrations derived from passive sampling correlated significantly with extracellular as well as total mc concentrations from discrete sampling data of all three reservoirs combined fig c 8 similarly so called spatt solid phase adsorption toxin tracking passive samplers developed for detection of various algal toxins mackenzie 2010 wood et al 2011 have been recently utilized to study occurrence seasonal dynamics and spatial distribution of mcs in the environment howard et al 2017 miller et al 2010 wiltsie et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 in these studies however spatt samplers were not calibrated to allow for estimation of mc concentrations in the water in our study calibrated pocis based passive samplers were able to reflect not only relative spatiotemporal differences in mc levels but provided also twa concentrations quantitatively matching the absolute concentrations of extracellular mcs determined by discrete sampling fig 1d g in addition passive samplers could be effectively used to detect the vertical distribution of mcs in the water column as demonstrated for the reservoir c fig 1h although the highest twa concentrations of mcs were detected in the top mixed layer 2 m bwl mcs were present in the deeper horizons of the reservoir fig 1h interestingly higher hypolimnetic concentrations of mcs were detected relatively early in the season which might be connected to spring reinvasion of overwintering benthic populations of cyanobacteria back to water column sejnohova and marsalek 2012 gradual increase of mc concentrations in the deeper horizons occurring from mid august fig 1h coincided with the development of metalimnetic cyanobacterial population 5 10 m bwl fig c 4 and most importantly with the ongoing thermal destratification and more intense mixing of the water column towards the end of the season fig c 4 apparently mcs and especially their extracellular fraction could be found also in deeper horizons used for the collection of raw water for dwtps 3 7 phytoplankton removal during water treatment since raw water for dwtp a and b was collected from deeper horizons 10 m bwl table a 1 without a major occurrence of phytoplankton fig c 1 3 concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in dwtp water intake were significantly lower than in the top horizon fig 2 in dwtp c the depth of water intake typically 9 m table a 1 partially overlapped with the development of cyanobacterial population at 5 10 m bwl fig c 4 thus phytoplankton concentrations in raw water were comparable to the epilimnion fig 2 table b 1 phytoplankton biomass was efficiently removed below the detectable levels by conventional coagulation based technologies in all dwtps similarly to the results of previous reports merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 westrick et al 2010 coagulation filtration technology in dwtp a had relatively the worst performance where traces of phytoplankton pigments occasionally passed the filtration step fig 2 in agreement with earlier findings teixeira et al 2010 flocculation daf dwtp b effectively and nearly completely removed phytoplankton including instances of elevated phytoplankton concentrations in raw water which occurred during the fall destratification fig 2 table b 2 in contrast photosynthetic pigments were still detected in 30 50 of samples after the flocculation sedimentation step in dwtp c and sand filtration was required for their final elimination fig 2 table b 3 cyanobacteria containing gas vesicles were reported to compromise sedimentation of the flocs pieterse and cloot 1997 teixeira et al 2010 which might explain the better performance of flocculation daf process dwtp b than flocculation sedimentation dwtp c for comparably phytoplankton rich raw waters 3 8 microcystin removal during water treatment elisa screening and its validation mc levels in raw waters were significantly lower than their concentrations in the epilimnion according to elisa screening coinciding with photosynthetic pigment concentrations fig 2 mc concentrations in raw water did not exceed 1 μg l except one instance in dwtp b associated with the fall destratification appropriate choice of the depth and position of raw water intake can therefore significantly reduce amounts of phytoplankton and mcs entering the treatment process westrick et al 2010 median concentrations of mcs in raw water were between 0 142 and 0 166 μg l in the individual dwtps with toxins detected by elisa in 55 60 samples fig 2 median values determined by lc ms ms analysis sum of extra and intracellular mc rr yr and lr were 0 052 0 074 μg l with the toxins found in 90 100 of samples figs 3 5 table 1 this difference between elisa and lc ms ms results can be attributed to the greater accuracy specificity and robustness of the instrumental method guo et al 2017 as well as to its greater sensitivity due to the pre concentration step included in the sample preparation for lc ms ms despite the greater uncertainties associated with the immunoassay guo et al 2017 qian et al 2015 the results from elisa screening significantly correlated with the results of lc ms ms analysis fig c 9 and reflected the major spatiotemporal differences between the reservoirs dwtps and treatment steps fig 2 fig c 10 similarly to other recent studies gaget et al 2017 out of 52 samples with mc concentrations below lod of the instrumental analysis mcs were found by elisa in 13 samples 7 but only at concentrations 0 13 0 24 μg l i e below lod 2 of elisa table a 6 out of 110 samples negative for mcs according to elisa 108 samples 98 were confirmed by lc ms ms to contain mcs only at concentrations below lod of elisa apparently elisa was not systematically missing mc concentrations within its detection range and thus seems to be a suitable and reliable method for mc screening in drinking waters however positive elisa results should be verified by an instrumental method he et al 2016 especially if concentrations lower than lod 2 are concerned 3 9 microcystin removal during water treatment comparison of discrete and passive sampling concentrations and frequency of mc positive samples decreased during the treatment process in all dwtps as revealed by both elisa fig 2 and lc ms ms table 1 figs 3 5 fig c 10 analyses of discrete sampling in all dwtps intracellular mcs were eliminated below the detectable levels after the sand filtration step figs 3 5 fig c 10 along with photosynthetic pigments fig 2 these long term data from full scale dwtp operations further confirm that monitoring of cyanobacterial biomass e g by pigment fluorescence provides a reliable surrogate to evaluate treatment performance for intracellular mcs gaget et al 2017 he et al 2016 sklenar et al 2016 however extracellular mcs were found to penetrate into further treatment stages than pigments and intracellular toxins fig 2 fig c 10 conventional coagulation flocculation based technologies have a limited ability to remove extracellular mcs whose elimination usually requires additional treatment steps such as active carbon or membrane filtration ozonation or advanced oxidative processes he et al 2016 merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 westrick et al 2010 correspondingly we observed that dwtps with conventional technologies were largely inefficient in the removal of extracellular toxins a simple coagulation filtration technology at dwtp a had the lowest efficiency in removal of extracellular mcs fig 3 fig c 10a median concentrations of extracellular mcs in dwtp a were within lod loq range between 0 010 and 0 025 μg l of mc rr regardless the treatment step with maximal concentrations ranging between loq 0 039 μg l table 1 reduced frequency of mc contaminated samples 64 and slightly but significantly decreased concentrations of extracellular mcs fig c 10a were observed only in the final treatment stage twa concentrations derived from passive sampling roughly corresponded to concentrations of extracellular mcs fig 3 with median values being 0 012 0 14 μg l and maxima 0 024 0 028 μg l table 1 in contrast to discrete sampling no significant decrease of mc concentrations during the treatment was indicated by passive samplers fig c 10a in dwtp b with a conventional two stage separation of the flocs extracellular toxins were detected in 45 82 of water samples from different treatment steps table 1 fig 4 the lowest frequency and levels median value lod of extracellular mcs were detected in the final treated water table 1 correspondingly median twa concentration estimated from the passive sampling for the final water 0 003 μg l was significantly lower than median twa concentrations in the prior stages 0 010 0 014 μg l table 1 fig c 10b partial removal of extracellular mcs occurring in the final treatment stages of dwtps a and b could be attributed to gaseous chlorine which was used for chemical disinfection in addition to chlorine dioxide treatment table a 1 free chlorine was reported to be partially effective in degradation of mcs at doses and contact times employed for disinfection in dwtps acero et al 2005 ho et al 2006 merel et al 2013 nicholson et al 1994 xagoraraki et al 2006 in dwtp c with a conventional two stage separation followed with gac filtration extracellular mcs were found in 60 80 of discrete samples prior the sand filtration step median concentrations loq maxima 0 031 0 060 μg l table 1 interestingly extracellular mcs were eliminated by the sand filtration step fig 5 fig c 10c which could be attributed to biodegradation processes eventually occurring within the top layer of sand filters ho et al 2012 similarly to discrete sampling twa concentrations of mcs were significantly reduced by the sand filtration fig c 10c but residual concentrations of mcs 0 002 μg l were affected neither by gac filtration nor chloramination and uv irradiation while chloramination and uv irradiation are mostly ineffective for mc elimination nicholson et al 1994 sklenar et al 2016 gac filtration is well recognized method capable to remove dissolved mcs by adsorption and eventually biodegradation delgado et al 2012 however adsorption of mcs depends not only on the physical chemical characteristics of gac such as number of mesopores he et al 2016 but also other factors such as ph natural organic matter and contaminant concentration or contact time delgado et al 2012 sklenar et al 2016 thus these factors could have contributed to the limited ability of gac filtration to remove mc residues after the sand filtration in dwtp c overall data from dwtps confirmed that calibrated pocis based passive samplers allow estimating twa concentrations which quantitatively correspond to the levels of extracellular toxins figs 1d f 3 5 moreover twa concentrations from passive sampling significantly correlated not only with extracellular but also intracellular mc concentrations determined by discrete sampling for the entire dataset fig c 11 indicating the ability of samplers to reflect spatiotemporal variations of mc concentrations in reservoirs or dwtps 3 10 risk assessment and management of microcystins in drinking water the use of passive sampling our results of seasonal monitoring of dwtp operations confirm that well adjusted conventional treatment technologies can efficiently eliminate cyanobacterial cells and intracellular mcs when working under the optimal conditions these were represented in our study by low intake concentrations of cyanobacteria 10ˆ4 cells ml and mcs mostly 1 μg l also the majority of mcs was present in the intracellular fraction which was successfully removed without toxin release into the soluble phase consequently maximal concentrations of mcs in the final water from the individual dwtps detected by discrete lod 0 025 μg l or passive 0 002 0 024 μg l sampling were much below 1 μg l drinking water guideline value recommended by who which is also implemented in the czech legislation buratti et al 2017 our results correspond to the data obtained from other treatment plants with comparable levels of cyanobacteria and mcs in raw water where mcs were occasionally detected in final water but only in concentrations lower than 1 μg l addico et al 2017 haddix et al 2007 hoeger et al 2005 pekar et al 2016 szlag et al 2015 yen et al 2011 observed levels of mcs in our study did not exceed even the stricter limits 0 1 0 3 μg l introduced for drinking waters in minnesota or ohio buratti et al 2017 however guidance values as low as 0 01 0 03 μg l have been recently suggested for sensitive populations children 6 years old due to new findings on adverse effects of mc lr on central nervous and male reproduction system miller et al 2017 guidance value 0 01 μg l was exceeded by twa concentrations of mcs in the final water produced by dwtp a in 60 samples or during 85 d of 141 d sampling season this could be attributed to the limited ability of this dwtp to remove extracellular mcs while extracellular mcs typically account for the lesser portion of total mcs in water they are ubiquitously accompanying mc producing cyanobacteria blahova et al 2007 buratti et al 2017 this was confirmed by our study frequently detecting extracellular toxins at concentrations 0 01 μg l even in deeper reservoir horizons fig 1h or raw water figs 3a 5a table 1 concentrations of extracellular mcs can also rapidly rise due to a variety of environmental factors or bloom management actions causing damage of cyanobacterial cells buratti et al 2017 miller et al 2017 during the water treatment process damage of cyanobacterial cells can be caused by a pre treatment oxidation he et al 2016 merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 coagulation process han et al 2012 or hydraulic stress during flocculation and filtration pietsch et al 2002 consequently increased mc levels in raw water and or different factors compromising mc removal during the treatment process might result into exceeding 1 μg l limit in the final treated water affan et al 2015 blaha and marsalek 2003 mohamed and al shehri 2009 qian et al 2015 svircev et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012 frequent monitoring of treatment performance is therefore a crucial part of risk management plans with respect to rapid dynamics of mc production and distribution and numerous variables affecting efficiency of mc removal by individual treatment steps he et al 2016 marce et al 2016 merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 low frequency discrete sampling might not adequately represent long term efficiency of mc removal and provide reliable estimates of chronic human exposures since various episodic events can be either missed zamyadi et al 2012 or their importance might get overestimated qian et al 2015 in this study we demonstrated that passive sampling can be used for sensitive long term and time integrated monitoring of mcs in the environment or during drinking water treatment a simple laboratory calibration of the samplers allows to determine rs values and calculate twa concentrations in addition to detecting the relative differences and trends of mc levels we observed that within the range of non zero flow velocities employed in our study 0 01 0 4 m s there were relatively minor differences in rs values varying by factor 1 3 1 4 it indicates that for sampling sites with at least a minimal flow or level of mixing which were common in our study flow velocities ranging between 0 01 and 0 15 m s twa concentrations could have been semiquantitatively assessed even without direct measurements of flow velocities in the field however direct measurements of flow velocity can be recommended for practical applications to adjust rs values and further improve the accuracy and confidence of twa concentration estimates finally the nearly ubiquitous presence of trace mc concentrations in the surface as well as treated waters provides also an opportunity to conduct in situ calibration of the samplers which should best account for multiple physicochemical factors potentially influencing rs at a given sampling site skodova et al 2016 the used combination of passive samplers and analytical procedure allowed to monitor ultra trace concentrations of mcs capable to detect twa concentrations about 20 pg l for mc rr and 200 pg l for mc yr and mc lr over 14 d sampling period table a 6 concentrations of extracellular toxins which represent the major issue for drinking water treatment can be thus effectively monitored by passive samplers with a sensitivity sufficient to detect even the very low toxin levels 0 01 μg l recently discussed as a potential concern for human health miller et al 2017 passive sampling allows to evaluate a long term compliance with mc drinking water guidelines and to assess chronic human exposures which have been linked to chronic toxicities and diseases liu et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 moreover monitoring of treatment performance can identify treatment steps most vulnerable to toxin breakthrough and also provide a warning when the treatment efficiency becomes repeatedly compromised 4 conclusions passive samplers deployed for 14 d were demonstrated to sequester mcs and provide time integrated concentrations with an excellent sensitivity 1 ng l in combination with lc ms ms the results from passive sampling correlated with the discrete one shot sampling of drinking water reservoirs as well as dwtps concentrations estimated by passive samplers quantitatively corresponded to the concentrations of extracellular mcs from discrete sampling passive and discrete sampling indicated that conventional treatment technologies have a limited ability to remove extracellular mcs and significant differences in removal efficiencies were identified between individual dwtps and treatment steps concentrations of mcs in final treated water were one or more orders of magnitude lower than who guidance value 1 μg l passive sampling is a valuable technique for environmental and ecological studies of mcs and can be integrated into monitoring

19006,calibrated adsorption based passive samplers were used for time integrative monitoring of microcystins mcs in three full scale drinking water treatment plants dwtps in the czech republic during two vegetation seasons jun nov in parallel with traditional discrete sampling mcs were detected in epilimnetic water samples at concentrations up to 14 μg l but their levels in raw water in dwtps were below 1 μg l who guideline value for drinking water conventional treatment technologies coagulation filtration eliminated cyanobacteria and intracellular toxins but had a limited removal efficiency for extracellular toxins mcs were regularly detected in final treated water especially in dwtps equipped only with the conventional treatment but their concentrations were below the quantitation limit of discrete sampling 25 ng l passive samplers in combination with lc ms ms analysis provided excellent sensitivity allowing to detect time weighted average twa concentrations of mcs as low as 20 200 pg l after 14 d deployment median mc twa concentrations in the treated water from the individual dwtps were 1 12 ng l and most likely did not present significant health risks passive samplers well reflected spatiotemporal variations of mcs actual concentrations of extracellular toxins mc removal efficiency in dwtps and toxin concentrations in the treated water passive sampling can be effectively used for assessment and management of mc health risks during dwtp operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria drinking water treatment microcystins passive sampling pocis time integrative monitoring 1 introduction global anthropogenically driven increase in the frequency magnitude and duration of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in fresh and coastal waters represents a major ecological and human health issue buratti et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 microcystins mcs are the most prevalent and abundant cyanobacterial toxins in the environment which can be frequently found in water reservoirs used for drinking water supply buratti et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 consumption of mc contaminated drinking water has been recognized as an important exposure route with potentially chronic repeated exposure patterns buratti et al 2017 miller et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 chronic human exposures to mcs have been associated with an increased incidence of liver and colorectal cancers chronic liver damage and diseases liu et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 considering chronic toxicity of mcs namely their tumor promoting and hepatocarcinogenic activity world health organization who established a provisional guidance value of 1 μg l for mc lr concentration in drinking water and even stricter limits 0 1 0 3 μg l have been implemented by some regulatory agencies buratti et al 2017 long term compliance with such limits requires a multibarrier approach which includes a monitoring system for cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in order to optimize and facilitate their effective removal during drinking water treatment operation he et al 2016 merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 westrick et al 2010 therefore there is a continuous effort to develop rapid simple sensitive and cost effective methods which would allow either real time or time integrative monitoring of cyanobacteria and mcs gaget et al 2017 marce et al 2016 passive sampling is a technique which can be effectively used for sensitive and time integrative monitoring of chemicals in the aquatic environment alvarez et al 2004 it has been demonstrated that passive samplers based on polar organic compound integrative samplers pocis can sequester mcs in the environment and allow to estimate their time weighted average twa concentrations for periods of several days to several weeks kohoutek et al 2008 2010 moreover passive sampling has been recently used also for monitoring of selected anthropogenic contaminants in drinking water treatment plants dwtps for evaluation of the treatment performance and drinking water quality metcalfe et al 2014 mirasole et al 2016 tanwar et al 2015 in this study we evaluated the use of passive samplers for the monitoring of mcs in three drinking water reservoirs and adjacent full scale operating dwtps in the czech republic in situ measurements of photosynthetic pigments and discrete grab one shot sampling for mc analysis were conducted to assess the ability of passive sampling to capture seasonal and spatial variations of mcs the long term removal efficiency of mcs in dwtps and also mc levels in treated drinking water we demonstrate that passive samplers can be effectively used for time integrative measurements of trace concentrations of these hazardous contaminants in dwtps passive samplers represent a valuable tool

pigments or mcs in the top surface layer of the reservoirs significantly correlated with the depth integrated values for the horizon of 0 4 m bwl derived from either vertical profile ysi measurements or hosepipe sampling fig c 5 tables b 1 3 for the simplicity only the depth integrated values will be presented in the main text 3 results and discussion 3 1 passive sampler calibration the uptake of mc rr yr and lr by the samplers was linear for at least 14 d and up to 0 4 m s flow velocity since only minor differences in rs values were observed with increasing exposure time table a 2 which indicates the kinetic sampling regime vrana et al 2006 skodova et al 2016 rs values were dependent on the flow velocity and mc structure for 0 0 4 m s flow velocities rs values 4 14 d averages ranged between 0 03 and 0 21 l d for mc rr 0 01 0 1 l d for mc yr and 0 02 0 11 l d for mc lr similarly pocis based passive samplers were previously reported to work in the kinetic regime during 28 d sampling of mc rr and mc lr with rs values 0 02 l d for static and 0 1 l d for turbulent condition kohoutek et al 2010 3 2 phytoplankton in the reservoirs during the sampling period chlorophyll a

4 9 0 μg l in a mesotrophic reservoir c fig 1c fig c 4 phycocyanin fluorescence reached up to 1 9 3 7 rfu relative fluorescence units equivalent to 4000 7700 cell ml of microcystis culture tables b 1 3 with maximal phycocyanin concentrations detected early in the season reservoir a and then during late summer all reservoirs fig 1a c fig c 1 4 vertical profiling revealed a metalimnetic cyanobacterial population developing in the depths 5 10 m bwl of the reservoir c in early august fig c 4 correspondingly to pigment measurements phytoplankton communities were mostly dominated by dinoflagellates ceratium sp diatoms fragilaria sp asterionella sp and various green algae at the beginning of the sampling while the abundance of cyanobacteria increased during the season tables b 4 6 cyanobacteria microcystis sp m aeruginosa m viridis became dominant and accounted for 70 80 of phytoplankton biomass in august september in all reservoirs in the reservoir b microcystis sp was accompanied with picocyanobacterium aphanocapsa sp while woronichinia sp and chroococcus sp were subdominant in the reservoir c microcystis sp has been repeatedly identified as the major genera associated with mc contamination in the czech republic where the toxins can be detected in 70 90 of reservoirs blahova et al 2007 jancula et al 2014 znachor et al 2006 3 3 microcystins in phytoplankton biomass there are 200 known mc structural variants spoof and arnaud 2017 and different mcs might be dominant in different cyanobacterial samples pekar et al 2016 yen et al 2011 mc rr yr and lr commonly produced by microcystis sp belong to environmentally most prevalent mcs blahova et al 2007 buratti et al 2017 su et al 2015 which was confirmed by hplc dad analyses in this study mc rr yr or lr accounted for more than 90 of the combined area of all peaks possessing characteristic mc like uv spectra in the phytoplankton samples from all studied reservoirs fig c 6a c mc rr yr and lr were thus detected and quantified in lc ms ms target analyses with a good correlation with hplc dad data fig c 6d according to lc ms ms mc levels in the phytoplankton biomass ranged between 131 and 2161 μg g d w median 941 μg g d w in the reservoir a 43 688 μg g d w median 332 μg g d w in the reservoir b and 10 391 μg g d w median 61 μg g d w in the reservoir c seasonal changes in mc concentrations in phytoplankton biomass were specific for each reservoir fig c 6a c such mc levels and spatiotemporal variations are comparable with previous reports including studies in the czech republic reporting median values between 51 and 830 μg g d w max 2438 6171 μg g d w for biomasses collected from 21 to 210 reservoirs during 1998 2008 blaha et al 2010 3 4 spatial variations and seasonal dynamics of microcystins in the reservoirs elisa screening apparently all major variables affecting mc concentration in the water namely i phytoplankton and cyanobacteria concentration ii occurrence of mc producing species and iii mc concentration in phytoplankton biomass displayed their own reservoir specific variations and seasonal dynamics consequently mc concentrations and their seasonal trends also varied between the reservoirs fig 1a c elisa screening detected mcs in 82 91 of water samples from the studied reservoirs the highest concentrations were found in the reservoir a max 16 9 μg l median 2 3 μg l which corresponds to the highest phycocyanin levels fig 1a dominance of mc producing genus microcystis table b 4 and the highest levels of mcs in phytoplankton biomass fig c 6a mc concentrations observed in the reservoir b were lower max 6 7 μg l median 1 μg l than in the reservoir a coinciding with lower phycocyanine fluorescence fig 1b and mc levels in the net plankton fig c 6b in the reservoir c maximal detected concentration of mcs was 0 95 μg l median 0 17 μg l which reflects relatively low phycocyanin levels fig 1c low concentrations of mcs in the seston fig c 6c and a higher share of genera woronichinia and chroococcus table b 6 which do not produce mcs bernard et al 2017 these concentrations of mcs were comparable to those detected in surface waters in other countries buratti et al 2017 including the czech republic with reported seasonal median values between 0 2 and 1 0 μg l and maxima 18 5 37 μg l blahova et al 2007 jancula et al 2014 in this study higher concentrations of mcs were mostly observed during the late summer however it has been documented that seasonal dynamics of mc concentrations can be highly variable and difficult to predict blaha et al 2010 blahova et al 2008 westrick et al 2010 with respect to the complexity of ecological and ecophysiological factors controlling growth and abundance of mc producing cyanobacteria cellular production of mcs and also their further environmental fate corbel et al 2014 kardinaal and visser 2005 3 5 distribution of microcystins between intracellular and extracellular fraction distribution of mcs between the intracellular compartment and the extracellular soluble phase represents one of the most important factors affecting environmental fate of mcs and also their removal in drinking water treatment buratti et al 2017 he et al 2016 merel et al 2013 westrick et al 2010 under normal ecophysiological conditions the majority of mcs is present inside the cyanobacterial cells and the fraction of extracellular toxins usually accounts for less than 30 of total mcs blahova et al 2007 buratti et al 2017 in our study extracellular mcs represented 9 reservoirs a and b seasonal average or 14 reservoir c of mc sum in the epilimnion according to lc ms ms analyses fig 1d g concentrations of extracellular toxins significantly correlated with intracellular mcs but levels of extracellular mcs oscillated within a much narrower range fig c 7 3 6 passive sampling of microcystins in the reservoirs spatiotemporal variations in all three reservoirs twa concentrations estimated from the passive samplers reflected general seasonal trends of both total and extracellular mc concentrations determined by discrete sampling fig 1d f although extracellular mcs represent the toxin fraction available for the sequestration by passive sampling kohoutek et al 2008 2010 concentrations of extracellular toxins significantly correlated with intracellular and total mcs see section 3 5 fig c 7 thus twa concentrations derived from passive sampling correlated significantly with extracellular as well as total mc concentrations from discrete sampling data of all three reservoirs combined fig c 8 similarly so called spatt solid phase adsorption toxin tracking passive samplers developed for detection of various algal toxins mackenzie 2010 wood et al 2011 have been recently utilized to study occurrence seasonal dynamics and spatial distribution of mcs in the environment howard et al 2017 miller et al 2010 wiltsie et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 in these studies however spatt samplers were not calibrated to allow for estimation of mc concentrations in the water in our study calibrated pocis based passive samplers were able to reflect not only relative spatiotemporal differences in mc levels but provided also twa concentrations quantitatively matching the absolute concentrations of extracellular mcs determined by discrete sampling fig 1d g in addition passive samplers could be effectively used to detect the vertical distribution of mcs in the water column as demonstrated for the reservoir c fig 1h although the highest twa concentrations of mcs were detected in the top mixed layer 2 m bwl mcs were present in the deeper horizons of the reservoir fig 1h interestingly higher hypolimnetic concentrations of mcs were detected relatively early in the season which might be connected to spring reinvasion of overwintering benthic populations of cyanobacteria back to water column sejnohova and marsalek 2012 gradual increase of mc concentrations in the deeper horizons occurring from mid august fig 1h coincided with the development of metalimnetic cyanobacterial population 5 10 m bwl fig c 4 and most importantly with the ongoing thermal destratification and more intense mixing of the water column towards the end of the season fig c 4 apparently mcs and especially their extracellular fraction could be found also in deeper horizons used for the collection of raw water for dwtps 3 7 phytoplankton removal during water treatment since raw water for dwtp a and b was collected from deeper horizons 10 m bwl table a 1 without a major occurrence of phytoplankton fig c 1 3 concentrations of photosynthetic pigments in dwtp water intake were significantly lower than in the top horizon fig 2 in dwtp c the depth of water intake typically 9 m table a 1 partially overlapped with the development of cyanobacterial population at 5 10 m bwl fig c 4 thus phytoplankton concentrations in raw water were comparable to the epilimnion fig 2 table b 1 phytoplankton biomass was efficiently removed below the detectable levels by conventional coagulation based technologies in all dwtps similarly to the results of previous reports merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 westrick et al 2010 coagulation filtration technology in dwtp a had relatively the worst performance where traces of phytoplankton pigments occasionally passed the filtration step fig 2 in agreement with earlier findings teixeira et al 2010 flocculation daf dwtp b effectively and nearly completely removed phytoplankton including instances of elevated phytoplankton concentrations in raw water which occurred during the fall destratification fig 2 table b 2 in contrast photosynthetic pigments were still detected in 30 50 of samples after the flocculation sedimentation step in dwtp c and sand filtration was required for their final elimination fig 2 table b 3 cyanobacteria containing gas vesicles were reported to compromise sedimentation of the flocs pieterse and cloot 1997 teixeira et al 2010 which might explain the better performance of flocculation daf process dwtp b than flocculation sedimentation dwtp c for comparably phytoplankton rich raw waters 3 8 microcystin removal during water treatment elisa screening and its validation mc levels in raw waters were significantly lower than their concentrations in the epilimnion according to elisa screening coinciding with photosynthetic pigment concentrations fig 2 mc concentrations in raw water did not exceed 1 μg l except one instance in dwtp b associated with the fall destratification appropriate choice of the depth and position of raw water intake can therefore significantly reduce amounts of phytoplankton and mcs entering the treatment process westrick et al 2010 median concentrations of mcs in raw water were between 0 142 and 0 166 μg l in the individual dwtps with toxins detected by elisa in 55 60 samples fig 2 median values determined by lc ms ms analysis sum of extra and intracellular mc rr yr and lr were 0 052 0 074 μg l with the toxins found in 90 100 of samples figs 3 5 table 1 this difference between elisa and lc ms ms results can be attributed to the greater accuracy specificity and robustness of the instrumental method guo et al 2017 as well as to its greater sensitivity due to the pre concentration step included in the sample preparation for lc ms ms despite the greater uncertainties associated with the immunoassay guo et al 2017 qian et al 2015 the results from elisa screening significantly correlated with the results of lc ms ms analysis fig c 9 and reflected the major spatiotemporal differences between the reservoirs dwtps and treatment steps fig 2 fig c 10 similarly to other recent studies gaget et al 2017 out of 52 samples with mc concentrations below lod of the instrumental analysis mcs were found by elisa in 13 samples 7 but only at concentrations 0 13 0 24 μg l i e below lod 2 of elisa table a 6 out of 110 samples negative for mcs according to elisa 108 samples 98 were confirmed by lc ms ms to contain mcs only at concentrations below lod of elisa apparently elisa was not systematically missing mc concentrations within its detection range and thus seems to be a suitable and reliable method for mc screening in drinking waters however positive elisa results should be verified by an instrumental method he et al 2016 especially if concentrations lower than lod 2 are concerned 3 9 microcystin removal during water treatment comparison of discrete and passive sampling concentrations and frequency of mc positive samples decreased during the treatment process in all dwtps as revealed by both elisa fig 2 and lc ms ms table 1 figs 3 5 fig c 10 analyses of discrete sampling in all dwtps intracellular mcs were eliminated below the detectable levels after the sand filtration step figs 3 5 fig c 10 along with photosynthetic pigments fig 2 these long term data from full scale dwtp operations further confirm that monitoring of cyanobacterial biomass e g by pigment fluorescence provides a reliable surrogate to evaluate treatment performance for intracellular mcs gaget et al 2017 he et al 2016 sklenar et al 2016 however extracellular mcs were found to penetrate into further treatment stages than pigments and intracellular toxins fig 2 fig c 10 conventional coagulation flocculation based technologies have a limited ability to remove extracellular mcs whose elimination usually requires additional treatment steps such as active carbon or membrane filtration ozonation or advanced oxidative processes he et al 2016 merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 westrick et al 2010 correspondingly we observed that dwtps with conventional technologies were largely inefficient in the removal of extracellular toxins a simple coagulation filtration technology at dwtp a had the lowest efficiency in removal of extracellular mcs fig 3 fig c 10a median concentrations of extracellular mcs in dwtp a were within lod loq range between 0 010 and 0 025 μg l of mc rr regardless the treatment step with maximal concentrations ranging between loq 0 039 μg l table 1 reduced frequency of mc contaminated samples 64 and slightly but significantly decreased concentrations of extracellular mcs fig c 10a were observed only in the final treatment stage twa concentrations derived from passive sampling roughly corresponded to concentrations of extracellular mcs fig 3 with median values being 0 012 0 14 μg l and maxima 0 024 0 028 μg l table 1 in contrast to discrete sampling no significant decrease of mc concentrations during the treatment was indicated by passive samplers fig c 10a in dwtp b with a conventional two stage separation of the flocs extracellular toxins were detected in 45 82 of water samples from different treatment steps table 1 fig 4 the lowest frequency and levels median value lod of extracellular mcs were detected in the final treated water table 1 correspondingly median twa concentration estimated from the passive sampling for the final water 0 003 μg l was significantly lower than median twa concentrations in the prior stages 0 010 0 014 μg l table 1 fig c 10b partial removal of extracellular mcs occurring in the final treatment stages of dwtps a and b could be attributed to gaseous chlorine which was used for chemical disinfection in addition to chlorine dioxide treatment table a 1 free chlorine was reported to be partially effective in degradation of mcs at doses and contact times employed for disinfection in dwtps acero et al 2005 ho et al 2006 merel et al 2013 nicholson et al 1994 xagoraraki et al 2006 in dwtp c with a conventional two stage separation followed with gac filtration extracellular mcs were found in 60 80 of discrete samples prior the sand filtration step median concentrations loq maxima 0 031 0 060 μg l table 1 interestingly extracellular mcs were eliminated by the sand filtration step fig 5 fig c 10c which could be attributed to biodegradation processes eventually occurring within the top layer of sand filters ho et al 2012 similarly to discrete sampling twa concentrations of mcs were significantly reduced by the sand filtration fig c 10c but residual concentrations of mcs 0 002 μg l were affected neither by gac filtration nor chloramination and uv irradiation while chloramination and uv irradiation are mostly ineffective for mc elimination nicholson et al 1994 sklenar et al 2016 gac filtration is well recognized method capable to remove dissolved mcs by adsorption and eventually biodegradation delgado et al 2012 however adsorption of mcs depends not only on the physical chemical characteristics of gac such as number of mesopores he et al 2016 but also other factors such as ph natural organic matter and contaminant concentration or contact time delgado et al 2012 sklenar et al 2016 thus these factors could have contributed to the limited ability of gac filtration to remove mc residues after the sand filtration in dwtp c overall data from dwtps confirmed that calibrated pocis based passive samplers allow estimating twa concentrations which quantitatively correspond to the levels of extracellular toxins figs 1d f 3 5 moreover twa concentrations from passive sampling significantly correlated not only with extracellular but also intracellular mc concentrations determined by discrete sampling for the entire dataset fig c 11 indicating the ability of samplers to reflect spatiotemporal variations of mc concentrations in reservoirs or dwtps 3 10 risk assessment and management of microcystins in drinking water the use of passive sampling our results of seasonal monitoring of dwtp operations confirm that well adjusted conventional treatment technologies can efficiently eliminate cyanobacterial cells and intracellular mcs when working under the optimal conditions these were represented in our study by low intake concentrations of cyanobacteria 10ˆ4 cells ml and mcs mostly 1 μg l also the majority of mcs was present in the intracellular fraction which was successfully removed without toxin release into the soluble phase consequently maximal concentrations of mcs in the final water from the individual dwtps detected by discrete lod 0 025 μg l or passive 0 002 0 024 μg l sampling were much below 1 μg l drinking water guideline value recommended by who which is also implemented in the czech legislation buratti et al 2017 our results correspond to the data obtained from other treatment plants with comparable levels of cyanobacteria and mcs in raw water where mcs were occasionally detected in final water but only in concentrations lower than 1 μg l addico et al 2017 haddix et al 2007 hoeger et al 2005 pekar et al 2016 szlag et al 2015 yen et al 2011 observed levels of mcs in our study did not exceed even the stricter limits 0 1 0 3 μg l introduced for drinking waters in minnesota or ohio buratti et al 2017 however guidance values as low as 0 01 0 03 μg l have been recently suggested for sensitive populations children 6 years old due to new findings on adverse effects of mc lr on central nervous and male reproduction system miller et al 2017 guidance value 0 01 μg l was exceeded by twa concentrations of mcs in the final water produced by dwtp a in 60 samples or during 85 d of 141 d sampling season this could be attributed to the limited ability of this dwtp to remove extracellular mcs while extracellular mcs typically account for the lesser portion of total mcs in water they are ubiquitously accompanying mc producing cyanobacteria blahova et al 2007 buratti et al 2017 this was confirmed by our study frequently detecting extracellular toxins at concentrations 0 01 μg l even in deeper reservoir horizons fig 1h or raw water figs 3a 5a table 1 concentrations of extracellular mcs can also rapidly rise due to a variety of environmental factors or bloom management actions causing damage of cyanobacterial cells buratti et al 2017 miller et al 2017 during the water treatment process damage of cyanobacterial cells can be caused by a pre treatment oxidation he et al 2016 merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 coagulation process han et al 2012 or hydraulic stress during flocculation and filtration pietsch et al 2002 consequently increased mc levels in raw water and or different factors compromising mc removal during the treatment process might result into exceeding 1 μg l limit in the final treated water affan et al 2015 blaha and marsalek 2003 mohamed and al shehri 2009 qian et al 2015 svircev et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2012 frequent monitoring of treatment performance is therefore a crucial part of risk management plans with respect to rapid dynamics of mc production and distribution and numerous variables affecting efficiency of mc removal by individual treatment steps he et al 2016 marce et al 2016 merel et al 2013 sklenar et al 2016 low frequency discrete sampling might not adequately represent long term efficiency of mc removal and provide reliable estimates of chronic human exposures since various episodic events can be either missed zamyadi et al 2012 or their importance might get overestimated qian et al 2015 in this study we demonstrated that passive sampling can be used for sensitive long term and time integrated monitoring of mcs in the environment or during drinking water treatment a simple laboratory calibration of the samplers allows to determine rs values and calculate twa concentrations in addition to detecting the relative differences and trends of mc levels we observed that within the range of non zero flow velocities employed in our study 0 01 0 4 m s there were relatively minor differences in rs values varying by factor 1 3 1 4 it indicates that for sampling sites with at least a minimal flow or level of mixing which were common in our study flow velocities ranging between 0 01 and 0 15 m s twa concentrations could have been semiquantitatively assessed even without direct measurements of flow velocities in the field however direct measurements of flow velocity can be recommended for practical applications to adjust rs values and further improve the accuracy and confidence of twa concentration estimates finally the nearly ubiquitous presence of trace mc concentrations in the surface as well as treated waters provides also an opportunity to conduct in situ calibration of the samplers which should best account for multiple physicochemical factors potentially influencing rs at a given sampling site skodova et al 2016 the used combination of passive samplers and analytical procedure allowed to monitor ultra trace concentrations of mcs capable to detect twa concentrations about 20 pg l for mc rr and 200 pg l for mc yr and mc lr over 14 d sampling period table a 6 concentrations of extracellular toxins which represent the major issue for drinking water treatment can be thus effectively monitored by passive samplers with a sensitivity sufficient to detect even the very low toxin levels 0 01 μg l recently discussed as a potential concern for human health miller et al 2017 passive sampling allows to evaluate a long term compliance with mc drinking water guidelines and to assess chronic human exposures which have been linked to chronic toxicities and diseases liu et al 2017 svircev et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 moreover monitoring of treatment performance can identify treatment steps most vulnerable to toxin breakthrough and also provide a warning when the treatment efficiency becomes repeatedly compromised 4 conclusions passive samplers deployed for 14 d were demonstrated to sequester mcs and provide time integrated concentrations with an excellent sensitivity 1 ng l in combination with lc ms ms the results from passive sampling correlated with the discrete one shot sampling of drinking water reservoirs as well as dwtps concentrations estimated by passive samplers quantitatively corresponded to the concentrations of extracellular mcs from discrete sampling passive and discrete sampling indicated that conventional treatment technologies have a limited ability to remove extracellular mcs and significant differences in removal efficiencies were identified between individual dwtps and treatment steps concentrations of mcs in final treated water were one or more orders of magnitude lower than who guidance value 1 μg l passive sampling is a valuable technique for environmental and ecological studies of mcs and can be integrated into monitoring plans at dwtps in compliance with the current needs for mc risk assessment and management such tools allowing sensitive monitoring of cyanotoxins might be increasingly needed especially under the circumstances of anthropogenically intensified occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms and globally increasing demands for drinking water supply acknowledgements we would like to thank ms roswita

19007,global aquatic ecosystems are essential to human existence and have deteriorated seriously in recent years understanding the influence mechanism of habitat variation on the structure of the food web allows the effective recovery of the health of degraded ecosystems whereas most previous studies focused on the selection of driving habitat factors the impact of habitat variation on the food web structure was rarely studied resulting in the low success rate of ecosystem restoration projects globally this paper presents a framework for exploring the effects of spatial variations in water quality and hydrological habitat factors on the food web structure in city waters indices for the evaluation of the food web structure are first determined by integrating model parameter extraction via literature refinement the key water quality and hydrological factors are then determined by coupling canonical correspondence analysis with partial least squares regression their spatial variation is investigated using spatial autocorrelation finally fuzzy clustering is applied to analyze the influence of the spatial variations in water quality and hydrological factors on the food web structure the results obtained in ji nan the pilot city of water ecological civilization in china show that the shannon diversity index connectance index omnivory index and the ratio of total primary production to the total respiration are important indicators of food web structural change they show that the driving factors affecting the aquatic food web structure in ji nan are hydrological factors e g river width water depth and stream flow physical aspects of water quality e g air temperature water temperature electrical conductivity and transparency and chemical aspects e g potassium dissolved oxygen calcium and total hardness they also show that the stability of the food web is more prone to spatial variations in water quality than in hydrological factors higher electrical conductivity potassium total hardness and air temperature lead to deteriorated food web structures whereas better transparency improves structure and stability we found that water and air temperature are the most important factors in the spatial variation of the food web structure in the study area followed by total hardness transparency is the least important factor large disparities and varied spatial distributions exist in the driving effects of water quality and hydrological factors across regions attributable to differences in geographical environments water salinity fresh vs sea water and environmental factors e g water pollution the above methods and results serve as a theoretical and scientific basis for a high success rate of aquatic ecosystem restoration projects in the study area and other cities worldwide keywords water quality hydrology spatial variation food web structure driving factors 1 introduction human activities have a severe impact on hydrological cycles and river water quality zou et al 2018 causing deterioration of water quality and the decline in the hydrological state of the water cycle causing negative effects on the ecosystem this leads to drastic changes in the food web structure of rivers coll et al 2011 garay narváez et al 2013 perkins et al 2010 the degradation of river ecosystems is accelerated seriously affecting the ecological values of freshwater ecosystems can be categorized according to their form and function the former refers to the community structure and the latter is the network or trophic levels baird and ulanowicz 1989 mcintyre et al 2007 of biological components in the system organized via the food web or food chain the most fundamental link between various elements of an ecosystem is nutrition food chain and food web are important forms of energy transfer in an ecosystem post 2002 nordström and bonsdorff 2017 the food web is a network comprising various organisms and their nutritional relationships in the ecosystem formed via the interactions among communities and species post 2002 it describes the complex nutritional interactions of different organisms in biological communities and reveals the material and energy flow of the entire ecosystem a food web is very sensitive to changes in the biodiversity and the intensity of interactions between organisms in an ecosystem post and takimoto 2007 a food web with a higher level of complexity indicates greater ecosystem resilience to external disturbances peralta maraver et al 2017 research on this topic readily offers insight into the flow of material and energy the composition and structure of the biological communities and the complex feeding relationship among species baird and ulanowicz 1989 mcintyre et al 2007 it functions as the basis for making ecosystem based ecological protection and restoration decisions harvey et al 2017 mccann 2007 presently the common food web models are mainly divided into three categories the first type is the structural model e g random model proposed by erdos and renyi 1960 xue et al 2018 the second type is a dynamic model that is primarily used to predict dynamic changes in the structure of the food web chen and cohen 2001 haerter et al 2016 grilli et al 2017 the third type is the energy flow model wherein the ecopath model is commonly used ecopath is a nutritionally balanced model of an ecosystem that describes the nutrition flow based on food web structure of the system and the principle of nutritional dynamics natugonza et al 2016 its primary function is to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze the structure of the ecosystem the process of nutrition flow and the characteristics of nutritional dynamics this model has been widely used in the study of nutrition structure and energy flow and the prediction of the future development of aquatic ecosystems it is recognized by ecologists worldwide as the key instrument in the next generation research on water ecosystems angelini and agostinho 2005 chen 2010 water quality and hydrological habitat factor changes affect the hierarchy and structure of the ecosystem zhao et al 2018a and the integrity of the food web carvalho et al 2016 deeply influencing ecosystem functions and services hemraj et al 2017 robson et al 2017 previous studies however were mostly conducted on the selection of key driving factors and lack the quantitative investigation of the influence of spatial variations in hydrology and water quality on the food web structure consequently an assessment of 78 large scale ecological restoration projects in europe and the united states shows that only a few have achieved their aims palmer et al 2010 it is therefore pressing to investigate the effects of water quality and hydrological changes on the food web structure to quantify the level of human impact on the ecosystem and food web structure and to restrain and reduce the influence of human activities on the ecosystem doing so will provide solid scientific evidence for the management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems mor et al 2018 sabo et al 2010 this study proposes a framework for analyzing the influence of water quality and hydrological factor variations on the structure of aquatic food webs and understanding the relationship between the structure of aquatic food webs in various regions and the spatial changes of water quality and hydrological factors ji nan is the study city for water ecological civilization in china the ministry of water resources in china proposed a project in 2013 to build healthy water ecological communities to promote sustainable development jinan city was designated to be the first pilot city for this project the success of ecological restoration in healthy water ecological communities should improve the quality of life for people in china and will be an example for other cities around the world zhao et al 2019 this study will provide a scientific foundation for the effective resolution of problems in the current increasingly grave aquatic ecosystems across the globe 2 study area ji nan city 36 0 37 5 n 116 2 117 7 e is a pilot in the construction of civilized and freshwater ecological cities in china fig 1 the success of aquatic ecosystem restoration in the city will determine the fundamental improvement of the living environment of the chinese people zhao et al 2018b hilly areas piedmont clinoplain and alluvial plains span the city from north to south the altitude within the area ranges from 30 to 937 m asl with highly contrasting relief cui et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 ji nan city represents a typical developing city in china having an area of 8227 km2 and a population of 5 69m with rapid industrial development and urbanization in recent decades the water resources in ji nan have been severely polluted and reduced in quantity because of extraction consequently drinking water and human health and well being are becoming increasingly threatened hong et al 2010 the same is true for aquatic plants and animals and the food webs they form based on comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the watershed and administrative regions of ji nan city and the consideration of the spatial differentiation of hydrological water quality 48 stations for the hydrology water quality aquatic ecosystem monitoring were set up and distributed evenly in the first grade freshwater ecoregions of the city 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental data in the spring summer and autumn of the years 2015 and 2016 six large scale field investigations measured 37 hydrologic water quality physical and water quality chemical factors table 1 and concurrently sampled the principle communities in a food web inclusive of phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos and fish table 2 nine stations where the rivers had dried were excluded and monitored data from the remaining 39 stations were used fig 1 3 1 1 water quality and hydrological data the monitored data includes 27 parameters belonging to three categories which are four hydrological factors i e flow velocity water depth flow and river width five physical parameters of water quality i e turbidity conductivity water temperature air temperature and transparency and 18 chemical parameters of water quality i e permanganate index chemical oxygen demand calcium sulfate etc the data are listed in table 1 hydrological parameters such as water depth and flow velocity were routinely monitored the flow velocity was measured using a radio flow meter stalker ii svr v1 0 and traditional flow meter ls25 1 to ensure accuracy of results water depth and river width were measured using a tape gauge and flow was calculated from the flow velocity water depth and cross sectional area an unmanned aerial vehicle was used to retrieve river course cross sections with high resolution stereoscopic images zhao et al 2017 in table 1 the physical parameters were measured in situ using portable equipment and the chemical parameters were obtained by testing water samples in the laboratory within 24 h after they were collected at monitoring sites a spectrophotometer dr5000 was used to measure ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen and hexavalent chromium an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo m6 was used to measure copper zinc cadmium lead etc and an ion chromatograph dionex 600 was used to measure sulfate fluoride chloride and nitrate concentrations zhao et al 2015 3 1 2 aquatic biota data phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos and fish were sampled concurrently with water quality and hydrological factors for phytoplankton a 1000 ml organic glass bottle was used to obtain water in the range 0 2 m below water surface subsequently 1 5 concentration lugol s solution was added to the bottle as quickly as possible in the laboratory the sample was first set aside for more than 24 h subsequently it was concentrated into 30 ml subsequently 0 1 ml of this concentrated sample was extracted and transfused into 0 1 ml plankton counting chamber finally a microscope was used to classify and count phytoplankton zhao et al 2010 for zooplankton the sampling methods of protozoon and rotifera are the same as those of phytoplankton when sampling cladocera and copepods a 10 l organic glass bottle was used to obtain water subsequently this water sample was filtered and concentrated into 5 ml using a 200 mesh or 125 mesh plankton net finally 4 concentration formaldehyde was added the number of protozoon and rotifera was determined via the same method as phytoplankton the method used for cladocera and copepods is different the 10 l water sample was fully concentrated and all cladocera and copepods were classified and counted zhao et al 2010 for zoobenthos an oyster bucket harvester with a mouth area of 29 cm 29 cm was used to dig substrate sludge subsequently the substrate sludge was washed with a 60 mesh filter finally zoobenthos were extracted and 75 concentration alcoholic solution was added owing to the bigger size of zoobenthos they are usually directly classified and counted with eyes all aquatic organisms were weighed by using a torque balance or a pharmaceutical scale and classified by using aquatic organism atlas zhao et al 2017 concurrently fish were collected during 30 min periods in three habitat types i e pools riffles and runs within 500 m of the river at each sampling site specimens caught from the three habitats were combined to represent a site in wadeable streams fish were collected by a two person team barbour et al 1999 in unwadeable streams seine nets mesh sizes of 30 and 40 mm were used to collect fish from a boat furthermore electrofishing was performed to ensure that a good representation of fish species was collected at each site all individuals collected were identified in situ according to chen et al 1987 and thereafter counted weighed and recorded in field data sheets subsequently all identified fish were released a few specimens that could not be identified in the field were preserved in 10 formalin solution and stored in labeled jars for subsequent laboratory identification zhao et al 2017 in total 440 species of phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos and fish were detected in the study area during the six field investigations 242 in 2015 and 198 in 2016 further details are presented in table 2 3 2 methods food web models for different sampling sites in different seasons were first set up followed by the selection of indices for the evaluation of food web structure from literature the key driving factors affecting the food web structure were identified by jointly using canonical correspondence analysis cca and partial least squares the spatial variation of different types of driving factors were analyzed using the spatial autocorrelation analysis method together with fuzzy clustering they were used to explore the food web structure and ecosystem stability of ji nan under different degrees of water quality and hydrological changes 3 2 1 selection of food web structure indices the ecopath model provides a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of the structure of the ecosystem the processes of nutrient flow and the characteristics of nutrient dynamics first indices of food web structure were extracted from the established ecopath models the effects of these indices on the complexity connectance stability and maturity of food web structure were thereafter retrieved from the relevant results obtained by scientists worldwide in the last 10 yrs the key indices most indicative of food web structure were screened out for later use as shown in our study the indices for food web structure mainly include biodiversity abonyi et al 2018 mor et al 2018 thompson et al 2018 food chain length mendonça and vinagre 2018 morillo velarde et al 2018 shannon index liu et al 2016a b connectance index marina et al 2018 system omnivory index wang et al 2017 and total primary production total respiration chen et al 2011 xu et al 2011 3 2 2 identifying the key driving factors affecting food web structure cca analyses were performed on hydrological factors and food web structure indices water quality chemical factors and food web structure indices and water quality physical factors and food web structure indices partial least squares regression was thereafter used for further quantitative verification to determine the key driving factors affecting the food web structure cca is a multivariate gradient analysis method designed to elucidate relationships between biological assemblages of species and environmental factors and has been widely used to predict interactions between community structure and environmental variables biswas et al 2015 it requires two data matrices the food web structure index data matrix and the environmental data matrix in this study barrella et al 2014 factors affecting the structure of food webs include water quality and hydrological parameters a method comprising single modal sorting and monte carlo displacement testing was used to select the main factors p 0 05 for food web structure differences based on the above two parameters cca was conducted using canoco software zhao et al 2017 the partial least squares regression analysis is an extension of multiple regression analysis which evaluates the effects of linear combinations of several predictors on a response variable this technique can be used to determine the relationship between two sets of variables the matrix xm n comprising m variables columns and n objects rows and a response vector yn 1 partial least squares regression identifies a few linear combinations of the original x values that describe most of the inherent variable hu et al 2018 in brief cca is a multivariate statistical analysis that uses the correlation between a pair of integrated variables to reflect the overall correlation between the two sets of indices it is a semi quantitative analysis of the overall correlation between the two sets of indices partial least squares regression is a second generation regression analysis combining multivariate linear regression canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis it provides a quantitative description of the correlation between two sets of indicators and indicates the driving factors more clearly the cross validation using these two methods ensures the accurate selection of key driving factors 3 2 3 spatial variations of the key driving factors based on the key driving factors determined above the spatial autocorrelation analysis method was used to study the spatial distribution of the key driving factors this method has been commonly used to assess the degree of clustering randomness or fragmentation of a spatial pattern spatial autocorrelation includes global spatial autocorrelation which estimates the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset and local spatial autocorrelation which identifies the location and types of clusters the two most common spatial autocorrelation measures for continuous data are moran s i and geary s c statistics moran s i is generally preferred over geary s c because the values of the former are more intuitive i e positive values for positive autocorrelation and vice versa moran s i was also observed to be generally more robust atikaimu et al 2015 spatial autocorrelation analysis in geostatistics is usually used to analyze the spatial variability of certain types of data the spatial changes of various driving factors are analyzed using arcgis and geoda atikaimu et al 2015 the moran s i value of the global autocorrelation analysis can be obtained intuitively the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation of the factors and local autocorrelation analysis can identify the location and type of the cluster 3 2 4 impact of key driving factors on food web structure studied using spatial clustering after analyzing the spatial heterogeneity of water quality and hydrological factors further clustering was performed on water quality and hydrological factors and the food web structure indices to study the impact of spatial temporal variations of the factors on the food web structure clustering is important for pattern recognition classification model reduction and optimization clustering analysis can be performed using the traditional hard clustering method or the fuzzy clustering method fcm the hard clustering method is more suitable for clustering conditions with clear boundaries whereas for problems with unclear boundaries fcm is usually adopted pan 2010 zhao et al 2013 in this study monitoring stations are distributed randomly across the study area making it difficult to determine clear boundaries therefore clustering with fcm is the best choice the advantage of this algorithm is that it can effectively avoid setting thresholds and can solve the difficult problem of multiple branches in threshold segmentation there are many algorithms and software for fcm and detailed algorithms can be found in li et al 2007 pan 2010 and shafi et al here we use the statistical software called data processing system to perform the fuzzy clustering analysis zhao et al 2013 4 results 4 1 selection of food web structure indices thirteen indices table 3 were obtained from the food web models constructed relevant results obtained by scientists in the international community during the past 10 yrs were thereafter studied to select the six most commonly used and accurate indices table 4 which were screened with the indices from the constructed food web models to obtain the following four evaluation indices shannon s diversity index iliev et al 2017 liu et al 2016a b wang et al 2016 total primary production total respiration chen et al 2011 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2011 connectance index guo et al 2018 han et al 2017 marina et al 2018 and system omnivory index lira et al 2018 wang et al 2017 among these indices shannon s diversity index indicates the complexity of food webs liu et al 2016a b connectance index shows its connectivity marina et al 2018 system omnivory index reflects the stability wang et al 2017 and total primary production total respiration indicates the maturity chen et al 2011 xu et al 2011 they are used herein to evaluate the structure of food webs and the structural and functional integrity of the entire ecosystem 4 2 key driving factors affecting food web structure the relationship between the three types of monitored data i e hydrologic physical and chemical water quality parameters as shown in table 1 and the structure indices of food web i e system omnivory index shannon s diversity index connectance index and total primary production total respiration is first analyzed using cca preliminary screening determines the key driving factors fig 2 among the various candidates the variable importance in projection vip values from partial least squares regression are used to finely select the driving factors affecting food web structure tables 5 7 for hydrological factors cca results fig 2a show that the flow velocity fv stream flow fl water depth wd and river width rw are positively correlated with total primary production total respiration tpr and negatively correlated with shannon s diversity index sdi connectance index ci and system omnivory index soi moreover vip values table 5 are considered to further screen and analyze the factors that affect tpr sdi ci and soi specifically after removing the factors with mean vip below 1 it is observed that tpr is mainly affected by the environmental factors of river width and flow soi by water depth and river width sdi by river width and water depth and ci by stream flow and water depth combining cca and vip results the river width water depth and stream flow are identified as the hydrological factors affecting the food web structure similarly the water quality physical factors affecting the food web structure are observed to be air temperature water temperature electrical conductivity and transparency via cca analysis fig 2band c and vip results table 5 whereas the water quality chemical factors with the greatest impact are potassium dissolved oxygen calcium and total hardness 4 3 spatial variation of the key driving factors autocorrelation was performed on the above key driving water quality and hydrological factors screened out to study their spatial variations global spatial autocorrelation was used to determine the moran s i index for each factor a clearly positive moran s i indicates significant positive correlation observed values of the factor tend to aggregate in space clearly negative moran s i indicates significant negative spatial correlation and observed values of the factor tend to be spatially dispersed which reflects the variation pattern in the value of the factor across spatial sites moreover higher moran s i signifies greater correlation among the values of a factor in space local autocorrelation is thereafter performed on the driving factors showing a strong spatial correlation in their values to yield the detailed spatial change of the factor and its relation with geographical location 4 3 1 global spatial autocorrelation global autocorrelation analysis of each driving factor using geoda yields the spatial autocorrelation index i e moran s i and its confidence level table 6 as shown in table 6 there is almost no correlation in the spatial distributions of hydrological factors i e almost no pattern in the spatial variation confidence level 95 however a significant correlation is observed among the water quality physical factors confidence level 95 which are also positively correlated moran s i 0 indicating substantial spatial aggregation of these factors into distinct high and low value zones water quality chemical factors show positive spatial correlation moran s i 0 with k and th being the most significant confidence level 95 4 3 2 local spatial autocorrelation as shown in table 6 water quality physical factors display prominent spatial clustering autocorrelation with ec being the most significant followed by tran at and wt among the chemical factors of water quality only k and th exhibit appreciable spatial clustering these six driving factors with significant spatial clustering are therefore selected for local autocorrelation via arcgis to study the relationship between their spatial clustering and geographical location and to further identify the spatial clustering characteristics of driving factors as shown in fig 3 fig 3 confirms the spatial autocorrelation in the driving factors of ji nan food web structure ec tran at wt k th and the strong regional aggregation in their values as observed in fig 3a high values of electrical conductivity ec are mainly observed in ecoregion iv and ecoregion iii to the north of metropolitan ji nan the ec values in other regions are low high value areas are mostly plains having higher salt ion levels in water owing to agricultural activities and thus higher electrical conductivity the spatial distribution of transparency tran is opposite to that of ec with higher values concentrated in the southwest and southern hilly region as shown in fig 3b whereas most of the northern region has low values of transparency this is because many streams flow in the mountains of ecoregion i to the south of the city with yellow river as the water source human activity is also less intense in this area which ensures good water conditions in fig 3c high values of air temperature at are mainly observed in the north and center of ji nan whereas low values are present in the southwest and southern mountains ji nan is higher in altitude at the south where the population is also less dense and the human activity is low resulting in the low temperatures of ecoregion i the trend in wt is opposite to that of at with high values located in the southwest of the city the spatial variations in potassium k and total hardness th are similar as shown in fig 3d and f with high values observed in the ecoregion iv to the north and some areas in the northern part of ecoregion iii ecoregion i to the south and ecoregion ii at the urban center are low value areas high value areas are mostly plains heavily affected by agricultural activities the levels of potassium and other salt ions in the water body are higher increasing total hardness drinking grade water is supplied in the urban center and spring water flows abundantly in the southern hilly region which is also not significantly influenced by human activity the level of salt ions and the total hardness are thus lower in the waters of these two zones elevated total hardness and electrical conductivity in water affect the food web structure and the health of ecosystem mazzei and gaiser 2018 pekcanhekim et al 2016 4 4 impact of key driving factors on food web structure based on spatial clustering analysis after the spatial clustering characteristics of key driving factors are determined the food web structure indices and the water quality and hydrological factors were analyzed together via fcm clustering the results are displayed on geospatial maps according to the location of sampling points for visualization of the distribution of clusters fig 4 the spatial clustering results of the food web structure indices and key driving factors were compared and analyzed to further identify the relationship between the driving factors and the spatial variation in food web structure as shown in fig 4a fuzzy spatial clustering on the food web structure indices tpr soi sdi and ci reveals the aggregation of low structure index values in the urban center pentagons in the figure and the concentration of high values in both the urban center and southern hilly region circles the medium values triangles tend to be more uniformly distributed in space and are observed in the south center and north of the ji nan metropolitan area the fuzzy clustering results of hydrological factors fig 4b show that ji nan metropolitan area overall is one of medium to low values triangles and pentagons and predominantly low values the southern hilly region and the eastern region are both areas of low values whereas the urban center in the middle is an area of medium to high values fuzzy clustering on water quality factors in fig 4c a higher value indicates lower water quality shows the concentration of high values circles in the eastern part of the city because this area is under the influence of heavy human activities the values of ec tran at wt k and th are high and do not benefit the health of the ecosystem overall the values of water quality factors in the southern part of the city are lower than those in the northern part indicating a healthier aquatic ecosystem in the south analyzing the clustering results of water quality and hydrological factors together fig 4b and c it is observed that ecoregion iv on the northern plain is moderate in hydrological condition triangles in fig 4b and water quality triangles in fig 4c owing to intense agricultural activities ecoregion ii in the urban center possesses good hydrological condition circles and triangles in fig 4b the ion hardness and water temperature values are low pentagons and hexagons in fig 4c streams are observed in the ecoregion i of the southern hilly region but the stream flow is small indicating poor hydrological condition pentagons in fig 4b the key driving factors of water quality adopt low values which facilitates ecosystem health pentagons in fig 4c analyzing the clustering results of food web structure indices fig 4a and all the key driving factors fig 4b and c comprehensively it is observed that both the food web structure indices and the driving factors assume medium values in the northern plain region triangles in fig 4a b and 4c the food web structure indices and key hydrological driving factors have medium to high values in the central region circles and triangles in fig 4a and b whereas the key driving factors of water quality have low values pentagons and hexagons in fig 4c the food web structure indices have high values in the southern hilly region circles in fig 4a the hydrological condition is poor triangles in fig 4b but the water quality is good pentagons and hexagons in fig 4c owing to the presence of streams the narrow rivers with small stream flow result in poor hydrological conditions however the water quality factors have medium to low values because the level of human activity there is low lu et al 2017 the number of aquatic organisms in this region is abundant and the food webs are intact and stable the above analyses demonstrate that there is a good spatial correspondence between the key driving factors and the food web structure regions with good hydrological condition and water quality especially water quality would have high values of food web structure indices and vice versa generally food web structure indices are negatively correlated with the degree of human activity and are more significantly influenced by water quality than by hydrological factors as shown by the above results and fig 3 the food web structure of the northern plain is less stable and intact than the southern hilly region owing to the high levels of electrical conductivity air temperature potassium and total hardness in the former these water quality factors are inversely related to food web stability whereas the opposite is true for transparency 5 discussion 5 1 key driving factors affecting food web structure human activities cause changes in water quality and hydrological factors significantly influencing the food web structure carvalho et al 2016 two different methods i e cca and partial least squares regression hu et al 2018 are used to select the driving factors because these two methods differ in the selection of the driving factors qualitatively and quantitatively they produce different results however cca followed by partial least squares regression would achieve higher precision screening and more reliable results the main driving factors obtained jointly via these two methods are river width water depth flow air temperature water temperature transparency electrical conductivity total hardness potassium calcium and dissolved oxygen studies conducted on the montsant river observed changes in the food web structure of the river caused by the impact of the driving factors including river width flow and water depth mor et al 2018 similarly research in the ramsar listed coastal lagoon of india shows the varied influences of habitat environmental factors such as hydrological condition and water quality which are under different degrees of human impact on the food web and changes in stream flow and water quality drive the changes in food web hemraj et al 2017 sanchez carrillo et al studied 10 lakes around the world and identified temperature and altitude as the important factors leading to the differences in food web structure sánchez carrilloet al 2018 these results are similar to ours and cross validate our methods of quantitatively studying the effects of water quality and hydrological factors on food web structure 5 2 analyses of the spatial temporal variation in key driving factors this study reveals the apparent variation in the autocorrelation properties of driving factors however owing to topography spatial autocorrelation is not observed in hydrological factors water quality physical factors show good positive autocorrelation as do the potassium and total hardness among water quality chemical factors water quality and hydrological changes were also studied on the lancang river basin in china it was observed that the degree of changes along the river diameter increased downstream and the changes in hydrological factors became more intense however the changes were less stable i e there is no definite autocorrelation li juan et al 2002 similarly the spatial temporal changes of surface water quality were studied on the yinghe river basin of china the spatial autocorrelation among the variables was quantified using moran s i the spatial autocorrelation of water quality showed that the water quality factors changed in a complex way with season and geographical location liu et al 2016a b this is consistent with the spatial variation patterns obtained for the key driving factors of hydrological condition and water quality in our study hamidi et al 2018 studied the chemistry of coastal aquifers of rmel oulad ogbane in morocco and observed no autocorrelation in the water chemical factors armt et al 2017 obtained the highest spatial autocorrelation with sodium ions while investigating the water quality and spatial variability of groundwater in sylhet district bangladesh gorgij et al 2017 observed the most significant autocorrelation in bicarbonate during their evaluation of the water quality of 21 groundwater samples from the azarshahr plain of iran these results differ from ours because ionic content varies with environmental factors such as geographical condition water salinity and water pollution leading to the differences in spatial distribution of water quality chemical factors across study areas 5 3 impact of key driving factors on ecosystem health low values of food web structure indices are observed primarily in the urban center whereas medium values are observed in all four regions with high values in the southern hilly region and the yellow river basin streams flow in the southern hills and the region is not significantly affected by human activity lu et al 2017 the yellow river receives external sources of stream flow and has a relatively integral and stable food web structure moreover the spatial distribution shown in the clustering results is consistent with the ecological zoning of ji nan metropolitan area yu et al 2015 because variations in geographical location and intensity of human activity such as the different distributions of water sources population and industrial and agricultural productions among places could lead to differences in hydrological condition and water quality carvalho et al 2016 similarly mazzei and gaiser 2018 also observed changes in the diatom assemblage by even small variations in the electrical conductivity at the bottom wetland during their study conducted in southern florida wetlands quiroga et al 2017 identified total hardness and electrical conductivity as the most important factors affecting the structure of bacterial assemblage while studying the bacterioplankton of five peatland pools tunney et al 2018 surveyed 35 canadian lakes and observed water transparency to be an important factor affecting the predation relationship of food web these results indicate the temporal spatial variations in water quality and hydrological factors have great influences on food web structure our research reveals a negative correlation between the stability of food web and human activity level and greater influence of water quality than hydrological factors higher electrical conductivity air temperature potassium and total hardness lead to less stable food web and vice versa indicating that these factors are inversely related to food web stability the opposite is true for transparency pekcanhekim et al 2016 studied several sub basins of the baltic sea concluding that salt concentration is the most important factor driving the changes in offshore biota composition of bothnian bay temperature on the contrary was not deemed as important possibly owing to changes in the environment in our study the conductivity potassium and total hardness were also affected by salt concentration kautza and sullivan 2016 observed a positive correlation between river width and food chain length in 12 river reaches along an 185 km long section of the scioto river system ohio usa the study by sullivan 2013 in the mountain drainages of northern idaho showed the effect of stream geomorphology on food web structure whereas the above results indicate hydrological factors as an important factor influencing food web such a driving effect is not apparent in the hydrological factors studied in our study this may be caused by the graver water pollution in our study area as compared with the two studied in the united states this could overshadow the influence of hydrological factors on food web structure comprehensive analyses show that conductivity air temperature water temperature total hardness transparency and potassium ions affect food web structures to a certain extent changes in food web structure will have important impact on ecosystem functions and ecological values hemraj et al 2017 robson et al 2017 to further quantify the effects of the above key driving factors on the structure level of food web a structure level index i a i 1 b i c i d i 4 is established by assigning equal weight to the four food web structure indices identified before this formula is used to evaluate the overall structural characteristics of the food web i is the structure level index of the ith food web a i b i c i and d i are the shannon s diversity index total primary production total respiration connectance index and system omnivory index of the ith food web respectively the structure level index reflects the changes in the structure level of food web in terms of stability complexity connectivity and maturity the vip values of the key driving factors on the structure level index of food web are calculated via partial least squares regression table 7 from which the influence of each factor on the index of the food network table 7 could be used to analyze the influence of each key driving factor on the potential factors in the regression analysis the mean vip of each key driving factor is obtained to indicate the effect of that factor on the structure level index of food web the impact levels of the factors on ranging in descending order are as follows water temperature wt air temperature at potassium ion k transparency tran electrical conductivity ec and total hardness th the left 2 columns of table 8 wt and at could be observed to have the greatest influence vip 1 0 the mean vip of each key driver factor on the four food web structure indices could be similarly obtained table 8 it can be observed that four factors out of five at th k wt and ec have strong influence on sdi vip 1 0 two factors wt and at have great influence on tpr four factors wt ec at and th have strong impact on ci and four factors ec tran k and th have great impact on soi overall the six key driving factors selected affect the different aspects of the food web water temperature and air temperature influence sdi tpr and ci more conductivity has greater influence on ci and soi potassium ion influences sdi and soi more total hardness has a significant influence on sdi ci and soi transparency only influences soi to a significant degree generally the most important factors that drive the spatial variation of food web structure are water temperature and air temperature followed by total hardness with transparency being the least influential 6 conclusions study on the influence of water quality and hydrological factor variations on the structure of aquatic food webs shows that 1 complexity connectivity stability and maturity are important features in the structural stability of the food web and are well reflected by the shannon s index connectance index system omnivory index and total primary production total respiration 2 in our study area the three types of driving factors affecting the food web structure are the hydrological driving factors river width water depth and flow water quality physical factors air temperature water temperature electrical conductivity and transparency water quality chemical factors potassium dissolved oxygen calcium and total hardness 3 hydrological factors do not show spatial correlation whereas the above four water quality physical factors and two water quality chemical factors potassium and total hardness display good positive correlation 4 food web stability is more susceptible to the influence of spatial variations in water quality than hydrological condition high electrical conductivity potassium total hardness and temperature lead to the decline in food web stability whereas transparency improves the stability 5 water quality factors tend to be more dominant than hydrological factors in regions of drastic environmental changes such as serious water pollution in this study the driving factors affecting food web structure are selected based on the structural characteristics of aquatic food webs and the respective water quality and hydrological states the results can guide the successful recovery of aquatic ecosystem in the study area they can also provide scientific evidence for the restoration of similar aquatic ecosystems in other cities worldwide owing to the complexity of aquatic ecosystems some of the results obtained here are preliminary and qualitative and further investigation is required in this respect to achieve more comprehensive protection and promotion of water ecosystems health moreover long term monitoring and routine data collection should be performed on aquatic ecosystems to obtain rigorous

19007,global aquatic ecosystems are essential to human existence and have deteriorated seriously in recent years understanding the influence mechanism of habitat variation on the structure of the food web allows the effective recovery of the health of degraded ecosystems whereas most previous studies focused on the selection of driving habitat factors the impact of habitat variation on the food web structure was rarely studied resulting in the low success rate of ecosystem restoration projects globally this paper presents a framework for exploring the effects of spatial variations in water quality and hydrological habitat factors on the food web structure in city waters indices for the evaluation of the food web structure are first determined by integrating model parameter extraction via literature refinement the key water quality and hydrological factors are then determined by coupling canonical correspondence analysis with partial least squares regression their spatial variation is investigated using spatial autocorrelation finally fuzzy clustering is applied to analyze the influence of the spatial variations in water quality and hydrological factors on the food web structure the results obtained in ji nan the pilot city of water ecological civilization in china show that the shannon diversity index connectance index omnivory index and the ratio of total primary production to the total respiration are important indicators of food web structural change they show that the driving factors affecting the aquatic food web structure in ji nan are hydrological factors e g river width water depth and stream flow physical aspects of water quality e g air temperature water temperature electrical conductivity and transparency and chemical aspects e g potassium dissolved oxygen calcium and total hardness they also show that the stability of the food web is more prone to spatial variations in water quality than in hydrological factors higher electrical conductivity potassium total hardness and air temperature lead to deteriorated food web structures whereas better transparency improves structure and stability we found that water and air temperature are the most important factors in the spatial variation of the food web structure in the study area followed by total hardness transparency is the least important factor large disparities and varied spatial distributions exist in the driving effects of water quality and hydrological factors across regions attributable to differences in geographical environments water salinity fresh vs sea water and environmental factors e g water pollution the above methods and results serve as a theoretical and scientific basis for a high success rate of aquatic ecosystem restoration projects in the study area and other cities worldwide keywords water quality hydrology spatial variation food web structure driving factors 1 introduction human activities have a severe impact on hydrological cycles and river water quality zou et al 2018 causing deterioration of water quality and the decline in the hydrological state of the water cycle causing negative effects on the ecosystem this leads to drastic changes in the food web structure of rivers coll et al 2011 garay narváez et al 2013 perkins et al 2010 the degradation of river ecosystems is accelerated seriously affecting the ecological values of freshwater ecosystems can be categorized according to their form and function the former refers to the community structure and the latter is the network or trophic levels baird and ulanowicz 1989 mcintyre et al 2007 of biological components in the system organized via the food web or food chain the most fundamental link between various elements of an ecosystem is nutrition food chain and food web are important forms of energy transfer in an ecosystem post 2002 nordström and bonsdorff 2017 the food web is a network comprising various organisms and their nutritional relationships in the ecosystem formed via the interactions among communities and species post 2002 it describes the complex nutritional interactions of different organisms in biological communities and reveals the material and energy flow of the entire ecosystem a food web is very sensitive to changes in the biodiversity and the intensity of interactions between organisms in an ecosystem post and takimoto 2007 a food web with a higher level of complexity indicates greater ecosystem resilience to external disturbances peralta maraver et al 2017 research on this topic readily offers insight into the flow of material and energy the composition and structure of the biological communities and the complex feeding relationship among species baird and ulanowicz 1989 mcintyre et al 2007 it functions as the basis for making ecosystem based ecological protection and restoration decisions harvey et al 2017 mccann 2007 presently the common food web models are mainly divided into three categories the first type is the structural model e g random model proposed by erdos and renyi 1960 xue et al 2018 the second type is a dynamic model that is primarily used to predict dynamic changes in the structure of the food web chen and cohen 2001 haerter et al 2016 grilli et al 2017 the third type is the energy flow model wherein the ecopath model is commonly used ecopath is a nutritionally balanced model of an ecosystem that describes the nutrition flow based on food web structure of the system and the principle of nutritional dynamics natugonza et al 2016 its primary function is to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze the structure of the ecosystem the process of nutrition flow and the characteristics of nutritional dynamics this model has been widely used in the study of nutrition structure and energy flow and the prediction of the future development of aquatic ecosystems it is recognized by ecologists worldwide as the key instrument in the next generation research on water ecosystems angelini and agostinho 2005 chen 2010 water quality and hydrological habitat factor changes affect the hierarchy and structure of the ecosystem zhao et al 2018a and the integrity of the food web carvalho et al 2016 deeply influencing ecosystem functions and services hemraj et al 2017 robson et al 2017 previous studies however were mostly conducted on the selection of key driving factors and lack the quantitative investigation of the influence of spatial variations in hydrology and water quality on the food web structure consequently an assessment of 78 large scale ecological restoration projects in europe and the united states shows that only a few have achieved their aims palmer et al 2010 it is therefore pressing to investigate the effects of water quality and hydrological changes on the food web structure to quantify the level of human impact on the ecosystem and food web structure and to restrain and reduce the influence of human activities on the ecosystem doing so will provide solid scientific evidence for the management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems mor et al 2018 sabo et al 2010 this study proposes a framework for analyzing the influence of water quality and hydrological factor variations on the structure of aquatic food webs and understanding the relationship between the structure of aquatic food webs in various regions and the spatial changes of water quality and hydrological factors ji nan is the study city for water ecological civilization in china the ministry of water resources in china proposed a project in 2013 to build healthy water ecological communities to promote sustainable development jinan city was designated to be the first pilot city for this project the success of ecological restoration in healthy water ecological communities should improve the quality of life for people in china and will be an example for other cities around the world zhao et al 2019 this study will provide a scientific foundation for the effective resolution of problems in the current increasingly grave aquatic ecosystems across the globe 2 study area ji nan city 36 0 37 5 n 116 2 117 7 e is a pilot in the construction of civilized and freshwater ecological cities in china fig 1 the success of aquatic ecosystem restoration in the city will determine the fundamental improvement of the living environment of the chinese people zhao et al 2018b hilly areas piedmont clinoplain and alluvial plains span the city from north to south the altitude within the area ranges from 30 to 937 m asl with highly contrasting relief cui et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 ji nan city represents a typical developing city in china having an area of 8227 km2 and a population of 5 69m with rapid industrial development and urbanization in recent decades the water resources in ji nan have been severely polluted and reduced in quantity because of extraction consequently drinking water and human health and well being are becoming increasingly threatened hong et al 2010 the same is true for aquatic plants and animals and the food webs they form based on comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the watershed and administrative regions of ji nan city and the consideration of the spatial differentiation of hydrological water quality 48 stations for the hydrology water quality aquatic ecosystem monitoring were set up and distributed evenly in the first grade freshwater ecoregions of the city 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental data in the spring summer and autumn of the years 2015 and 2016 six large scale field investigations measured 37 hydrologic water quality physical and water quality chemical factors table 1 and concurrently sampled the principle communities in a food web inclusive of phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos and fish table 2 nine stations where the rivers had dried were excluded and monitored data from the remaining 39 stations were used fig 1 3 1 1 water quality and hydrological data the monitored data includes 27 parameters belonging to three categories which are four hydrological factors i e flow velocity water depth flow and river width five physical parameters of water quality i e turbidity conductivity water temperature air temperature and transparency and 18 chemical parameters of water quality i e permanganate index chemical oxygen demand calcium sulfate etc the data are listed in table 1 hydrological parameters such as water depth and flow velocity were routinely monitored the flow velocity was measured using a radio flow meter stalker ii svr v1 0 and traditional flow meter ls25 1 to ensure accuracy of results water depth and river width were measured using a tape gauge and flow was calculated from the flow velocity water depth and cross sectional area an unmanned aerial vehicle was used to retrieve river course cross sections with high resolution stereoscopic images zhao et al 2017 in table 1 the physical parameters were measured in situ using portable equipment and the chemical parameters were obtained by testing water samples in the laboratory within 24 h after they were collected at monitoring sites a spectrophotometer dr5000 was used to measure ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen and hexavalent chromium an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo m6 was used to measure copper zinc cadmium lead etc and an ion chromatograph dionex 600 was used to measure sulfate fluoride chloride and nitrate concentrations zhao et al 2015 3 1 2 aquatic biota data phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos and fish were sampled concurrently with water quality and hydrological factors for phytoplankton a 1000 ml organic glass bottle was used to obtain water in the range 0 2 m below water surface subsequently 1 5 concentration lugol s solution was added to the bottle as quickly as possible in the laboratory the sample was first set aside for more than 24 h subsequently it was concentrated into 30 ml subsequently 0 1 ml of this concentrated sample was extracted and transfused into 0 1 ml plankton counting chamber finally a microscope was used to classify and count phytoplankton zhao et al 2010 for zooplankton the sampling methods of protozoon and rotifera are the same as those of phytoplankton when sampling cladocera and copepods a 10 l organic glass bottle was used to obtain water subsequently this water sample was filtered and concentrated into 5 ml using a 200 mesh or 125 mesh plankton net finally 4 concentration formaldehyde was added the number of protozoon and rotifera was determined via the same method as phytoplankton the method used for cladocera and copepods is different the 10 l water sample was fully concentrated and all cladocera and copepods were classified and counted zhao et al 2010 for zoobenthos an oyster bucket harvester with a mouth area of 29 cm 29 cm was used to dig substrate sludge subsequently the substrate sludge was washed with a 60 mesh filter finally zoobenthos were extracted and 75 concentration alcoholic solution was added owing to the bigger size of zoobenthos they are usually directly classified and counted with eyes all aquatic organisms were weighed by using a torque balance or a pharmaceutical scale and classified by using aquatic organism atlas zhao et al 2017 concurrently fish were collected during 30 min periods in three habitat types i e pools riffles and runs within 500 m of the river at each sampling site specimens caught from the three habitats were combined to represent a site in wadeable streams fish were collected by a two person team barbour et al 1999 in unwadeable streams seine nets mesh sizes of 30 and 40 mm were used to collect fish from a boat furthermore electrofishing was performed to ensure that a good representation of fish species was collected at each site all individuals collected were identified in situ according to chen et al 1987 and thereafter counted weighed and recorded in field data sheets subsequently all identified fish were released a few specimens that could not be identified in the field were preserved in 10 formalin solution and stored in labeled jars for subsequent laboratory identification zhao et al 2017 in total 440 species of phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos and fish were detected in the study area during the six field investigations 242 in 2015 and 198 in 2016 further details are presented in table 2 3 2 methods food web models for different sampling sites in different seasons were first set up followed by the selection of indices for the evaluation of food web structure from literature the key driving factors affecting the food web structure were identified by jointly using canonical correspondence analysis cca and partial least squares the spatial variation of different types of driving factors were analyzed using the spatial autocorrelation analysis method together with fuzzy clustering they were used to explore the food web structure and ecosystem stability of ji nan under different degrees of water quality and hydrological changes 3 2 1 selection of food web structure indices the ecopath model provides a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of the structure of the ecosystem the processes of nutrient flow and the characteristics of nutrient dynamics first indices of food web structure were extracted from the established ecopath models the effects of these indices on the complexity connectance stability and maturity of food web structure were thereafter retrieved from the relevant results obtained by scientists worldwide in the last 10 yrs the key indices most indicative of food web structure were screened out for later use as shown in our study the indices for food web structure mainly include biodiversity abonyi et al 2018 mor et al 2018 thompson et al 2018 food chain length mendonça and vinagre 2018 morillo velarde et al 2018 shannon index liu et al 2016a b connectance index marina et al 2018 system omnivory index wang et al 2017 and total primary production total respiration chen et al 2011 xu et al 2011 3 2 2 identifying the key driving factors affecting food web structure cca analyses were performed on hydrological factors and food web structure indices water quality chemical factors and food web structure indices and water quality physical factors and food web structure indices partial least squares regression was thereafter used for further quantitative verification to determine the key driving factors affecting the food web structure cca is a multivariate gradient analysis method designed to elucidate relationships between biological assemblages of species and environmental factors and has been widely used to predict interactions between community structure and environmental variables biswas et al 2015 it requires two data matrices the food web structure index data matrix and the environmental data matrix in this study barrella et al 2014 factors affecting the structure of food webs include water quality and hydrological parameters a method comprising single modal sorting and monte carlo displacement testing was used to select the main factors p 0 05 for food web structure differences based on the above two parameters cca was conducted using canoco software zhao et al 2017 the partial least squares regression analysis is an extension of multiple regression analysis which evaluates the effects of linear combinations of several predictors on a response variable this technique can be used to determine the relationship between two sets of variables the matrix xm n comprising m variables columns and n objects rows and a response vector yn 1 partial least squares regression identifies a few linear combinations of the original x values that describe most of the inherent variable hu et al 2018 in brief cca is a multivariate statistical analysis that uses the correlation between a pair of integrated variables to reflect the overall correlation between the two sets of indices it is a semi quantitative analysis of the overall correlation between the two sets of indices partial least squares regression is a second generation regression analysis combining multivariate linear regression canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis it provides a quantitative description of the correlation between two sets of indicators and indicates the driving factors more clearly the cross validation using these two methods ensures the accurate selection of key driving factors 3 2 3 spatial variations of the key driving factors based on the key driving factors determined above the spatial autocorrelation analysis method was used to study the spatial distribution of the key driving factors this method has been commonly used to assess the degree of clustering randomness or fragmentation of a spatial pattern spatial autocorrelation includes global spatial autocorrelation which estimates the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset and local spatial autocorrelation which identifies the location and types of clusters the two most common spatial autocorrelation measures for continuous data are moran s i and geary s c statistics moran s i is generally preferred over geary s c because the values of the former are more intuitive i e positive values for positive autocorrelation and vice versa moran s i was also observed to be generally more robust atikaimu et al 2015 spatial autocorrelation analysis in geostatistics is usually used to analyze the spatial variability of certain types of data the spatial changes of various driving factors are analyzed using arcgis and geoda atikaimu et al 2015 the moran s i value of the global autocorrelation analysis can be obtained intuitively the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation of the factors and local autocorrelation analysis can identify the location and type of the cluster 3 2 4 impact of key driving factors on food web structure studied using spatial clustering after analyzing the spatial heterogeneity of water quality and hydrological factors further clustering was performed on water quality and hydrological factors and the food web structure indices to study the impact of spatial temporal variations of the factors on the food web structure clustering is important for pattern recognition classification model reduction and optimization clustering analysis can be performed using the traditional hard clustering method or the fuzzy clustering method fcm the hard clustering method is more suitable for clustering conditions with clear boundaries whereas for problems with unclear boundaries fcm is usually adopted pan 2010 zhao et al 2013 in this study monitoring stations are distributed randomly across the study area making it difficult to determine clear boundaries therefore clustering with fcm is the best choice the advantage of this algorithm is that it can effectively avoid setting thresholds and can solve the difficult problem of multiple branches in threshold segmentation there are many algorithms and software for fcm and detailed algorithms can be found in li et al 2007 pan 2010 and shafi et al here we use the statistical software called data processing system to perform the fuzzy clustering analysis zhao et al 2013 4 results 4 1 selection of food web structure indices thirteen indices table 3 were obtained from the food web models constructed relevant results obtained by scientists in the international community during the past 10 yrs were thereafter studied to select the six most commonly used and accurate indices table 4 which were screened with the indices from the constructed food web models to obtain the following four evaluation indices shannon s diversity index iliev et al 2017 liu et al 2016a b wang et al 2016 total primary production total respiration chen et al 2011 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2011 connectance index guo et al 2018 han et al 2017 marina et al 2018 and system omnivory index lira et al 2018 wang et al 2017 among these indices shannon s diversity index indicates the complexity of food webs liu et al 2016a b connectance index shows its connectivity marina et al 2018 system omnivory index reflects the stability wang et al 2017 and total primary production total respiration indicates the maturity chen et al 2011 xu et al 2011 they are used herein to evaluate the structure of food webs and the structural and functional integrity of the entire ecosystem 4 2 key driving factors affecting food web structure the relationship between the three types of monitored data i e hydrologic physical and chemical water quality parameters as shown in table 1 and the structure indices of food web i e system omnivory index shannon s diversity index connectance index and total primary production total respiration is first analyzed using cca preliminary screening determines the key driving factors fig 2 among the various candidates the variable importance in projection vip values from partial least squares regression are used to finely select the driving factors affecting food web structure tables 5 7 for hydrological factors cca results fig 2a show that the flow velocity fv stream flow fl water depth wd and river width rw are positively correlated with total primary production total respiration tpr and negatively correlated with shannon s diversity index sdi connectance index ci and system omnivory index soi moreover vip values table 5 are considered to further screen and analyze the factors that affect tpr sdi ci and soi specifically after removing the factors with mean vip below 1 it is observed that tpr is mainly affected by the environmental factors of river width and flow soi by water depth and river width sdi by river width and water depth and ci by stream flow and water depth combining cca and vip results the river width water depth and stream flow are identified as the hydrological factors affecting the food web structure similarly the water quality physical factors affecting the food web structure are observed to be air temperature water temperature electrical conductivity and transparency via cca analysis fig 2band c and vip results table 5 whereas the water quality chemical factors with the greatest impact are potassium dissolved oxygen calcium and total hardness 4 3 spatial variation of the key driving factors autocorrelation was performed on the above key driving water quality and hydrological factors screened out to study their spatial variations global spatial autocorrelation was used to determine the moran s i index for each factor a clearly positive moran s i indicates significant positive correlation observed values of the factor tend to aggregate in space clearly negative moran s i indicates significant negative spatial correlation and observed values of the factor tend to be spatially dispersed which reflects the variation pattern in the value of the factor across spatial sites moreover higher moran s i signifies greater correlation among the values of a factor in space local autocorrelation is thereafter performed on the driving factors showing a strong spatial correlation in their values to yield the detailed spatial change of the factor and its relation with geographical location 4 3 1 global spatial autocorrelation global autocorrelation analysis of each driving factor using geoda yields the spatial autocorrelation index i e moran s i and its confidence level table 6 as shown in table 6 there is almost no correlation in the spatial distributions of hydrological factors i e almost no pattern in the spatial variation confidence level 95 however a significant correlation is observed among the water quality physical factors confidence level 95 which are also positively correlated moran s i 0 indicating substantial spatial aggregation of these factors into distinct high and low value zones water quality chemical factors show positive spatial correlation moran s i 0 with k and th being the most significant confidence level 95 4 3 2 local spatial autocorrelation as shown in table 6 water quality physical factors display prominent spatial clustering autocorrelation with ec being the most significant followed by tran at and wt among the chemical factors of water quality only k and th exhibit appreciable spatial clustering these six driving factors with significant spatial clustering are therefore selected for local autocorrelation via arcgis to study the relationship between their spatial clustering and geographical location and to further identify the spatial clustering characteristics of driving factors as shown in fig 3 fig 3 confirms the spatial autocorrelation in the driving factors of ji nan food web structure ec tran at wt k th and the strong regional aggregation in their values as observed in fig 3a high values of electrical conductivity ec are mainly observed in ecoregion iv and ecoregion iii to the north of metropolitan ji nan the ec values in other regions are low high value areas are mostly plains having higher salt ion levels in water owing to agricultural activities and thus higher electrical conductivity the spatial distribution of transparency tran is opposite to that of ec with higher values concentrated in the southwest and southern hilly region as shown in fig 3b whereas most of the northern region has low values of transparency this is because many streams flow in the mountains of ecoregion i to the south of the city with yellow river as the water source human activity is also less intense in this area which ensures good water conditions in fig 3c high values of air temperature at are mainly observed in the north and center of ji nan whereas low values are present in the southwest and southern mountains ji nan is higher in altitude at the south where the population is also less dense and the human activity is low resulting in the low temperatures of ecoregion i the trend in wt is opposite to that of at with high values located in the southwest of the city the spatial variations in potassium k and total hardness th are similar as shown in fig 3d and f with high values observed in the ecoregion iv to the north and some areas in the northern part of ecoregion iii ecoregion i to the south and ecoregion ii at the urban center are low value areas high value areas are mostly plains heavily affected by agricultural activities the levels of potassium and other salt ions in the water body are higher increasing total hardness drinking grade water is supplied in the urban center and spring water flows abundantly in the southern hilly region which is also not significantly influenced by human activity the level of salt ions and the total hardness are thus lower in the waters of these two zones elevated total hardness and electrical conductivity in water affect the food web structure and the health of ecosystem mazzei and gaiser 2018 pekcanhekim et al 2016 4 4 impact of key driving factors on food web structure based on spatial clustering analysis after the spatial clustering characteristics of key driving factors are determined the food web structure indices and the water quality and hydrological factors were analyzed together via fcm clustering the results are displayed on geospatial maps according to the location of sampling points for visualization of the distribution of clusters fig 4 the spatial clustering results of the food web structure indices and key driving factors were compared and analyzed to further identify the relationship between the driving factors and the spatial variation in food web structure as shown in fig 4a fuzzy spatial clustering on the food web structure indices tpr soi sdi and ci reveals the aggregation of low structure index values in the urban center pentagons in the figure and the concentration of high values in both the urban center and southern hilly region circles the medium values triangles tend to be more uniformly distributed in space and are observed in the south center and north of the ji nan metropolitan area the fuzzy clustering results of hydrological factors fig 4b show that ji nan metropolitan area overall is one of medium to low values triangles and pentagons and predominantly low values the southern hilly region and the eastern region are both areas of low values whereas the urban center in the middle is an area of medium to high values fuzzy clustering on water quality factors in fig 4c a higher value indicates lower water quality shows the concentration of high values circles in the eastern part of the city because this area is under the influence of heavy human activities the values of ec tran at wt k and th are high and do not benefit the health of the ecosystem overall the values of water quality factors in the southern part of the city are lower than those in the northern part indicating a healthier aquatic ecosystem in the south analyzing the clustering results of water quality and hydrological factors together fig 4b and c it is observed that ecoregion iv on the northern plain is moderate in hydrological condition triangles in fig 4b and water quality triangles in fig 4c owing to intense agricultural activities ecoregion ii in the urban center possesses good hydrological condition circles and triangles in fig 4b the ion hardness and water temperature values are low pentagons and hexagons in fig 4c streams are observed in the ecoregion i of the southern hilly region but the stream flow is small indicating poor hydrological condition pentagons in fig 4b the key driving factors of water quality adopt low values which facilitates ecosystem health pentagons in fig 4c analyzing the clustering results of food web structure indices fig 4a and all the key driving factors fig 4b and c comprehensively it is observed that both the food web structure indices and the driving factors assume medium values in the northern plain region triangles in fig 4a b and 4c the food web structure indices and key hydrological driving factors have medium to high values in the central region circles and triangles in fig 4a and b whereas the key driving factors of water quality have low values pentagons and hexagons in fig 4c the food web structure indices have high values in the southern hilly region circles in fig 4a the hydrological condition is poor triangles in fig 4b but the water quality is good pentagons and hexagons in fig 4c owing to the presence of streams the narrow rivers with small stream flow result in poor hydrological conditions however the water quality factors have medium to low values because the level of human activity there is low lu et al 2017 the number of aquatic organisms in this region is abundant and the food webs are intact and stable the above analyses demonstrate that there is a good spatial correspondence between the key driving factors and the food web structure regions with good hydrological condition and water quality especially water quality would have high values of food web structure indices and vice versa generally food web structure indices are negatively correlated with the degree of human activity and are more significantly influenced by water quality than by hydrological factors as shown by the above results and fig 3 the food web structure of the northern plain is less stable and intact than the southern hilly region owing to the high levels of electrical conductivity air temperature potassium and total hardness in the former these water quality factors are inversely related to food web stability whereas the opposite is true for transparency 5 discussion 5 1 key driving factors affecting food web structure human activities cause changes in water quality and hydrological factors significantly influencing the food web structure carvalho et al 2016 two different methods i e cca and partial least squares regression hu et al 2018 are used to select the driving factors because these two methods differ in the selection of the driving factors qualitatively and quantitatively they produce different results however cca followed by partial least squares regression would achieve higher precision screening and more reliable results the main driving factors obtained jointly via these two methods are river width water depth flow air temperature water temperature transparency electrical conductivity total hardness potassium calcium and dissolved oxygen studies conducted on the montsant river observed changes in the food web structure of the river caused by the impact of the driving factors including river width flow and water depth mor et al 2018 similarly research in the ramsar listed coastal lagoon of india shows the varied influences of habitat environmental factors such as hydrological condition and water quality which are under different degrees of human impact on the food web and changes in stream flow and water quality drive the changes in food web hemraj et al 2017 sanchez carrillo et al studied 10 lakes around the world and identified temperature and altitude as the important factors leading to the differences in food web structure sánchez carrilloet al 2018 these results are similar to ours and cross validate our methods of quantitatively studying the effects of water quality and hydrological factors on food web structure 5 2 analyses of the spatial temporal variation in key driving factors this study reveals the apparent variation in the autocorrelation properties of driving factors however owing to topography spatial autocorrelation is not observed in hydrological factors water quality physical factors show good positive autocorrelation as do the potassium and total hardness among water quality chemical factors water quality and hydrological changes were also studied on the lancang river basin in china it was observed that the degree of changes along the river diameter increased downstream and the changes in hydrological factors became more intense however the changes were less stable i e there is no definite autocorrelation li juan et al 2002 similarly the spatial temporal changes of surface water quality were studied on the yinghe river basin of china the spatial autocorrelation among the variables was quantified using moran s i the spatial autocorrelation of water quality showed that the water quality factors changed in a complex way with season and geographical location liu et al 2016a b this is consistent with the spatial variation patterns obtained for the key driving factors of hydrological condition and water quality in our study hamidi et al 2018 studied the chemistry of coastal aquifers of rmel oulad ogbane in morocco and observed no autocorrelation in the water chemical factors armt et al 2017 obtained the highest spatial autocorrelation with sodium ions while investigating the water quality and spatial variability of groundwater in sylhet district bangladesh gorgij et al 2017 observed the most significant autocorrelation in bicarbonate during their evaluation of the water quality of 21 groundwater samples from the azarshahr plain of iran these results differ from ours because ionic content varies with environmental factors such as geographical condition water salinity and water pollution leading to the differences in spatial distribution of water quality chemical factors across study areas 5 3 impact of key driving factors on ecosystem health low values of food web structure indices are observed primarily in the urban center whereas medium values are observed in all four regions with high values in the southern hilly region and the yellow river basin streams flow in the southern hills and the region is not significantly affected by human activity lu et al 2017 the yellow river receives external sources of stream flow and has a relatively integral and stable food web structure moreover the spatial distribution shown in the clustering results is consistent with the ecological zoning of ji nan metropolitan area yu et al 2015 because variations in geographical location and intensity of human activity such as the different distributions of water sources population and industrial and agricultural productions among places could lead to differences in hydrological condition and water quality carvalho et al 2016 similarly mazzei and gaiser 2018 also observed changes in the diatom assemblage by even small variations in the electrical conductivity at the bottom wetland during their study conducted in southern florida wetlands quiroga et al 2017 identified total hardness and electrical conductivity as the most important factors affecting the structure of bacterial assemblage while studying the bacterioplankton of five peatland pools tunney et al 2018 surveyed 35 canadian lakes and observed water transparency to be an important factor affecting the predation relationship of food web these results indicate the temporal spatial variations in water quality and hydrological factors have great influences on food web structure our research reveals a negative correlation between the stability of food web and human activity level and greater influence of water quality than hydrological factors higher electrical conductivity air temperature potassium and total hardness lead to less stable food web and vice versa indicating that these factors are inversely related to food web stability the opposite is true for transparency pekcanhekim et al 2016 studied several sub basins of the baltic sea concluding that salt concentration is the most important factor driving the changes in offshore biota composition of bothnian bay temperature on the contrary was not deemed as important possibly owing to changes in the environment in our study the conductivity potassium and total hardness were also affected by salt concentration kautza and sullivan 2016 observed a positive correlation between river width and food chain length in 12 river reaches along an 185 km long section of the scioto river system ohio usa the study by sullivan 2013 in the mountain drainages of northern idaho showed the effect of stream geomorphology on food web structure whereas the above results indicate hydrological factors as an important factor influencing food web such a driving effect is not apparent in the hydrological factors studied in our study this may be caused by the graver water pollution in our study area as compared with the two studied in the united states this could overshadow the influence of hydrological factors on food web structure comprehensive analyses show that conductivity air temperature water temperature total hardness transparency and potassium ions affect food web structures to a certain extent changes in food web structure will have important impact on ecosystem functions and ecological values hemraj et al 2017 robson et al 2017 to further quantify the effects of the above key driving factors on the structure level of food web a structure level index i a i 1 b i c i d i 4 is established by assigning equal weight to the four food web structure indices identified before this formula is used to evaluate the overall structural characteristics of the food web i is the structure level index of the ith food web a i b i c i and d i are the shannon s diversity index total primary production total respiration connectance index and system omnivory index of the ith food web respectively the structure level index reflects the changes in the structure level of food web in terms of stability complexity connectivity and maturity the vip values of the key driving factors on the structure level index of food web are calculated via partial least squares regression table 7 from which the influence of each factor on the index of the food network table 7 could be used to analyze the influence of each key driving factor on the potential factors in the regression analysis the mean vip of each key driving factor is obtained to indicate the effect of that factor on the structure level index of food web the impact levels of the factors on ranging in descending order are as follows water temperature wt air temperature at potassium ion k transparency tran electrical conductivity ec and total hardness th the left 2 columns of table 8 wt and at could be observed to have the greatest influence vip 1 0 the mean vip of each key driver factor on the four food web structure indices could be similarly obtained table 8 it can be observed that four factors out of five at th k wt and ec have strong influence on sdi vip 1 0 two factors wt and at have great influence on tpr four factors wt ec at and th have strong impact on ci and four factors ec tran k and th have great impact on soi overall the six key driving factors selected affect the different aspects of the food web water temperature and air temperature influence sdi tpr and ci more conductivity has greater influence on ci and soi potassium ion influences sdi and soi more total hardness has a significant influence on sdi ci and soi transparency only influences soi to a significant degree generally the most important factors that drive the spatial variation of food web structure are water temperature and air temperature followed by total hardness with transparency being the least influential 6 conclusions study on the influence of water quality and hydrological factor variations on the structure of aquatic food webs shows that 1 complexity connectivity stability and maturity are important features in the structural stability of the food web and are well reflected by the shannon s index connectance index system omnivory index and total primary production total respiration 2 in our study area the three types of driving factors affecting the food web structure are the hydrological driving factors river width water depth and flow water quality physical factors air temperature water temperature electrical conductivity and transparency water quality chemical factors potassium dissolved oxygen calcium and total hardness 3 hydrological factors do not show spatial correlation whereas the above four water quality physical factors and two water quality chemical factors potassium and total hardness display good positive correlation 4 food web stability is more susceptible to the influence of spatial variations in water quality than hydrological condition high electrical conductivity potassium total hardness and temperature lead to the decline in food web stability whereas transparency improves the stability 5 water quality factors tend to be more dominant than hydrological factors in regions of drastic environmental changes such as serious water pollution in this study the driving factors affecting food web structure are selected based on the structural characteristics of aquatic food webs and the respective water quality and hydrological states the results can guide the successful recovery of aquatic ecosystem in the study area they can also provide scientific evidence for the restoration of similar aquatic ecosystems in other cities worldwide owing to the complexity of aquatic ecosystems some of the results obtained here are preliminary and qualitative and further investigation is required in this respect to achieve more comprehensive protection and promotion of water ecosystems health moreover long term monitoring and routine data collection should be performed on aquatic ecosystems to obtain rigorous

19008,this study evaluates a treatment system centered on forward osmosis fo to extract high quality water from real brackish groundwater and wastewater the groundwater had salinity of 4 g l while the wastewater sample consisted of a secondary effluent these feed solutions were treated first in a fo step achieving a recovery of 60 subsequently the diluted draw solutions were subject to a nanofiltration nf step to regenerate their original osmotic pressure and to simultaneously collect a final permeate product magnesium chloride and sodium sulfate were both suitable draw solutes for this application mgcl2 had a larger specific reverse salt flux and induced a more pronounced fouling related flux decline with groundwater samples na2so4 was re concentrated with a higher permeability nf membrane but may require the use of anti scalants the average fluxes obtained in high recovery batch fo were between 5 and 11 l m 2h 1 with an initial bulk draw osmotic pressure in the range of 12 15 bar relatively low flux decline was observed in fouling experiments with both samples while physical cleaning proved promising to recover the related loss in productivity the final product waters were all of very high quality suggesting the potential of this coupled system for water reuse and desalination some challenges related to the relatively low water flux in the fo step as well as the loss of draw solutes and the gradual change in composition of the draw solution need further analysis to establish the technical and economic feasibility of the system graphical abstract image 1

and population growth mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 ridoutt and pfister 2010 at present fresh groundwater and high salinity resources are the main sources of water for potable and irrigation uses however

to remove salts and other contaminants elimelech and phillip 2011 mid salinity water resources such as brackish groundwater or wastewater are valuable alternatives to provide high quality water the treatment of wastewater and of brackish groundwater has been achieved by applying different technologies qu et al 2013 with membrane filtration among the most promising options high quality water can be extracted from wastewater through the application of membrane bio reactors mbr or membranes coupled with advanced oxidation processes holloway et al 2015 hu et al 2018 minella et al 2018 skouteris et al 2012 nanofiltration nf and low pressure reverse osmosis have been instead proposed as feasible technologies for the purification of brackish groundwaters phuntsho et al 2013 walha et al 2007 however fouling severely affects the lifetime of the membranes involved in pressure driven filtration thus increasing the overall cost of such systems guo et al 2012 for this reason current efforts are focused on the evaluation of innovative membrane based processes exploiting different driving forces within these efforts promising results were reported for the application of forward osmosis fo to treat complex water sources akther et al 2015 coday et al 2014a 2014b linares et al 2014 lutchmiah et al 2014 studies have demonstrated the feasibility to integrate fo membranes in mbr systems thus

2013 klaysom et al 2013 zhao et al 2012b the advantages related to fo drive a considerable amount of research around membrane development module design and the identification of the most applicable draw solutes chekli et al 2012 huang and mccutcheon 2015 shaffer et al 2015 xiao et al 2012 numerous membrane materials have been recently proposed to enhance the performance of fo by reducing fouling

have presented a comprehensive study related to the most commercially available inorganic draw solutes achilli et al 2010 all these studies have increased the understanding of the fo process and promoted its rapid development but mainly focusing on the optimization of specific sections of the fo technology e g the membrane or the draw solute there are also processes related to the overall system functioning that are crucial for the effective implementation of fo e g its rational coupling with the draw solute regeneration process and its achievable recovery rate especially when treating real waters the literature provides theoretical calculations strengthening the economic and environmental potential of full scale fo based systems blandin et al 2015 2016a kim et al 2018 linares et al 2016 luo et al 2014 wan and chung 2018 but very few experimental reports exist on these issues examples include discussion on pilot scale fo coupled with ro or nf treating wastewater effluents corzo et al 2018 hancock et al 2013 and a fo membrane distillation hybrid for sewer mining xie et al 2013 in addition zhao et al have presented promising results about the treatment of brackish water with an fo nf system but without providing many details on draw solution recovery and on the quality of the final product water zhao et al 2012a while more fo studies have recently involved the use or the modeling of pilot scale systems the vast majority of this research is performed at low recovery rates and does not yet address the optimization of the combined system comprising also the draw solute regeneration step thus overlooking also some of the phenomena involving the changes in the nature and composition of the draw solution during operation experimental research investigating these mechanisms is still relevant and should be conducted simultaneously with technological upscaling studies to understand i the high recovery performance of the system ii the optimal operating conditions when fo is coupled to the draw solute recovery step and iii the quality of both the recovered draw solution and the final water product the aim of this study is to evaluate a system to produce high quality water from a real brackish groundwater sample and a real wastewater effluent through the integration of forward osmosis and nanofiltration at first different draw solutes are assessed and the most promising ones identified for this specific application following preliminary fo tests to choose the best operating conditions high recovery experiments are presented the two contaminated waters are first used as feed solutions in fo subsequently the diluted draw solutions are treated in nf for regeneration and to obtain a high quality permeate the quality of the various aqueous streams entering and exiting both treatment steps are analyzed to discuss the overall performance of the coupled fo nf system in terms of quality of the final product and effectiveness of draw solution recovery the results of preliminary fouling tests are also presented which provide further insight on the feasibility of the treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes and draw solutes two commercial membranes were used for nanofiltration nf tests nf270 and nf90 dow chemical company midland mi the nf90 membrane has higher selectivity and lower permeance compared to the nf270 as reported in our previous work giagnorio et al 2018 commercial polyamide based tfc forward osmosis fo membranes were acquired from porifera inc hayward ca usa the active layer water permeance a nacl permeability coefficient b nacl and the support layer structural parameter s of the fo membranes were computed with nacl as draw solution following the protocol reported by tiraferri et al 2013 their values were 2 74 0 50 l m 2h 1bar 1 0 94 0 25 l m 2h 1 and 427 19 μm respectively resulting in a water flux of roughly 15 l m 2h 1 and a reverse salt flux of approximately 0 09 mol m 2h 1 5 g m 2h 1 using a draw solution of 485 mm nacl and a feed solution of deionized water three inorganic salts and one organic compound were evaluated as draw solutes magnesium chloride sodium sulfate magnesium sulfate and glucose were all purchased from carlo erba milan italy these solutes were chosen because of the possibility to regenerate the related draw solutions using nf an established technology with already robust operational standards 2 2 feed water samples real water samples were collected from two separate treatment plants located in italy one of the two plants referred to as site a treats contaminated brackish groundwater the second plant site b treats a mixture of civil and industrial wastewater specifically samples exiting the secondary sedimentation step were collected from both sites fig 1 the tests in this work aimed at assessing the possibility to substitute the following treatment steps currently in place with a coupled fo nf system with the specific goal to obtain water for high end uses specifically in site a the advantage of the fo nf treatment train would be a potentially lower fouling compared to the uf ro system currently in place and a possible slightly higher quality of the product due to the nature of the membranes providing a double barrier in the fo nf option in site b however the fo nf system would require an overall higher energy to be operated compared to the current configuration but in contrast it would promote the beneficial reuse of this wastewater the main characteristics of the feed samples are reported in table 1 together with the respective osmotic pressures calculated with oli system software 2 3 lab filtration setups the nf experiments were performed with the same cross flow system described in our previous publication giagnorio et al 2018 the retentate stream was recirculated back to the feed reservoir while the permeate stream was continuously collected in an external vessel the fo setup was purchased from sterlitech corporation kent wa usa it comprises two variable speed gear pumps cole parmer vernon hills il two reservoirs for the feed and draw solutions a flat custom made membrane cell and a data acquisition system the housing cell consists of a 146 mm 5 75 inches long 94 5 mm 3 72 inches wide and 1 5 mm 0 059 inches deep rectangular channel for a total active area of the membrane sample of 140 cm2 21 7 in2 in all the experiments the cross flow rate was 1 8 l min 0 34 m s cross flow velocity the temperature and the conductivity of both solutions were measured through the programmable controller included in the system the water flux across the membrane was computed based on the change of volume of the feed solution in time which was measured with a computer interfaced balance experiments were performed in batch recirculating the feed and draw solutions to the respective reservoirs all the tests were conducted with the membrane in fo configuration i e active layer facing the feed solution in co current mode and at a temperature of 23 c 2 4 preliminary forward osmosis tests and fouling tests the different draw solutes were evaluated in initial tests consisting of measuring the water and the reverse salt fluxes using deionized water on the feed side and upon variation of the osmotic pressure of the draw stream the draw osmotic pressure was varied in five consecutive steps with bulk osmotic pressures of 4 8 12 16 and 20 bar respectively once the most promising draw solutes were chosen mgcl2 and na2so4 a second set of tests was then conducted using solutions of either of these two salts on the draw side and the real samples from site a or b as feed solutions these tests were analogous to those just described and comprised measurements of the water fluxes for five steps with varying driving force fouling experiments were also performed with the real samples as feed solutions and with a draw solution of a single salt of mgcl2 or na2so4 with a concentration suitable to achieve an initial flux of approximately 13 14 l m 2h 1 in these 8 h long fouling tests the nominal driving force was kept constant by additions of appropriate volumes of a stock draw solution and of deionized water in the draw and feed reservoir respectively every 30 min some fouling experiments with the wastewater sample from site b also comprised physical cleaning steps to promote a larger shear stress at the membrane solution interface without backwashing every 2 h the cross flow velocity was increased and a cleaning solution of 4 5 mm of na2so4 or 1 mm of mgcl2 was used both on the draw and on the feed side larger flow rates would translate into more significant pressure drops within the channels and higher energy requirements for pumping in this study the cross flow velocity was only increased by 30 to 0 45 m s during cleaning representative of a mild process that would minimize the energy needs after 20 min the cleaning streams were replaced with previous draw and feed solutions and the fouling experiments carried on 2 5 high recovery forward osmosis and nanofiltration tests high recovery fo tests were performed with either mgcl2 or na2so4 as draw solutes at an initial osmotic pressure of 15 bar 0 304 0 218 m of na2so4 mgcl2 when treating the brackish groundwater from site a and 12 bar 0 238 0 178 m of na2so4 mgcl2 when treating the wastewater effluent from site b the draw and feed reservoir contained 3 5 l of solution in the beginning of the experiment the water flux through the membrane was measured every 10 min and the tests were prolonged until roughly 65 of solution i e 2 3 l permeated from the feed to the draw side at the end of each fo test the diluted draw solution was processed in nf the nf90 and nf270 membranes were used to re concentrate mgcl2 and na2so4 respectively and to produce high quality permeate water the reported average ion water internuclear distances i e a measure for the size of the hydrated ion for these species in aqueous solution are mg2 0 21 nm cl 0 32 nm na 0 236 nm so4 2 0 38 nm marcus 1988 nf membranes reject solutes by a combination of size based separation mechanisms and electrostatic effects the size and the valence of the ions in solution suggest the possibility to apply a looser nf270 to reject na2so4 and a denser nf90 to reject mgcl2 the applied pressure in the nf tests was kept constant at 20 bar or 16 bar to regenerate the draw solution coming from the treatment of the brackish groundwater and the wastewater effluent respectively the applied pressure in nf needs to be at least equal or higher than the osmotic pressure of the feed solution at the end of the test i e 15 and 12 bar respectively the nf tests were prolonged until a relative recovery rate of 100 was achieved i e 2 3 l of solution permeated from the feed side to the permeate side samples of the fo concentrate stream fo draw solution as well as nf feed and permeate solutions were collected at the end of each experiment and analyzed by an external accredited lab eurolab turin italy 3 results and discussion 3 1 choice of the draw solutes and of the operating conditions the first set of tests aimed to select the most appropriate draw solutes four candidate compounds were evaluated namely magnesium chloride magnesium sulfate sodium sulfate and glucose they were selected based on the promising results discussed in the literature achilli et al 2010 chekli et al 2012 being widely available and inexpensive and owing to the possibility of being effectively recovered in nanofiltration nf magnesium chloride mgcl2 and sodium sulfate na2so4 have the largest osmolality among the four compounds these two salts were also associated with the highest fluxes and the lowest specific reverse salt fluxes in forward osmosis fo see fig s1 of the supporting information specifically the values of membrane b were 0 068 and 0 059 l m 2h 1 for mgcl2 and na2so4 respectively and the resulting reverse solute flux selectivities j w j s were 1 5 and 1 9 l mmol 16 and 13 l g obtained in experiments with deionized water as feed solution at 23 c additionally these two salts were rejected at high rate in nf with suitably high flux and were thus chosen to conduct our ensuing investigation to maximize productivity a denser nf membrane nf90 and a looser membrane nf270 were deployed to separate mgcl2 and na2so4 respectively during draw solute regeneration tests the purpose of preliminary low recovery fo experiments was then to choose the concentration of these two draw solutes to be later applied in high recovery tests the two waters from site a and b were thus used as feed solutions and permeating fluxes measured as a function of bulk osmotic pressure of the draw solution the trends displayed in fig 2 are consistent with theoretical expectations shaffer et al 2015 tiraferri et al 2013 similar fo fluxes were obtained with the two draw solutes while higher productivity was observed when the less saline water was used as the feed solution especially in the lower range of nominal osmotic driving force at high values of draw bulk osmotic pressure the results obtained with the two feed solutions evolved into similar values due to concentration polarization effects combined with reverse salt flux mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 the choice of the draw solution concentration for high recovery tests is a compromise between the expected fo productivity and the hydraulic pressure to be applied in nf to restore this initial concentration value based on the profiles shown in fig 2 draw osmotic pressures of 15 bar and 12 bar were selected for subsequent experiments with water samples from site a and b respectively 3 2 productivity of the coupled fo nf system the two contaminated waters from site a and b were first used as feed solutions in high recovery fo test using draw solutions of mgcl2 or na2so4 these tests were run until a recovery of roughly 65 was achieved subsequently the diluted draw solutions were used as feed streams in nf tests which were run until 100 of the dilution volume that is 100 of the approximate amount of permeated volume during the respective previous fo test was collected as permeate as a result the draw solution was virtually completely regenerated and high quality water was produced the latter amounting to 65 of the volume of the initial feed of the fo test the fluxes measured in all the filtration experiments are reported in fig 3 as a function of recovery at the initial draw osmotic pressures indicated in each graph the rate of permeation in batch fo tests decreased gradually in time caused both by a continuous reduction of the driving force and by fouling the experiments were highly reproducible as displayed in fig s2 of the supporting information in accordance with the data displayed in fig 2 and despite the lower initial draw osmotic pressure used to treat the wastewater effluent from site b the average fluxes measured with this less saline feed water were significantly larger compared to those observed in tests treating the brackish solution from site a also using sodium sulfate as draw solute instead of magnesium chloride resulted in slightly higher fluxes possibly due to a more pronounced reverse salt diffusion of the latter salt achilli et al 2010 specifically the average fluxes were 6 4 l m 2h 1 and 5 2 l m 2h 1 for brackish groundwater site a and 11 1 l m 2h 1 and 9 7 l m 2h 1 for the secondary wastewater effluent site b an implication of the relatively high fluxes displayed in fig 3b is the possibility to achieve significantly larger recovery values with wastewaters similar to those from site b possibly up to 80 the situation with brackish waters is the opposite as lower recovery goals may be necessary to maintain high fluxes as shown in fig 3c and d the fluxes observed in nanofiltration were larger than those observed in fo tests owing to the different transport mechanisms and driving force involved in the two processes the flux reduction observed in time as a function of recovery rate may be here entirely ascribed to the loss of driving force as the feed nf solution became more concentrated a larger productivity was associated with the looser nf270 membrane as expected from the intrinsic properties of the active materials characterizing the two nf membranes the average fluxes in nanofiltration were 86 2 l m 2h 1 and 54 9 l m 2h 1 to recover the draw solution used to treat samples from site a applied hydraulic pressure of 20 bar and 69 9 l m 2h 1 and 50 8 l m 2h 1 in the case of site b applied hydraulic pressure of 16 bar the average fluxes reported in the two paragraphs above were calculated simply by dividing the total cumulated permeated volumes by the duration of each respective experiment when operating in batch mode in the laboratory recovery increases with time in real operation recovery increases with space along the membrane module indeed recovery may be used to tie the two modes of operation luo et al 2014 therefore the fluxes discussed in this study may be regarded as those that would be obtained from the modules in a plant operating at the equivalent recovery rate of lab tests and in co current mode as the nf productivity is larger than the fo productivity the total active area needed to recover the draw solution is smaller than that necessary to treat the contaminated stream in fo i e the capital costs of installation of the nf plant would be lower than for the associated fo plant the data shown in fig 2 suggests that it would be possible to conveniently work with a larger initial osmotic pressure in the draw solution to maximize the productivity of the fo step while maintaining the same applied pressure in nf thus reducing capital costs related to fo installation alternatively or concurrently the nf system may be configured to operate at lower applied pressure resulting in energy savings for the overall system other possible options to optimize the system would be operating in counter current mode in the fo stage as well as working at larger flow rates of the draw compared to the feed solution to achieve a lower dilution rate of the draw solutes at equivalent recovery the excess flow of the draw would be treated in nf at higher fluxes compared to fo thus producing larger volumes of high quality water without greatly increasing the size of the plant clearly scaling up of the system should take into account the piecing together of the two stages a strategy that aims at optimizing the fo step alone and independently of the nf step will likely not achieve an optimal design such best configuration is expected to be accomplished by simultaneous optimization of both steps possibly applying sub optimal parameters in one of the two stages to maximize the overall utility 3 3 preliminary fouling results fig 4 presents experimental fo fluxes obtained from tests where their reduction was due solely to fouling related effects the flux decline observed with brackish groundwater as feed solution was moderate with mgcl2 as draw solute and very low with a draw solution of na2so4 the difference obtained with the two solutes which also explains the slight dissimilarity of the data from high recovery experiments with the same feed water from site a fig 2a may be rationalized with the negative effect of magnesium to enhance foulant deposition at the membrane solution interface as this ion diffused to the feed side xie et al 2014 a note of caution when comparing the performance of the two draw solutes is due here as the use of sulfate may necessitate additions of anti scalants in real operation the flux decline observed with secondary effluent was relatively more significant than that observed when treating water from site a and this result is somewhat expected owing to the larger amount of organic molecules present in the wastewater samples table 1 the water fluxes measured after 8 h of test with samples from site b were 75 80 of the initial flux regardless of the nature of the draw solution the results suggest a role of magnesium chloride in promoting fouling when the brackish water from site a was used as feed stream this observation may be rationalized with larger magnesium flux into the feed possibly exacerbated by bidirectional ion transport mechanisms and exchanges with sodium ions contained at higher levels in water a compared to water b and with specific interactions of magnesium with some of the components of the feed brackish water it is likely that the results shown in fig 4 overestimate the true prevalence of flux decline due to fouling no provision was taken to minimize fouling during lab tests viz the cross flow velocity was relatively low spacers were not used and the initial flux strongly correlated to the extent of fouling blandin et al 2016b was intentionally in the higher range of typical fo fluxes when simple and mild physical cleaning was performed with the feed wastewater from site b part of the flux previously lost could be recovered and fluxes were generally higher compared to experiments without cleaning see fig 4c this result is consistent with previous studies which showed partial recovery of the previously lost water flux thanks to physical cleaning using pure water blandin et al 2016b mi and elimelech 2010 even more important effects of cleaning are expected if the cross velocity is increased at larger rates during real operation at the expense of some energy costs additional observations can be made from the data in fig 4 which suggest the interesting behavior of the fo process in terms of fouling resistance all the fluxes shown in the three graphs tended to stabilize within roughly one third of the experiment duration suggesting that fouling may be minimal during operation after an initial influence on productivity the observed decrease in flux at the onset of the tests may be also partly attributed to system equilibration more in depth fouling and cleaning experiments are certainly needed to provide further information and suggest operational modes 3 4 quality of the product waters draw solution regeneration and feasibility of the process the composition of all the streams entering and exiting both the fo and the nf systems was analyzed in terms of ionic species organic carbon and heavy metal concentrations the three main issues related to water quality in the coupled system concern i the management of the fo concentrate ii the end uses of the product i e the nf permeate and iii the regeneration of the draw solution i e the nf retentate stream while this study did not investigate the treatment of the fo retentate the quality of these concentrated streams is here briefly commented in relation to their potential management strategy the composition of the fo retentate streams collected in the high recovery experiments is summarized in the supporting information tables s1 and s2 the concentrated brackish groundwaters had medium high salinity close to 10 g l the correct management of this solution may involve further concentration to recover salt or other resources and for a more facile disposal the concentrated secondary effluent comprised instead a considerable amount of organics which would be even larger at higher advised recovery rates see table s2 given the relatively low salinity of this stream following fo treatment it may be partly recycled within the treatment train and be subject to biological treatment already present in site b which would only need to remove organic carbon without problematic issues related to other nutrients such as n or p highly promising results of this work are related to the quality of the product waters which is presented in tables 2 and 3 for the treatment of feed waters from site a and b respectively in all the cases the quality of the nf permeate was very high and this observation demonstrates the ability of the coupled system to desalinate brackish groundwater and to treat secondary effluents for high end uses in particular the composition of one of the four product streams would allow its direct use as safe drinking water the two waters produced using mgcl2 as draw solution may be readily used as high quality irrigation water without restrictions having a sar value significantly lower than 3 being thus compatible with the most sensitive crops heavy metal concentrations were always below detection limit or at least one order of magnitude lower than the limits for potable water these positive results are only partly surprising as the fo and nf treatment steps in series involved the use of two selective membranes only in the case of use of na2so4 as draw solute the values of sar were relatively high and the final concentrations of sodium and sulfate in the product water starting from feed waters from site a 250 mg l and 270 mg l respectively table 2 were larger than the limit value for potable water in italy these issues may be readily resolved by performing a second pass for only part of the nf permeate on the other hand the value of aggressive index slightly below 10 for one of the product waters from site b table 3 may be addressed by operating with a small bypass to mix the nf permeate with untreated water still guaranteeing high quality of the final product preliminary tests showed that similar product qualities may be obtained by directly applying significantly denser nanofiltration membranes e g xle membranes dow to treat the influent feed waters comparable recovery rates and permeate fluxes to those observed in this study may be achieved by working at lower applied pressures 10 15 bar but with more considerable concerns related to fouling the choice between the implementation of a coupled fo nf system and a stand alone nf system would require pilot scale tests and evaluation of the various trade offs of the two alternatives moreover a system consisting of nf only would comprise only one high selectivity barrier while the coupled fo nf is a two barrier system that would potentially allow higher removal rates also of small organic compounds and micropollutants the third issue concerns the quality of the regenerated draw solutions reconcentrated draw streams should be ideally equivalent to the initial draw solution applied in the fo step at least in terms of osmotic pressure a comparison of the composition of the initial and regenerated draw streams is presented in tables s3 and s4 of the supporting information following the two treatment steps in series the regenerated draw solutions contained between 87 and 97 of the original tds vastly provided by the respective draw solutes with only traces of different ions the reduced amount of salinity translates into a nearly proportional loss of osmotic pressure compared to that of the initial draw solutions the change in composition and in particular the decrease of tds is attributed to both reverse salt flux in fo possible phenomena of scaling and to incomplete 100 salt rejection in nf giagnorio et al 2018 a larger relative loss of tds was registered when treating wastewater from site b in this case the osmotic pressure of the nf retentate stream was roughly 10 5 bar instead of 12 bar this result may be rationalized with a larger net salt flux to the feed stream in fo due to the largest salt gradient across the membrane as the feed was characterized by lower salinity compared with experiments treating brackish solutions from site a generally a larger relative loss of osmotic pressure was observed with mgcl2 an implication of these observations is the need to either add solute continuously to the draw stream entering the fo step to maintain the osmotic pressure constant or the opportunity to reach relative recovery rates larger than 100 in the nf step this latter step would possibly be advantageous as it would increase the overall system recovery keeping in mind that a certain amount of draw solution would still have to be supplemented at the entrance of the fo step to maintain flow balance another final important aspect related to the composition of the regenerated draw solution is the molar ratio of its constituting ions the na so4 2 ratios of the nf retentates were 1 87 and 1 98 nominal ratio is 2 following the treatment of the brackish groundwater from site a and site b respectively the cl mg2 ratios were 2 08 and 2 04 respectively these data imply larger loss of cations compared to each respective anion in the system this result is rationalized with coupled and bidirectional ion transport across the fo and the nf membranes and with exchange mechanisms between feed and draw solutes in fo which cause a departure of the draw solutions from the initial compositions due to the complex mixture of species present in the feed waters another aspect that was not observed in this study but that may cause further impairment of the solution in the draw loop is the possible accumulation of micropollutants and other undesired substances this phenomenon is expected to be more significant when the draw regeneration process is more selective than that comprising the fo membrane e g dense ro membranes thus rejecting at high rates all the species that pass through the fo membrane when nf is applied downstream of fo this phenomenon should be thwarted and the system will still provide the advantages of a dual barrier to contaminants in any case the continuous alteration in the nature of the recirculated draw solution would perhaps require more than simple additions of solutes to this stream and also involve partial or complete replacement of the draw solution periodically during operation ideal fo membranes that are more selective and capable of providing high fluxes using lower draw solute concentrations would be a step forward to address issues related to loss of osmotic pressure and alteration of draw solutions during operation 4 conclusions in this work forward osmosis fo was evaluated in the treatment of a real sample of brackish groundwater and a real sample of wastewater effluent for the production of high quality water the most suitable draw solutions were magnesium chloride and sodium sulfate used to obtain bulk osmotic pressures of 12 and 15 bar in the initial draw solutions to provide feasible fluxes in the treatment of wastewater and groundwater samples respectively the diluted draw solutions obtained following a recovery of 60 of the initial feed 2 3 l out of 4 l were reconcentrated using medium pressure nanofiltration nf where the totality of the recovered water 2 3 l was collected in the permeate the results suggested that i the combination of fo and nf allows the production of waters of quality suitable for potable uses or unrestricted irrigation ii fo fluxes were in the order of 10 l m 2h 1 significantly lower than fluxes obtained in the nf step by applying a suitable hydraulic pressure to regenerate the initial draw solution osmotic pressure iii reverse salt flux in fo and incomplete solute rejection in nf caused some loss of draw solutes in the order of 5 10 iv the regenerated draw solutions contained ions leaked from the initial feed samples and the stoichiometry of the two ionic species composing the initial draw solute were slightly off following regeneration v the system may be further optimized by working at higher initial draw osmotic pressures and by increasing the recovery of the nf step very preliminary fouling and cleaning experiments suggested that the flux decline due to fouling may be low and mostly reversible during operation overall these results imply that the implementation of full scale fo still requires further improvements of this technology and of the coupling with the recovery process although the potential of this novel technology remains high in treating contaminated streams of low and medium salinity

19008,this study evaluates a treatment system centered on forward osmosis fo to extract high quality water from real brackish groundwater and wastewater the groundwater had salinity of 4 g l while the wastewater sample consisted of a secondary effluent these feed solutions were treated first in a fo step achieving a recovery of 60 subsequently the diluted draw solutions were subject to a nanofiltration nf step to regenerate their original osmotic pressure and to simultaneously collect a final permeate product magnesium chloride and sodium sulfate were both suitable draw solutes for this application mgcl2 had a larger specific reverse salt flux and induced a more pronounced fouling related flux decline with groundwater samples na2so4 was re concentrated with a higher permeability nf membrane but may require the use of anti scalants the average fluxes obtained in high recovery batch fo were between 5 and 11 l m 2h 1 with an initial bulk draw osmotic pressure in the range of 12 15 bar relatively low flux decline was observed in fouling experiments with both samples while physical cleaning proved promising to recover the related loss in productivity the final product waters were all of very high quality suggesting the potential of this coupled system for water reuse and desalination some challenges related to the relatively low water flux in the fo step as well as the loss of draw solutes and the gradual change in composition of the draw solution need further analysis to establish the technical and economic feasibility of the system graphical abstract image 1

et al 2012 nanofiltration nf and low pressure reverse osmosis have been instead proposed as feasible technologies for the purification of brackish groundwaters phuntsho et al 2013 walha et al 2007 however fouling severely affects the lifetime of the membranes involved in pressure driven filtration thus increasing the overall cost of such systems guo et al 2012 for this reason current efforts

2016 luo et al 2014 wan and chung 2018 but very few experimental reports exist on these issues examples include discussion on pilot scale fo coupled with ro or nf treating wastewater effluents corzo et al 2018 hancock et al 2013 and a fo membrane distillation hybrid for sewer mining xie et al 2013 in addition zhao et al have presented promising results about the treatment of brackish water with an fo nf system but without providing many details on draw solution recovery and on the quality of the final product water zhao et al 2012a while more fo studies have recently involved the use or the modeling of pilot scale systems the vast majority of this research is performed at low recovery rates and does not yet address the optimization of the combined system comprising also the draw solute regeneration step thus overlooking also some of the phenomena involving the changes in the nature and composition of the draw solution during operation experimental research investigating these mechanisms is still relevant and should be conducted simultaneously with technological upscaling studies to understand i the high recovery performance of the system ii the optimal operating conditions when fo is coupled to the draw solute recovery step and iii the quality of both the recovered draw solution and the final water product the aim of this study is to evaluate a system to produce high quality water from a real brackish groundwater sample and a real wastewater effluent through the integration of forward osmosis and nanofiltration at first different draw solutes are assessed and the most promising ones identified for this specific application following preliminary fo tests to choose the best operating conditions high recovery experiments are presented the two contaminated waters are first used as feed solutions in fo subsequently the diluted draw solutions are treated in nf for regeneration and to obtain a high quality permeate the quality of the various aqueous streams entering and exiting both treatment steps are analyzed to discuss the overall performance of the coupled fo nf system in terms of quality of the final product and effectiveness of draw solution recovery the results of preliminary fouling tests are also presented which provide further insight on the feasibility of the treatment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 membranes and draw solutes two commercial membranes were used for nanofiltration nf tests nf270 and nf90 dow chemical company midland mi the nf90 membrane has higher selectivity and lower permeance compared to the nf270 as reported in our previous work giagnorio et al 2018 commercial polyamide based tfc forward osmosis fo membranes were acquired from porifera inc hayward ca usa the active layer water permeance a nacl permeability coefficient b nacl and the support layer structural parameter s of the fo membranes were computed with nacl as draw solution following the protocol reported by tiraferri et al 2013 their values were 2 74 0 50 l m 2h 1bar 1 0 94 0 25 l m 2h 1 and 427 19 μm respectively resulting in a water flux of roughly 15 l m 2h 1 and a reverse salt flux of approximately 0 09 mol m 2h 1 5 g m 2h 1 using a draw solution of 485 mm nacl and a feed solution of deionized water three inorganic salts and one organic compound were evaluated as draw solutes magnesium chloride sodium sulfate magnesium sulfate and glucose were all purchased from carlo erba milan italy these solutes were chosen because of the possibility to regenerate the related draw solutions using nf an established technology with already robust operational standards 2 2 feed water samples real water samples were collected from two separate treatment plants located in italy one of the two plants referred to as site a treats contaminated brackish groundwater the second plant site b treats a mixture of civil and industrial wastewater specifically samples exiting the secondary sedimentation step were collected from both sites fig 1 the tests in this work aimed at assessing the possibility to substitute the following treatment steps currently in place with a coupled fo nf system with the specific goal to obtain water for high end uses specifically in site a the advantage of the fo nf treatment train would be a potentially lower fouling compared to the uf ro system currently in place and a possible slightly higher quality of the product due to the nature of the membranes providing a double barrier in the fo nf option in site b however the fo nf system would require an overall higher energy to be operated compared to the current configuration but in contrast it would promote the beneficial reuse of this wastewater the main characteristics of the feed samples are reported in table 1 together with the respective osmotic pressures calculated with oli system software 2 3 lab filtration setups the nf experiments were performed with the same cross flow system described in our previous publication giagnorio et al 2018 the retentate stream was recirculated back to the feed reservoir while the permeate stream was continuously collected in an external vessel the fo setup was purchased from sterlitech corporation kent wa usa it comprises two variable speed gear pumps cole parmer vernon hills il two reservoirs for the feed and draw solutions a flat custom made membrane cell and a data acquisition system the housing cell consists of a 146 mm 5 75 inches long 94 5 mm 3 72 inches wide and 1 5 mm 0 059 inches deep rectangular channel for a total active area of the membrane sample of 140 cm2 21 7 in2 in all the experiments the cross flow rate was 1 8 l min 0 34 m s cross flow velocity the temperature and the conductivity of both solutions were measured through the programmable controller included in the system the water flux across the membrane was computed based on the change of volume of the feed solution in time which was measured with a computer interfaced balance experiments were performed in batch recirculating the feed and draw solutions to the respective reservoirs all the tests were conducted with the membrane in fo configuration i e active layer facing the feed solution in co current mode and at a temperature of 23 c 2 4 preliminary forward osmosis tests and fouling tests the different draw solutes were evaluated in initial tests consisting of measuring the water and the reverse salt fluxes using deionized water on the feed side and upon variation of the osmotic pressure of the draw stream the draw osmotic pressure was varied in five consecutive steps with bulk osmotic pressures of 4 8 12 16 and 20 bar respectively once the most promising draw solutes were chosen mgcl2 and na2so4 a second set of tests was then conducted using solutions of either of these two salts on the draw side and the real samples from site a or b as feed solutions these tests were analogous to those just described and comprised measurements of the water fluxes for five steps with varying driving force fouling experiments were also performed with the real samples as feed solutions and with a draw solution of a single salt of mgcl2 or na2so4 with a concentration suitable to achieve an initial flux of approximately 13 14 l m 2h 1 in these 8 h long fouling tests the nominal driving force was kept constant by additions of appropriate volumes of a stock draw solution and of deionized water in the draw and feed reservoir respectively every 30 min some fouling experiments with the wastewater sample from site b also comprised physical cleaning steps to promote a larger shear stress at the membrane solution interface without backwashing every 2 h the cross flow velocity was increased and a cleaning solution of 4 5 mm of na2so4 or 1 mm of mgcl2 was used both on the draw and on the feed side larger flow rates would translate into more significant pressure drops within the channels and higher energy requirements for pumping in this study the cross flow velocity was only increased by 30 to 0 45 m s during cleaning representative of a mild process that would minimize the energy needs after 20 min the cleaning streams were replaced with previous draw and feed solutions and the fouling experiments carried on 2 5 high recovery forward osmosis and nanofiltration tests high recovery fo tests were performed with either mgcl2 or na2so4 as draw solutes at an initial osmotic pressure of 15 bar 0 304 0 218 m of na2so4 mgcl2 when treating the brackish groundwater from site a and 12 bar 0 238 0 178 m of na2so4 mgcl2 when treating the wastewater effluent from site b the draw and feed reservoir contained 3 5 l of solution in the beginning of the experiment the water flux through the membrane was measured every 10 min and the tests were prolonged until roughly 65 of solution i e 2 3 l permeated from the feed to the draw side at the end of each fo test the diluted draw solution was processed in nf the nf90 and nf270 membranes were used to re concentrate mgcl2 and na2so4 respectively and to produce high quality permeate water the reported average ion water internuclear distances i e a measure for the size of the hydrated ion for these species in aqueous solution are mg2 0 21 nm cl 0 32 nm na 0 236 nm so4 2 0 38 nm marcus 1988 nf membranes reject solutes by a combination of size based separation mechanisms and electrostatic effects the size and the valence of the ions in solution suggest the possibility to apply a looser nf270 to reject na2so4 and a denser nf90 to reject mgcl2 the applied pressure in the nf tests was kept constant at 20 bar or 16 bar to regenerate the draw solution coming from the treatment of the brackish groundwater and the wastewater effluent respectively the applied pressure in nf needs to be at least equal or higher than the osmotic pressure of the feed solution at the end of the test i e 15 and 12 bar respectively the nf tests were prolonged until a relative recovery rate of 100 was achieved i e 2 3 l of solution permeated from the feed side to the permeate side samples of the fo concentrate stream fo draw solution as well as nf feed and permeate solutions were collected at the end of each experiment and analyzed by an external accredited lab eurolab turin italy 3 results and discussion 3 1 choice of the draw solutes and of the operating conditions the first set of tests aimed to select the most appropriate draw solutes four candidate compounds were evaluated namely magnesium chloride magnesium sulfate sodium sulfate and glucose they were selected based on the promising results discussed in the literature achilli et al 2010 chekli et al 2012 being widely available and inexpensive and owing to the possibility of being effectively recovered in nanofiltration nf magnesium chloride mgcl2 and sodium sulfate na2so4 have the largest osmolality among the four compounds these two salts were also associated with the highest fluxes and the lowest specific reverse salt fluxes in forward osmosis fo see fig s1 of the supporting information specifically the values of membrane b were 0 068 and 0 059 l m 2h 1 for mgcl2 and na2so4 respectively and the resulting reverse solute flux selectivities j w j s were 1 5 and 1 9 l mmol 16 and 13 l g obtained in experiments with deionized water as feed solution at 23 c additionally these two salts were rejected at high rate in nf with suitably high flux and were thus chosen to conduct our ensuing investigation to maximize productivity a denser nf membrane nf90 and a looser membrane nf270 were deployed to separate mgcl2 and na2so4 respectively during draw solute regeneration tests the purpose of preliminary low recovery fo experiments was then to choose the concentration of these two draw solutes to be later applied in high recovery tests the two waters from site a and b were thus used as feed solutions and permeating fluxes measured as a function of bulk osmotic pressure of the draw solution the trends displayed in fig 2 are consistent with theoretical expectations shaffer et al 2015 tiraferri et al 2013 similar fo fluxes were obtained with the two draw solutes while higher productivity was observed when the less saline water was used as the feed solution especially in the lower range of nominal osmotic driving force at high values of draw bulk osmotic pressure the results obtained with the two feed solutions evolved into similar values due to concentration polarization effects combined with reverse salt flux mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 the choice of the draw solution concentration for high recovery tests is a compromise between the expected fo productivity and the hydraulic pressure to be applied in nf to restore this initial concentration value based on the profiles shown in fig 2 draw osmotic pressures of 15 bar and 12 bar were selected for subsequent experiments with water samples from site a and b respectively 3 2 productivity of the coupled fo nf system the two contaminated waters from site a and b were first used as feed solutions in high recovery fo test using draw solutions of mgcl2 or na2so4 these tests were run until a recovery of roughly 65 was achieved subsequently the diluted draw solutions were used as feed streams in nf tests which were run until 100 of the dilution volume that is 100 of the approximate amount of permeated volume during the respective previous fo test was collected as permeate as a result the draw solution was virtually completely regenerated and high quality water was produced the latter amounting to 65 of the volume of the initial feed of the fo test the fluxes measured in all the filtration experiments are reported in fig 3 as a function of recovery at the initial draw osmotic pressures indicated in each graph the rate of permeation in batch fo tests decreased gradually in time caused both by a continuous reduction of the driving force and by fouling the experiments were highly reproducible as displayed in fig s2 of the supporting information in accordance with the data displayed in fig 2 and despite the lower initial draw osmotic pressure used to treat the wastewater effluent from site b the average fluxes measured with this less saline feed water were significantly larger compared to those observed in tests treating the brackish solution from site a also using sodium sulfate as draw solute instead of magnesium chloride resulted in slightly higher fluxes possibly due to a more pronounced reverse salt diffusion of the latter salt achilli et al 2010 specifically the average fluxes were 6 4 l m 2h 1 and 5 2 l m 2h 1 for brackish groundwater site a and 11 1 l m 2h 1 and 9 7 l m 2h 1 for the secondary wastewater effluent site b an implication of the relatively high fluxes displayed in fig 3b is the possibility to achieve significantly larger recovery values with wastewaters similar to those from site b possibly up to 80 the situation with brackish waters is the opposite as lower recovery goals may be necessary to maintain high fluxes as shown in fig 3c and d the fluxes observed in nanofiltration were larger than those observed in fo tests owing to the different transport mechanisms and driving force involved in the two processes the flux reduction observed in time as a function of recovery rate may be here entirely ascribed to the loss of driving force as the feed nf solution became more concentrated a larger productivity was associated with the looser nf270 membrane as expected from the intrinsic properties of the active materials characterizing the two nf membranes the average fluxes in nanofiltration were 86 2 l m 2h 1 and 54 9 l m 2h 1 to recover the draw solution used to treat samples from site a applied hydraulic pressure of 20 bar and 69 9 l m 2h 1 and 50 8 l m 2h 1 in the case of site b applied hydraulic pressure of 16 bar the average fluxes reported in the two paragraphs above were calculated simply by dividing the total cumulated permeated volumes by the duration of each respective experiment when operating in batch mode in the laboratory recovery increases with time in real operation recovery increases with space along the membrane module indeed recovery may be used to tie the two modes of operation luo et al 2014 therefore the fluxes discussed in this study may be regarded as those that would be obtained from the modules in a plant operating at the equivalent recovery rate of lab tests and in co current mode as the nf productivity is larger than the fo productivity the total active area needed to recover the draw solution is smaller than that necessary to treat the contaminated stream in fo i e the capital costs of installation of the nf plant would be lower than for the associated fo plant the data shown in fig 2 suggests that it would be possible to conveniently work with a larger initial osmotic pressure in the draw solution to maximize the productivity of the fo step while maintaining the same applied pressure in nf thus reducing capital costs related to fo installation alternatively or concurrently the nf system may be configured to operate at lower applied pressure resulting in energy savings for the overall system other possible options to optimize the system would be operating in counter current mode in the fo stage as well as working at larger flow rates of the draw compared to the feed solution to achieve a lower dilution rate of the draw solutes at equivalent recovery the excess flow of the draw would be treated in nf at higher fluxes compared to fo thus producing larger volumes of high quality water without greatly increasing the size of the plant clearly scaling up of the system should take into account the piecing together of the two stages a strategy that aims at optimizing the fo step alone and independently of the nf step will likely not achieve an optimal design such best configuration is expected to be accomplished by simultaneous optimization of both steps possibly applying sub optimal parameters in one of the two stages to maximize the overall utility 3 3 preliminary fouling results fig 4 presents experimental fo fluxes obtained from tests where their reduction was due solely to fouling related effects the flux decline observed with brackish groundwater as feed solution was moderate with mgcl2 as draw solute and very low with a draw solution of na2so4 the difference obtained with the two solutes which also explains the slight dissimilarity of the data from high recovery experiments with the same feed water from site a fig 2a may be rationalized with the negative effect of magnesium to enhance foulant deposition at the membrane solution interface as this ion diffused to the feed side xie et al 2014 a note of caution when comparing the performance of the two draw solutes is due here as the use of sulfate may necessitate additions of anti scalants in real operation the flux decline observed with secondary effluent was relatively more significant than that observed when treating water from site a and this result is somewhat expected owing to the larger amount of organic molecules present in the wastewater samples table 1 the water fluxes measured after 8 h of test with samples from site b were 75 80 of the initial flux regardless of the nature of the draw solution the results suggest a role of magnesium chloride in promoting fouling when the brackish water from site a was used as feed stream this observation may be rationalized with larger magnesium flux into the feed possibly exacerbated by bidirectional ion transport mechanisms and exchanges with sodium ions contained at higher levels in water a compared to water b and with specific interactions of magnesium with some of the components of the feed brackish water it is likely that the results shown in fig 4 overestimate the true prevalence of flux decline due to fouling no provision was taken to minimize fouling during lab tests viz the cross flow velocity was relatively low spacers were not used and the initial flux strongly correlated to the extent of fouling blandin et al 2016b was intentionally in the higher range of typical fo fluxes when simple and mild physical cleaning was performed with the feed wastewater from site b part of the flux previously lost could be recovered and fluxes were generally higher compared to experiments without cleaning see fig 4c this result is consistent with previous studies which showed partial recovery of the previously lost water flux thanks to physical cleaning using pure water blandin et al 2016b mi and elimelech 2010 even more important effects of cleaning are expected if the cross velocity is increased at larger rates during real operation at the expense of some energy costs additional observations can be made from the data in fig 4 which suggest the interesting behavior of the fo process in terms of fouling resistance all the fluxes shown in the three graphs tended to stabilize within roughly one third of the experiment duration suggesting that fouling may be minimal during operation after an initial influence on productivity the observed decrease in flux at the onset of the tests may be also partly attributed to system equilibration more in depth fouling and cleaning experiments are certainly needed to provide further information and suggest operational modes 3 4 quality of the product waters draw solution regeneration and feasibility of the process the composition of all the streams entering and exiting both the fo and the nf systems was analyzed in terms of ionic species organic carbon and heavy metal concentrations the three main issues related to water quality in the coupled system concern i the management of the fo concentrate ii the end uses of the product i e the nf permeate and iii the regeneration of the draw solution i e the nf retentate stream while this study did not investigate the treatment of the fo retentate the quality of these concentrated streams is here briefly commented in relation to their potential management strategy the composition of the fo retentate streams collected in the high recovery experiments is summarized in the supporting information tables s1 and s2 the concentrated brackish groundwaters had medium high salinity close to 10 g l the correct management of this solution may involve further concentration to recover salt or other resources and for a more facile disposal the concentrated secondary effluent comprised instead a considerable amount of organics which would be even larger at higher advised recovery rates see table s2 given the relatively low salinity of this stream following fo treatment it may be partly recycled within the treatment train and be subject to biological treatment already present in site b which would only need to remove organic carbon without problematic issues related to other nutrients such as n or p highly promising results of this work are related to the quality of the product waters which is presented in tables 2 and 3 for the treatment of feed waters from site a and b respectively in all the cases the quality of the nf permeate was very high and this observation demonstrates the ability of the coupled system to desalinate brackish groundwater and to treat secondary effluents for high end uses in particular the composition of one of the four product streams would allow its direct use as safe drinking water the two waters produced using mgcl2 as draw solution may be readily used as high quality irrigation water without restrictions having a sar value significantly lower than 3 being thus compatible with the most sensitive crops heavy metal concentrations were always below detection limit or at least one order of magnitude lower than the limits for potable water these positive results are only partly surprising as the fo and nf treatment steps in series involved the use of two selective membranes only in the case of use of na2so4 as draw solute the values of sar were relatively high and the final concentrations of sodium and sulfate in the product water starting from feed waters from site a 250 mg l and 270 mg l respectively table 2 were larger than the limit value for potable water in italy these issues may be readily resolved by performing a second pass for only part of the nf permeate on the other hand the value of aggressive index slightly below 10 for one of the product waters from site b table 3 may be addressed by operating with a small bypass to mix the nf permeate with untreated water still guaranteeing high quality of the final product preliminary tests showed that similar product qualities may be obtained by directly applying significantly denser nanofiltration membranes e g xle membranes dow to treat the influent feed waters comparable recovery rates and permeate fluxes to those observed in this study may be achieved by working at lower applied pressures 10 15 bar but with more considerable concerns related to fouling the choice between the implementation of a coupled fo nf system and a stand alone nf system would require pilot scale tests and evaluation of the various trade offs of the two alternatives moreover a system consisting of nf only would comprise only one high selectivity barrier while the coupled fo nf is a two barrier system that would potentially allow higher removal rates also of small organic compounds and micropollutants the third issue concerns the quality of the regenerated draw solutions reconcentrated draw streams should be ideally equivalent to the initial draw solution applied in the fo step at least in terms of osmotic pressure a comparison of the composition of the initial and regenerated draw streams is presented in tables s3 and s4 of the supporting information following the two treatment steps in series the regenerated draw solutions contained between 87 and 97 of the original tds vastly provided by the respective draw solutes with only traces of different ions the reduced amount of salinity translates into a nearly proportional loss of osmotic pressure compared to that of the initial draw solutions the change in composition and in particular the decrease of tds is attributed to both reverse salt flux in fo possible phenomena of scaling and to incomplete 100 salt rejection in nf giagnorio et al 2018 a larger relative loss of tds was registered when treating wastewater from site b in this case the osmotic pressure of the nf retentate stream was roughly 10 5 bar instead of 12 bar this result may be rationalized with a larger net salt flux to the feed stream in fo due to the largest salt gradient across the membrane as the feed was characterized by lower salinity compared with experiments treating brackish solutions from site a generally a larger relative loss of osmotic pressure was observed with mgcl2 an implication of these observations is the need to either add solute continuously to the draw stream entering the fo step to maintain the osmotic pressure constant or the opportunity to reach relative recovery rates larger than 100 in the nf step this latter step would possibly be advantageous as it would increase the overall system recovery keeping in mind that a certain amount of draw solution would still have to be supplemented at the entrance of the fo step to maintain flow balance another final important aspect related to the composition of the regenerated draw solution is the molar ratio of its constituting ions the na so4 2 ratios of the nf retentates were 1 87 and 1 98 nominal ratio is 2 following the treatment of the brackish groundwater from site a and site b respectively the cl mg2 ratios were 2 08 and 2 04 respectively these data imply larger loss of cations compared to each respective anion in the system this result is rationalized with coupled and bidirectional ion transport across the fo and the nf membranes and with exchange mechanisms between feed and draw solutes in fo which cause a departure of the draw solutions from the initial compositions due to the complex mixture of species present in the feed waters another aspect that was not observed in this study but that may cause further impairment of the solution in the draw loop is the possible accumulation of micropollutants and other undesired substances this phenomenon is expected to be more significant when the draw regeneration process is more selective than that comprising the fo membrane e g dense ro membranes thus rejecting at high rates all the species that pass through the fo membrane when nf is applied downstream of fo this phenomenon should be thwarted and the system will still provide the advantages of a dual barrier to contaminants in any case the continuous alteration in the nature of the recirculated draw solution would perhaps require more than simple additions of solutes to this stream and also involve partial or complete replacement of the draw solution periodically during operation ideal fo membranes that are more selective and capable of providing high fluxes using lower draw solute concentrations would be a step forward to address issues related to loss of osmotic pressure and alteration of draw solutions during operation 4 conclusions in this work forward osmosis fo was evaluated in the treatment of a real sample of brackish groundwater and a real sample of wastewater effluent for the production of high quality water the most suitable draw solutions were magnesium chloride and sodium sulfate used to obtain bulk osmotic pressures of 12 and 15 bar in the initial draw solutions to provide feasible fluxes in the treatment of wastewater and groundwater samples respectively the diluted draw solutions obtained following a recovery of 60 of the initial feed 2 3 l out of 4 l were reconcentrated using medium pressure nanofiltration nf where the totality of the recovered water 2 3 l was collected in the permeate the results suggested that i the combination of fo and nf allows the production of waters of quality suitable for potable uses or unrestricted irrigation ii fo fluxes were in the order of 10 l m 2h 1 significantly lower than fluxes obtained in the nf step by applying a suitable hydraulic pressure to regenerate the initial draw solution osmotic pressure iii reverse salt flux in fo and incomplete solute rejection in nf caused some loss of draw solutes in the order of 5 10 iv the regenerated draw solutions contained ions leaked from the initial feed samples and the stoichiometry of the two ionic species composing the initial draw solute were slightly off following regeneration v the system may be further optimized by working at higher initial draw osmotic pressures and by increasing the recovery of the nf step very preliminary fouling and cleaning experiments suggested that the flux decline due to fouling may be low and mostly reversible during operation overall these results imply that the implementation of full scale fo still requires further improvements of this technology and of the coupling with the recovery process although the potential of this novel technology remains high in treating contaminated streams of low and medium salinity

19009,antibiotics have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and are of emerging concern due to their adverse effect and potential of inducing antibiotic resistance in this study we developed an uv pre magnetized fe0 h2o2 process uv pre fe0 h2o2 valid for neutral ph conditions which could remove sulfamethazine smt completely within only 30 min and enhance 1 8 times of smt removal meanwhile this process demonstrated outstanding mineralization capability with the toc removal of 92 1 while for uv h2o2 and uv fe0 h2o2 system it was 53 9 and 72 1 respectively better synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system was observed and the value of synergetic factor was 6 3 in the presence of both ions and humic acid which was much higher than that in deionized

electrochemical oxidation fenton process using safe and environmental friendly reagents of fe2 and h2o2 to produce oh radical via eq 1 has been reported as one of the fastest and most economical aops kourdali et al 2014 however limited ph range 2 3 production of ferric ion fe3 sludge and difficult recycling of fe2 are main drawbacks that restrict the full scale application of fenton process basturk and karatas 2014 meanwhile the presence of ions and natural organic matters nom in wastewater can scavenge oh radicals and thus influence the fenton performance kourdali et al 2014 1 fe2 h2o2

reactions eqs 2 4 pan et al 2017 and 2 pre fe0 can largely enhance the generation of fe2 for the catalysis of h2o2 thus producing more oh radicals to remove pollutants the h2o2 decomposition in the presence of pre fe0 is much faster than that with conventional fe0 li et al 2017b pan et al 2016 moreover due to the magnetic field gradient force pre fe0 can corrode fast at neutral ph in the

it has been proved that pre fe0 h2o2 can substitute fe2 h2o2 to treat different pollutants in salty wastewater because of the fast generation of fe2 pan et al 2018a uv irradiation can also recycle fe2 via eqs 7 and 8 thus can enhance the fenton reaction therefore uv pre fe0 h2o2 process might be a potential process to treat antibiotics in swe herein this novel uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was conducted for the degradation of sulfamethazine and then used to remove two contaminants from tetracycline class oxytetracycline and tetracycline and two from sulfonamide class sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine

tafel scans were carried out in a 100 ml beaker to determine the free corrosion potentials of fe0 species tafel tests were accomplished with the chi 760e ch instruments chenhua shanghai china potentiostat in a three electrode system polarization curves were obtained in the potential interval of 1 0 v to 0 2 v with 0 01 v s 1 scan rate the pt counter electrode work electrode and calomel

removal of smt by fe0 h2o2 pre fe0 h2o2 uv irradiation uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 processes are compared as shown in fig 1 a less than 10 and 20 smt could be removed within 60 min by fe0 h2o2 and pre fe0 h2o2 process under the uv irradiation alone 68 6 smt could be removed within 60 min indicating that direct photolysis of smt occurred the direct photolysis was highly dependent on the molar absorption coefficient of the compound at a certain wavelength de la cruz et al 2012 in uv h2o2 system both direct photolysis and oh radicals produced in h2o2 decomposition under uv irradiation could remove 94 3 smt within 60 min uv fe0 h2o2 could remove 99 4 smt within 60 min while smt could be completely removed within only 30 min by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process the results indicated that uv irradiation exhibited better synergistic effect on pre fe0 h2o2 than that on fe0 h2o2 while combining with the uv irradiation the value of k app 103 in deionized water was improved from 1 9 to 94 1 min 1 in the fe0 h2o2 and from 4 3 to 164 5 min 1 in the pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively fig s1 both values of k app in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems were larger than those in the uv h2o2 system 68 9 min 1 the results indicated the crucial role of fe0 for the antibiotics degradation in both uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems it is because of the recycle of fe2 under uv irradiation via eqs 7 and 8 lópez et al 2017 and the faster decrease of ph induce better fenton performance the decreased ph was primarily ascribed to the hydrolysis of fe3 via eq 12 and the formation of molecule acids during the degradation of smt sopaj et al 2016 as shown in table s1 the ph decreased from 7 to 6 5 5 7 and 4 8 in the uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively meanwhile as shown in fig 1b the concentration of total fe was 40 5 μm in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system which was much higher than that in pre fe0 h2o2 13 4 μm the result was mainly because uv irradiation helped to overcome the activation energy for the oxidation of fe0 son et al 2009 the concentration of total fe in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was also much higher than that in uv fe0 h2o2 system 28 6 μm which might because magnetization based on magnetic memory of iron enhanced the generation of fe2 li et al 2017b as shown in fig 1c only 1 3 μm and 1 9 μm oh was generated within 60 min in fe0 h2o2 and pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively and 34 9 μm oh was generated in uv h2o2 system oh generated in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system increased to 52 2 μm while only increased to 44 4 μm in the uv fe0 h2o2 system the results confirmed the hypothesis that the faster corrosion of pre fe0 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system induced the generation of more oh and thus enhanced the degradation of smt moreover synergetic factors sf were calculated via eq 13 to confirm the better synergetic effect for the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system sf value for the removal of smt was 2 2 and 4 6 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively confirming the better synergetic effect in the latter system 12 fe3 xh2o fe oh x 3 x xh 13 sf k uf k u k f k u k f where sf is the synergetic factor k uf k u and k f are the k app values of uv pre fe0 h2o2 uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 respectively 3 2 effect of inorganic ions and nom on the smt removal the presence of inorganic ions and nom in wastewater effluents may significantly affect the performance of fe0 based aops system we added 300 mg l 1 nacl 400 mg l 1 na2so4 and 150 mg l 1 nahco3 to simulate inorganic ions that presented similar concentrations in real swe nom could be a competitor to smt for oh radical and it absorbs uv light thus decreasing the direct uv photolysis of smt and the light intensity for fe related reactions we added 30 mg l 1 ha to simulate nom as shown in fig 2 a the removal of smt decreased in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ha compared with fig 1a such as that the value of k app 103 decreased from 68 9 94 1 and 164 5 min 1 to 27 9 45 2 and 98 2 min 1 in the uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems respectively fig 2d as shown in fig s2 in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ha total fe increased from 40 5 to 57 3 μm promoting the h2o2 decomposition in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system the results might be due to that the presence of nom could complex fe3 to prevent iron precipitation at neutral ph conditions inducing more significant fenton reaction uv fe2 h2o2 which were consistent with previous reports wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 zhang and zhou 2019 the role of pre fe0 for the antibiotics degradation in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was more significant in the presence of ha than that in the absence of ha as shown in fig 2e values of sf increased from 2 2 to 2 5 in uv fe0 h2o2 and from 4 6 to 5 5 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems indicating more significant synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system in the presence of ha as shown in fig 2b the removal of smt increased slightly in both uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems in the presence of 400 mg l 1 na2so4 300 mg l 1 nacl and 150 mg l 1 nahco3 compared with uv h2o2 system ph was almost unchanged in these systems in the presence of these ions mainly because hco3 could consume both h and oh via eq 14 and 15 thus keeping the stability of ph pan et al 2018b iron ion would precipitate under the neutral condition therefore no significant enhancement in both uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems compared with uv h2o2 system the sf value was only 0 8 and 1 5 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively hco3 was able to accelerate fe0 corrosion following eq 16 agrawal et al 2002 schmitt 1984 wiȩckowski et al 1983 the conjugate ion of hco3 co3 2 might inhibit iron ion release from fe0 by forming iron compounds and an insulating film on fe0 surface devlin and allin 2005 the influence of so4 2 on iron reactivity in the previous reports was contradictory some researchers insisted of the promoting effect of so4 2 on iron reactivity lipczynskakochany et al 1994 while the others declared of no influence farrell et al 2000 the presence of cl would destroy the insulating film on fe0 surface and thus promoted the reactivity of iron the comprehensive effect of the three ions on iron reactivity resulted in the enhanced smt removal in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems 14 hco3 h co2 h2o 15 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 16 2hco3 fe0 2co3 2 h2 fe2 as shown in fig 2c in the presence of both ions and ha the role of pre fe0 or fe0 was more significant value of k app 103 increased from 22 2 min 1 uv h2o2 to 43 9 min 1 uv fe0 h2o2 and 90 4 min 1 uv pre fe0 h2o2 ha and hco3 were both reported to occupy the sorption sites on fe0 and form inner sphere complexes on the surface of the particle therefore the presence of hco3 would compete with ha for the sites on fe0 reducing the adsorption of ha on the particle giasuddin et al 2007 the value f m was 2 1 in the presence of both ions and ha which was larger than that in deionized water 1 8 this might be because pre fe0 corroded faster at salty condition due to the magnetic memory and the generation of fe2 by the magnetic field pan et al 2018a being pulled by the magnetic field gradient force from pre fe0 fe2 generated by fe0 corrosion tended to move along the magnetic lines to the place with higher magnetic field flux intensity thereby inducing uneven distribution of fe2 and eventually enhancing the generation of fe2 the value of sf was 3 1 and 6 3 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively which were also much higher than those in deionized water in the presence of ha and ions the results indicated that better synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system while in the presence of both ions and nom 3 3 effect of inorganic ions and nom on pre fe0 corrosion the fe0 corrosion rate is one of the most important factors that determines the performance of the fe0 based photo fenton system faster fe0 corrosion can induce better photo fenton performance the electron transfer in the fe0 related reactions as a reflection of the fe0 corrosion was related to the oxidation status of the iron core which can be reflected by its free corrosion potential the more negative the free corrosion potential is the faster the electron transfer will be mu et al 2017 malgorzata et al 2019 therefore the free corrosion potential in tafel polarization diagrams was measured in our study to clarify the fe0 corrosion characteristics as shown in fig 3 a the potential of pre fe0 at the beginning of the reaction in di water was 0 67 v potentials of pre fe0 0 66 v 0 65 v 0 63 v and 0 63 v after 10 20 30 and 60 min reaction in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system indicating decrease of fe0 corrosion rate with the reaction decreased fe0 corrosion rate was because iron oxides generated during the reaction laid on the pre fe0 surface mu et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b the potential of pre fe0 at the beginning was 0 72 v in the presence of salts which was more negative than in di water 0 67 v showing the faster pre fe0 corrosion rate in the presence of ions which might because negatively charged anions would move together with fe2 to keep local charge balance in salty system fujiwara et al 2004 thus a high anions concentration would accelerate the generation of fe2 faster fe0 corrosion rate would induce more iron oxides generated laying on pre fe0 sufrace which would inhibit the pre fe0 corrosion fig 3b depicted that potential of pre fe0 decreased faster during the reaction and only 0 58 v after the 60 min reaction the results indicated that pre fe0 would be largely inhibited during the reaction the potential of pre fe0 at the beginning was 0 65 v in the presence of nom which was slightly less negative than that in di water 0 67 v fig 3c the results were because nom adsorbed on pre fe0 surface would hinder the pre fe0 corrosion whille the potential of pre fe0 decreased slightly during the reaction the results might be because the presence of nom prevented the formation of iron oxides on the pre fe0 surface that retarded the corrosion thus promoting fe2 release from fe0 during the reaction giasuddin et al 2007 while in the presence of both salts and nom the potential of pre fe0 0 72 v at the beginning was more negative fig 3d meanwhile potentials of pre fe0 decreased slightly during the reaction indicating that pre fe0 could keep the faster corrosion rate during the whole reaction therefore pre fe0 could keep better corrosion rate in swe which contains both salts and nom 3 4 comparison of the mineralization efficiency the complete removal of organic pollutants from wastewater is of high importance because they have various adverse effects on the environment the oxidation or partial mineralization of organic pollutants during an aop treatment can lead to the formation of intermediates even more toxic than the initial pollutant accordingly the oxidative degradation of the persistent toxic chemicals must continue unto the quasi complete mineralization of the treated solution therefore the removal of toc was compared in different systems as shown in fig 4 a fe0 h2o2 pre fe0 h2o2 and uv irradiation could not efficiently mineralize smt because the toc removal was 6 4 10 8 and 34 7 within 360 min in these three systems respectively 53 9 and 72 1 toc could be removed in uv h2o2 and uv fe0 h2o2 system while the toc removal could increase to 92 1 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system therefore not only the fast removal of smt but also a deep mineralization was achieved in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system short chain carboxylic acids are the low molecular weight organic species formed before complete mineralization i e transformation to co2 and h2o of organic pollutants during aops fig 4b d shows the formation and evolution of different carboxylic acids generated during the degradation of smt in uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively five carboxylic acids namely glyoxylic maleic fumaric formic and succinic acids were identified and quantified malonic and fumaric acids were detected at trace level in the three systems these acids were generated and accumulated in the medium up to maximum values which was peaked at different times in these three systems glyoxylic formic and succinic acids reached the maximum concentrations at about 180 min in uv h2o2 system while at 120 min in uv fe0 h2o2 system glyoxylic acid 180 min and only 60 min in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system it then mineralized within 360 min in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system while carboxylic acids still remained relatively high concentrations in uv fe0 h2o2 and uv h2o2 systems these results pointed out again the outstanding mineralization capability of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process moreover intermediates formed in the removal of smt were analyzed by gc ms as shown in table s2 sulfanilamide m z 172 sulfanilic acid m z 173 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine m z 123 4 aminophenol m z 109 and hydroquinone m z 110 were detected some short chain carboxylic acids such as glyoxylic maleic fumaric formic and succinic acids were also detected in hplc the possible pathway of smt degradation is shown in fig 5 the s n bond in sulfamethazine can be oxidized by oh radical to form 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine and sulfanilamide sulfanilamide will be converted to sulfanilic acid by hydroxylation sulfanilic acid will be further oxidized to 4 aminophenol which then can be converted to hydroquinone by hydroxylation the hydroquinone and 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine can also be further decomposed by oh oxidation then formed short chain carboxylic acids and finally co2 and h2o 3 5 mechanism of uv pre fe0 h2o2 process in the presence of nom and anions the possible mechanisms of uv pre fe0 h2o2 system for the removal of antibiotics at neutral ph are presented in fig 6 the corrosion of fe0 would be enhanced by the magnetization based on the magnetic memory of iron paramagnetic ions especially fe2 generated during the corrosion of fe0 tend to move along the magnetic lines to where higher magnetic field flux intensity exists resulting in uneven distribution of fe2 the flow of fe2 driven by magnetic field gradient force can induce a secondary flow of coexisting anions which then in turn accelerate the generation of fe2 pan et al 2018b the coexistence of anions might impose contrary influences on iron reactivity hco3 can promote iron release from fe0 by behaving as an oxidant co3 2 the conjugate ion of hco3 would probably inhibit the reactivity of iron by forming iron compounds and an insulating film on fe0 surface promoting effect or no effect of so4 2 on iron reactivity was reported by previous researchers cl could destroy the insulating film on fe0 surface enhancing the release of iron from fe0 the comprehensive effect of the three ions promoted iron reactivity as indicated by the enhanced smt removal in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems oh radical would react with anions to produce less reactive radicals rm pan et al 2018b ha imposed both positive and negative impacts on the efficiency of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system the adherence of ha prevented the iron oxide formation on fe0 surface and thus promote iron release from the particle moreover the ligand effect of ha would keep released iron ion soluble by forming a complex with the ion the complexes formed between fe3 and nom absorbed light uv visible to produce fe2 and a ligand radical nom giannakis et al 2015 the light shield impact of nom would decrease the light for h2o2 decomposition and uv fenton process nom as an organic ligand also consumed oh reducing the amount of oh for smt degradation smt could be degraded by direct uv irradiation rm radical ligand radical nom and oh radical generated during h2o2 decomposition under uv irradiation and in the reaction of iron with h2o2 the faster corrosion rate of pre fe0 led to higher amount of oh radical generation in the reaction of iron with h2o2 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system moreover fe3 generated via the fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 could be reduced to fe2 by uv irradiation lópez et al 2017 3 6 applicability of uv pre fe0 h2o2 for antibiotics removal in swe 3 6 1 performance of uv pre fe0 h2o2 in swe four antibiotics 800 μgl 1 otc 800 μgl 1 tc 400 μgl 1 sd and 400 μgl 1 smt were spiked into the secondary wastewater effluent the wastewater quality parameters are shown in table s1 which then were treated by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process as shown in fig s3 the potential of fe0 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system 0 69 v was lower than that in both pre fe0 h2o2 0 63 v and uv fe0 h2o2 systems 0 66 v indicating that pre fe0 could keep faster corrosion rate in swe under uv irradiation meanwhile more total fe 38 6 μm and oh radicals 40 5 μm could be generated in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system than in both pre fe0 h2o2 8 7 μm fe and 11 4 μm oh and uv fe0 h2o2 systems 21 4 μm fe and 28 3 μm oh for antibotic removal in swe fig 7 a and fig 7b as shown in fig s4a fig s4e less than 5 and 10 were removed within 60 min and marginal toc were removed of the swe within 6 h fig s4f by fe0 h2o2 and pre fe0 h2o2 process 60 antibiotics could be removed within 60 min under uv irradiation alone indicating that direct photolysis of these antibiotics 19 3 toc could be removed within 6 h via the only direct photolysis in the uv h2o2 system antibiotics could not only removed by direct photolysis but oh radicals produced by the photolysis of h2o2 65 7 97 2 antibiotics could be removed within 60 min and 34 1 toc could be removed within 6 h in uv fe0 h2o2 system fe2 generated in the system could also catalyze h2o2 to produce oh radicals to remove antibiotics 85 2 99 4 antibiotics could be removed within 60 min and 43 8 toc could be removed within 6 h more fe2 could be generated in the system to catalyze h2o2 faster then produced more oh radicals while substituting fe0 with pre fe0 antibiotics except sd could be completely removed within 30 min and 98 8 sd was removed within 60 min and 54 6 toc could be removed within 6 h in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system these results indicated that uv irradiation could exhibit better synergistic effect on pre fe0 h2o2 than that on fe0 h2o2 in swe as shown in fig 7c values of k app 103 in uv h2o2 system tc 54 3 min 1 otc 58 9 min 1 sd 18 6 min 1 smt 29 0 min 1 were also much lower than those in uv fe0 h2o2 tc 63 7 min 1 otc 91 5 min 1 sd 27 7 min 1 and smt 42 8 min 1 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems tc 140 4 min 1 otc 200 4 min 1 sd 72 7 min 1 and smt 131 9 min 1 degradation rate of the sulfonamide class was lower than that of the tetracycline class in all these systems indicating that sulfonamide class was difficult to remove the value f m in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process was 3 0 3 2 2 0 and 2 2 for the removal of smt sd tc and otc respectively suggesting the superiority of the approach for removing the sulfonamide class moreover sf values for the removal of various antibiotics were 2 1 3 5 and 6 1 8 3 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively confirming the better synergetic effect in the latter system for swe an economic analysis using ee o concept was performed to clarify the economical efficiency of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process ee o is defined as the electric energy in kwh required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude in 1 m3 of water it includes the electrical energy consumption of uv lamp ee ouv and chemical consumption of oxidants and can be determined according to eq 17 xiao et al 2016 17 e e o 1000 p t 60 v 1 og c 0 c t 38 38 p v k where p represents the total electric power supplied to the system kw t refers to the reaction time min v is the solution volume l c0 and ct represent the pollutant concentration at reaction time 0 and t respectively mg l 1 and k defines the pseudo first order reaction kinetic constant for the pollutant degradation min 1 thus ee o for uv process uv h2o2 process and uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could be calculated via eqs 18 20 18 e e o u v 38 38 p u v v k uv 19 e e o u v h 2 o 2 38 38 p u v v k uv h 2 o 2 r 1 h 2 o 2 1000 20 e e o u v pre f e 0 h 2 o 2 38 38 p u v v k uv pre fe 0 h 2 o 2 r 1 h 2 o 2 1000 r 2 f e 0 1000 where ee ouv ee ouv h2o2 and ee ouv pre fe0 h2o2 are the ee os kwh m 3 for uv irradiation uv h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 processes respectively puv is power of uv lamp kw r 1 refers to the energy requirement for h2o2 mg l 1 production 10 kwh kg h2o2 1 de la cruz et al 2012 and r 2 is the energy requirement for fe0 mg l 1 production 6 kwh kg fe0 1 liu et al 2016 the values of ee o in uv uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems were calculated as shown in fig 7d and fig s5 energy for uv irradiation was accounting for the majority energy consumption in all these processes dosage of fe0 and h2o2 increased the consumption of oxidants while largely enhanced the contaminant degradation rate as a result it reduced the energy consumption of uv irradiation needed and thus reduced the total energy consumption for treatment of the antibiotics the costs are taking into account only the operating cost uv irradiation alone was the most expensive approach followed by uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems ee o values were 16 6 27 7 4 0 12 5 2 7 8 5 and 1 3 3 4 kwh m 3 for uv irradiation uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 process respectively energy consumption could reduce 50 68 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system compared with the uv fe0 h2o2 system in summary the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could not only enhance the antibiotic degradation rates by 2 0 3 2 times but also reduce 52 60 operating costs in swe 3 6 2 optimization of uv pre fe0 h2o2 process for antibiotics removal 3 6 2 1 h2o2 dosage in photo fenton system h2o2 dose is a major factor that can significantly influence the degradation rate kusic et al 2006 therefore the efficiency and energy consumption of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system at different h2o2 concentrations 0 2 4 mm in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system were investigated as shown in fig s6 the degradation of the antibiotics increased with the increase of h2o2 from 0 to 1 2 mm the value of k app 103 for the removal of otc tc sd smt and c increased from 27 9 31 4 17 4 21 3 and 25 3 min 1 at 0 mm h2o2 to 586 2 723 3 203 6 312 5 and 288 6 min 1 at 1 2 mm h2o2 while slightly decreased to 411 1 586 4 168 6 245 8 and 214 6 min 1 at 2 4 mm h2o2 respectively fig 8 a the increase of k app values at h2o2 of 0 1 2 mm might be due to that improved h2o2 dose could enhance the absorption of uv photons and the reaction between fe2 and h2o2 resulting in more oh radical generation while the decrease was probably because of the self decomposition eq 21 and self scavenging effect of oh eq 22 moreover excessive h2o2 could react with oh radical to produce less reactive ho2 radical eq 23 delavaran shiraz et al 2018 21 oh h o 22 oh oh h2o2 23 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 meanwhile as shown in fig 8b and fig s7 ee o values for the removal of individual antibiotics at different h2o2 dose were compared because the value of k app increased with the increase of h2o2 concentration energy consumption for uv irradiation reduced significantly with the increase of h2o2 the lowest ee o for the removal of otc and sd were obtained at 1 2 mm h2o2 and the values were 0 91 and 1 65 kwh m 3 respectively the lowest ee o values for the removal of tc 0 77 kwh m 3 smt 1 21 kwh m 3 and c 1 22 kwh m 3 were obtained at 0 6 mm h2o2 close to the values obtained at 1 2 mm h2o2 while the values of k app at 1 2 mm were quite larger than that at 0 6 mm suggesting the optimal h2o2 dose for the antibiotic removal of 1 2 mm 3 6 2 2 fe0 dosage fe0 as a resource of ferrous irons plays an important role in the performance of fe0 based fenton oxidation gomathi devi et al 2009 2016 therefore the efficiency and energy consumption of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system at different fe0 concentration 0 1 2 mm were investigated as shown in fig s8 the degradation of antibiotics increased with the increase of fe0 dosage from 0 to 0 6 mm the values of k app 103 for the removal of otc tc sd smt and c increased from 54 3 58 7 18 6 29 1 and 38 6 min 1 at 0 mm fe0 to 178 2 262 5 104 8 166 2 and 157 5 min 1 at 0 6 mm fe0 while slightly decreased to 163 4 236 5 99 2 161 4 and 151 8 min 1 at 1 2 mm fe0 respectively fig 8c enhanced values of k app can be attributed to the improved catalysis rate of h2o2 in the presence of larger amount of fe2 ions the decrease of the values of k app with the addition of excessive fe0 can be ascribed to two reasons 1 scavenging effect of fe2 on oh radical via eq 24 pan et al 2016 and 2 the generation of aggregates and subsequent self binding of iron particles at higher dosages reducing the active sites of the catalyst the values of ee o for the removal of various antibiotics at different fe0 concentrations were calculated as shown in fig 8d and fig s9 with increasing fe0 dose ee o values reduced from 4 0 to 12 5 kwh m 3 at 0 mm fe0 to 1 2 2 5 kwh m 3 at 0 6 mm fe0 but increased to 1 5 2 8 kwh m 3 at 1 2 mm fe0 because of the enhanced oxidant consumption and the inhibited degradation rate leading to higher electrical consumption therefore the optimal fe0 dosage to remove antibiotics were at 0 6 mm 24 fe2 oh fe3 oh 3 6 2 3 initial ph the ph of the aqueous reaction medium is a crucial operating parameter in photo fenton reactions ph directly affects the catalytic performance of fe0 and the extent of iron leaching therefore the efficiency and energy consumption of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system at different initial ph 3 9 were investigated as shown in fig s10 the degradation of antibiotics decreased with the increase of initial ph from 3 to 9 the values of k app 103 for the removal of antibiotics decreased from 188 4 to 378 2 min 1 at ph 3 to 147 9 301 0 108 3 217 3 72 7 200 4 and 49 9 138 8 min 1 at ph 4 5 7 3 and 9 respectively fig 8e decreased values of k app at high ph might be because of the low fe0 corrosion rate at such phs as shown in fig s11 total dissolved fe0 at ph 3 decreased within 60 min from 96 8 μm to 71 5 50 3 38 6 and 20 8 μm at ph 4 5 7 3 and 9 respectively low fe0 corrosion rate would inhibit the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process meanwhile low values of k app at alkaline ph were also attributed to the high self decomposition rate of h2o2 lin et al 2016 and low redox potential of oh h2o zhang et al 2016 the values of ee o for the removal of various antibiotics at different initial ph were also calculated as shown in fig 8f and fig s12 ee o values decreased from 0 9 to 1 6 kwh m 3 at initial ph 3 to 1 0 1 9 1 2 2 5 1 3 3 4 and 2 0 4 9 kwh m 3 at ph 4 5 7 3 and 9 respectively although degradation rate to remove antibiotics was faster at ph 3 regarding other reagents consumption uv pre fe0 h2o2 process operating costs at ph 3 includes h2so4 0 4 l m 3 1 5 kwh l 1 and naoh 0 6 kg m 3 1 7 kwh kg 1 required for ph adjustments to 3 and 7 before and after the treatment respectively thus the energy consumption for ph adjustment was about 1 6 kwh m 3 which would largely increase the ee o value while substitute fe0 with pre fe0 could enhance the fe0 corrosion rate at neutral ph uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could enhance the antibiotic degradation rates by 2 0 3 2 times and reduce 52 60 ee o at neutral ph ee o value in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system to remove c in swe at neutral ph 2 2 kwh m 3 was also much lower than at ph 3 2 9 kwh m 3 1 3 1 6 therefore our uv pre fe0 h2o2 process is meaningful to remove antibiotics at neutral condition in swe 3 6 2 4 reusability of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system owing to the dissolved fe could be detected and both fe0 and h2o2 were not consumed within 60 min continuous antibiotics treatment in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was investigated with 2 4 mg l 1 antibiotics added every 30 min and 0 3 mm h2o2 added at 60 min and 150 min as shown in fig 9 a and fig s13 antibiotic could be completely removed in 8 runs and the values of k app 103 for antibiotic removal only decreased slightly in the second run 118 2 334 6 min 1 compared with the first run 135 2 367 4 min 1 fig 9b values of k app 103 in 3 8 runs 230 4 345 6 min 1 for c removal were much larger than that in the first run 200 7 min 1 the results were attributed to higher dissolved fe in 3 8 runs fig 9c which could faster catalyze h2o2 decomposition to generate more oh radicals fig 9d therefore the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system maintains a rapid removal of antibiotics in 8 consecutive runs with h2o2 added twice which indicated the advantage for industrial use 3 7 comparison of antibiotics degradation by different processes the optimized conditions to remove antibiotics in our present work were at 0 1 mm fe0 and 0 6 mm h2o2 dosage and the corresponding ee o value was 1 22 kwh m 3 meanwhile the operating costs to remove these antibiotics by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process were calculated the operating costs based on the active substances industrial grade prices were provided as h2o2 0 45 usd l 1 fe0 0 5 usd kg 1 and electricity 0 07 usd kwh 1 prieto rodriguez et al 2013 and for 90 removal of these antibiotics the operating cost was only 0 1 usd m 3 compared with ultrasound based us processes energy consumption of the uv based processes was much lower for the removal of antibiotics yin et al 2018 as shown in table 2 the degradation rate 103 of 20 mg l 1 sd 12 4 min 1 in the us fe0 ps process with an ee o of 185 7 kwh m 3 zhou et al 2016 and the degradation rate 103 of 5 mg l 1 smt was 15 2 min 1 in us smt system with an ee o of 1510 kwh m 3 yin et al 2018 degradation rates to remove antibiotics by us based processes were much lower than uv pre fe0 h2o2 process 288 6 min 1 while the ee o value was much higher than uv pre fe0 h2o2 process 1 22 kwhm 3 meanwhile 90 various antibiotics 2 mg l 1 in swe removed by 9 5 mg l 1 ozonation at ph 7 was needed 30 min and the operating cost was 0 22 usd m 3 prieto rodriguez et al 2013 however 90 various antibiotics removed was only needed 10 min by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process and the operating cost was only 0 1 usd m 3 moreover compared with other uv based processes uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could also enhance the degradation rates and reduce a lot of operating costs degradation rate 103 to remove 4 mg l 1 tc by vuv uv fe3 was only 14 7 min 1 and the ee o value was 2 17 kwh m 3 yao et al 2017 90 antibiotics 1 mg l 1 in municipal wastewater could be removed by uv fe2 pds process with 10 min but the operating cost was 0 23 usd m 3 which was much higher than that in our present work 0 1 usd m 3 miralles cuevas et al 2017 1 μm sd stz sm1 siz smt smp smm and sdm in the swe removed by uv h2o2 process ee o value was 3 2 kwhm 3 and value of k app 103 was 128 4 min 1 which was similar with our results uv h2o2 but also much lower than uv pre fe0 h2o2 process zhang et al 2016 the removal of 2 5 mg l 1400 μgl 1 dfa gbz bfa ibf cbf and 100 μgl 1 p cba by electro peroxone process was also proved not cost effective than ours yao et al 2016 therefore uv pre fe0 h2o2 process not only could enhance the degradation rate but also could reduce the operating costs to remove various antibiotics compared with o3 uv fe2 pds vuv uv fe2 and other us based processes the above results indicate that the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process may be promising for wastewater treatment by simply substituting conventional fe0 with pre fe0 uv h2o2 or uv fe0 h2o2 systems can be conveniently adapted into the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process requiring little upgrade work and costs it also indicate that the pre fe0 can be good catalysts for wastewater treatment by the processes with h2o2 generated or external h2o2 or ps reagent added for example electro uv h2o2 electro peroxone and uv ps processes and etc these results suggest that uv pre fe0 h2o2 process may have wide and promising potentials in water and wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the findings of this research showed that the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process had great potential for cost effective removal of antibiotics uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could effectively remove smt and enhance 1 8 times of smt removal uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could also have outstanding mineralization capabilities 53 9 and 72 1 toc could be removed in uv h2o2 and uv fe0 h2o2 system while the toc removal could increase to 92 1 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system better synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system was observed in the presence of both ions and nom values of sf for the removal of various antibiotics were 6 1 8 3 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system while only 2 1 3 5 in the uv fe0 h2o2 system meanwhile uv pre fe0 h2o2 process was verified to be efficient to remove various antibiotics in real swe it could enhance the antibiotic degradation rates by 2 0 3 2 times and reduce 52 60 operating costs compared with uv fe0 h2o2 process 0 6 mm fe0 and 1 2 mm h2o2 as the optimal dosage in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system compared with o3 uv fe2 pds vuv uv fe2 and other us based processes uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could also enhance the degradation rate and reduce operating costs to remove various antibiotics therefore this process is promising

19009,antibiotics have been frequently detected in the aquatic environment and are of emerging concern due to their adverse effect and potential of inducing antibiotic resistance in this study we developed an uv pre magnetized fe0 h2o2 process uv pre fe0 h2o2 valid for neutral ph conditions which could remove sulfamethazine smt completely within only 30 min and enhance 1 8 times of smt removal meanwhile this process demonstrated outstanding mineralization capability with the toc removal of 92 1 while for uv h2o2 and uv fe0 h2o2 system it was 53 9 and 72 1 respectively better synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system was observed and the value of synergetic factor was 6 3 in the presence of both ions and humic acid which was much higher than that in deionized water 4 4 humic acid 5 5 and ions 1 5 moreover the process could efficiently remove various antibiotics 800 μg l 1 oxytetracycline otc 800 μg l 1 tetracycline tc 400 μg l 1 sulfadiazine sd and 400 μg l 1 smt in the secondary wastewater effluent after optimization of fe0 and h2o2 dosage these antibiotics could be removed within 10 min k app 103 288 6 min 1 with a very low treatment cost of 0 1 usd m 3 and the ee o value was only 1 22 kwh m 3 compared with o3 uv fe2 pds vuv uv fe2 and other us based processes the degradation rates by this process could enhance as high as 22 3 folds while the treatment cost or ee o value could reduce greatly therefore uv pre fe0 h2o2 process is promising and cost effective for the treatment of antibiotics in secondary wastewater effluents graphical

secondary wastewater effluents swe their mixtures can have significantly adverse impacts on the aqueous ecosystem and human health yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore a cost effective treatment process is needed to effectively remove these antibiotics from swe before they are discharged into the aquatic environment advanced oxidation processes aops based on the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh as a powerful oxidant can effectively remove antibiotics huang et al 2010 riga et al 2007 wang et al 2005 common aops involve fenton and fenton like process ozonation photochemical and electrochemical oxidation fenton process using safe and environmental friendly reagents of fe2 and h2o2 to produce oh radical via eq 1 has been reported as one of the fastest and most economical aops kourdali et al 2014 however limited ph range 2 3 production of ferric ion fe3 sludge and difficult recycling of fe2 are main drawbacks that restrict the full scale application of fenton process basturk and karatas 2014 meanwhile the presence of ions and natural organic matters nom in wastewater can scavenge oh radicals and thus influence the fenton performance kourdali et al 2014 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh heterogeneous catalysts such as goethite ɑ feooh li et al 2015 hematite ɑ fe2o3 guo et al 2010 magnetite fe3o4 costa et al 2008 zero valent iron zvi fe0 kallel et al 2009 pre magnetized fe0 pre fe0 li et al 2017a pan et al 2017 ɑ fe2o3 tio2 cong et al 2012 fe0 fe3o4 moura et al 2005 and si al ɑ feooh yuan et al 2013 have been used to catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 among these catalysts pre fe0 is a promising substitute for fe2 due to its obvious advantages 1 fe0 is a readily available inexpensive nontoxic moderately strong reducing agent and can generate fe2 via different reactions eqs 2 4 pan et al 2017 and 2 pre fe0 can largely enhance the generation of fe2 for the catalysis of h2o2 thus producing more oh radicals to remove pollutants the h2o2 decomposition in the presence of pre fe0 is much faster than that with conventional fe0 li et al 2017b pan et al 2016 moreover due to the magnetic field gradient force pre fe0 can corrode fast at neutral ph in the presence of anions that widely existed in swe sun et al 2017 2 fe0 o2 2h fe2 h2o 3 fe0 h2o2 2h fe2 2h2o 4 fe0 o2 h2o fe2 2oh ultraviolet uv light irradiation especially uv254 is an established technology for drinking water disinfection and has been increasingly used for wastewater treatment tokumura et al 2006 uv irradiation can degrade organic contaminants via direct photolysis and oh produced by the decomposition of h2o2 through eq 5 bolobajev et al 2016 li et al 2017c santos et al 2015 fe0 is an advantageous material to enhance the performance of photo fenton system uv irradiation can not only accelerate the generation of fe2 via eq 6 but also recycle the fe2 via eqs 7 and 8 and thus enhance the fenton reaction efficiency delavaran shiraz et al 2018 rott et al 2017 tian et al 2017 the uv fe0 h2o2 process exhibits good synergetic effect of uv irradiation with fe0 h2o2 process and has been used to remove various contaminants barndõk et al 2016 santos juanes et al 2017 son et al 2009 while it has not been used to treat antibiotics at neutral condition because of the difficulty in the corrosion of fe0 and precipitation of ferric ions 5 h2o2 hv 2 oh 6 fe0 hv fe2 2e 7 fe3 h2o hv fe2 h oh 8 fe oh 2 hv fe2 oh some investigations showed that uv fe2 h2o2 could exhibit good performance to remove pollutants in wastewater at near neutral ph while containing nom de la cruz et al 2012 because nom such as humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa can complex with ferric ions and keep iron soluble at neutral ph de la cruz et al 2012 giannakis et al 2015 in our previous study it has been proved that pre fe0 h2o2 can substitute fe2 h2o2 to treat different pollutants in salty wastewater because of the fast generation of fe2 pan et al 2018a uv irradiation can also recycle fe2 via eqs 7 and 8 thus can enhance the fenton reaction therefore uv pre fe0 h2o2 process might be a potential process to treat antibiotics in swe herein this novel uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was conducted for the degradation of sulfamethazine and then used to remove two contaminants from tetracycline class oxytetracycline and tetracycline and two from sulfonamide class sulfadiazine and sulfamethazine

the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system 3 investigate applicability of uv pre fe0 h2o2 process to remove antibiotics in swe 4 investigate the efficiency and economical advantages for antibiotics removal by this uv pre fe0 h2o2 system compared with uv fe0 h2o2 system and other aops systems like ozonation 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc sulfadiazine sd sulfamethazine smt and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso were obtained from aladdin china company formic acid methanol and acetonitrile were of hplc grade fe0 powder was purchased from shanghai jinshan company h2o2 was obtained from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co ltd 2 2 sample preparation secondary wastewater effluent was from tianjin china its water quality was shown in table 1 in the supporting information si the concentration of cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 was 258 163 182 and 1 1 mg l 1 in the swe respectively chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc was 106 and 8 3 mg l 1 respectively the background concentrations of otc tc sd and smt in swe were about 100 ng l 1 10 μg l 1 in section 3 5 small amounts of antibiotics were spiked into the swe to achieve an initial concentration of 800 μg l 1 otc and tc and 400 μg l 1 sd and smt c was used to measure the total antibiotics in swe 2 3 experimental procedures fe0 pre magnetization a certain amount of fe0 particles were placed in a glass bottle and magnetized by a static and uniform 200 mt magnetic field mf for 2 min the mf was generated with an electromagnet em3 purchased from east changing technologies inc beijing batch experiments were started by adding fe0 or pre fe0 and h2o2 into 500 ml solution and the mixture was placed on a mechanical stirrer 350 r min 1 and irradiated with a uv lamp gph150t 6 w 254 nm samples 2 5 ml suspension were collected at given time intervals and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm membrane filter then the concentrations of pollutants were analyzed 2 4 analytical methods concentrations

and mobile phase of acetonitrile 0 01 m formic v v 30 70 for sd and smt analysis the mobile phase was methanol water v v 30 70 and wavelength of 265 nm was chosen for detection hydroxyl radicals were trapped with dimethyl sulfoxide dmso hydroxyl radicals were trapped with dimethyl sulfoxide dmso dmso was used as the hydroxyl radical probe because of its high reactivity with hydroxyl radical k 4 5

calculate the concentration of hydroxyl radical zhang et al 2015 kubo and kawase 2018 liu et al 2018 the detection was conducted on a hplc ultimate 3000 with a beh c18 column 1 7 μm ϕ 2 1 100 mm at a flow rate of 0 1 ml min 1 the mobile phase was methanol water v v 60 40 and 355 nm was chosen for detection total organic carbon toc was monitored by a toc analyzer analytikjena multi n c 3100 germany tafel scans were carried out in a 100 ml beaker to determine the free corrosion potentials of fe0 species tafel tests were accomplished with the chi 760e ch instruments chenhua shanghai china potentiostat in a three electrode system polarization curves were obtained in the potential interval of 1 0 v to 0 2 v with 0 01 v s 1 scan rate the pt counter electrode work electrode and calomel electrode were placed into the beaker and the work electrodes were fe0 or pre fe0 species before and after reaction to determine the initial corrosion potential of fe0 species tafel scans were carried out as soon as the work electrode was immersed into the electrolyte solution the degradation efficiency η was calculated via eq 9 9 η c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 mg l 1 and ct mg l 1 were the concentration of various pollutants at time 0 and reaction time t respectively the degradation of various pollutants by uv fe0 h2o2 or uv pre fe0 h2o2 process were fitted by a pseudo first order rate equation eq 10 ration f m was calculated by eq 11 to evaluate the enhancement of the efficiency of uv pre fe0 h2o2 compared with uv fe0 h2o2 10 l n c t c 0 k a p p t 11 f m k app 1 k app 2 where kapp 1 and kapp 2 were the first pseudo first order constant of uv pre fe0 h2o2 and uv fe0 h2o2 process respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 synergistic effect of uv irradiation with pre fe0 h2o2 the removal of smt by fe0 h2o2 pre fe0 h2o2 uv irradiation uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 processes are compared as shown in fig 1 a less than 10 and 20 smt could be removed within 60 min by fe0 h2o2 and pre fe0 h2o2 process under the uv irradiation alone 68 6 smt could be removed within 60 min indicating that direct photolysis of smt occurred the direct photolysis was highly dependent on the molar absorption coefficient of the compound at a certain wavelength de la cruz et al 2012 in uv h2o2 system both direct photolysis and oh radicals produced in h2o2 decomposition under uv irradiation could remove 94 3 smt within 60 min uv fe0 h2o2 could remove 99 4 smt within 60 min while smt could be completely removed within only 30 min by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process the results indicated that uv irradiation exhibited better synergistic effect on pre fe0 h2o2 than that on fe0 h2o2 while combining with the uv irradiation the value of k app 103 in deionized water was improved from 1 9 to 94 1 min 1 in the fe0 h2o2 and from 4 3 to 164 5 min 1 in the pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively fig s1 both values of k app in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems were larger than those in the uv h2o2 system 68 9 min 1 the results indicated the crucial role of fe0 for the antibiotics degradation in both uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems it is because of the recycle of fe2 under uv irradiation via eqs 7 and 8 lópez et al 2017 and the faster decrease of ph induce better fenton performance the decreased ph was primarily ascribed to the hydrolysis of fe3 via eq 12 and the formation of molecule acids during the degradation of smt sopaj et al 2016 as shown in table s1 the ph decreased from 7 to 6 5 5 7 and 4 8 in the uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively meanwhile as shown in fig 1b the concentration of total fe was 40 5 μm in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system which was much higher than that in pre fe0 h2o2 13 4 μm the result was mainly because uv irradiation helped to overcome the activation energy for the oxidation of fe0 son et al 2009 the concentration of total fe in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was also much higher than that in uv fe0 h2o2 system 28 6 μm which might because magnetization based on magnetic memory of iron enhanced the generation of fe2 li et al 2017b as shown in fig 1c only 1 3 μm and 1 9 μm oh was generated within 60 min in fe0 h2o2 and pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively and 34 9 μm oh was generated in uv h2o2 system oh generated in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system increased to 52 2 μm while only increased to 44 4 μm in the uv fe0 h2o2 system the results confirmed the hypothesis that the faster corrosion of pre fe0 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system induced the generation of more oh and thus enhanced the degradation of smt moreover synergetic factors sf were calculated via eq 13 to confirm the better synergetic effect for the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system sf value for the removal of smt was 2 2 and 4 6 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively confirming the better synergetic effect in the latter system 12 fe3 xh2o fe oh x 3 x xh 13 sf k uf k u k f k u k f where sf is the synergetic factor k uf k u and k f are the k app values of uv pre fe0 h2o2 uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 respectively 3 2 effect of inorganic ions and nom on the smt removal the presence of inorganic ions and nom in wastewater effluents may significantly affect the performance of fe0 based aops system we added 300 mg l 1 nacl 400 mg l 1 na2so4 and 150 mg l 1 nahco3 to simulate inorganic ions that presented similar concentrations in real swe nom could be a competitor to smt for oh radical and it absorbs uv light thus decreasing the direct uv photolysis of smt and the light intensity for fe related reactions we added 30 mg l 1 ha to simulate nom as shown in fig 2 a the removal of smt decreased in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ha compared with fig 1a such as that the value of k app 103 decreased from 68 9 94 1 and 164 5 min 1 to 27 9 45 2 and 98 2 min 1 in the uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems respectively fig 2d as shown in fig s2 in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ha total fe increased from 40 5 to 57 3 μm promoting the h2o2 decomposition in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system the results might be due to that the presence of nom could complex fe3 to prevent iron precipitation at neutral ph conditions inducing more significant fenton reaction uv fe2 h2o2 which were consistent with previous reports wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 zhang and zhou 2019 the role of pre fe0 for the antibiotics degradation in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was more significant in the presence of ha than that in the absence of ha as shown in fig 2e values of sf increased from 2 2 to 2 5 in uv fe0 h2o2 and from 4 6 to 5 5 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems indicating more significant synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system in the presence of ha as shown in fig 2b the removal of smt increased slightly in both uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems in the presence of 400 mg l 1 na2so4 300 mg l 1 nacl and 150 mg l 1 nahco3 compared with uv h2o2 system ph was almost unchanged in these systems in the presence of these ions mainly because hco3 could consume both h and oh via eq 14 and 15 thus keeping the stability of ph pan et al 2018b iron ion would precipitate under the neutral condition therefore no significant enhancement in both uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems compared with uv h2o2 system the sf value was only 0 8 and 1 5 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively hco3 was able to accelerate fe0 corrosion following eq 16 agrawal et al 2002 schmitt 1984 wiȩckowski et al 1983 the conjugate ion of hco3 co3 2 might inhibit iron ion release from fe0 by forming iron compounds and an insulating film on fe0 surface devlin and allin 2005 the influence of so4 2 on iron reactivity in the previous reports was contradictory some researchers insisted of the promoting effect of so4 2 on iron reactivity lipczynskakochany et al 1994 while the others declared of no influence farrell et al 2000 the presence of cl would destroy the insulating film on fe0 surface and thus promoted the reactivity of iron the comprehensive effect of the three ions on iron reactivity resulted in the enhanced smt removal in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems 14 hco3 h co2 h2o 15 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 16 2hco3 fe0 2co3 2 h2 fe2 as shown in fig 2c in the presence of both ions and ha the role of pre fe0 or fe0 was more significant value of k app 103 increased from 22 2 min 1 uv h2o2 to 43 9 min 1 uv fe0 h2o2 and 90 4 min 1 uv pre fe0 h2o2 ha and hco3 were both reported to occupy the sorption sites on fe0 and form inner sphere complexes on the surface of the particle therefore the presence of hco3 would compete with ha for the sites on fe0 reducing the adsorption of ha on the particle giasuddin et al 2007 the value f m was 2 1 in the presence of both ions and ha which was larger than that in deionized water 1 8 this might be because pre fe0 corroded faster at salty condition due to the magnetic memory and the generation of fe2 by the magnetic field pan et al 2018a being pulled by the magnetic field gradient force from pre fe0 fe2 generated by fe0 corrosion tended to move along the magnetic lines to the place with higher magnetic field flux intensity thereby inducing uneven distribution of fe2 and eventually enhancing the generation of fe2 the value of sf was 3 1 and 6 3 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively which were also much higher than those in deionized water in the presence of ha and ions the results indicated that better synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system while in the presence of both ions and nom 3 3 effect of inorganic ions and nom on pre fe0 corrosion the fe0 corrosion rate is one of the most important factors that determines the performance of the fe0 based photo fenton system faster fe0 corrosion can induce better photo fenton performance the electron transfer in the fe0 related reactions as a reflection of the fe0 corrosion was related to the oxidation status of the iron core which can be reflected by its free corrosion potential the more negative the free corrosion potential is the faster the electron transfer will be mu et al 2017 malgorzata et al 2019 therefore the free corrosion potential in tafel polarization diagrams was measured in our study to clarify the fe0 corrosion characteristics as shown in fig 3 a the potential of pre fe0 at the beginning of the reaction in di water was 0 67 v potentials of pre fe0 0 66 v 0 65 v 0 63 v and 0 63 v after 10 20 30 and 60 min reaction in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system indicating decrease of fe0 corrosion rate with the reaction decreased fe0 corrosion rate was because iron oxides generated during the reaction laid on the pre fe0 surface mu et al 2017 as shown in fig 3b the potential of pre fe0 at the beginning was 0 72 v in the presence of salts which was more negative than in di water 0 67 v showing the faster pre fe0 corrosion rate in the presence of ions which might because negatively charged anions would move together with fe2 to keep local charge balance in salty system fujiwara et al 2004 thus a high anions concentration would accelerate the generation of fe2 faster fe0 corrosion rate would induce more iron oxides generated laying on pre fe0 sufrace which would inhibit the pre fe0 corrosion fig 3b depicted that potential of pre fe0 decreased faster during the reaction and only 0 58 v after the 60 min reaction the results indicated that pre fe0 would be largely inhibited during the reaction the potential of pre fe0 at the beginning was 0 65 v in the presence of nom which was slightly less negative than that in di water 0 67 v fig 3c the results were because nom adsorbed on pre fe0 surface would hinder the pre fe0 corrosion whille the potential of pre fe0 decreased slightly during the reaction the results might be because the presence of nom prevented the formation of iron oxides on the pre fe0 surface that retarded the corrosion thus promoting fe2 release from fe0 during the reaction giasuddin et al 2007 while in the presence of both salts and nom the potential of pre fe0 0 72 v at the beginning was more negative fig 3d meanwhile potentials of pre fe0 decreased slightly during the reaction indicating that pre fe0 could keep the faster corrosion rate during the whole reaction therefore pre fe0 could keep better corrosion rate in swe which contains both salts and nom 3 4 comparison of the mineralization efficiency the complete removal of organic pollutants from wastewater is of high importance because they have various adverse effects on the environment the oxidation or partial mineralization of organic pollutants during an aop treatment can lead to the formation of intermediates even more toxic than the initial pollutant accordingly the oxidative degradation of the persistent toxic chemicals must continue unto the quasi complete mineralization of the treated solution therefore the removal of toc was compared in different systems as shown in fig 4 a fe0 h2o2 pre fe0 h2o2 and uv irradiation could not efficiently mineralize smt because the toc removal was 6 4 10 8 and 34 7 within 360 min in these three systems respectively 53 9 and 72 1 toc could be removed in uv h2o2 and uv fe0 h2o2 system while the toc removal could increase to 92 1 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system therefore not only the fast removal of smt but also a deep mineralization was achieved in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system short chain carboxylic acids are the low molecular weight organic species formed before complete mineralization i e transformation to co2 and h2o of organic pollutants during aops fig 4b d shows the formation and evolution of different carboxylic acids generated during the degradation of smt in uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively five carboxylic acids namely glyoxylic maleic fumaric formic and succinic acids were identified and quantified malonic and fumaric acids were detected at trace level in the three systems these acids were generated and accumulated in the medium up to maximum values which was peaked at different times in these three systems glyoxylic formic and succinic acids reached the maximum concentrations at about 180 min in uv h2o2 system while at 120 min in uv fe0 h2o2 system glyoxylic acid 180 min and only 60 min in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system it then mineralized within 360 min in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system while carboxylic acids still remained relatively high concentrations in uv fe0 h2o2 and uv h2o2 systems these results pointed out again the outstanding mineralization capability of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process moreover intermediates formed in the removal of smt were analyzed by gc ms as shown in table s2 sulfanilamide m z 172 sulfanilic acid m z 173 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine m z 123 4 aminophenol m z 109 and hydroquinone m z 110 were detected some short chain carboxylic acids such as glyoxylic maleic fumaric formic and succinic acids were also detected in hplc the possible pathway of smt degradation is shown in fig 5 the s n bond in sulfamethazine can be oxidized by oh radical to form 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine and sulfanilamide sulfanilamide will be converted to sulfanilic acid by hydroxylation sulfanilic acid will be further oxidized to 4 aminophenol which then can be converted to hydroquinone by hydroxylation the hydroquinone and 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine can also be further decomposed by oh oxidation then formed short chain carboxylic acids and finally co2 and h2o 3 5 mechanism of uv pre fe0 h2o2 process in the presence of nom and anions the possible mechanisms of uv pre fe0 h2o2 system for the removal of antibiotics at neutral ph are presented in fig 6 the corrosion of fe0 would be enhanced by the magnetization based on the magnetic memory of iron paramagnetic ions especially fe2 generated during the corrosion of fe0 tend to move along the magnetic lines to where higher magnetic field flux intensity exists resulting in uneven distribution of fe2 the flow of fe2 driven by magnetic field gradient force can induce a secondary flow of coexisting anions which then in turn accelerate the generation of fe2 pan et al 2018b the coexistence of anions might impose contrary influences on iron reactivity hco3 can promote iron release from fe0 by behaving as an oxidant co3 2 the conjugate ion of hco3 would probably inhibit the reactivity of iron by forming iron compounds and an insulating film on fe0 surface promoting effect or no effect of so4 2 on iron reactivity was reported by previous researchers cl could destroy the insulating film on fe0 surface enhancing the release of iron from fe0 the comprehensive effect of the three ions promoted iron reactivity as indicated by the enhanced smt removal in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems oh radical would react with anions to produce less reactive radicals rm pan et al 2018b ha imposed both positive and negative impacts on the efficiency of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system the adherence of ha prevented the iron oxide formation on fe0 surface and thus promote iron release from the particle moreover the ligand effect of ha would keep released iron ion soluble by forming a complex with the ion the complexes formed between fe3 and nom absorbed light uv visible to produce fe2 and a ligand radical nom giannakis et al 2015 the light shield impact of nom would decrease the light for h2o2 decomposition and uv fenton process nom as an organic ligand also consumed oh reducing the amount of oh for smt degradation smt could be degraded by direct uv irradiation rm radical ligand radical nom and oh radical generated during h2o2 decomposition under uv irradiation and in the reaction of iron with h2o2 the faster corrosion rate of pre fe0 led to higher amount of oh radical generation in the reaction of iron with h2o2 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system moreover fe3 generated via the fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 could be reduced to fe2 by uv irradiation lópez et al 2017 3 6 applicability of uv pre fe0 h2o2 for antibiotics removal in swe 3 6 1 performance of uv pre fe0 h2o2 in swe four antibiotics 800 μgl 1 otc 800 μgl 1 tc 400 μgl 1 sd and 400 μgl 1 smt were spiked into the secondary wastewater effluent the wastewater quality parameters are shown in table s1 which then were treated by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process as shown in fig s3 the potential of fe0 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system 0 69 v was lower than that in both pre fe0 h2o2 0 63 v and uv fe0 h2o2 systems 0 66 v indicating that pre fe0 could keep faster corrosion rate in swe under uv irradiation meanwhile more total fe 38 6 μm and oh radicals 40 5 μm could be generated in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system than in both pre fe0 h2o2 8 7 μm fe and 11 4 μm oh and uv fe0 h2o2 systems 21 4 μm fe and 28 3 μm oh for antibotic removal in swe fig 7 a and fig 7b as shown in fig s4a fig s4e less than 5 and 10 were removed within 60 min and marginal toc were removed of the swe within 6 h fig s4f by fe0 h2o2 and pre fe0 h2o2 process 60 antibiotics could be removed within 60 min under uv irradiation alone indicating that direct photolysis of these antibiotics 19 3 toc could be removed within 6 h via the only direct photolysis in the uv h2o2 system antibiotics could not only removed by direct photolysis but oh radicals produced by the photolysis of h2o2 65 7 97 2 antibiotics could be removed within 60 min and 34 1 toc could be removed within 6 h in uv fe0 h2o2 system fe2 generated in the system could also catalyze h2o2 to produce oh radicals to remove antibiotics 85 2 99 4 antibiotics could be removed within 60 min and 43 8 toc could be removed within 6 h more fe2 could be generated in the system to catalyze h2o2 faster then produced more oh radicals while substituting fe0 with pre fe0 antibiotics except sd could be completely removed within 30 min and 98 8 sd was removed within 60 min and 54 6 toc could be removed within 6 h in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system these results indicated that uv irradiation could exhibit better synergistic effect on pre fe0 h2o2 than that on fe0 h2o2 in swe as shown in fig 7c values of k app 103 in uv h2o2 system tc 54 3 min 1 otc 58 9 min 1 sd 18 6 min 1 smt 29 0 min 1 were also much lower than those in uv fe0 h2o2 tc 63 7 min 1 otc 91 5 min 1 sd 27 7 min 1 and smt 42 8 min 1 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems tc 140 4 min 1 otc 200 4 min 1 sd 72 7 min 1 and smt 131 9 min 1 degradation rate of the sulfonamide class was lower than that of the tetracycline class in all these systems indicating that sulfonamide class was difficult to remove the value f m in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process was 3 0 3 2 2 0 and 2 2 for the removal of smt sd tc and otc respectively suggesting the superiority of the approach for removing the sulfonamide class moreover sf values for the removal of various antibiotics were 2 1 3 5 and 6 1 8 3 in the uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 system respectively confirming the better synergetic effect in the latter system for swe an economic analysis using ee o concept was performed to clarify the economical efficiency of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process ee o is defined as the electric energy in kwh required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude in 1 m3 of water it includes the electrical energy consumption of uv lamp ee ouv and chemical consumption of oxidants and can be determined according to eq 17 xiao et al 2016 17

respectively puv is power of uv lamp kw r 1 refers to the energy requirement for h2o2 mg l 1 production 10 kwh kg h2o2 1 de la cruz et al 2012 and r 2 is the energy requirement for fe0 mg l 1 production 6 kwh kg fe0 1 liu et al 2016 the values of ee o in uv uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems were calculated as shown in fig 7d and fig s5 energy for uv irradiation was accounting for the majority energy consumption in all these processes dosage of fe0 and h2o2 increased the consumption of oxidants while largely enhanced the contaminant degradation rate as a result it reduced the energy consumption of uv irradiation needed and thus reduced the total energy consumption for treatment of the antibiotics the costs are taking into account only the operating cost uv irradiation alone was the most expensive approach followed by uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 systems ee o values were 16 6 27 7 4 0 12 5 2 7 8 5 and 1 3 3 4 kwh m 3 for uv irradiation uv h2o2 uv fe0 h2o2 and uv pre fe0 h2o2 process respectively energy consumption could reduce 50 68 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system compared with the uv fe0 h2o2 system in summary the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could not only enhance the antibiotic degradation rates by 2 0 3 2 times but also reduce 52 60 operating costs in swe 3 6 2 optimization of uv pre fe0 h2o2 process for antibiotics removal 3 6 2 1 h2o2 dosage in photo fenton system h2o2 dose is a major factor that can significantly influence the degradation rate kusic et al 2006 therefore the efficiency and energy consumption of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system at different h2o2 concentrations 0 2 4 mm in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system were investigated as shown in fig s6 the degradation of the antibiotics increased with the increase of h2o2 from 0 to 1 2 mm the value of k app 103 for the removal of otc tc sd smt and c increased from 27 9 31 4 17 4 21 3 and 25 3 min 1 at 0 mm h2o2 to 586 2 723 3 203 6 312 5 and 288 6 min 1 at 1 2 mm h2o2 while slightly decreased to 411 1 586 4 168 6 245 8 and 214 6 min 1 at 2 4 mm h2o2 respectively fig 8 a the increase of k app values at h2o2 of 0 1 2 mm might be due to that improved h2o2 dose could enhance the absorption of uv photons and the reaction between fe2 and h2o2 resulting in more oh radical generation while the decrease was probably because of the self decomposition eq 21 and self scavenging effect of oh eq 22 moreover excessive h2o2 could react with oh radical to produce less reactive ho2 radical eq 23 delavaran shiraz et al 2018 21 oh h o 22 oh oh h2o2 23 oh h2o2 h2o ho2 meanwhile as shown in fig 8b and fig s7 ee o values for the removal of individual antibiotics at different h2o2 dose were compared because the value of k app increased with the increase of h2o2 concentration energy consumption for uv irradiation reduced significantly with the increase of h2o2 the lowest ee o for the removal of otc and sd were obtained at 1 2 mm h2o2 and the values were 0 91 and 1 65 kwh m 3 respectively the lowest ee o values for the removal of tc 0 77 kwh m 3 smt 1 21 kwh m 3 and c 1 22 kwh m 3 were obtained at 0 6 mm h2o2 close to the values obtained at 1 2 mm h2o2 while the values of k app at 1 2 mm were quite larger than that at 0 6 mm suggesting the optimal h2o2 dose for the antibiotic removal of 1 2 mm 3 6 2 2 fe0 dosage fe0 as a resource of ferrous irons plays an important role in the performance of fe0 based fenton oxidation gomathi devi et al 2009 2016 therefore the efficiency and energy consumption of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system at different fe0 concentration 0 1 2 mm were investigated as shown in fig s8 the degradation of antibiotics increased with the increase of fe0 dosage from 0 to 0 6 mm the values of k app 103 for the removal of otc tc sd smt and c increased from 54 3 58 7 18 6 29 1 and 38 6 min 1 at 0 mm fe0 to 178 2 262 5 104 8 166 2 and 157 5 min 1 at 0 6 mm fe0 while slightly decreased to 163 4 236 5 99 2 161 4 and 151 8 min 1 at 1 2 mm fe0 respectively fig 8c enhanced values of k app can be attributed to the improved catalysis rate of h2o2 in the presence of larger amount of fe2 ions the decrease of the values of k app with the addition of excessive fe0 can be ascribed to two reasons 1 scavenging effect of fe2 on oh radical via eq 24 pan et al 2016 and 2 the generation of aggregates and subsequent self binding of iron particles at higher dosages reducing the active sites of the catalyst the values of ee o for the removal of various antibiotics at different fe0 concentrations were calculated as shown in fig 8d and fig s9 with increasing fe0 dose ee o values reduced from 4 0 to 12 5 kwh m 3 at 0 mm fe0 to 1 2 2 5 kwh m 3 at 0 6 mm fe0 but increased to 1 5 2 8 kwh m 3 at 1 2 mm fe0 because of the enhanced oxidant consumption and the inhibited degradation rate leading to higher electrical consumption therefore the optimal fe0 dosage to remove antibiotics were at 0 6 mm 24 fe2 oh fe3 oh 3 6 2 3 initial ph the ph of the aqueous reaction medium is a crucial operating parameter in photo fenton reactions ph directly affects the catalytic performance of fe0 and the extent of iron leaching therefore the efficiency and energy consumption of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system at different initial ph 3 9 were investigated as shown in fig s10 the degradation of antibiotics decreased with the increase of initial ph from 3 to 9 the values of k app 103 for the removal of antibiotics decreased from 188 4 to 378 2 min 1 at ph 3 to 147 9 301 0 108 3 217 3 72 7 200 4 and 49 9 138 8 min 1 at ph 4 5 7 3 and 9 respectively fig 8e decreased values of k app at high ph might be because of the low fe0 corrosion rate at such phs as shown in fig s11 total dissolved fe0 at ph 3 decreased within 60 min from 96 8 μm to 71 5 50 3 38 6 and 20 8 μm at ph 4 5 7 3 and 9 respectively low fe0 corrosion rate would inhibit the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process meanwhile low values of k app at alkaline ph were also attributed to the high self decomposition rate of h2o2 lin et al 2016 and low redox potential of oh h2o zhang et al 2016 the values of ee o for the removal of various antibiotics at different initial ph were also calculated as shown in fig 8f and fig s12 ee o values decreased from 0 9 to 1 6 kwh m 3 at initial ph 3 to 1 0 1 9 1 2 2 5 1 3 3 4 and 2 0 4 9 kwh m 3 at ph 4 5 7 3 and 9 respectively although degradation rate to remove antibiotics was faster at ph 3 regarding other reagents consumption uv pre fe0 h2o2 process operating costs at ph 3 includes h2so4 0 4 l m 3 1 5 kwh l 1 and naoh 0 6 kg m 3 1 7 kwh kg 1 required for ph adjustments to 3 and 7 before and after the treatment respectively thus the energy consumption for ph adjustment was about 1 6 kwh m 3 which would largely increase the ee o value while substitute fe0 with pre fe0 could enhance the fe0 corrosion rate at neutral ph uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could enhance the antibiotic degradation rates by 2 0 3 2 times and reduce 52 60 ee o at neutral ph ee o value in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system to remove c in swe at neutral ph 2 2 kwh m 3 was also much lower than at ph 3 2 9 kwh m 3 1 3 1 6 therefore our uv pre fe0 h2o2 process is meaningful to remove antibiotics at neutral condition in swe 3 6 2 4 reusability of the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system owing to the dissolved fe could be detected and both fe0 and h2o2 were not consumed within 60 min continuous antibiotics treatment in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system was investigated with 2 4 mg l 1 antibiotics added every 30 min and 0 3 mm h2o2 added at 60 min and 150 min as shown in fig 9 a and fig s13 antibiotic could be completely removed in 8 runs and the values of k app 103 for antibiotic removal only decreased slightly in the second run 118 2 334 6 min 1 compared with the first run 135 2 367 4 min 1 fig 9b values of k app 103 in 3 8 runs 230 4 345 6 min 1 for c removal were much larger than that in the first run 200 7 min 1 the results were attributed to higher dissolved fe in 3 8 runs fig 9c which could faster catalyze h2o2 decomposition to generate more oh radicals fig 9d therefore the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system maintains a rapid removal of antibiotics in 8 consecutive runs with h2o2 added twice which indicated the advantage for industrial use 3 7 comparison of antibiotics degradation by different processes the optimized conditions to remove antibiotics in our present work were at 0 1 mm fe0 and 0 6 mm h2o2 dosage and the corresponding ee o value was 1 22 kwh m 3 meanwhile the operating costs to remove these antibiotics by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process were calculated the operating costs based on the active substances industrial grade prices were provided as h2o2 0 45 usd l 1 fe0 0 5 usd kg 1 and electricity 0 07 usd kwh 1 prieto rodriguez et al 2013 and for 90 removal of these antibiotics the operating cost was only 0 1 usd m 3 compared with ultrasound based us processes energy consumption of the uv based processes was much lower for the removal of antibiotics yin et al 2018 as shown in table 2 the degradation rate 103 of 20 mg l 1 sd 12 4 min 1 in the us fe0 ps process with an ee o of 185 7 kwh m 3 zhou et al 2016 and the degradation rate 103 of 5 mg l 1 smt was 15 2 min 1 in us smt system with an ee o of 1510 kwh m 3 yin et al 2018 degradation rates to remove antibiotics by us based processes were much lower than uv pre fe0 h2o2 process 288 6 min 1 while the ee o value was much higher than uv pre fe0 h2o2 process 1 22 kwhm 3 meanwhile 90 various antibiotics 2 mg l 1 in swe removed by 9 5 mg l 1 ozonation at ph 7 was needed 30 min and the operating cost was 0 22 usd m 3 prieto rodriguez et al 2013 however 90 various antibiotics removed was only needed 10 min by uv pre fe0 h2o2 process and the operating cost was only 0 1 usd m 3 moreover compared with other uv based processes uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could also enhance the degradation rates and reduce a lot of operating costs degradation rate 103 to remove 4 mg l 1 tc by vuv uv fe3 was only 14 7 min 1 and the ee o value was 2 17 kwh m 3 yao et al 2017 90 antibiotics 1 mg l 1 in municipal wastewater could be removed by uv fe2 pds process with 10 min but the operating cost was 0 23 usd m 3 which was much higher than that in our present work 0 1 usd m 3 miralles cuevas et al 2017 1 μm sd stz sm1 siz smt smp smm and sdm in the swe removed by uv h2o2 process ee o value was 3 2 kwhm 3 and value of k app 103 was 128 4 min 1 which was similar with our results uv h2o2 but also much lower than uv pre fe0 h2o2 process zhang et al 2016 the removal of 2 5 mg l 1400 μgl 1 dfa gbz bfa ibf cbf and 100 μgl 1 p cba by electro peroxone process was also proved not cost effective than ours yao et al 2016 therefore uv pre fe0 h2o2 process not only could enhance the degradation rate but also could reduce the operating costs to remove various antibiotics compared with o3 uv fe2 pds vuv uv fe2 and other us based processes the above results indicate that the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process may be promising for wastewater treatment by simply substituting conventional fe0 with pre fe0 uv h2o2 or uv fe0 h2o2 systems can be conveniently adapted into the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process requiring little upgrade work and costs it also indicate that the pre fe0 can be good catalysts for wastewater treatment by the processes with h2o2 generated or external h2o2 or ps reagent added for example electro uv h2o2 electro peroxone and uv ps processes and etc these results suggest that uv pre fe0 h2o2 process may have wide and promising potentials in water and wastewater treatment 4 conclusions the findings of this research showed that the uv pre fe0 h2o2 process had great potential for cost effective removal of antibiotics uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could effectively remove smt and enhance 1 8 times of smt removal uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could also have outstanding mineralization capabilities 53 9 and 72 1 toc could be removed in uv h2o2 and uv fe0 h2o2 system while the toc removal could increase to 92 1 in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system better synergetic effect between uv irradiation and pre fe0 h2o2 system was observed in the presence of both ions and nom values of sf for the removal of various antibiotics were 6 1 8 3 in the uv pre fe0 h2o2 system while only 2 1 3 5 in the uv fe0 h2o2 system meanwhile uv pre fe0 h2o2 process was verified to be efficient to remove various antibiotics in real swe it could enhance the antibiotic degradation rates by 2 0 3 2 times and reduce 52 60 operating costs compared with uv fe0 h2o2 process 0 6 mm fe0 and 1 2 mm h2o2 as the optimal dosage in uv pre fe0 h2o2 system compared with o3 uv fe2 pds vuv uv fe2 and other us based processes uv pre fe0 h2o2 process could also enhance the degradation rate and reduce operating costs to remove various antibiotics therefore this process is promising
