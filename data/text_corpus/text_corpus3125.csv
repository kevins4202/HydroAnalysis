15625,dissolved organic phosphorus dop is a key factor in the water eutrophication process because of its high potential bioavailability and inorganic phosphate pi compensation ability through bio and photo mineralization however the research on the characterization and transformation of dop is insufficient owing to their complex composition this study investigates the release of dissolved pi from dop photo mineralization in lake dong based on fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis the results showed that the photo release of dissolved pi is spatially heterogeneous in lake dong and is consistent with the distribution of dop concentration the ft icr ms results showed that the simulated irradiation decreased the relative abundance ra of the dop molecular formulae with higher molecular weight mw and higher double bond equivalence values dbe while the ra of dop molecular formulae with lower mw and lower dbe value increased or remained besides the total ra of lipid like formulae increased from 49 09 to 55 90 while the oxy aromatic like formulae decreased from 50 91 to 44 10 suggesting that simulated irradiation would influence the potential bioavailability of dop as the main photolysis medium during dop photo mineralization the hydroxyl radicals oh are mainly derived from dissolved organic matter dom compared to the nitrate no3 and iron ion fe3 in lake dong these results are important in understanding the ability and mechanism of dop photo mineralization and provide suggestions for cycling phosphorus in eutrophic shallow lakes

eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is becoming a severe environmental issue phosphorus p is a vital element that influences the lake eutrophication process schindler et al 2008 numerous studies regarding p biogeochemistry mainly focus on the dissolved inorganic phosphate pi because it could be directly utilized by the microorganisms in fresh water however the dissolved organic phosphorus dop reservoir was not considered enough even though its concentration could exceed those of dissolved pi and become a significant component of p pools in some lakes cooper et al 2005 monbet et al 2009 notably the dop has been receiving increasing attention of researchers because of its potential bioavailability and because of the compensation ability of dissolved pi through bio and photo mineralization boyer et al 2006 capone et al 2005 lv et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 hence clearly identifying the characteristics and composition of the dop pool is important to assess the p loading and turnover in shallow lakes in the aquatic system dop comprises two important bond classes ester c o p and carbon phosphorus c p jonasdottir 2019 phosphonates are recalcitrant to degradation because of the presence of the c p bond and phosphor esters compounds could degrade by alkaline phosphatase to release dissolved pi until now most studies focused on the enzyme hydrolysis of dop ni et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 2013 some studies have also provided in situ evidence that a considerable fraction of dop in fresh water can be readily hydrolyzed by microorganisms phytoplankton and zooplanktons dyhrman et al 2006 apart from enzyme hydrolysis release of dissolved pi by reactive oxygen species ros is another feasible pathway for dop photo mineralization zhang et al 2019 reported that the dop in wastewater treatment plants could transform into dissolved pi under uv irradiation this could be an effective pretreatment method for industrial wastewater treatment our previous studies have shown that dop in the resuspended sediment from shallow lakes could release dissolved pi under simulated sunlight irradiation and further determined the content and species of organic phosphorus using sequential extraction and 31p nmr methods guo et al 2020 li et al 2019 2017 however due to the 31p nmr technology is limited by the signal detection limit and low sensitivity to low molecular weight organic compounds it is necessary to further understand dop with an adequate molecular resolution in order to evaluate its role in eutrophic shallow lakes fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is an advanced technique to characterize thousands of molecular formulae in complex organic matters ft icr ms has been widely used to investigate dissolved organic matter dom molecular formulae in freshwater lakes and rivers gonsior et al 2016 johnston et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 with the progressive refinement of the research ft icr ms has been successfully used for dop distribution and transformation analysis kurek et al 2020 analyzed the extraction effectiveness of organic phosphorus in sediments with various extractants and concluded that the nahco3 extraction afforded the most assigned organic phosphorus by ft icr ms from a purely qualitative perspective meanwhile kurek et al 2021 explored the dop molecular formula compositions in lake champlain in all seasons and clarified the changing of dop molecular formulae in redox dynamic freshwater ni et al 2021 conducted the distribution and characteristics of water extractable organic phosphorus in the different nutrient levels of lakes with ft icr ms technology and further confirmed the high bioavailability of organic phosphorus in lakes sediment from new sight gao et al 2021 revealed that the dop in wastewater treatment plants could be mineralized to dissolved pi under uv irradiation and during this process dop molecular formulae with higher molecular weight mw and higher unsaturated aromatic structures formula compounds were preferentially removed these results indicate that it is feasible to analyze dop molecular formulae with ft icr ms which could further deepen our understanding of the photo mineralization of dop in lakes herein the characteristics and mechanism of dissolved pi released from dop photo mineralization in lake dong are investigated this study aims to confirm the photo release process of dissolved pi and further understand the change of dop composition at the molecular level under simulated irradiation finally the generation of ros during simulated irradiation is determined to reveal the driving force of dop mineralization the study results can deepen the research on the dop and fill the current knowledge gap on dop cycling in shallow lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and collection of samples the study area is lake dong located in wuhan city china lake dong was once the largest urban inland lake in china with a water area of 33 km2 an average water depth of 2 8 m and water storage of 0 94 108 m3 tao and lu 2020 like other shallow lakes such as lake tai and lake chao the water quality of lake dong was vulnerable to human activities and hydrological conditions chen et al 2020 since the 1970s large scale algal blooms in lake dong have become more frequent with the peak reaching in the 1980s yang et al 2005 as a result various high impact government policies were formulated which improved the water quality of lake dong however in recent years algal blooms have again begun to break out in some regions of the lake which worsened the surrounding environmental quality and water ecological security twenty samples were collected from lake dong and the distribution of the sample sites is shown in fig s1 samples were collected into 18 l polyethylene terephthalate bottles that had been previously acid washed and thoroughly rinsed with demineralized water the sampling bottles were closed and wrapped in black bags to prevent sunlight irradiation after sampling and during their transport to the laboratory in the laboratory the samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size glass fiber filter and stored in the dark at 4 c before conducting simulated irradiation experiments the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by the total organic carbon analyzer ika germany 2 2 experimental and analytical procedures 2 2 1 photolysis experiments a quantitative volume of samples from different sample sites was transferred into the quartz tube 200 mm φ50 mm 50 ml then a magnetic stirrer was added into each quartz tube the tube was placed into the phchem iii rotating photo reactor newport corporation china a 500 w xenon lamp was placed in the center of a cold hydro pump that circulated cooling water the temperature of the irradiated samples was below 30 5 c which was approximately 5 c above the ambient laboratory temperature the average light intensity on the surface of the quartz tubes was approximately 130 5 mw cm 2 according to a light intensity test instrument newport corporation beijing china quantitative samples were collected at scheduled times and the concentration of total phosphorus was determined using the molybdenum blue method after performing potassium persulfate digestion procedure dissolved pi was determined by directly using the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 the concentration of organic phosphorus dop was calculated from the difference between total phosphorus and dissolved pi 2 2 2 ft icr ms analysis and molecular formula assignment plexa pax spe columns were chosen for this experiment because the pax column are more efficient at retaining organic phosphorus than ppl c18 and sax columns brooker et al 2018 the pax column bond elut plexa pax 500 mg 6 ml agilent 12257506 was wetted with 3 ml of 100 hplc grade methanol followed by 2 l milli q water while keeping the column wet 200 ml samples concentrated by 2 l sample were gravity filtered through the pax column the binding samples on the column were eluted with 5 ml of hplc grade methanol and 5 ml of methanol with 5 formic acid the eluent was dried with nitrogen gas blow and redissolved with 1 ml of hplc grade methanol before analysis the analysis was carried out using 9 4t bruker apex ultra ft icr ms with a negative ion apollo ii esi peaks with a signal to noise ratio s n of 4 were chosen for further analysis the mass spectrometer was initially calibrated using sodium formate and then recalibrated with some known mass series that contains a relatively high abundance of cho formulae providing a mass accuracy of 0 2 ppm or higher the mass range was set at m z 200 800 data analysis was performed using in house software he et al 2020 a molecular formula calculator generated matching formulae according to the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 14n0 3 16o0 30 32s0 1 and 31p0 2 in addition 13c 15n 34s and 18o isotopologs was considered during data analysis the mass accuracy window was set to 1 0 ppm in the formula assignment section all the elemental formulae should meet basic chemical criteria the calculation of double bond equivalent dbe and the relative abundance ra of each dop molecular formula can be determined as follows according to the assigned molecular formulae cchhoonnsspp the double bond equivalent dbe of each molecular formula was calculated as follow dbe c 0 5 h 0 5 n 1 where c h and n represent the stoichiometric number of carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n atoms in each molecular formula the relative abundance ra of each molecular formula was calculated as follow rai i i σ i i where i i represent the intensity of each molecular formula 2 2 3 detection of hydroxyl radicals coumarin was employed as the selective probe to trap the hydroxyl radicals oh and produced 7 hydroxycoumarin 7 hoc the concentration of 7 hoc was detected by a spectrofluorophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu under the following conditions λ excitation 332 nm λ emission 455 nm the calibration curve of 7 hoc was obtained over various initial 7 hoc concentrations in this study the steady state concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh ss was calculated using a method reported elsewhere zhao et al 2014 the oh ss is the result of photogeneration and scavenging under steady state conditions the formation rate of oh r oh is proportional to that of 7 hoc which can be converted to oh ss using eq 1 1 r o h 0 286 k c o u m a r i n h c o u m a r i n o h s s here k coumarin oh 6 4 109 mol l s 1 coumarin 0 1 mm r oh is the formation rate of oh μmol l h 1 and oh ss is the steady state concentration of oh mol l 1 only 6 1 of oh can be detected using 0 1 mm coumarin hence the r oh should be divided by 6 1 zhang and nosaka 2013 to investigate the influence of iron on oh ss in filtered water samples during the photo reaction a chelating resin chelex 100 sodium form sigma was used to remove the iron from the sample catalase 40 u ml was added to remove hydrogen peroxide to investigate the contribution of fe based photo fenton reaction on the production of oh the contribution of nitrate to oh photogeneration was evaluated by irradiating synthetic solutions containing different concentrations of nitrate and 0 1 mm coumarin as the only oh scavenger in this irradiation system a calibration curve between oh ss and nitrate concentration no3 was derived under simulated irradiation the steady state concentration of hydroxyl radicals resulting from no3 can be calculated using the no3 of the sample it was assumed that at no3 0 mg l in the milli q water the oh ss 0 mol l 2 2 4 eem analysis fluorescence measurements of dom in samples were conducted using a spectrofluorophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu at room temperature and the cuvette we use in this study is the 4 polished faces cell with a 10mm pathlength 200 34441 shimadzu the excitation wavelength was performed from 220 to 450 nm at 2 nm steps while the emission wavelength was performed from 250 to 600 nm at 1 nm steps matlab software was used to analyzed the fluorescence regional integration analysis fri of dom chen et al 2003 the eem data were calibrated with a milli q water blank before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical characteristics of lake dong the basic parameters of samples in lake dong are summarized in table s1 the ph of lake dong is in the range of 7 70 9 08 which is weakly alkaline this weak alkalinity is not accidental some reports have found that the water quality of lakes is weakly alkaline mainly because the photosynthesis of phytoplankton consumes the co2 in the water body leading to the rise of ph paerl 1988 paerl and paul 2012 the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a in lake dong is in the range of 2 56 63 19 μg l showing greatly spatial differences it is particularly noteworthy that the sample sites sites 16 18 that with higher chl a concentration is also the area where algal blooms have occurred frequently in recent years however the control of algal blooms in lake dong lacks an important basis due to the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of algal blooms re outbreak organic phosphorus is an important part of phosphorus pool in water it could be transformed to inorganic phosphorus through mineralization thereby compensating for the phosphorus demand for phytoplankton growth fig 1 shows the spatial distribution characteristics of dop in lake dong the concentration of organic phosphorus in the lake is 5 18 37 76 µg l in terms of spatial distribution the concentration of dop at sites 16 20 in the southwest of the lake which is affected by human activities is higher than that in other regions notably the spatial distribution of dop is consistent with the chl a concentration in the lake in 2017 and 2020 which indicates that the concentration of organic phosphorus in the lake may be related to the outbreak of algal blooms to a certain degree fig s2 therefore investigating the transformation of organic phosphorus to dissolved pi is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of algal bloom outbreaks 3 2 release of dissolved pi during dop photo mineralization fig 2 shows changes in dissolved pi and dop concentration in samples under simulated irradiation in lake dong the concentration of dissolved pi and dop in lake dong was between 20 37 and 95 17 5 18 37 76 ug l respectively after 9 h of simulated irradiation the concentration of dissolved pi and dop in the lake became between 26 82 and 108 06 µg l and between 2 92 and 26 77 µg l respectively fig 2 statistical analysis showed that there has no significant change in the average concentration of dissolved pi while that of dop changed significantly during the simulated irradiation process further analysis showed that the concentration of dissolved pi in lake areas with high dop concentrations changed significantly after simulated irradiation sampling sites 2 4 7 13 16 18 20 p 0 05 indicating photo release of dissolved pi from dop especially in sites 16 18 20 with higher concentrations of dop fig s3 research on the photo release of inorganic phosphors could be traced back to the report by francko and heath francko and heath 1982 who reported that iron phosphorus humic complexes can be photo decomposed to release dissolved pi under simulated irradiation and that the dissolved pi photo released rate was highly correlated to the reduction rate of fe3 to fe2 recent years have seen continuous expansion of the research on the photo mineralization of organic phosphorus zhang et al 2019 showed that organic phosphorus in wastewater treatment plants could be photo mineralized to dissolved pi and that the particle organic phosphorus photo mineralization rate constant was 3 2 times higher than that for dop our studies on the photo mineralization of organic phosphorus at different scales also found that the organic phosphorus in shallow lakes could release dissolved pi during simulated irradiation guo et al 2020 li et al 2019 2017 however because of the limitations of analysis methods structural and compositional changes occurring in dop at the molecular level have not been investigated thereby restricting the understanding of the transformation mechanism of dop in the aquatic environment 3 3 transformation of dop molecular formulae during photo mineralization typically any change in the dop concentration should be accompanied by a corresponding change in the composition and structure of dop however it is still unclear how the composition and structure of dop influence its photo mineralization and what happens to the dop molecular structure under simulated irradiation here we used ft icr ms to analyze dop at the molecular level to investigate the role of photo mineralization of dop based on our previous studies in the present study we collected samples from different sample sites in lake dong and mixed them before conducting our investigation the results obtained reflected changes in the molecular structure of organic phosphorus in the entire lake the mixed sample was subjected to simulated irradiation followed by ft icr ms analysis according to the assignment there were 46 and 57 dop molecular formulae in the before and after simulated irradiation samples which account for 0 93 and 0 98 of the total assigned elemental formulae respectively fig s4 table s2 table s3 shows the proportion of assigned dop formulae accounting for the total assigned formulae in other studies a comparison of the results indicated that the proportion of dop formulae reported in the present study is comparable to that of other studies brooker et al 2018 kurek et al 2020 2021 ni et al 2021 yang et al 2022 besides this the comparison results also revealed that the lake water samples had a lower proportion of dop formulae than that of the sediment and manure samples table s3 moreover we showed that the assigned dop formulae contained only one p atom in contrast to previous studies the absent formulae contained more p atoms or nitrogen n atoms and sulfur s atoms indicating a lower diversity of dop formulae in lake dong than that in other samples table s3 as a basic parameter of dop in lake dong the mw of dop molecular formulae ranged between 249 05 and 599 23 da and with an average mw of 435 18 da 95 confidence interval ci 409 14 461 22 da this result indicates that the dop molecular formulae in lake dong had a higher mw than that of the dop molecular formulae in the water extractable organic phosphorus in the lake sediment 342 4 da and a lower mw than that of the wastewater treatment plant effluent 491 da table s4 gao et al 2021 ni et al 2021 moreover some researchers developed a molecular lability boundary mlb and divided the dom into labile h c 1 5 and less labile formula compounds h c 1 5 in lake dong the proportion of labile and less liable formula compounds for dop molecular formulae are 32 97 and 67 03 respectively table s4 compared to a previous study the proportion of labile formula compounds in dop in lake dong was higher than a diverse set of environment dom that reported by d andrilli et al 2015 however the proportion of labile formula compounds in dop in lake dong was lower than that of water extractable organic phosphorus 65 5 probably because the mw of water extractable organic phosphorus in the sediment is lower than that of dop in lake dong ni et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge the present researches about the natural dop characterization at the molecular level are not enough therefore this comparison may have limitations that said the results could still explain some problems to a certain extent to determine the transformation of dop during photo mineralization at the molecular level the structure and compounds of dop molecular formulae were further analyzed the ra of mw fig 3 a and the dbe fig 3b of dop molecular formulae were calculated the results indicate that during simulated irradiation the ra of dop molecular formulae with a higher mw 500 da decreased while that with the lower mw 200 500 da increased in addition the ra of dop molecular formulae with higher dbe values 9 decreased while those with a lower dbe value increased dbe typically represents the sum of carbon double bonds and rings in the dop molecular formulae therefore the decrease in the ra of dop molecular formulae with a higher dbe implied a decrease in the degree of unsaturation of dop these results suggest a change in the preferential photo mineralization of higher mw higher unsaturated dop formulae and the photo preservation or photo production of lower mw dop formulae with a more saturated structure under simulated irradiation this result is consistent with those reported in previous studies according to which higher mw and unsaturated dop molecular formulae in the wastewater treatment plant were largely removed during the uv irradiation process gao et al 2021 for the dop molecular formula compounds multidimensional stoichiometric compound classification mscc was employed to classify the dop molecular formulae in lake dong into two categories lipid like formulae and oxy aromatic like formulae fig 4 a and 4b rivas ubach et al 2018 the average ra values of lipid like formulae and oxy aromatic like formulae were 2 13 95 ci 1 88 2 39 and 2 31 95 ci 1 91 2 72 respectively after 9 h of simulated irradiation the average ra values of lipid like formulae and oxy aromatic like formulae were 1 86 95 ci 1 28 2 44 and 1 76 95 ci 1 33 2 20 respectively table s5 the average ra of oxy aromatic like formulae decreased but did not reach the significance level p 0 08 during simulated irradiation generally speaking lipid like formulae are preferentially involved in microbial degradation while oxy aromatic like formulae prefer photo mineralization xu et al 2020b the total ra of lipid like formulae increased from 49 09 to 55 90 while that of oxy aromatic like formulae decreased from 50 91 to 44 10 fig 4c this result is consistent with those reported in previous studies according to which the mineralization process preferentially removed oxidized aromatic compounds from the aquatic systems kellerman et al 2015 song et al 2019 xu et al 2020b the oxy aromatic like formulae mainly contain compounds with lower h c values such as polyphenolics and are the main compounds produced during irradiation in the aquatic system xu et al 2020b in addition an increase in the relative abundance of lipid like formulae would increase the bioavailability of dop to certain degree because the lipid like formulae are vulnerable to microbial degradation and can be quickly utilized by microorganisms kim et al 2006 3 4 role of oh in dop photo mineralization photo mineralization of organic compounds in natural water bodies usually involves direct and indirect photolysis mediated by the reactive oxygen species ros such as oh and 1o2 buxton et al 1988 derbalah et al 2020 previous studies have shown that oh plays an important role in the photo mineralization of dissolved organic phosphorus compared to that observed with 1o2 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 therefore we investigated the relationship between oh and release of dissolved pi besides the five outlier samples sites a positive correlation was observed between the photo released amount of dissolved pi and oh ss r 2 0 50 fig 5 notably the amount of dissolved pi released at 16 20 sampling sites was higher than that observed at other sample sites the 16 20 sampling sites also had a higher concentration of dop than that at other sample sites suggesting that the photo released amount of dissolved pi is affected by many factors such as the ros yield and organic phosphorus concentration to identify the source of oh contribution of various photosensitizers such as iron ion fe3 no3 and dom to the production of oh was analyzed as shown in fig 6 the oh ss was calculated to be 1 73 0 09 10 16 mol l for the original lake water when catalase was added to remove the influence of the photo fenton process oh ss slightly decreased to 1 71 0 03 10 16 mol l after the fe3 was removed from the water sample oh ss produced during 9 h of simulated irradiation was 1 41 0 07 10 16 mol l the average concentration of no3 is 0 26 mg l and its contribution to oh ss was calculated through equal oh ss 7 10 16 no3 3 10 17 therefore the contributions of no3 dom and fe3 to the total oh ss were estimated to be 24 82 55 17 and 20 01 respectively the contribution of dom to oh ss is the highest previous studies have shown that generation of ros such as oh by photoinduced dom is influenced by its structure and composition lee et al 2013 xu and guo 2017 thus lower oh ss at sites 16 20 may be related to the structure or composition of dom fig 5 sample sites 7 9 and 16 18 was selected to further investigate the effects of dom composition and structure on oh generation the average oh ss at sites 7 9 and 16 18 were 3 13 10 16 and 8 96 10 17 mol l respectively chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom was the light absorbing component of dom the relative abundance ra of five fluorescent components of cdom in sample at sites 7 9 and 16 18 is shown in fig s5 and table s6 statistical analysis was conducted to determine the ra of these five components these components had significant differences at sites 7 9 and 16 18 p 0 05 components 1 and 2 are simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine acid and tryptophan component 3 is usually related to substances such as phenols quinones and fulvic acids component 4 is soluble microbial metabolites while component 5 is humic like organic components chen et al 2003 the cdom at different sample sites were dominated by fulvic acid like component 3 and humic acid like component 5 components accounting for 90 of the dom hence these two components may greatly influence the production of oh under simulated irradiation process humic acid like components generally have a higher mw and a higher aromatic character while fulvic acid like components have a lower mw previous studies have shown that the mw of cdom in natural water is negatively correlated with oh ss lee et al 2013 xu et al 2020a furthermore the fulvic acid typically accounts for 50 of the dom and is the dominant light absorbing solute at a wavelength range of 200 800 nm in some aquatic systems mcknight et al 2001 stewart and wetzel 1980 therefore a significantly higher content of fulvic acid like components in the cdom at sites 7 9 may explain its higher oh ss than that at sites 16 18 however it is not sufficient to explain the influence of the fluorescent components of dom on the generation of hydroxyl radicals therefore additional research should be performed in this field hence the generation of oh by photoinduced dom could be an important link for the photo release of dissolved pi and the generation of oh may be influenced by the structure and composition of dom in summary the process of photo induced dom to generate oh could be an important link for the photo released dissolved pi and the generation of oh may influenced by the structure and composition of dom 4 conclusions this study investigated the photo mineralization of dop and photo release of dissolved pi in lake dong at the molecular level the dop in lake dong could be photo mineralized and release dissolved pi especially in regions with a higher concentration of dop the dop molecular formulae with a higher mw and higher dbe were preferentially photo removed accompanied by an increase in the ra of dop molecular formulae with lower mw and lower dbe the preferential photogeneration of lipid like formulae and photo removal of oxy aromatic like formulae suggest that the simulated irradiation process could influence the potential bioavailability of dop molecular formulae because lipid like formulae were vulnerable to microbial degradation in addition the photoinduced generation of oh by dom was the main driving force for the photo mineralization of dop further the structure and composition of dom influenced the generation of oh during the simulated irradiation process however this process needs to be further explored on a large scale these study results provide a new sight into the phosphorus biogeochemical cycle and may further the

and hydrological conditions chen et al 2020 since the 1970s large scale algal blooms in lake dong have become more frequent with the peak reaching in the 1980s yang et al 2005 as a result various high impact government policies were formulated which improved the water quality of lake dong however in recent years algal blooms have again begun to break out in some regions of the lake which worsened the surrounding environmental quality and water ecological security twenty samples were collected from lake dong and the distribution of the sample sites is shown in fig s1 samples were collected into 18 l polyethylene terephthalate bottles that had been previously acid washed and thoroughly rinsed with demineralized water the sampling bottles were closed and wrapped in black bags to prevent sunlight irradiation after sampling and during their transport to the laboratory in the laboratory the samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size glass fiber filter and stored in the dark at 4 c before conducting simulated irradiation experiments the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by the total organic carbon analyzer ika germany 2 2 experimental and analytical procedures 2 2 1 photolysis experiments a quantitative volume of samples from different sample sites was transferred into the quartz tube 200 mm φ50 mm 50 ml then a magnetic stirrer was added into each quartz tube the tube was placed into the phchem iii rotating photo reactor newport corporation china a 500 w xenon lamp was placed in the center of a cold hydro pump that circulated cooling water the temperature of the irradiated samples was below 30 5 c which was approximately 5 c above the ambient laboratory temperature the average light intensity on the surface of the quartz tubes was approximately 130 5 mw cm 2 according to a light intensity test instrument newport corporation beijing china quantitative samples were collected at scheduled times and the concentration of total phosphorus was determined using the molybdenum blue method after performing potassium persulfate digestion procedure dissolved pi was determined by directly using the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 the concentration of organic phosphorus dop was calculated from the difference between total phosphorus and dissolved pi 2 2 2 ft icr ms analysis and molecular formula assignment plexa pax spe columns were chosen for this experiment because the pax column are more efficient at retaining organic phosphorus than ppl c18 and sax columns brooker et al 2018 the pax column bond elut plexa pax 500 mg 6 ml agilent 12257506 was wetted with 3 ml of 100 hplc grade methanol followed by 2 l milli q water while keeping the column wet 200 ml samples concentrated by 2 l sample were gravity filtered through the pax column the binding samples on the column were eluted with 5 ml of hplc grade methanol and 5 ml of methanol with 5 formic acid the eluent was dried with nitrogen gas blow and redissolved with 1 ml of hplc grade methanol before analysis the analysis was carried out using 9 4t bruker apex ultra ft icr ms with a negative ion apollo ii esi peaks with a signal to noise ratio s n of 4 were chosen for further analysis the mass spectrometer was initially calibrated using sodium formate and then recalibrated with some known mass series that contains a relatively high abundance of cho formulae providing a mass accuracy of 0 2 ppm or higher the mass range was set at m z 200 800 data analysis was performed using in house software he et al 2020 a molecular formula calculator generated matching formulae according to the elemental combinations of 12c1 60 1h1 120 14n0 3 16o0 30 32s0 1 and 31p0 2 in addition 13c 15n 34s and 18o isotopologs was considered during data analysis the mass accuracy window was set to 1 0 ppm in the formula assignment section all the elemental formulae should meet basic chemical criteria the calculation of double bond equivalent dbe and the relative abundance ra of each dop molecular formula can be determined as follows according to the assigned molecular formulae cchhoonnsspp the double bond equivalent dbe of each molecular formula was calculated as follow dbe c 0 5 h 0 5 n 1 where c h and n represent the stoichiometric number of carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n atoms in each molecular formula the relative abundance ra of each molecular formula was calculated as follow rai i i σ i i where i i represent the intensity of each molecular formula 2 2 3 detection of hydroxyl radicals coumarin was employed as the selective probe to trap the hydroxyl radicals oh and produced 7 hydroxycoumarin 7 hoc the concentration of 7 hoc was detected by a spectrofluorophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu under the following conditions λ excitation 332 nm λ emission 455 nm the calibration curve of 7 hoc was obtained over various initial 7 hoc concentrations in this study the steady state concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh ss was calculated using a method reported elsewhere zhao et al 2014 the oh ss is the result of photogeneration and scavenging under steady state conditions the formation rate of oh r oh is proportional to that of 7 hoc which can be converted to oh ss using eq 1 1 r o h 0 286 k c o u m a r i n h c o u m a r i n o h s s here k coumarin oh 6 4 109 mol l s 1 coumarin 0 1 mm r oh is the formation rate of oh μmol l h 1 and oh ss is the steady state concentration of oh mol l 1 only 6 1 of oh can be detected using 0 1 mm coumarin hence the r oh should be divided by 6 1 zhang and nosaka 2013 to investigate the influence of iron on oh ss in filtered water samples during the photo reaction a chelating resin chelex 100 sodium form sigma was used to remove the iron from the sample catalase 40 u ml was added to remove hydrogen peroxide to investigate the contribution of fe based photo fenton reaction on the production of oh the contribution of nitrate to oh photogeneration was evaluated by irradiating synthetic solutions containing different concentrations of nitrate and 0 1 mm coumarin as the only oh scavenger in this irradiation system a calibration curve between oh ss and nitrate concentration no3 was derived under simulated irradiation the steady state concentration of hydroxyl radicals resulting from no3 can be calculated using the no3 of the sample it was assumed that at no3 0 mg l in the milli q water the oh ss 0 mol l 2 2 4 eem analysis fluorescence measurements of dom in samples were conducted using a spectrofluorophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu at room temperature and the cuvette we use in this study is the 4 polished faces cell with a 10mm pathlength 200 34441 shimadzu the excitation wavelength was performed from 220 to 450 nm at 2 nm steps while the emission wavelength was performed from 250 to 600 nm at 1 nm steps matlab software was used to analyzed the fluorescence regional integration analysis fri of dom chen et al 2003 the eem data were calibrated with a milli q water blank before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical characteristics of lake dong the basic parameters of samples in lake dong are summarized in table s1 the ph of lake dong is in the range of 7 70 9 08 which is weakly alkaline this weak alkalinity is not accidental some reports have found that the water quality of lakes is weakly alkaline mainly because the photosynthesis of phytoplankton consumes the co2 in the water body leading to the rise of ph paerl 1988 paerl and paul 2012 the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a in lake dong is in the range of 2 56 63 19 μg l showing greatly spatial differences it is particularly noteworthy that the sample sites sites 16 18 that with higher chl a concentration is also the area where algal blooms have occurred frequently in recent years however the control of algal blooms in lake dong lacks an important basis due to the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of algal blooms re outbreak organic phosphorus is an important part of phosphorus pool in water it could be transformed to inorganic phosphorus through mineralization thereby compensating for the phosphorus demand for phytoplankton growth fig 1 shows the spatial distribution characteristics of dop in lake dong the concentration of organic phosphorus in the lake is 5 18 37 76 µg l in terms of spatial distribution the concentration of dop at sites 16 20 in the southwest of the lake which is affected by human activities is higher than that in other regions notably the spatial distribution of dop is consistent with the chl a concentration in the lake in 2017 and 2020 which indicates that the concentration of organic phosphorus in the lake may be related to the outbreak of algal blooms to a certain degree fig s2 therefore investigating the transformation of organic phosphorus to dissolved pi is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of algal bloom outbreaks 3 2 release of dissolved pi during dop photo mineralization fig 2 shows changes in dissolved pi and dop concentration in samples under simulated irradiation in lake dong the concentration of dissolved pi and dop in lake dong was between 20 37 and 95 17 5 18 37 76 ug l respectively after 9 h of simulated irradiation the concentration of dissolved pi and dop in the lake became between 26 82 and 108 06 µg l and between 2 92 and 26 77 µg l respectively fig 2 statistical analysis showed that there has no significant change in the average concentration of dissolved pi while that of dop changed significantly during the simulated irradiation process further analysis showed that the concentration of dissolved pi in lake areas with high dop concentrations changed significantly after simulated irradiation sampling sites 2 4 7 13 16 18 20 p 0 05 indicating photo release of dissolved pi from dop especially in sites 16 18 20 with higher concentrations of dop fig s3 research on the photo release of inorganic phosphors could be traced back to the report by francko and heath francko and heath 1982 who reported that iron phosphorus humic complexes can be photo decomposed to release dissolved pi under simulated irradiation and that the dissolved pi photo released rate was highly correlated to the reduction rate of fe3 to fe2 recent years have seen continuous expansion of the research on the photo mineralization of organic phosphorus zhang et al 2019 showed that organic phosphorus in wastewater treatment plants could be photo mineralized to dissolved pi and that the particle organic phosphorus photo mineralization rate constant was 3 2 times higher than that for dop our studies on the photo mineralization of organic phosphorus at different scales also found that the organic phosphorus in shallow lakes could release dissolved pi during simulated irradiation guo et al 2020 li et al 2019 2017 however because of the limitations of analysis methods structural and compositional changes occurring in dop at the molecular level have not been investigated thereby restricting the understanding of the transformation mechanism of dop in the aquatic environment 3 3 transformation of dop molecular formulae during photo mineralization typically any change in the dop concentration should be accompanied by a corresponding change in the composition and structure of dop however it is still unclear how the composition and structure of dop influence its photo mineralization and what happens to the dop molecular structure under simulated irradiation here we used ft icr ms to analyze dop at the molecular level to investigate the role of photo mineralization of dop based on our previous studies in the present study we collected samples from different sample sites in lake dong and mixed them before conducting our investigation the results obtained reflected changes in the molecular structure of organic phosphorus in the entire lake the mixed sample was subjected to simulated irradiation followed by ft icr ms analysis according to the assignment there were 46 and 57 dop molecular formulae in the before and after simulated irradiation samples which account for 0 93 and 0 98 of the total assigned elemental formulae respectively fig s4 table s2 table s3 shows the proportion of assigned dop formulae accounting for the total assigned formulae in other studies a comparison of the results indicated that the proportion of dop formulae reported in the present study is comparable to that of other studies brooker et al 2018 kurek et al 2020 2021 ni et al 2021 yang et al 2022 besides this the comparison results also revealed that the lake water samples had a lower proportion of dop formulae than that of the sediment and manure samples table s3 moreover we showed that the assigned dop formulae contained only one p atom in contrast to previous studies the absent formulae contained more p atoms or nitrogen n atoms and sulfur s atoms indicating a lower diversity of dop formulae in lake dong than that in other samples table s3 as a basic parameter of dop in lake dong the mw of dop molecular formulae ranged between 249 05 and 599 23 da and with an average mw of 435 18 da 95 confidence interval ci 409 14 461 22 da this result indicates that the dop molecular formulae in lake dong had a higher mw than that of the dop molecular formulae in the water extractable organic phosphorus in the lake sediment 342 4 da and a lower mw than that of the wastewater treatment plant effluent 491 da table s4 gao et al 2021 ni et al 2021 moreover some researchers developed a molecular lability boundary mlb and divided the dom into labile h c 1 5 and less labile formula compounds h c 1 5 in lake dong the proportion of labile and less liable formula compounds for dop molecular formulae are 32 97 and 67 03 respectively table s4 compared to a previous study the proportion of labile formula compounds in dop in lake dong was higher than a diverse set of environment dom that reported by d andrilli et al 2015 however the proportion of labile formula compounds in dop in lake dong was lower than that of water extractable organic phosphorus 65 5 probably because the mw of water extractable organic phosphorus in the sediment is lower than that of dop in lake dong ni et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge the present researches about the natural dop characterization at the molecular level are not enough therefore this comparison may have limitations that said the results could still explain some problems to a certain extent to determine the transformation of dop during photo mineralization at the molecular level the structure and compounds of dop molecular formulae were further analyzed the ra of mw fig 3 a and the dbe fig 3b of dop molecular formulae were calculated the results indicate that during simulated irradiation the ra of dop molecular formulae with a higher mw 500 da decreased while that with the lower mw 200 500 da increased in addition the ra of dop molecular formulae with higher dbe values 9 decreased while those with a lower dbe value increased dbe typically represents the sum of carbon double bonds and rings in the dop molecular formulae therefore the decrease in the ra of dop molecular formulae with a higher dbe implied a decrease in the degree of unsaturation of dop these results suggest a change in the preferential photo mineralization of higher mw higher unsaturated dop formulae and the photo preservation or photo production of lower mw dop formulae with a more saturated structure under simulated irradiation this result is consistent with those reported in previous studies according to which higher mw and unsaturated dop molecular formulae in the wastewater treatment plant were largely removed during the uv irradiation process gao et al 2021 for the dop molecular formula compounds multidimensional stoichiometric compound classification mscc was employed to classify the dop molecular formulae in lake dong into two categories lipid like formulae and oxy aromatic like formulae fig 4 a and 4b rivas ubach et al 2018 the average ra values of lipid like formulae and oxy aromatic like formulae were 2 13 95 ci 1 88 2 39 and 2 31 95 ci 1 91 2 72 respectively after 9 h of simulated irradiation the average ra values of lipid like formulae and oxy aromatic like formulae were 1 86 95 ci 1 28 2 44 and 1 76 95 ci 1 33 2 20 respectively table s5 the average ra of oxy aromatic like formulae decreased but did not reach the significance level p 0 08 during simulated irradiation generally speaking lipid like formulae are preferentially involved in microbial degradation while oxy aromatic like formulae prefer photo mineralization xu et al 2020b the total ra of lipid like formulae increased from 49 09 to 55 90 while that of oxy aromatic like formulae decreased from 50 91 to 44 10 fig 4c this result is consistent with those reported in previous studies according to which the mineralization process preferentially removed oxidized aromatic compounds from the aquatic systems kellerman et al 2015 song et al 2019 xu et al 2020b the oxy aromatic like formulae mainly contain compounds with lower h c values such as polyphenolics and are the main compounds produced during irradiation in the aquatic system xu et al 2020b in addition an increase in the relative abundance of lipid like formulae would increase the bioavailability of dop to certain degree because the lipid like formulae are vulnerable to microbial degradation and can be quickly utilized by microorganisms kim et al 2006 3 4 role of oh in dop photo mineralization photo mineralization of organic compounds in natural water bodies usually involves direct and indirect photolysis mediated by the reactive oxygen species ros such as oh and 1o2 buxton et al 1988 derbalah et al 2020 previous studies have shown that oh plays an important role in the photo mineralization of dissolved organic phosphorus compared to that observed with 1o2 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 therefore we investigated the relationship between oh and release of dissolved pi besides the five outlier samples sites a positive correlation was observed between the photo released amount of dissolved pi and oh ss r 2 0 50 fig 5 notably the amount of dissolved pi released at 16 20 sampling sites was higher than that observed at other sample sites the 16 20 sampling sites also had a higher concentration of dop than that at other sample sites suggesting that the photo released amount of dissolved pi is affected by many factors such as the ros yield and organic phosphorus concentration to identify the source of oh contribution of various photosensitizers such as iron ion fe3 no3 and dom to the production of oh was analyzed as shown in fig 6 the oh ss was calculated to be 1 73 0 09 10 16 mol l for the original lake water when catalase was added to remove the influence of the photo fenton process oh ss slightly decreased to 1 71 0 03 10 16 mol l after the fe3 was removed from the water sample oh ss produced during 9 h of simulated irradiation was 1 41 0 07 10 16 mol l the average concentration of no3 is 0 26 mg l and its contribution to oh ss was calculated through equal oh ss 7 10 16 no3 3 10 17 therefore the contributions of no3 dom and fe3 to the total oh ss were estimated to be 24 82 55 17 and 20 01 respectively the contribution of dom to oh ss is the highest previous studies have shown that generation of ros such as oh by photoinduced dom is influenced by its structure and composition lee et al 2013 xu and guo 2017 thus lower oh ss at sites 16 20 may be related to the structure or composition of dom fig 5 sample sites 7 9 and 16 18 was selected to further investigate the effects of dom composition and structure on oh generation the average oh ss at sites 7 9 and 16 18 were 3 13 10 16 and 8 96 10 17 mol l respectively chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom was the light absorbing component of dom the relative abundance ra of five fluorescent components of cdom in sample at sites 7 9 and 16 18 is shown in fig s5 and table s6 statistical analysis was conducted to determine the ra of these five components these components had significant differences at sites 7 9 and 16 18 p 0 05 components 1 and 2 are simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine acid and tryptophan component 3 is usually related to substances such as phenols quinones and fulvic acids component 4 is soluble microbial metabolites while component 5 is humic like organic components chen et al 2003 the cdom at different sample sites were dominated by fulvic acid like component 3 and humic acid like component 5 components accounting for 90 of the dom hence these two components may greatly influence the production of oh under simulated irradiation process humic acid like components generally have a higher mw and a higher aromatic character while fulvic acid like components have a lower mw previous studies have shown that the mw of cdom in natural water is negatively correlated with oh ss lee et al 2013 xu et al 2020a furthermore the fulvic acid typically accounts for 50 of the dom and is the dominant light absorbing solute at a wavelength range of 200 800 nm in some aquatic systems mcknight et al 2001 stewart and wetzel 1980 therefore a significantly higher content of fulvic acid like components in the cdom at sites 7 9 may explain its higher oh ss than that at sites 16 18 however it is not sufficient to explain the influence of the fluorescent components of dom on the generation of hydroxyl radicals therefore additional research should be performed in this field hence the generation of oh by photoinduced dom could be an important link for the photo release of dissolved pi and the generation of oh may be influenced by the structure and composition of dom in summary the process of photo induced dom to generate oh could be an important link for the photo released dissolved pi and the generation of oh may influenced by the structure and composition of dom 4 conclusions this study investigated the photo mineralization of dop and photo release of dissolved pi in lake dong at the molecular level the dop in lake dong could be photo mineralized and release dissolved pi especially in regions with a higher concentration of dop the dop molecular formulae with a higher mw and higher dbe were preferentially photo removed accompanied by an increase in the ra of dop molecular formulae with lower mw and lower dbe the preferential photogeneration of lipid like formulae and photo removal of oxy aromatic like formulae suggest that the simulated irradiation process could influence the potential bioavailability of dop molecular formulae because lipid like formulae were vulnerable to microbial degradation in addition the photoinduced generation of oh by dom was the main driving force for the photo mineralization of dop further the structure and composition of dom influenced the generation of oh during the simulated irradiation process however this process needs to be further explored on a large scale these study results provide a new sight into the phosphorus biogeochemical cycle and may further the

15626,urban rivers are hotspots of regional nitrogen n pollution and n transformations previous studies have reported that the microbial community of urban rivers was different from that of natural rivers however how microbial community affects n transformations in the urban rivers is still unclear in this study we employed n nutrients related isotope technology includes natural abundance isotopes survey and isotope labeling method and bioinformatics methods includes 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and quantitative pcr analysis to investigate the major n transformations microbial communities as well as functional gene abundances in a metropolitan river network our results suggested that the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was characterized by higher richness less complexity and increased abundances of nitrification and denitrifying bacterium compared to those in the suburban rivers these differences were mainly caused by high sewage discharge and n loadings in addition the abundances of nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifier genes nirk and nirs were significantly higher in the highly urbanized rivers 2 36 103 7 43 107 and 2 28 107 copies ml 1 than that in the suburban rivers 0 43 103 2 18 107 and 0 99 107 copies ml 1 these changes in microbes have accelerated nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers as compared to those in the suburban rivers which was evidenced by environmental isotopes and the rates of nitrification 10 52 vs 0 03 nmol l 1 h 1 and denitrification 83 31 vs 22 49 nmol g 1 h 1 overall this study concluded that the excess exogenous n has significantly shaped the specific aquatic bacterial communities which had a potential for enhancing nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized river network this study provides a further understanding of microbial n cycling in urban river ecosystems and expands the combined application of isotopic technology and bioinformatics methods in studying biogeochemical cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen cycling bacterial community isotope urban river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activities have significantly changed the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients such as nitrogen n in atmospheric terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems over the past decades leading to a series of environmental and ecological problems conley et al 2009 fowler et al 2013 kendall et al 2007 metropolitan areas are hotspots driving environmental change since they carry over half of the global population phaneuf et al 2008 many cities are located along water bodies especially rivers which serve as an important sink for urban sewage stormwater runoff and waste materials phaneuf et al 2008 thus urban rivers represent a unique ecosystem where n pollution occurs regularly and are recognized as a hotspot of n transformations urban rivers receive a substantial amount of treated sewage from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and occasionally untreated sewage by direct discharge which potentially leads to the reshaping of aquatic bacterial community structure hladilek et al 2016 lin and lin 2022 zhou et al 2022 on the one hand allochthonous sources would introduce microbiological contamination and affect the diversity and structure of the aquatic bacterial community drury et al 2013 for example previous research has found significant differences in the composition of the bacterial communities under the influence of different types of domestic pollution e g residential hotel school and hospital sewage zhang et al 2020 the urban rivers receiving effluent from wwtps had been characterized by decreases in the population size and diversity of bacterial communities and increases in the abundance of nitrospirae and sphingobacteria drury et al 2013 pascual benito et al 2020 on the other hand treated and untreated sewage containing lots of organic and inorganic pollutants may greatly alter the riverine environmental conditions for example increasing sewage discharge has caused excessive n loading to urban rivers and changes in ph and dissolved oxygen dong et al 2020 xuan et al 2020 these changes can reshape the microbial communities and further affect microbial activities and rates of n transformations archana et al 2016 eckert et al 2018 thus understanding the impact of n sources and n loadings on changes in aquatic bacterial communities is the primary step to gain greater insight into n cycling in urban rivers changes in bacterial community structure due to exogenous input and high n loading would further alter n transformation processes in urban rivers kuypers et al 2018 numerous studies have speculated potential n transformation and discussed its response to the bacterial community in aquatic ecosystems based on profiling phylogenetic marker genes such as the 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing hanson et al 2014 shu et al 2016 tran et al 2021 for example one study has shown that denitrification was the central process associated with elevated levels of carbon and nitrogen contents and extracellular enzyme activities in riparian and stream sediments kim et al 2016 however little is known about the response of n transformation processes to changes in bacterial community structure in urban river ecosystems under highly human disturbance a possible reason is that the bioinformatics analysis can not determine whether the n transformations occurred due to a large fraction of dormant cells within the communities that have been detected but without activity roberto et al 2018 to overcome this point the isotope tracer technique including natural abundance isotope survey and isotope labeling methods appears to be a powerful tool for qualitative and quantitative characterization of n transformations the natural abundance of multi isotopes could give an obvious signal of the major n transformation processes which have occurred in the rivers as each process has an individual preference for the common or rare isotope isotope effect denk et al 2017 xue et al 2009 isotopically enriched labelling methods could estimate potential rates of different n transformations santoro et al 2010 steingruber et al 2001 which would provide solid evidence of n transformations in the rivers hence the isotope tracer technique gives direct evidence of revealing the predominant n transformation processes and their rates in the urban river ecosystem with complex biogeochemical cycling michener and lajtha 2008 overall it is urgent to use a combination of isotope tracer technique and microbiological survey to reveal the microbial mediated n transformations in urban rivers which could enhance our understanding of n cycling and its response to the changes in bacterial community structure in the urban river ecosystem over the past few years china has experienced unprecedented urbanization and is now facing and solving numerous environmental problems guangzhou with its advantageous geographic location and extremely rapid urbanization rate due to the economic reform beginning in 1978 and economic development strategies of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba has become one of the largest metropolises in china gong et al 2018 xu and yeh 2003 zhou et al 2018 situated at the northern tip of the pearl river delta near the mouth of the pearl river estuary guangzhou is an area with a dense network of waterways and creeks since fast urbanization and industrialization the rivers in guangzhou have received rainfall runoff effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps or even untreated wastewater from surroundings severely deteriorated and carried excess n loading dong et al 2020 numerous studies have investigated n cycling in urbanized watersheds such as n fluxes and retention hobbie et al 2017 lin et al 2020a n sources transformation processes based on isotopes jung et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 and effects of urban sewage on n cycle related microorganisms zhang et al 2020 however it is still unclear about the characteristics of bacterial community structure and its link to n transformations in the highly human impacted urban rivers the working hypothesis of this study is that the excess exogenous n significantly reshapes the aquatic bacterial communities in the highly urbanized river network and subsequently alters the n transformations and the fate of n in the rivers therefore this study aims to investigate in a highly urbanized river network and mainly focuses on two aspects 1 to characterize the changes in aquatic microbial communities and n related functional genes in highly urbanized rivers using high throughput sequencing and 2 to reveal the dominant processes of n transformations and their potential rates driven by the changed microbes and functional genes based on stable isotope tracer technology the results of this study will enhance our understanding of n cycling in urban rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area guangzhou city 112o57 114o03 e 22o26 23o56 n the selected study area with a total terrestrial area of about 7434 km2 is located in the south east part of china where the intersection of the three major tributaries of pearl river and is a collection of numerous tributaries fig 1 guangzhou is located in the subtropical coastal area which has a monsoon climate with an average annual temperature between 20 and 25 c and average annual precipitation

guangdong province over the past 20 years guangzhou has experienced explosive economic growth due to rapid industrialization and significant changes to its society and landscape resulting in a substantial urbanization the fast growing economy and rapid urbanization in guangzhou resulted in heavy loads of anthropogenic wastewater into the rivers which would affect the river ecosystem s chemistry and biology and strongly influence biogeochemical cycling in the metropolitan river network based on the spatial distribution pattern of land use the study area was divided into two parts to be conducted in this study the northern part of guangzhou suburban region region i in fig 1 was defined as the control group its percentages of forestland bushland grassland cropland wetland and urban

out by r software version 3 4 2 with the package of igraph yuan et al 2021 2 4 3 calculation of oxygen isotope in nitrate produced by nitrification a combination of δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o values can provide clear evidence for the nitrification process in the river ecosystem the oxygen isotope in nitrate from nitrification δ18o no3 nitrified is derived from one oxygen atom of the atmospheric o2 and two other oxygen atoms of two thirds of the ambient water thus if these oxygen atoms are included without isotopic fractionation the δ18o no3 value produced by nitrification can be calculated as follows eq 2 kendall et al 2007 2 δ 18 o no 3 nitrified 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 however δ18o no3 nitrified is likely to be more depleted than that predicted using eq 2 owing to the abiotic o atom exchange between nitrite and h2o and the isotopic fractionation associated with the incorporation of o atoms during the nitrification and the δ18o no3 nitrified can be calculated as following eq

potential nitrification rates were calculated by modeling the 15n and 14n contents of the no3 with inputs from the labeled 15nh4 and outputs through no3 uptake as following eq 4 potential denitrification rates were calculated based on the accumulation of 29n2 and 30n2 and the details as described in thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 4 1 5 n no 3 1 4 n no 3 t 1 5 n 0 e kt α f in a p nh 4 k α

rivers the statistical characteristics of physicochemical parameters nutrient concentrations and isotopic values of the river water samples are summarized in tables 1 and s2 environmental characteristics of river water showed significant differences between the two regions the differences mainly included higher nutrient concentrations especially higher n contents in the highly urbanized rivers than in suburban rivers table 1 and fig s1 in the highly urbanized rivers the ranges of tn concentrations in river waters were 3 08 20 01 mg l 1 and 0 92 15 15 mg l 1 in the dry and wet seasons respectively in the suburban rivers the ranges of tn concentrations in river waters were 1 46 4 76 mg l 1 and 1 23 4 35 mg l 1 in the dry and wet seasons respectively on average tn concentrations in the highly urbanized rivers were more than 2 times of those in the suburban rivers in both regions tn concentrations were significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season p 0 01 table 1 no3 n was the dominant n form in the rivers in both the dry and wet seasons the no3 n concentrations in the highly urbanized rivers 3 47 1 75 and 2 88 1 07 mg l 1 were significantly higher than that in the suburban rivers 1 64 1 37 and 1 12 0 85 mg l 1 p 0 01 table 1 nh4 n was another dominant n form in the highly urbanized rivers accounting for 31 of tn in contrast to its lower percentages 14 in the suburban rivers there was no significant seasonal variation in no3 n and nh4 n concentrations p 0 05 table 1 overall compared to the suburban rivers the highly urbanized rivers were characterized by higher n loadings in addition to n contents n sources in the highly urbanized rivers differed from the suburban rivers in the highly urbanized rivers the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged from 3 21 to 32 70 and 10 21 to 34 51 respectively most of which fell within the isotopic range of manure and sewage zone fig 2 a indicating that domestic sewage was the dominant n source in addition the δ15n no3 values of most of the samples in the wet season were higher than those in the dry season fig 2a which suggested that the contribution of manure and sewage increased during the wet season in the suburban rivers the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged from 1 98 to 10 51 and 2 82 to 11 36 respectively which preferred the isotopic range of soil n zone fig 2a indicating that soil n was one of the dominant n sources in the rivers in addition the δ15n nh4 values provided additional evidence that high nh4 n loading in the highly urbanized rivers originated from domestic sewage fig 2b overall compared to the suburban rivers the highly urbanized rivers received larger n sources originating from treated or untreated sewage 3 2 microbial structure in the urban rivers the chao1 index fig 3 a and the shannon index fig 3b showed that the bacterial richness in the highly urbanized rivers was significantly higher than that in the suburban rivers p 0 05 the robustness of bacterial composition in the highly urbanized rivers was significantly lower than that in the suburban rivers p 0 05 fig 3d in addition the chao1 index showed that the bacterial richness in the wet season was higher than that in the dry season fig 3a the bacterial composition of samples collected in the wet season seemed to be more stable than that in the dry season fig 3d overall compared to the suburban rivers the bacterial community showed higher richness but lower robustness in the highly urbanized rivers which was also influenced by seasonal change network analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the interaction in bacterial communities and their responses to environmental changes deng et al 2012 based on the same threshold r 0 800 network sizes total number of nodes n were 422 region i d 477 region i w 67 region ii d and 94 region ii w for different sampling groups respectively fig 4 the network connectivity total number of links l were 1318 region i d 1146 region i w 35 region ii d and 81 region ii w for different sampling groups respectively fig 4 the nodes in the network of suburban rivers were divided into 11 phyla of which 3 phyla actinobacteria proteobacteria and cyanobateria were widely distributed fig 4 and table s3 in the suburban rivers the genus of chlorophyta was considered as the network hub which was also called super generalists in the highly urbanized rivers the nodes in the network were divided into 4 phyla including actinobacteria proteobacteria cyanobateria and fusobacteria fig 4 and table s3 the genera of bacillariophyta gpiia novosphingobium clostridium sensu stricto mycobacterium and sphingopyxis were seen as connectors and the remaining genera were called module hubs which were close to the generalists in the network however no central taxon was found in the highly urbanized rivers these results indicated that the network of microorganisms was less complex in the highly urbanized rivers than in the suburban river the relationship between the aquatic bacterial community and environmental factors was analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis cca fig 5 the cca showed that the first two axes explained 41 03 of the variation in the aquatic bacterial community the water samples were well separated into five groups interestingly samples of suburban rivers were separated into two groups among different seasons groups a and b however samples of highly urbanized rivers were separated into three groups groups c d and e the dissimilarity test indicated that the five groups bacterial community composition and environment variables were significantly different adonis r2 0 076 p 0 001 and anova p 0 01 the cca results indicated that n concentrations were essential factors affecting the bacterial community structure notably samples of group e were the most sensitive to n concentrations compared to other groups therefore n concentrations were the most significant environmental factor that shaped the specific bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers 3 3 bacterial community composition core taxa and functional genes of nitrification and denitrification in the urban rivers the relative abundance of specific genera of bacteria in the highly urbanized rivers was significantly higher than that in the suburban rivers fig 6 in the highly urbanized rivers the genus of arcobacter bacillariophyta ilumatobacter and rhodobacter were enriched during the dry season 12 91 10 83 3 18 and 2 62 respectively while the genera in the wet season mainly consisted of novosphingobium bacillariophyta gpiia and ilumatobacter 12 63 11 39 10 47 and 5 67 respectively in the suburban rivers genera of bacillariophyta 7 74 ilumatobacter 7 06 candidatus pelagibacter 4 13 and faecalibacterium 2 73 were enriched during the dry season while the genera of gpiia 10 11 ilumatobacter 6 38 novosphingobium 6 32 and bacillariophyta 5 47 had a higher relative abundance during the wet season the known functional taxa of n transformations nitrification and denitrification were found in guangzhou s urban river network their relative abundances and occurrence frequency were higher in the highly urbanized rivers than in suburban rivers table 2 and fig s2 the results identified 5 taxa of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria including nitrosomonas nitrobacter nitrospira nitrospina and nitrosospira among them nitrobacter had the highest relative abundance with a percentage of 0 03 and that was higher in the highly urbanized rivers than in the suburban rivers the results also identified 14 taxa of denitrifying bacteria including hyphomicrobium paracoccus rhodobacter sphingomonas alsobacter clostridium sensu stricto gemmobacter and others gemmobacter hyphomicrobium and paracoccus were the dominant taxa of denitrifying bacteria with percentages of 2 26 2 26 and 2 24 respectively like nitrifying bacteria the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria was higher in the highly urbanized rivers than in the suburban rivers table 2 and fig s2 the abundances of the nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifier gene nirk and nirs were relatively higher in the highly urbanized rivers as compared with those in the suburban rivers p 0 05 but there was no significant difference between the two seasons p 0 05 table 1 in the highly urbanized rivers there were 2 36 3 58 103 copies ml 1 of amoa 7 43 9 76 107 copies ml 1 of nirk 2 28 2 10 107 copies ml 1 of nirs in the suburban rivers there were 0 43 0 38 103 copies ml 1 of amoa 2 18 0 59 107 copies ml 1 of nirk 0 99 0 92 107 copies ml 1 of nirs the nirk nirs ratios in more than 95 of collected samples were greater than 1 indicating that the nirk type denitrifiers were consistently more abundant than nirk type denitrifiers in this urban river network the amoa gene abundance was positively correlated with no3 while these correlations were not found between the nirk nirs genes and n concentrations fig s3 3 4 major n transformations and their potential rates in the urban rivers multi isotopes approach provides valuable information regarding the biogeochemical processes of n in the river ecosystem denk et al 2017 jung et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 in this study environmental isotopes of δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o and calculated δ18o no3 nitrified based on eqs 2 and 3 were used to identify whether nitrification occurred in the rivers the relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was used to identify whether denitrification occurred in the rivers due to denitrification process could lead to an enrichment in both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values casciotti 2016 granger et al 2004 the results showed an unmistakable signal of coupled nitrification denitrification in the water samples during the sampling periods fig 7 a which indicated that nitrification denitrification processes did occur in the rivers in the highly urbanized rivers during the dry season which was characterized by higher n content table 1 and fig s1 a significant relationship was observed between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 01 and the ratio of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 2 08 fig 7b together with significant negative correlations between ln no3 n and δ18o no3 p 0 01 fig 7c suggesting that denitrification fingerprinting was obvious overall natural abundance isotopes showed that nitrification denitrification was the dominant n transformation in the urban rivers and denitrification was more evident in n enriched rivers to further confirm the enhancement of nitrification and denitrification we also measured the potential rates of nitrification and denitrification based on 15n isotope labeling methods the results showed that both the nitrification and denitrification rates were significantly higher in the highly urbanized rivers than that in the suburban rivers p 0 05 table 1 nitrification rates ranged from 3 61 to 58 61 nmol l 1 h 1 in the highly urbanized rivers and from 0 004 to 0 08 nmol l 1 h 1 in the suburban rivers there was no significant variation in nitrification rates between the two seasons p 0 05 the nitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with amoa gene abundances p 0 01 fig s4 indicating that nitrification was driven by amoa gene denitrification rates ranged from 2 24 to 189 70 nmol g 1 h 1 in the highly urbanized rivers and from 11 66 to 36 7 nmol g 1 h 1 in the suburban rivers in the highly urbanized rivers the denitrification rate was significantly higher in the dry season 118 54 nmol g 1 h 1 than that in the wet season 48 07 nmol g 1 h 1 p 0 05 which was consistent with the results from environmental isotopes the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with nirk nirs gene abundances p 0 01 fig s4 indicating that denitrifiers drove denitrification 4 discussion 4 1 sewage discharge and high n loading as dominant factors reshaping bacterial communities in urban river network urban rivers are hotspots where n loading increases due to exogenous input of nutrients to the rivers by anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2015 a substantial amount of exogenous discharge and high n loading could reshape the bacterial community structure of the river ecosystem in this study the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was characterized by higher richness less complexity and increased abundances of nitrification and denitrifying bacteria compared to those in the suburban rivers the specific bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers on the one hand was likely to be attributed to increased allochthonous microbes derived from point pollution sources e g wwtps or direct sewage discharge le et al 2020 subirats et al 2019 our data indicated that the relative abundances of sewer indicator bacteria arcobacter and fecal indicator bacteria lachnospiracea incertae sedis were higher in the highly urbanized rivers fig 6 in contrast higher relative abundance of actinobacteria and genus of ilumatobacter and candidatus pelagibacter commonly found in unpolluted freshwater environments eggleston 2015 zeglin 2015 were detected in the suburban rivers fig 6 these results indicated that the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers had been shifted due to sewage discharge by anthropogenic activities in addition sourcetracker analysis as described by knights et al 2011 detailed analysis methods see supplementary materials showed that sewage sources accounted for about 60 94 77 in dry season and 81 in wet season of all bacteria found in this urban river network our result was consistent with previous studies that sewage was a significant source of bacterial communities in the urban aquatic ecosystem frick et al 2020 li et al 2018 mansfeldt et al 2020 this result provided further and direct evidence that urban rivers received a large number of new microbes from wwtps or direct sewage discharge which was the primary reason for shifting in the bacterial community composition in the highly urbanized river network on the other hand changes in riverine environmental factors especially increased n concentrations caused by sewage discharge could further affect the aquatic bacterial community composition roberto et al 2018 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 in the present study strong linkages between environmental factors and bacterial communities were observed fig 5 among them n concentration was recognized as a major environmental factor affecting the changes in the aquatic bacterial community in highly urbanized rivers as shown in fig 5 a group sample group e was isolated the bacterial community of which was significantly correlated to n concentrations in the samples of this group n concentrations were significantly higher than that in the other groups p 0 01 and the mean n concentrations were 11 00 24 32 3 87 2 72 and 4 89 5 04 mg l 1 of tn no3 n and nh4 n respectively compared to other samples the samples with high n loadings detected higher relative abundances of arcobacter and cetobacterium arcobacter and cetobacterium were commonly found in freshwater environments but arcobacter was most known for being the dominant bacteria in sewage or fecal samples ferreira et al 2016 and cetobacterium was enriched in ammonia rich environments qi et al 2017 in addition the n enriched rivers had a higher relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria fig s2 gemmobacter hyphomicrobium and paracoccus were the main taxa of denitrifying bacteria and nitrobacter was the dominant taxa of nitrifying bacteria in this urban river network which was similar to the finding in other urban rivers hanson et al 2014 yang et al 2019 overall sewage discharge and high n loading resulted in changes in bacterial community structure especially increases in the denitrifying and nitrifying bacterium in the urban river network 4 2 enhanced nitrification denitrification processes driven by changed bacterial communities in urban river network changes in microbes have further influenced n transformations in the urban river network in this study enhanced nitrification denitrification processes were observed in the highly urbanized rivers as compared to those in the suburban rivers evidenced by environmental isotopes fig 7 and the nitrification and denitrification rates table 1 this finding differed from previous studies conducted in suburban or natural rivers which found that nitrification and assimilation were the significant processes contributing to the n transformations han et al 2018 xuan et al 2021 however this study found that enhanced nitrification denitrification processes were similar to wastewater treatment plants jung et al 2021 in addition the nitrification rates in the highly urbanized rivers of guangzhou were relatively higher than those reported in the aquatic ecosystems of the estuary wang et al 2018 current santoro et al 2010 and gulf carini et al 2010 and was comparable to that observed in the effluent from wastewater mclaughlin et al 2017 table s4 the accelerated nitrification in the highly urbanized rivers was due to the availability of a continuous concentrated ammonium source from sewage outlet which would provide a rich substrate for ammonium oxidizing mclaughlin et al 2017 the denitrification rates in the highly urbanized rivers of guangzhou were comparable to those measured in the eutrophic waters laverman et al 2010 sharma et al 2020 and were higher than those measured in the ponds cai et al 2022 and estuary gao et al 2022 table s4 in this study an accelerated denitrification rate was observed in the dry season table 1 which corresponded to higher n contents fig s1 and changes in bacterial communities in the dry season as compared to the wet season fig 5 therefore our results suggested that changes in microbes due to the high loadings of sewage and n accelerated potential for nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers abundant nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifiers genes nirk and nirs in this urban river network provided additional evidence that microbial nitrification denitrification dominated riverine n transformation processes in both the dry and wet seasons amoa nirk and nirs gene abundances were significantly higher in the highly urbanized rivers than those in the suburban rivers table 1 in addition significant positive correlations were observed between amoa gene abundances and nitrification rates as well as between nirs nirk gene abundances and denitrification rates fig s5 these results indicated that enhanced nitrification denitrification was driven by increased nitrifier and denitrifiers our finding was also supported by the results of previous studies that high n input in the urban rivers favored the growth of nitrifier amoa of aob lin et al 2020b and denitrifiers nirs and nirk yan et al 2018 in addition compared to previous studies lin et al 2020b zhang et al 2022 amoa nirs and nirk gene abundances in the highly urbanized rivers of this study were higher than those reported in different types of aquatic ecosystems including urban rivers agricultural rivers and lakes table s5 this finding provided further evidence of a high potential for nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rives the denitrifiers gene abundances were higher than nitrifier gene abundances in the rivers table 1 which was consistent with the result that denitrifying bacteria were relatively more abundant than nitrite oxidizing bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria fig s2 this result suggested that denitrification was the dominant n transformation process in the water column it is generally recognized that denitrification often occurs in the sediment due to its anoxic environment in this study abundant nirs and nirk genes in suspended matter and rapid denitrification rates suggested that denitrification occurred in the water column this result was also supported by previous studies liu et al 2013 xia et al 2017 zhu et al 2018a however different from other studies song et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 zhu et al 2018b our results showed that nirk gene was more numerous than nirs gene table 1 previous studies have shown that nirk achieved high abundances in aerobic environments knapp et al 2009 whereas nirs had more abundance in anoxic locations huang et al 2011 the mean do concentration was 5 49 mg l 1 in this study which was beneficial to nirk gene therefore we concluded that high loadings of sewage and n accelerated the growth of nitrifier amoa and denitrifiers nirk which enhanced coupled nitrification denitrification in the urban rivers 4 3 implications of n cycling in the urban river ecosystem the urban river is a unique ecosystem due to substantial sewage input characterized by a specific microbial community structure and a hotspot of n transformation however the dominant n transformation process and its response to microbes in the urban rivers are still unclear this study highlighted enhanced microbial nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers from comprehensive evidence including multi isotopic signatures n transformation rates and n cycle functional genes due to sewage discharge and high n loading coupled nitrification denitrification was driven by changes in microbes in the highly urbanized rivers our results have shown that sewage discharge provided an equivalent flux of n especially the form of ammonium and was favorable for nitrifying and denitrifying bacterium growth given this finding this study suggested that nitrification of sewage effluent ammonium can provide a significant source of nitrate to the urban rivers which are subsequently converted by denitrifiers during the denitrification process nitrification and denitrification are important processes that can produce n2o a significant contributor to global climate change quick et al 2019 thompson et al 2019 hence this study suggested that changes in microorganisms have enhanced the microbial nitrification denitrification processes in the urban river network which was beneficial to n pollution removal but also increased the risk of n2o emissions our study contributes to an evolving conceptual model for how anthropogenic nutrients may shape microbial communities and further affect n cycling in highly urbanized rivers our study also expands the combined application of isotopic technology and bioinformatics methods in studying biogeochemical cycling in the river ecosystem given the complexity of n cycling in the urban rivers more work should be conducted to estimate rates and gene abundances of different n transformations except for nitrification and denitrification which would provide more precise contributions of riverine n cycling to the global n budget 5 conclusions we combined the isotopic tracing technology natural abundance isotopes survey and isotope labeling method and bioinformatic methods 16s rrna gene based high throughput sequencing and qpcr analysis to investigate the biogeochemical processes of n as well as microbial communities in the urban river network of guangzhou china the major conclusions of this study are detailed below n loading was significantly higher in highly urbanized rivers than in suburban rivers no3 n and nh4 n were the dominant forms of dissolved n in the highly urbanized rivers which were mainly derived from domestic sewage discharge the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was characterized by higher richness less complexity and increased relative abundances of nitrification bacteria e g nitrobacter and denitrifying bacteria e g gemmobacter hyphomicrobium and paracoccus as compared with the suburban rivers the specific bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was mainly attributed to microbial input 60 94 from domestic sewage and high n loadings changes in microorganisms have enhanced nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers compared with suburban rivers evidenced by environmental isotopic signatures increased nitrification and denitrification rates and higher abundances of nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifiers

15626,urban rivers are hotspots of regional nitrogen n pollution and n transformations previous studies have reported that the microbial community of urban rivers was different from that of natural rivers however how microbial community affects n transformations in the urban rivers is still unclear in this study we employed n nutrients related isotope technology includes natural abundance isotopes survey and isotope labeling method and bioinformatics methods includes 16s rrna high throughput sequencing and quantitative pcr analysis to investigate the major n transformations microbial communities as well as functional gene abundances in a metropolitan river network our results suggested that the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was characterized by higher richness less complexity and increased abundances of nitrification and denitrifying bacterium compared to those in the suburban rivers these differences were mainly caused by high sewage discharge and n loadings in addition the abundances of nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifier genes nirk and nirs were significantly higher in the highly urbanized rivers 2 36 103 7 43 107 and 2 28 107 copies ml 1 than that in the suburban rivers 0 43 103 2 18 107 and 0 99 107 copies ml 1 these changes in microbes have accelerated nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers as compared to those in the suburban rivers which was evidenced by environmental isotopes and the rates of nitrification 10 52 vs 0 03 nmol l 1 h 1 and denitrification 83 31 vs 22 49 nmol g 1 h 1 overall this study concluded that the excess exogenous n has significantly shaped the specific aquatic bacterial communities which had a potential for enhancing nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized river network this study provides a further understanding of microbial n cycling in urban river ecosystems and expands the combined application of isotopic technology and bioinformatics methods in studying biogeochemical cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen cycling bacterial community isotope urban river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activities have significantly changed the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients such as nitrogen n in atmospheric terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems over the past decades leading to a series of environmental and ecological problems conley et al 2009 fowler et al 2013 kendall et al 2007 metropolitan areas are hotspots driving environmental change since they carry over half of the global population phaneuf et al 2008 many cities are located along water bodies especially rivers which serve as an important sink for urban sewage stormwater runoff and waste materials phaneuf et al 2008 thus urban rivers represent a unique ecosystem where n pollution occurs regularly and are recognized as a hotspot of n transformations urban rivers receive a substantial amount of treated sewage from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and occasionally untreated sewage by direct discharge which potentially leads to the reshaping of aquatic bacterial community structure hladilek et al 2016 lin and lin 2022 zhou et al 2022 on the one hand allochthonous sources would introduce microbiological contamination and affect the diversity and structure of the aquatic bacterial community drury et al 2013 for example previous research has found significant differences in the composition of the bacterial communities under the influence of different types of domestic pollution e g residential hotel school and hospital sewage zhang et al 2020 the urban rivers receiving effluent from wwtps had been characterized by decreases in the population size and diversity of bacterial communities and increases in the abundance of nitrospirae and sphingobacteria drury et al 2013 pascual benito et al 2020 on the other hand treated and untreated sewage containing lots of organic and inorganic pollutants may greatly alter the riverine environmental conditions for example increasing sewage discharge has caused excessive n loading to urban rivers and changes in ph and dissolved oxygen dong et al 2020 xuan et al 2020 these changes can reshape the microbial communities and further affect microbial activities and rates of n transformations archana et al 2016 eckert et al 2018 thus understanding the impact of n sources and n loadings on changes in aquatic bacterial communities is the primary step to gain greater insight into n cycling in urban rivers changes in bacterial community structure due to exogenous input and high n loading would further alter n transformation processes in urban rivers kuypers et al 2018 numerous studies have speculated potential n transformation and discussed its response to the bacterial community in aquatic ecosystems based on profiling phylogenetic marker genes such as the 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing hanson et al 2014 shu et al 2016 tran et al 2021 for example one study has shown that denitrification was the central process associated with elevated levels of carbon and nitrogen contents and extracellular enzyme activities in riparian and stream sediments kim et al 2016 however little is known about the response of n transformation processes to changes in bacterial community structure in urban river ecosystems under highly human disturbance a possible reason is that the bioinformatics analysis can not determine whether the n transformations occurred due to a large fraction of dormant cells within the communities that have been detected but without activity roberto et al 2018 to overcome this point the isotope tracer technique including natural abundance isotope survey and isotope labeling methods appears to be a powerful tool for qualitative and quantitative characterization of n transformations the natural abundance of multi isotopes could give an obvious signal of the major n transformation processes which have occurred in the rivers as each process has an individual preference for the common or rare isotope isotope effect denk et al 2017 xue et al 2009 isotopically enriched labelling methods could estimate potential rates of different n transformations santoro et al 2010 steingruber et al 2001 which would provide solid evidence of n transformations in the rivers hence the isotope tracer technique gives direct evidence of revealing the predominant n transformation processes and their rates in the urban river ecosystem with complex biogeochemical cycling michener and lajtha 2008 overall it is urgent to use a combination of isotope tracer technique and microbiological survey to reveal the microbial mediated n transformations in urban rivers which could enhance our understanding of n cycling and its response to the changes in bacterial community structure in the urban river ecosystem over the past few years china has experienced unprecedented urbanization and is now facing and solving numerous environmental problems guangzhou with its advantageous geographic location and extremely rapid urbanization rate due to the economic reform beginning in 1978 and economic development strategies of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba has become one of the largest metropolises in china gong et al 2018 xu and yeh 2003 zhou et al 2018 situated at the northern tip of the pearl river delta near the mouth of the pearl river estuary guangzhou is an area with a dense network of waterways and creeks since fast urbanization and industrialization the rivers in guangzhou have received rainfall runoff effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps or even untreated wastewater from surroundings severely deteriorated and carried excess n loading dong et al 2020 numerous studies have investigated n cycling in urbanized watersheds such as n fluxes and retention hobbie et al 2017 lin et al 2020a n sources transformation processes based on isotopes jung et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 and effects of urban sewage on n cycle related microorganisms zhang et al 2020 however it is still unclear about the characteristics of bacterial community structure and its link to n transformations in the highly human impacted urban rivers the working hypothesis of this study is that the excess exogenous n significantly reshapes the aquatic bacterial communities in the highly urbanized river network and subsequently alters the n transformations and the fate of n in the rivers therefore this study aims to investigate in a highly urbanized river network and mainly focuses on two aspects 1 to characterize the changes in aquatic microbial communities and n related functional genes in highly urbanized rivers using high throughput sequencing and 2 to reveal the dominant processes of n transformations and their potential rates driven by the changed microbes and functional genes based on stable isotope tracer technology the results of this study will enhance our understanding of n cycling in urban rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area guangzhou city 112o57 114o03 e 22o26 23o56 n the

denitrification rates in both the dry and wet seasons using the 15n tracer technique the nitrification rate in the water column was determined following the work of mclaughlin et al 2017 and santoro

provide clear evidence for the nitrification process in the river ecosystem the oxygen isotope in nitrate from nitrification δ18o no3 nitrified is derived from one oxygen atom of the atmospheric o2 and two other oxygen atoms of two thirds of the ambient water thus if these oxygen atoms are included without isotopic fractionation the δ18o no3 value produced by nitrification can be calculated as follows eq 2 kendall et al 2007 2 δ 18 o no 3 nitrified 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 however δ18o no3 nitrified is likely to be more depleted than that predicted using eq 2 owing to the abiotic o atom exchange between nitrite and h2o and the isotopic fractionation associated with the incorporation of o atoms during the nitrification and the δ18o no3 nitrified can be calculated as following eq

to its lower percentages 14 in the suburban rivers there was no significant seasonal variation in no3 n and nh4 n concentrations p 0 05 table 1 overall compared to the suburban rivers the highly urbanized rivers were characterized by higher n loadings in addition to n contents n sources in the highly urbanized rivers differed from the suburban rivers in the highly urbanized rivers the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged from 3 21 to 32 70 and 10 21 to 34 51 respectively most of which fell within the isotopic range of manure and sewage zone fig 2 a indicating that domestic sewage was the dominant n source in addition the δ15n no3 values of most of the samples in the wet season were higher than those in the dry season fig 2a which suggested that the contribution of manure and sewage increased during the wet season in the suburban rivers the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged from 1 98 to 10 51 and 2 82 to 11 36 respectively which preferred the isotopic range of soil n zone fig 2a indicating that soil n was one of the dominant n sources in the rivers in addition the δ15n nh4 values provided additional evidence that high nh4 n loading in the highly urbanized rivers originated from domestic sewage fig 2b overall compared to the suburban rivers the highly urbanized rivers received larger n sources originating from treated or untreated sewage 3 2 microbial structure in the urban rivers the chao1 index fig 3 a and the shannon index fig 3b showed that the bacterial richness in the highly urbanized rivers was significantly higher than that in the suburban rivers p 0 05 the robustness of bacterial composition in the highly urbanized rivers was significantly lower than that in the suburban rivers p 0 05 fig 3d in addition the chao1 index showed that the bacterial richness in the wet season was higher than that in the dry season fig 3a the bacterial composition of samples collected in the wet season seemed to be more stable than that in the dry season fig 3d overall compared to the suburban rivers the bacterial community showed higher richness but lower robustness in the highly urbanized rivers which was also influenced by seasonal change network analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of the interaction in bacterial communities and their responses to environmental changes deng et al 2012 based on the same threshold r 0 800 network sizes total number of nodes n were 422 region i d 477 region i w 67 region ii d and 94 region ii w for different sampling groups respectively fig 4 the network connectivity total number of links l were 1318 region i d 1146 region i w 35 region ii d and 81 region ii w for different sampling groups respectively fig 4 the nodes in the network of suburban rivers were divided into 11 phyla of which 3 phyla actinobacteria proteobacteria and cyanobateria were widely distributed fig 4 and table s3 in the suburban rivers the genus of chlorophyta was considered as the network hub which was also called super generalists in the highly urbanized rivers the nodes in the network were divided into 4 phyla including actinobacteria proteobacteria cyanobateria and fusobacteria fig 4 and table s3 the genera of bacillariophyta gpiia novosphingobium clostridium sensu stricto mycobacterium and sphingopyxis were seen as connectors and the remaining genera were called module hubs which were close to the generalists in the network however no central taxon was found in the highly urbanized rivers these results indicated that the network of microorganisms was less complex in the highly urbanized rivers than in the suburban river the relationship between the aquatic bacterial community and environmental factors was analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis cca fig 5 the cca showed that the first two axes explained 41 03 of the variation in the aquatic bacterial community the water samples were well separated into five groups interestingly samples of suburban rivers were separated into two groups among different seasons groups a and b however samples of highly urbanized rivers were separated into three groups groups c d and e the dissimilarity test indicated that the five groups bacterial community composition and environment variables were significantly different adonis r2 0 076 p 0 001 and anova p 0 01 the cca results indicated that n concentrations were essential factors affecting the bacterial community structure notably samples of group e were the most sensitive to n concentrations compared to other groups therefore n concentrations were the most significant environmental factor that shaped the specific bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers 3 3 bacterial community composition core taxa and functional genes of nitrification and denitrification in the urban rivers the relative abundance of specific genera of bacteria in the highly urbanized rivers was significantly higher than that in the suburban rivers fig 6 in the highly urbanized rivers the genus of arcobacter bacillariophyta ilumatobacter and rhodobacter were enriched during the dry season 12 91 10 83 3 18 and 2 62 respectively while the genera in the wet season mainly consisted of novosphingobium bacillariophyta gpiia and ilumatobacter 12 63 11 39 10 47 and 5 67 respectively in the suburban rivers genera of bacillariophyta 7 74 ilumatobacter 7 06 candidatus pelagibacter 4 13 and faecalibacterium 2 73 were enriched during the dry season while the genera of gpiia 10 11 ilumatobacter 6 38 novosphingobium 6 32 and bacillariophyta 5 47 had a higher relative abundance during the wet season the known functional taxa of n transformations nitrification and denitrification were found in guangzhou s urban river network their relative abundances and occurrence frequency were higher in the highly urbanized rivers than in suburban rivers table 2 and fig s2 the results identified 5 taxa of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria including nitrosomonas nitrobacter nitrospira nitrospina and nitrosospira among them nitrobacter had the highest relative abundance with a percentage of 0 03 and that was higher in the highly urbanized rivers than in the suburban rivers the results also identified 14 taxa of denitrifying bacteria including hyphomicrobium paracoccus rhodobacter sphingomonas alsobacter clostridium sensu stricto gemmobacter and others gemmobacter hyphomicrobium and paracoccus were the dominant taxa of denitrifying bacteria with percentages of 2 26 2 26 and 2 24 respectively like nitrifying bacteria the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria was higher in the highly urbanized rivers than in the suburban rivers table 2 and fig s2 the abundances of the nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifier gene nirk and nirs were relatively higher in the highly urbanized rivers as compared with those in the suburban rivers p 0 05 but there was no significant difference between the two seasons p 0 05 table 1 in the highly urbanized rivers there were 2 36 3 58 103 copies ml 1 of amoa 7 43 9 76 107 copies ml 1 of nirk 2 28 2 10 107 copies ml 1 of nirs in the suburban rivers there were 0 43 0 38 103 copies ml 1 of amoa 2 18 0 59 107 copies ml 1 of nirk 0 99 0 92 107 copies ml 1 of nirs the nirk nirs ratios in more than 95 of collected samples were greater than 1 indicating that the nirk type denitrifiers were consistently more abundant than nirk type denitrifiers in this urban river network the amoa gene abundance was positively correlated with no3 while these correlations were not found between the nirk nirs genes and n concentrations fig s3 3 4 major n transformations and their potential rates in the urban rivers multi isotopes approach provides valuable information regarding the biogeochemical processes of n in the river ecosystem denk et al 2017 jung et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 in this study environmental isotopes of δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o and calculated δ18o no3 nitrified based on eqs 2 and 3 were used to identify whether nitrification occurred in the rivers the relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was used to identify whether denitrification occurred in the rivers due to denitrification process could lead to an enrichment in both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values casciotti 2016 granger et al 2004 the results showed an unmistakable signal of coupled nitrification denitrification in the water samples during the sampling periods fig 7 a which indicated that nitrification denitrification processes did occur in the rivers in the highly urbanized rivers during the dry season which was characterized by higher n content table 1 and fig s1 a significant relationship was observed between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 01 and the ratio of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 2 08 fig 7b together with significant negative correlations between ln no3 n and δ18o no3 p 0 01 fig 7c suggesting that denitrification fingerprinting was obvious overall natural abundance isotopes showed that nitrification denitrification was the dominant n transformation in the urban rivers and denitrification was more evident in n enriched rivers to further confirm the enhancement of nitrification and denitrification we also measured the potential rates of nitrification and denitrification based on 15n isotope labeling methods the results showed that both the nitrification and denitrification rates were significantly higher in the highly urbanized rivers than that in the suburban rivers p 0 05 table 1 nitrification rates ranged from 3 61 to 58 61 nmol l 1 h 1 in the highly urbanized rivers and from 0 004 to 0 08 nmol l 1 h 1 in the suburban rivers there was no significant variation in nitrification rates between the two seasons p 0 05 the nitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with amoa gene abundances p 0 01 fig s4 indicating that nitrification was driven by amoa gene denitrification rates ranged from 2 24 to 189 70 nmol g 1 h 1 in the highly urbanized rivers and from 11 66 to 36 7 nmol g 1 h 1 in the suburban rivers in the highly urbanized rivers the denitrification rate was significantly higher in the dry season 118 54 nmol g 1 h 1 than that in the wet season 48 07 nmol g 1 h 1 p 0 05 which was consistent with the results from environmental isotopes the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with nirk nirs gene abundances p 0 01 fig s4 indicating that denitrifiers drove denitrification 4 discussion 4 1 sewage discharge and high n loading as dominant factors reshaping bacterial communities in urban river network urban rivers are hotspots where n loading increases due to exogenous input of nutrients to the rivers by anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2015 a substantial amount of exogenous discharge and high n loading could reshape the bacterial community structure of the river ecosystem in this study the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was characterized by higher richness less complexity and increased abundances of nitrification and denitrifying bacteria compared to those in the suburban rivers the specific bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers on the one hand was likely to be attributed to increased allochthonous microbes derived from point pollution sources e g wwtps or direct sewage discharge le et al 2020 subirats et al 2019 our data indicated that the relative abundances of sewer indicator bacteria arcobacter and fecal indicator bacteria lachnospiracea incertae sedis were higher in the highly urbanized rivers fig 6 in contrast higher relative abundance of actinobacteria and genus of ilumatobacter and candidatus pelagibacter commonly found in unpolluted freshwater environments eggleston 2015 zeglin 2015 were detected in the suburban rivers fig 6 these results indicated that the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers had been shifted due to sewage discharge by anthropogenic activities in addition sourcetracker analysis as described by knights et al 2011 detailed analysis methods see supplementary materials showed that sewage sources accounted for about 60 94 77 in dry season and 81 in wet season of all bacteria found in this urban river network our result was consistent with previous studies that sewage was a significant source of bacterial communities in the urban aquatic ecosystem frick et al 2020 li et al 2018 mansfeldt et al 2020 this result provided further and direct evidence that urban rivers received a large number of new microbes from wwtps or direct sewage discharge which was the primary reason for shifting in the bacterial community composition in the highly urbanized river network on the other hand changes in riverine environmental factors especially increased n concentrations caused by sewage discharge could further affect the aquatic bacterial community composition roberto et al 2018 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 in the present study strong linkages between environmental factors and bacterial communities were observed fig 5 among them n concentration was recognized as a major environmental factor affecting the changes in the aquatic bacterial community in highly urbanized rivers as shown in fig 5 a group sample group e was isolated the bacterial community of which was significantly correlated to n concentrations in the samples of this group n concentrations were significantly higher than that in the other groups p 0 01 and the mean n concentrations were 11 00 24 32 3 87 2 72 and 4 89 5 04 mg l 1 of tn no3 n and nh4 n respectively compared to other samples the samples with high n loadings detected higher relative abundances of arcobacter and cetobacterium arcobacter and cetobacterium were commonly found in freshwater environments but arcobacter was most known for being the dominant bacteria in sewage or fecal samples ferreira et al 2016 and cetobacterium was enriched in ammonia rich environments qi et al 2017 in addition the n enriched rivers had a higher relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria fig s2 gemmobacter hyphomicrobium and paracoccus were the main taxa of denitrifying bacteria and nitrobacter was the dominant taxa of nitrifying bacteria in this urban river network which was similar to the finding in other urban rivers hanson et al 2014 yang et al 2019 overall sewage discharge and high n loading resulted in changes in bacterial community structure especially increases in the denitrifying and nitrifying bacterium in the urban river network 4 2 enhanced nitrification denitrification processes driven by changed bacterial communities in urban river network changes in microbes have further influenced n transformations in the urban river network in this study enhanced nitrification denitrification processes were observed in the highly urbanized rivers as compared to those in the suburban rivers evidenced by environmental isotopes fig 7 and the nitrification and denitrification rates table 1 this finding differed from previous studies conducted in suburban or natural rivers which found that nitrification and assimilation were the significant processes contributing to the n transformations han et al 2018 xuan et al 2021 however this study found that enhanced nitrification denitrification processes were similar to wastewater treatment plants jung et al 2021 in addition the nitrification rates in the highly urbanized rivers of guangzhou were relatively higher than those reported in the aquatic ecosystems of the estuary wang et al 2018 current santoro et al 2010 and gulf carini et al 2010 and was comparable to that observed in the effluent from wastewater mclaughlin et al 2017 table s4 the accelerated nitrification in the highly urbanized rivers was due to the availability of a continuous concentrated ammonium source from sewage outlet which would provide a rich substrate for ammonium oxidizing mclaughlin et al 2017 the denitrification rates in the highly urbanized rivers of guangzhou were comparable to those measured in the eutrophic waters laverman et al 2010 sharma et al 2020 and were higher than those measured in the ponds cai et al 2022 and estuary gao et al 2022 table s4 in this study an accelerated denitrification rate was observed in the dry season table 1 which corresponded to higher n contents fig s1 and changes in bacterial communities in the dry season as compared to the wet season fig 5 therefore our results suggested that changes in microbes due to the high loadings of sewage and n accelerated potential for nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers abundant nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifiers genes nirk and nirs in this urban river network provided additional evidence that microbial nitrification denitrification dominated riverine n transformation processes in both the dry and wet seasons amoa nirk and nirs gene abundances were significantly higher in the highly urbanized rivers than those in the suburban rivers table 1 in addition significant positive correlations were observed between amoa gene abundances and nitrification rates as well as between nirs nirk gene abundances and denitrification rates fig s5 these results indicated that enhanced nitrification denitrification was driven by increased nitrifier and denitrifiers our finding was also supported by the results of previous studies that high n input in the urban rivers favored the growth of nitrifier amoa of aob lin et al 2020b and denitrifiers nirs and nirk yan et al 2018 in addition compared to previous studies lin et al 2020b zhang et al 2022 amoa nirs and nirk gene abundances in the highly urbanized rivers of this study were higher than those reported in different types of aquatic ecosystems including urban rivers agricultural rivers and lakes table s5 this finding provided further evidence of a high potential for nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rives the denitrifiers gene abundances were higher than nitrifier gene abundances in the rivers table 1 which was consistent with the result that denitrifying bacteria were relatively more abundant than nitrite oxidizing bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria fig s2 this result suggested that denitrification was the dominant n transformation process in the water column it is generally recognized that denitrification often occurs in the sediment due to its anoxic environment in this study abundant nirs and nirk genes in suspended matter and rapid denitrification rates suggested that denitrification occurred in the water column this result was also supported by previous studies liu et al 2013 xia et al 2017 zhu et al 2018a however different from other studies song et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 zhu et al 2018b our results showed that nirk gene was more numerous than nirs gene table 1 previous studies have shown that nirk achieved high abundances in aerobic environments knapp et al 2009 whereas nirs had more abundance in anoxic locations huang et al 2011 the mean do concentration was 5 49 mg l 1 in this study which was beneficial to nirk gene therefore we concluded that high loadings of sewage and n accelerated the growth of nitrifier amoa and denitrifiers nirk which enhanced coupled nitrification denitrification in the urban rivers 4 3 implications of n cycling in the urban river ecosystem the urban river is a unique ecosystem due to substantial sewage input characterized by a specific microbial community structure and a hotspot of n transformation however the dominant n transformation process and its response to microbes in the urban rivers are still unclear this study highlighted enhanced microbial nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers from comprehensive evidence including multi isotopic signatures n transformation rates and n cycle functional genes due to sewage discharge and high n loading coupled nitrification denitrification was driven by changes in microbes in the highly urbanized rivers our results have shown that sewage discharge provided an equivalent flux of n especially the form of ammonium and was favorable for nitrifying and denitrifying bacterium growth given this finding this study suggested that nitrification of sewage effluent ammonium can provide a significant source of nitrate to the urban rivers which are subsequently converted by denitrifiers during the denitrification process nitrification and denitrification are important processes that can produce n2o a significant contributor to global climate change quick et al 2019 thompson et al 2019 hence this study suggested that changes in microorganisms have enhanced the microbial nitrification denitrification processes in the urban river network which was beneficial to n pollution removal but also increased the risk of n2o emissions our study contributes to an evolving conceptual model for how anthropogenic nutrients may shape microbial communities and further affect n cycling in highly urbanized rivers our study also expands the combined application of isotopic technology and bioinformatics methods in studying biogeochemical cycling in the river ecosystem given the complexity of n cycling in the urban rivers more work should be conducted to estimate rates and gene abundances of different n transformations except for nitrification and denitrification which would provide more precise contributions of riverine n cycling to the global n budget 5 conclusions we combined the isotopic tracing technology natural abundance isotopes survey and isotope labeling method and bioinformatic methods 16s rrna gene based high throughput sequencing and qpcr analysis to investigate the biogeochemical processes of n as well as microbial communities in the urban river network of guangzhou china the major conclusions of this study are detailed below n loading was significantly higher in highly urbanized rivers than in suburban rivers no3 n and nh4 n were the dominant forms of dissolved n in the highly urbanized rivers which were mainly derived from domestic sewage discharge the bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was characterized by higher richness less complexity and increased relative abundances of nitrification bacteria e g nitrobacter and denitrifying bacteria e g gemmobacter hyphomicrobium and paracoccus as compared with the suburban rivers the specific bacterial community structure in the highly urbanized rivers was mainly attributed to microbial input 60 94 from domestic sewage and high n loadings changes in microorganisms have enhanced nitrification denitrification processes in the highly urbanized rivers compared with suburban rivers evidenced by environmental isotopic signatures increased nitrification and denitrification rates and higher abundances of nitrifier gene amoa and denitrifiers

15627,the widespread contamination of antibiotic resistance genes args in freshwater environment are becoming a serious challenge to human health and ecological safety rapid and efficient monitoring of args pollution is of great significance to args control water bottom mud and fish have all been used to indicate arg contamination in aquatic environments however it is unclear whether macrobenthic invertebrates in the food chain of aquatic environments can be indicators of arg contamination in this study we demonstrated that args including teta gene sul2 gene and km gene were distributed in chironomidae larvae in weishan lake the arg distribution was related to animal species body parts sampling sites time urban environment animal farming south to north water diversion food chain antibiotics and water storage mathematical model predictions of arg contamination in weishan lake were constructed based on the structural equation model sem and the distribution of arg sul2 in chironomidae larvae influencing factors such as water storage metal elements antibiotic and temperature were found to be closely related to the prediction of arg contamination this study provided a new indicator for arg contamination in freshwater environments and a method to predict args contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords distribution model prediction antibiotic resistance genes weishan lake the indication of chironomidae larvae data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater lakes are an important environment for antibiotic resistance gene arg transfer and diffusion ding et al 2021 yang et al 2017 args of sulfa tetracycline ampicillin oxygen pyrimidine quinolone aureomycin gentamicin and erythromycin widely distributed in lakes return to the human environment as drinking and irrigation water sources posing potential risks to human health vaseeharan et al 2009 yang et al 2016 luo et al 2017 weishan lake at the junction of jiangsu province and shandong province is the largest lake in north china and the second largest fresh water lake in the huaihe river it is in the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project which is important for drinking irrigation breeding reservoir flood control water supply shipping tourism and other functions hence it has an important influence on the cities in the basin luo et al 2017 sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 although arg contamination in many lakes has been reported arg contamination and its interrelationship with people s lives in weishan lake is rarely reported the traditional detection and prediction of arg contamination are indicated by the detection of arg in water bottom mud and fish which have obvious defects the detection of args in water needs to go through the enrichment step which is time consuming and labor intensive ding et al 2021 the detection of args in bottom mud is difficult and the extraction of dna requires expensive kits muziasari et al 2016 given that fish swim in water the accuracy of arg indication is questionable resistance bacteria and args are widely distributed in aquatic animals such as rainbow trout catfish tilapia medaka mozambique tilapia zebrafish and ornamental fish guglielmetti et al 2009 vaseeharan et al 2004 kawakami 2007 son et al 1997 vernerjeffreys et al 2009 muziasari et al 2016 among aquatic animals fish shrimp and crabs are all higher vertebrates that can indicate the distribution of args in freshwater lakes jo et al 2021 fang et al 2019 recently args have been detected in daphnia which is a kind of lower invertebrate plankton arg teta and vana are detected in daphnia in aquatic environments and the mode of arg transfer is plasmid mediated conjugation transfer olanrewaju et al 2019 eckert et al 2016 as indicators of arg contamination aquatic animals such as fish shrimp crabs and daphnia have the disadvantages of small quantity and difficulty to catch moreover due to the high migration of these organisms the arg content in these organisms is not consistent with that in the water therefore new genetic indicators of arg contamination are urgently needed it is not clear whether invertebrates can be used as indicators of args in benthic environments where resistance genes and bacteria are abundant chironomidae larvae is a typical benthic invertebrate that is a natural feed for fish it can be used as an indicator of water nutrient type for environmental monitoring and for water quality evaluation and has an effect on sewage self purification fard et al 2014 jo et al 2020 therefore the indicator function of chironomidae larvae especially for arg contamination remains to be further studied monitoring of args in lakes is required for water sources user safety sulfa and tetracycline resistance genes are almost 100 distributed in these lakes and the content of args is closely related to antibiotics and resistance bacteria released from municipal sewage and animal farm yang et al 2016 2017 luo et al 2017 vaseeharan et al 2009 so the monitoring and prediction of arg contamination in freshwater lakes for sewage disposal and animal farming has become a hot issue in the field of environmental toxicology in recent years jang et al 2021 however due to the diversity of environmental factors the complexity of the factors influence on one another and the replicability and transferability of args themselves the model prediction is difficult structural equation model sem is a model utilized to identify relationships among surveyed and measured variables it can inform decision making and be adapted to probe social dynamics for water and sanitation in unincorporated communities rowles et al 2020 this model is also used to assess the effects of pollutants discharged to streams caused by anthropogenic land use on water quality and the benthic macroinvertebrate lee et al 2020 however the correlation between args in water environment and benthic macroinvertebrate and its influencing factors remain unclear in the case of multi factor analysis sem analysis becomes a possible method in this study the distribution of args in macrobenthic invertebrates especially for chironomidae larvae in xuehe river and weishan lake was observed the affecting factors involved in animal species body parts sampling sites time urban environment animal farming south to north water diversion food chain and antibiotic in different water storage were also studied a sem of arg in weishan lake based on the indication of chironomidae larvae was explored and influencing factors such as water storage metal elements antibiotic and temperature were analyzed the arg contamination prediction of the sem formula was explored to regulate the key environmental factors for guiding the south to north water diversion and the seasonal discharge of municipal sewage to freshwater lakes this study provided a new indicator with the advantages of simplicity speed and accuracy for arg contamination in freshwater environments and a method to predict args contamination for guiding prevention and control 2 materials and

fish fig 3 3 4 effect of south to north water diversion on the distribution of arg in chironomidae larvae to observe the effect of south to north water diversion on the distribution of arg in weishan lake the contents of arg sul2 in chironomidae larvae before and after the water diversion were detected in aihu village weishan island hanzhuang gate and duck farm the contents of arg sul2 in chironomidae larvae of all sampling sites after the south to north water diversion decreased fig 4 3 5 mathematical model for the prediction of arg contamination the concentrations of arg sul2 in chironomidae larvae water metal element al and antibiotic were measured and the data of water storage and temperature were collected all the data are listed in table 2 pairwise correlations between the variates were analyzed from the data the concentration of arg was not directly related to water storage and temperature was not directly related to the concentration of antibiotic however there was a significant correlation between the other variates fig 5 a according to principal component analysis pca a correlation circle was used to show the representation of each variate in each principal component high cos2 value indicates that the variate has good representation in the principal component which was close to the circumference in the correlation circle the figure reveals that the 5 variates were all close to the periphery of the circle and had good representativeness fig 5b proportion photography of the principal components was used to show the contribution of each variate in each principal component high cos2 value indicates that the variate has good contribution in the principal component which was located in dim 1 and dim 2 the results showed that all five variables contributed significantly to the first two principal components according to the correlation and contribution rate of the above variables five variables were inferred to be important factors all of which were involved in the construction of sem fig 5c fig 5 shows that water storage had a significant negative correlation with temperature the concentration of metal element al and the concentration of antibiotic the correlation between water storage and the concentration of arg sul2 in chironomidae larvae was not significant so it was judged that there was no direct correlation between them temperature had little correlation with antibiotic so the equation between them was not constructed the structural equation was constructed and modified by taking the concentration of arg sul2 in chironomidae larvae as the final dependent variable considering the complexity of the influence of temperature on resistance bacterial growth we did not establish the equation between temperature and the concentration of arg then the sem was obtained for one variate equation 1 y α λ x ζ eq 1 was called the structural equation if there was sufficient evidence that variate x could explain variate y and there was a causal or dependent relationship between x and y the parameter λ represented the explanatory strength of x to y the combination of two or more than two structural equations to express

supplementary material there was no significant difference between the model prediction values of the content of antibiotic resistance gene sul2 in chironomidae larvae and the actual measured values in 2019 two tailed student s t test p 0 05 so the sem could be used to predict the arg contamination table 3 y 1 0 13576 x 1 2 14549 y 2 3 0374 x 1 42 4015 y 3 0 17805 y 2 0 92044 x 1 19 50551 y 4 0

correlation equation between the concentration of args in chironomidae larvae with other environmental variables was similar with the concentration of args in the water with the same environmental variables therefore the sem of the concentration of args in chironomidae larvae could be used to predict the arg contamination of the freshwater in weishan lake fig 6d 4 discussion the goal of this study was to improve the accurate predictions for arg contamination and to identify the variables that affect these predictions based on the indication of benthic invertebrates in this study args are ubiquitous in many benthic invertebrates such as chironomidae larvae tubificidae freshwater mussel and spiral shell chironomidae larvae had the greatest arg content several args including teta sul2 and km were found in chironomidae larvae with sul2 content being the highest therefore the content of sul2 in chironomidae larvae was taken as the research object in subsequent studies the abdomen of chironomidae larvae is the main location of args because the intestinal tract is the main location of antibiotic resistance bacteria enrichment and arg transfer food chain is an important mode of transfer and diffusion of args in a freshwater environment chironomidae larvae feed on water and bottom mud and the arg content in their intestines is higher than that in water and bottom mud chironomidae larvae are the main bait of fish and the arg content in fish intestines is significantly higher than that in chironomidae larvae considering the swimming status of fish the dynamic migration of args acquired through the food chain in water is an important way of arg transfer the sources of args in freshwater lakes are manifold the content of args in the new xuehe bridge and shizi river bridge is higher than that in mountain tao and aihu village therefore urban sewage discharge is an important source of args in freshwater lakes in addition the content of args in animal farming duck farm fish farm and crab farm is higher than that in other sampling sites indicating that animal farming is another important source of args in freshwater lakes these sites are closely related to the long term application of sulfanilamide tetracycline and kanamycin in clinical medicine and animal breeding lindsey et al 2001 ibrahim et al 2015 middleman et al 1972 controlling urban sewage discharge and animal farming is an important way of regulation arg contamination the distribution of args is affected by many environmental factors the season is an important factor for the distribution of args in weishan lake the content of args is the highest from august to october moderate from april to june and the lowest between december and february this pattern may be related to the temperature which is high in summer and low in winter temperature in summer is conducive to the growth of antibiotic resistance bacteria and the amplification of args dunivin 2018 knapp et al 2012 water storage has an effect on the distribution of args according to the data of the south to north water diversion project after water diversion the content of args in different sampling sites aihu village weishan lake hanzhuang gate duck farm decreased in chironomidae larvae the amount of water storage dry water normal water and wet water was closely related to the content of antibiotics the more the water was stored the less antibiotics there were antibiotic and arg distribution is closely related and antibiotic stress can promote the spread and copy of args in a freshwater environment the contents of metal elements especially for al are also positively correlated with the distribution of args and metal elements can promote the horizontal transfer of args zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2018 ding et al 2021 2016 qiu et al 2012 however the interaction between temperature water storage antibiotics metal elements and args remains unclear sem was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors affecting the distribution of args and predict the occurrence of arg contamination according to the results of model construction metal element content was negatively correlated with water storage and the content of arg was positively correlated with the content of metal element high water storage will dilute metal elements and thus reduce the content of arg which is consistent with the results of previous experiments ding et al 2021 2016 jang 2021 the temperature was negatively correlated with water storage and the content of arg was positively correlated with temperature the months with high water storage are in summer and autumn although high water storage will dilute args high temperature will promote the transfer and copy of args temperature has a greater impact on the content of args than does water storage which is consistent with the experimental results in this study the antibiotic content was negatively correlated with the water storage and high water storage will dilute antibiotics there was a negative correlation between the content of antibiotics and the content of args in the model which is contrary to the traditional understanding this outcome may be related to the low antibiotic content in the impounding lake and its influence on args will be affected by other factors in the final model formula the content of args was negatively correlated with water storage the pollution of args can be determined simply by the level of water storage the result is similar with deep learning models of arg contamination and the variable water storage is the same as rainfall jang et al 2021 in the constructed sem model the content of metal elements and antibiotic and temperature are difficult to control and only the water storage is easy to adjust for realistic operability for weishan lake there is a wet season from august to october abundant precipitation and a dry season from december to february low precipitation the period from april to june is the water transfer period of the south to north water diversion project which can increase the water storage of the lake therefore the south to north water diversion project can be used to control the pollution of args in weishan lake if args are different variable antibiotics need to be changed among the tested variables and the model formula is basically similar teta gene have been analyzed and the results are basically consistent with sul2 gene the detection of args in chironomidae larvae can not only omit the enrichment step but also use the general dna extraction kit at the same time the migration of chironomidae larvae in bottom mud is poor so the content of args in chironomidae larvae is consistent with the content of args in water and bottom mud at the same sampling site ding et al 2021 muziasari et al 2016 the results of arg contamination indication based on chironomidae larvae were consistent with the results of arg contamination indication based on water which is a new simple and fast indicator method based on the indication of chironomidae larvae the sem model formula can be used to predict arg contamination in lakes the water storage can guide the south to north water diversion and the seasonal discharge of municipal sewage to the lakes weishan lake shaoyang lake dushan lake and nanyang lake are connected together to form nansi lake and the constructed sem model is also applicable to other three lakes besides weishan lake therefore it is believed that the model might be applied to other freshwater lakes 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that chironomidae larvae can act as a new indicator of arg contamination in freshwater lakes the study fills the gap in the transfer of args from water and bottom mud to fish through the food chain sem is an effective mathematical model to predict arg contamination influenced by multiple environmental variables including the concentration of metal elements the concentration of antibiotic water storage and temperature and water storage is identified as the key variable that affect these predictions sem can be used to regulate the south to north water diversion and the seasonal discharge of municipal sewage for decreasing the arg contamination in weishan lake declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interests

15627,the widespread contamination of antibiotic resistance genes args in freshwater environment are becoming a serious challenge to human health and ecological safety rapid and efficient monitoring of args pollution is of great significance to args control water bottom mud and fish have all been used to indicate arg contamination in aquatic environments however it is unclear whether macrobenthic invertebrates in the food chain of aquatic environments can be indicators of arg contamination in this study we demonstrated that args including teta gene sul2 gene and km gene were distributed in chironomidae larvae in weishan lake the arg distribution was related to animal species body parts sampling sites time urban environment animal farming south to north water diversion food chain antibiotics and water storage mathematical model predictions of arg contamination in weishan lake were constructed based on the structural equation model sem and the distribution of arg sul2 in chironomidae larvae influencing factors such as water storage metal elements antibiotic and temperature were found to be closely related to the prediction of arg contamination this study provided a new indicator for arg contamination in freshwater environments and a method to predict args contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords distribution model prediction antibiotic

resistance gene arg transfer and diffusion ding et al 2021 yang et al 2017 args of sulfa tetracycline ampicillin oxygen pyrimidine quinolone aureomycin gentamicin and erythromycin widely distributed in lakes return to the human environment as drinking and irrigation water sources posing potential risks to human health vaseeharan et al 2009 yang et al 2016 luo et al 2017 weishan lake at the junction of jiangsu province and shandong province is the largest lake in north china and the second largest fresh water lake in the huaihe river it is in the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project which is important for drinking irrigation breeding reservoir flood control water supply shipping tourism and other functions hence it has an important influence on the cities in the basin luo et al 2017 sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 although arg contamination in many lakes has been reported arg contamination and its interrelationship with people s lives in weishan lake is rarely reported the traditional detection and prediction of arg contamination are indicated by the detection of arg in water bottom mud and fish which have obvious defects the detection of args in water needs to go through the enrichment step which is time consuming and labor intensive ding et al 2021 the detection of args in bottom mud is difficult and the extraction of dna requires expensive kits muziasari et al 2016 given that fish swim in water the accuracy of arg indication is questionable resistance bacteria and args are widely distributed in aquatic animals such as rainbow trout catfish tilapia medaka mozambique tilapia zebrafish and ornamental fish guglielmetti et al 2009 vaseeharan et al 2004 kawakami 2007 son et al 1997 vernerjeffreys et al 2009 muziasari et al 2016 among aquatic animals fish shrimp and crabs are all higher vertebrates that can indicate the distribution of args in freshwater lakes jo et al 2021 fang et al 2019 recently args have been detected in daphnia which is a kind of lower invertebrate plankton arg teta and vana are detected in daphnia in aquatic environments and the mode of arg transfer is plasmid mediated conjugation transfer olanrewaju et al 2019 eckert et al 2016 as indicators of arg contamination aquatic animals such as fish shrimp crabs and daphnia have the disadvantages of small quantity and difficulty to catch moreover due to the high migration of these organisms the arg content in these organisms is not consistent with that in the water therefore new genetic indicators of arg contamination are urgently needed it is not clear whether invertebrates can be used as indicators of args in benthic environments where resistance genes and bacteria are abundant chironomidae larvae is a typical benthic invertebrate that is a natural feed for fish it can be used as an indicator of water nutrient type for environmental monitoring and for water quality evaluation and has an effect on sewage self purification fard et al 2014 jo et al 2020 therefore the indicator function of chironomidae larvae especially for arg contamination remains to be further studied monitoring of args in lakes is required for water sources user safety sulfa and tetracycline resistance genes are almost 100 distributed in these lakes and the content of args is closely related to antibiotics and resistance bacteria released from municipal sewage and animal farm yang et al 2016 2017 luo et al 2017 vaseeharan et al 2009 so the monitoring and prediction of arg contamination in freshwater lakes for sewage disposal and animal farming has become a hot issue in the field of environmental toxicology in recent years jang et al 2021 however due to the diversity of environmental factors the complexity of the factors influence on one another and the replicability and transferability of args themselves the model prediction is difficult structural equation model sem is a model utilized to identify relationships among surveyed and measured variables it can inform decision making and be adapted to probe social dynamics for water and sanitation in unincorporated communities rowles et al 2020 this model is also used to assess the effects of pollutants discharged to streams caused by anthropogenic land use on water quality and the benthic macroinvertebrate lee et al 2020 however the correlation between args in water environment and benthic macroinvertebrate and its influencing factors remain unclear in the case of multi factor analysis sem analysis becomes a possible method in this study the distribution of args in macrobenthic invertebrates especially for chironomidae larvae in xuehe river and weishan lake was observed the affecting factors involved in animal species body parts sampling sites time urban environment animal farming south to north water diversion food chain and antibiotic in different water storage were also studied a sem of arg in weishan lake based on the indication of chironomidae larvae was explored and influencing factors such as water storage metal elements antibiotic and temperature were analyzed the arg contamination prediction of the sem formula was explored to regulate the key environmental factors for guiding the south to north water diversion and the seasonal discharge of municipal sewage to freshwater lakes this study provided a new indicator with the advantages of simplicity speed and accuracy for arg contamination in freshwater environments and a method to predict args contamination for guiding prevention and control 2 materials and

supplementary material there was no significant difference between the model prediction values of the content of antibiotic resistance gene sul2 in chironomidae larvae and the actual measured values in 2019 two tailed student s t test p 0 05 so the sem could be used to predict the arg contamination table 3 y 1 0 13576 x 1 2 14549 y 2 3 0374 x 1 42 4015 y 3 0 17805 y 2 0 92044 x 1 19 50551 y 4 0

correlation equation between the concentration of args in chironomidae larvae with other environmental variables was similar with the concentration of args in the water with the same environmental variables therefore the sem of the concentration of args in chironomidae larvae could be used to predict the arg contamination of the freshwater in weishan lake fig 6d 4 discussion the goal of this study was to improve the accurate predictions for arg contamination and to identify the variables that affect these predictions based on the indication of benthic invertebrates in this study args are ubiquitous in many benthic invertebrates such as chironomidae larvae tubificidae freshwater mussel and spiral shell chironomidae larvae had the greatest arg content several args including teta sul2 and km were found in chironomidae larvae with sul2 content being the highest therefore the content of sul2 in chironomidae larvae was taken as the research object in subsequent studies the abdomen of chironomidae larvae is the main location of args because the intestinal tract is the main location of antibiotic resistance bacteria enrichment and arg transfer food chain is an important mode of transfer and diffusion of args in a freshwater environment chironomidae larvae feed on water and bottom mud and the arg content in their intestines is higher than that in water and bottom mud chironomidae larvae are the main bait of fish and the arg content in fish intestines is significantly higher than that in chironomidae larvae considering the swimming status of fish the dynamic migration of args acquired through the food chain in water is an important way of arg transfer the sources of args in freshwater lakes are manifold the content of args in the new xuehe bridge and shizi river bridge is higher than that in mountain tao and aihu village therefore urban sewage discharge is an important source of args in freshwater lakes in addition the content of args in animal farming duck farm fish farm and crab farm is higher than that in other sampling sites indicating that animal farming is another important source of args in freshwater lakes these sites are closely related to the long term application of sulfanilamide tetracycline and kanamycin in clinical medicine and animal breeding lindsey et al 2001 ibrahim et al 2015 middleman et al 1972 controlling urban sewage discharge and animal farming is an important way of regulation arg contamination the distribution of args is affected by many environmental factors the season is an important factor for the distribution of args in weishan lake the content of args is the highest from august to october moderate from april to june and the lowest between december and february this pattern may be related to the temperature which is high in summer and low in winter temperature in summer is conducive to the growth of antibiotic resistance bacteria and the amplification of args dunivin 2018 knapp et al 2012 water storage has an effect on the distribution of args according to the data of the south to north water diversion project after water diversion the content of args in different sampling sites aihu village weishan lake hanzhuang gate duck farm decreased in chironomidae larvae the amount of water storage dry water normal water and wet water was closely related to the content of antibiotics the more the water was stored the less antibiotics there were antibiotic and arg distribution is closely related and antibiotic stress can promote the spread and copy of args in a freshwater environment the contents of metal elements especially for al are also positively correlated with the distribution of args and metal elements can promote the horizontal transfer of args zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2018 ding et al 2021 2016 qiu et al 2012 however the interaction between temperature water storage antibiotics metal elements and args remains unclear sem was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors affecting the distribution of args and predict the occurrence of arg contamination according to the results of model construction metal element content was negatively correlated with water storage and the content of arg was positively correlated with the content of metal element high water storage will dilute metal elements and thus reduce the content of arg which is consistent with the results of previous experiments ding et al 2021 2016 jang 2021 the temperature was negatively correlated with water storage and the content of arg was positively correlated with temperature the months with high water storage are in summer and autumn although high water storage will dilute args high temperature will promote the transfer and copy of args temperature has a greater impact on the content of args than does water storage which is consistent with the experimental results in this study the antibiotic content was negatively correlated with the water storage and high water storage will dilute antibiotics there was a negative correlation between the content of antibiotics and the content of args in the model which is contrary to the traditional understanding this outcome may be related to the low antibiotic content in the impounding lake and its influence on args will be affected by other factors in the final model formula the content of args was negatively correlated with water storage the pollution of args can be determined simply by the level of water storage the result is similar with deep learning models of arg contamination and the variable water storage is the same as rainfall jang et al 2021 in the constructed sem model the content of metal elements and antibiotic and temperature are difficult to control and only the water storage is easy to adjust for realistic operability for weishan lake there is a wet season from august to october abundant precipitation and a dry season from december to february low precipitation the period from april to june is the water transfer period of the south to north water diversion project which can increase the water storage of the lake therefore the south to north water diversion project can be used to control the pollution of args in weishan lake if args are different variable antibiotics need to be changed among the tested variables and the model formula is basically similar teta gene have been analyzed and the results are basically consistent with sul2 gene the detection of args in chironomidae larvae can not only omit the enrichment step but also use the general dna extraction kit at the same time the migration of chironomidae larvae in bottom mud is poor so the content of args in chironomidae larvae is consistent with the content of args in water and bottom mud at the same sampling site ding et al 2021 muziasari et al 2016 the results of arg contamination indication based on chironomidae larvae were consistent with the results of arg contamination indication based on water which is a new simple and fast indicator method based on the indication of chironomidae larvae the sem model formula can be used to predict arg contamination in lakes the water storage can guide the south to north water diversion and the seasonal discharge of municipal sewage to the lakes weishan lake shaoyang lake dushan lake and nanyang lake are connected together to form nansi lake and the constructed sem model is also applicable to other three lakes besides weishan lake therefore it is believed that the model might be applied to other freshwater lakes 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that chironomidae larvae can act as a new indicator of arg contamination in freshwater lakes the study fills the gap in the transfer of args from water and bottom mud to fish through the food chain sem is an effective mathematical model to predict arg contamination influenced by multiple environmental variables including the concentration of metal elements the concentration of antibiotic water storage and temperature and water storage is identified as the key variable that affect these predictions sem can be used to regulate the south to north water diversion and the seasonal discharge of municipal sewage for decreasing the arg contamination in weishan lake declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interests

15628,emerging contaminants such as polar pesticides pose a potential risk to human health due to their presence in drinking water however their occurrence and fate in drinking water treatment plants is poorly understood in this study we use passive sampling coupled to suspect screening and multivariate analysis to describe pesticide fate throughout the treatment stream of an operational drinking water treatment plant chemcatcherò passive sampling devices were deployed at sites n 6 positioned at all stages of the treatment stream during consecutive deployments n 20 over a twelve month period sample extracts n 120 were analysed using high resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and compounds identified against a commercially available database a total

this risk is more acute during drinking water treatment where threshold concentrations are set for pesticides and hence various treatment processes have been adopted to remove pesticides dong et al

migration from the point of application is a more economical alternative currently favoured by water utilities ukwir 2015 monitoring is performed to establish variation in pesticide occurrence and fate associated with event driven pollution and long term trends schreiner et al 2016 monitoring typically comprises discrete spot sampling coupled to quantitative analysis of an a priori target measurement suite jones et al 2015 analysis of environmental samples can routinely detect trace concentrations of aqueous pesticides ng l 1 to μg l 1 schäfer et al 2019 these sampling and analytical methods have recognised limitations impeding their utility within pesticide monitoring reemtsma et al 2016 spot sampling only provides a snap shot at the time of sample collection lacking the temporal resolution to accurately describe pesticide flux furthermore a priori measurement suites neglect pesticides not included despite the potential presence of such pesticides poulier et al 2015 increasing the resolution of spot sampling is prohibitively expensive demanding considerable resource and expertise likewise expanding the target measurement suite requires the adoption of additional sample extraction and enrichment steps in addition to development of the instrumental method reemtsma et al 2016 comprehensive methods for pesticide monitoring that overcome these limitations are needed moschet et al 2014 consequently passive sampling is increasingly used as an alternative or to complement spot water sampling taylor et al 2020a 2020b during passive sampling freely dissolved pesticides are sequestered in the receiving phase of the passive sampling device psd during in situ deployment in sampled waters passive sampling and its advantages are described elsewhere jones et al 2015 taylor et al 2020b 2019 briefly passive sampling can be used for quantitative and qualitative monitoring quantitative monitoring provides time weighted average twa concentrations calculated using compound specific sampling rates and the sampled mass of analyte qualitative monitoring can be used to determine the presence or absence of a compound in the sample matrix here the abundance of the compound measured as the integrated peak area on the analytical instrument is used for this purpose gravell et al 2020 chemcatcher and polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis psds have previously been deployed in drinking water treatment plants castle et al 2019 escher et al 2011 sultana et al 2018 the desire for more comprehensive analytical methods has encouraged the qualitative

consecutive separate deployments in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in south east england psd extracts were analysed without a priori knowledge of pesticides present using a suspect screening approach to identify polar pesticides a filtering procedure was manually applied to the workflow to increase confidence in pesticide identification k means clustering was applied to reduce data complexity and highlight similarities in fate within and between groups of pesticides during several drinking water treatment processes our approach combining long term passive sampling for polar pesticides and multivariate statistical analysis at representative sites in a dwtp process stream has not been attempted previously this research will enable water utilities to 1 select pesticides for

future monitoring campaigns in river catchments and dwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study dwtp the trial was undertaken at six points within a dwtp located in the arun and western rother river catchment in south east england a description of the type and position of processes within the treatment stream along with site location is presented in fig 1 the locations of the six sites were chosen based on the rationale of stackelberg et al 2007 i e to account for the introduction of raw waters and pesticide attenuation during treatment processes the catchment supplying the dwtp has varied hydrology and pollution sources abstraction occurs from three raw water sources with distinct water quality and availability two of these sources are surface waters with abstraction occurring from two rivers within the catchment whilst the final abstraction is groundwater occurring from a wellfield on the dwtp site a further description is provided in the supplementary material operating conditions of processes in the treatment stream e g retention time and water treatment chemical dosing of ozone chlorine polyaluminium chloride polyacrylamide and sodium bisulphite are optimised to achieve desired performance in response to water quality and are comparable to similar dwtp in the uk 2 2 reagents and glassware solvents were obtained from thermofisher scientific

preparation a hydrophilic lipophilic balanced 47 mm horizon atlantic spe disk hlb l biotage uppsala sweden with a high affinity for analytes over a broad polarity range was used as receiving phase

membrane preparation of the chemcatcher used in this work is described elsewhere taylor et al 2021 2020a field and blank psds were prepared using the same procedure blank psds were included so contamination occurring during preparation and deployment of devices could be identified 2 4 dwtp deployment of psds chemcatcher psds were deployed at the six sampling sites fig 1 for 20 consecutive deployments over a twelve month period march 2019 to march 2020 deployments lasted 2 3 weeks with an average duration of 2 5 weeks sampling occurred over a year to ensure the effects of seasonal variability on pesticide occurrence and abundance in raw waters and or removal efficacy during treatment processes were captured e g climatic conditions pesticide usage operational conditions and physiochemical status of the raw waters at each site two samplers were removed from their transport container and placed into the deployment enclosure fig s1 the deployment enclosure contained a support plate mounting fig s2 to which two samplers were secured with the sampling surface facing downwards this was to ensure water exiting the inlet pipe at the bottom of the enclosure flowed over the sampling surface the water sample line containing an adjustable valve was connected to the top of the inlet pipe of each deployment enclosure fig s2 after deployment chemcatcher samplers were removed from the deployment enclosure and transported to the laboratory in a cool box and stored at 4 c until extraction which usually occurred on the same day during each deployment and retrieval operation two new psds were exposed to serve as field blanks 2 5 chemcatcher extraction exposed and blank chemcatcher samplers were disassembled in the laboratory the hlb disk and pes membrane were removed and the latter discarded the hlb l disks were then dried 24 h on meoh rinsed aluminium foil at room temperature after which they were stored at 18 c then thawed prior to extraction disks were extracted as per taylor et al 2021 2020a only one exposed and one blank were extracted the other set of disks were used as back up samples 2 6 instrumental analysis and filtering procedure instrumental analysis of passive sampling extracts was performed with liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof details of which have been reported elsewhere taylor et al 2020a and are given in the sm instrument stability and mass accuracy was periodically checked through analysis of reference standards hystar software rev 3 2 and target analysis for screening and quantification tasq 1 4 software bruker daltonics bremen germany were used for data acquisition and interpretation respectively the coupled hardware and software are commercially available and optimised for bruker s pesticidescreener v2 1 database against which samples were screened the full method has been described previously taylor et al 2021 2020a with the exception that here the theoretical mass accuracy was 15 ppm any analytes present in the mobile phase were removed from the list of analytes found in the chemcatcher extracts analytes present in the field blank were also removed if the response was less than three times those of the field exposed samplers following filtering a final list of identified pesticides was compiled details of the removal of pesticides detected in the mobile phase and in the field blanks are shown in table s1 2 7 multi variate statistical analysis microsoft excel was used to calculate descriptive statistics of identified pesticides after transferring outputs from tasq multivariate analysis was performed in agilent mass profiler professional mpp b 14 9 1 data was imported to mpp in a generic format pesticide abundance defined as the integrated peak area of the analytical instrumental response were interrogated using k means clusters concentrations of the individual pesticides were not calculated as the compound specific sampling rate and the mass of analyte sampled were not known instead the abundance of the compound measured as the integrated peak area on the analytical instrument was used as a surrogate for the pesticide concentration in sampled waters this identified trends in fate for identified pesticides and characterised the efficacy of removal by treatment processes multivariate statistical analysis using k means clustering enabled reduction of data dimensionality so clusters within the large data set could be visualised for groups of pesticides possessing similar fate throughout treatment processes for non detections a value of 0 was used this substitution likely casues variance to be biased low the workflow for the instrumental analysis filtering and statistical treatment of data is presented in fig s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 use of chemcatcher sampling was performed at six sites over a twelve month period this comprised 20 consecutive deployments totalling 240 deployed samplers all samplers were retrieved but only one sampler of each duplicate was analysed 120 analyses fouling on the pes membrane was limited to site 1 fig s2 and varied between deployments the increased fouling at site 1 was due to the greater turbidity and suspended particulate matter present in raw water it is possible that fouling of devices at this site acted to reduce transport of analytes across the pes membrane thus potentially suppressing uptake as all deployments occurred in uniform enclosures within the treatment stream the dissimilarity in ambient hydrological conditions was expected to be low in this work however a difference in matrix composition was expected at each site as a consequence of dwtp treatment these factors were thought to have had only minimal effect on device performance with any variation substantially lower than that observed in surface waters where large variation in ambient conditions is possible djomte et al 2018 taylor et al 2021 2020b as the hydraulic retention time of the dwtp was less than 24 h and deployments occurred over 2 5 weeks the delay time of travel of water through treatment processes was not expected to have a pronounced effect on passive sampling data 3 2 pesticides identified in chemcatcher extracts suspect screening identified 58 pesticide compounds defined as actives and other compounds used in pesticide and biocide formulations table 1 of these pesticides 50 have not been monitored before in this dwtp identified pesticides are those that were amenable to the sampling and instrumental methods used in this work and are not exhaustive of all the pesticides potentially present pesticides not amenable to the methods used here include acid herbicides and metaldehyde the log k ow of identified pesticides ranged between 1 83 and 5 9 with the exception of merphos log k ow 7 67 which was only detected twice this is a similar range to that found by ahrens et al 2015 1 9 to 5 3 using the pocis passive sampler containing hlb receiving phase and grodtke et al 2021 1 74 to 3 77 and taylor et al 2021 1 0 to 5 9 both using the same configuration of chemcatcher as in this work there was a total of 647 detections within the 120 samples analysed the limits of detection of the method used were unknown and will vary between analytes this could have an influence on the number of detections found amongst the different pesticide classes reported passive sampling generally has a lower detection limit compared to discrete sampling methods due to in situ preconcentration taylor et al 2019 2020b fungicides and herbicides each accounted for 31 18 compounds of detected pesticides insecticides and tps each made up just 16 9 compounds with plant growth regulators pgr 3 compounds and repellents 1 compound accounting for 5 and 2 of detected pesticides respectively herbicides had the most detections 202 31 followed by tps 140 22 fungicides 138 21 and repellents 118 18 with significantly fewer detections of insecticides 44 7 and only 6 detections of pgrs 1 if the mean detections per compound for each pesticide type is calculated this is greatest for repellents at 118 solely due to deet which is often found to be ubiquitous in various environmental compartments merel and snyder 2016 taylor et al 2021 tps had the next highest mean detections per compound at 16 followed by herbicides 11 fungicides 8 insecticides 5 and pgrs 2 only deet and dichlorobenzamide had a detection frequency 50 with the next highest detection frequency being the herbicide metazachlor at 31 reduced detection frequency between sites 1 and 2 4 and 5 and 5 and 6 was observed and an increase in abundance between sites 2 and 3 can be attributed to groundwater entering the process stream here however an increase in detection frequency between sites 3 and 4 is not a result of any inputs site 4 had the largest values amongst all sites for total detections 198 and number of pesticides 48 compounds 3 3 treatment processes employed in the dwtp pesticide attenuation during drinking water treatment occurs through removal e g adsorption to carbonaceous sorbents reverse osmosis and nanofiltration and transformation via chemical oxidation e g ozonation and chlorination and photodegradation e g ultraviolet epa 2011 miklos et al 2018 taylor et al 2020b see sm removal most commonly occurs through adsorption to activated carbon sorbents deployed in granular form in filter beds ahmad et al 2010 table s2 presents a review of treatment process performance for a selection of polar pesticides comparison of process performance between studies must be done cautiously as lab based investigations are often not representative of an operational dwtp e g unrealistically high oxidant dose 18 mg cl2 l 1 see table s2 likewise the configuration and operation of processes can differ significantly between dwtps nam et al 2014 here we focus on the fate of pesticides through the treatment stream during each unit process clarification rapid gravity filtration rgf ozonation granular activated carbon and disinfection by chlorination fig 1 a summary of pesticide detection at each site is presented in table 2 and described in the following sections 3 3 1 abstraction of raw waters site 1 abstracted waters enter the dwtp where they are sampled at site 1 prior to undergoing clarification thirty four pesticides were present at site 1 with a total of 116 detections most of the pesticides present at site 1 were herbicides and fungicides used on oil seed rape and cereals in addition to insecticides and repellents with both diffuse and point sources two pesticides detected at site 1 were not seen at subsequent sites namely dimethylaniline and maleic hydrazide which are a tp and a pgr respectively these were present in 10 of samples at site 1 3 3 2 clarification site 2 three clarifiers were operated in parallel with site 2 located directly after clarification of the 34 pesticides present at site 1 nine were absent at site 2 but occurred later in the treatment stream potentially from the introduction of water from borehole abstraction clarification removal efficacy over a wide range 0 75 was also observed by stackelberg et al 2007 it was likely that attenuation was partly responsible for the reductions in detection frequency and number of pesticides observed between sites 1 and 2 in this work huerta fontela et al 2011 observed that moderately hydrophobic micropollutants with a log k ow 2 5 could sorb to particles during clarification nam et al 2014 found between 9 and 100 removal for micropollutants during clarification with the removal of micropollutants with a log k ow 2 5 increasing with turbidity here we found that removal during clarification was not correlated to log k ow and solubility although we found removal occurred over a similar range to nam et al 2014 understanding the mechanisms driving attenuation during clarification here is a low priority as subsequent treatment steps contribute to a greater proportion of attenuation of pesticides present in potable water 3 3 3 rgf filtration and groundwater dilution site 3 groundwater enters the treatment stream in a filter channel prior to the rgfs where it is mixed with the supernatant water from the clarifiers the mixing process is uneven meaning the composition of water in the rgfs favours the clarifier supernatant composed of surface water towards rgf a and groundwater towards rgf f located at the opposite end of the filter gallery fig 1 only two pesticides had their final detection in the treatment stream at site 2 whereas nine pesticides appeared for the first time at site 3 simazine a known groundwater contaminant is detected for the first time at site 3 whilst the frequency of atrazine detection 75 was significantly greater than at previous sites where it was only detected in a single sample atrazine desisopropyl a tp of both simazine and atrazine formed in soil university of hertfordshire 2015 was detected for the first time at site 3 similarly atrazine desethyl an atrazine tp also formed in soil university of hertfordshire 2015 displays a similar relationship to its parent compound at site 3 with significantly increased detection frequency our findings suggest that ground water abstraction is the major source of these pesticides in the dwtp such pesticide presence in groundwater is well documented kiefer et al 2021 2019 soulier et al 2016 it is not possible to distinguish between attenuation due to removal in the rgfs or dilution with groundwater for pesticides present at site 2 at higher abundance than site 3 however rgf filtration is not performed for pesticide removal and limited removal is anticipated for most pesticides the removal efficacy between sites 2 and 3 was 126 determined by the change in the total number of detections and 74 determined by the change in the total number of pesticides present our observations support the hypothesis that removal in the rgfs is negligible with the apparent negative removal rates caused by pesticides entering the treatment stream in groundwater leading to supplementation of pesticides already present and or the introduction of pesticides not found in raw surface waters 3 3 4 ozonation site 4 ozonation has been used as both a disinfectant and for pre treatment of process water prior to absorption as practiced at this dwtp there were 48 pesticides after ozonation eight more than the previous site the mean removal through ozonation was 25 based on the number of detections at sites 3 and 4 and 20 based on the number of pesticides with negative removal occurring for many compounds this compares to removal of between 18 and 100 in a variety of laboratory and field trails investigating ozone doses of between 0 5 and 4 3 mg o3 l 1 dong et al 2021 found that tebuconazole and imidacloprid removal in a full scale dwtp with a residual dose of 0 5 to 1 5 mg o3 l 1 was 20 and slightly greater for azoxystrobin at 30 this is a similar dose to the dwtp studied in this work 1 mg l 1 where mean removal of tebuconazole and imidacloprid was 11 and 11 respectively the lower efficacy observed in this work may result from the effect of ozonation in promoting adsorption this is performed to increase removal by gac media but may also promote uptake to psds as the same mechanisms drive both phenomena this effect of ozonation on compound specific uptake into the sampler requires further study and was beyond the remit of this study 3 3 5 gac adsorption site 5 site 5 is located after the gac adsorbers forty eight pesticides were detected at site 4 whereas 21 pesticides were detected at site 5 table 2 twenty eight pesticides were removed entirely in the gac adsorbers there was one instance primicarb one detection where a pesticide present at site 5 was absent at site 4 indicating that desorption from gac media may be the source the mean gac removal efficacy was 70 based on the total number of detections at site 4 198 and site 5 59 whereas removal efficacy was 56 based on pesticides present at each site the frequency of gac breakthrough defined as the number of detections at site 4 divided by 100 then multiplied by the number of detections at site 5 for each pesticide varied between 100 and 0 with deet and foramsulfuron each occurring on one more occasion at site 5 negative removals may result from in situ formation of tps following degradation of a parent compound unrepresentative sampling or due to analytical artefacts tröger et al 2018 however desorption from gac media is the suspected cause here gac breakthrough frequency varied between 11 simazine and 86 metazachlor for the remainder of pesticides stackelberg et al 2007 found that 50 of the removal of micropollutants in the treatment stream of a dwtp was attributable to gac however the contact time of 1 5 3 min investigated is unusually short and is not analogous to the dwtp in this study which has a current target contact time of 10 min 3 3 6 final disinfection and transfer site 6 the final treatment process was disinfection through chlorination dosed in the form of hypochlorite naocl leaving a residual for distribution 1 2 mg l 1 chlorination occurred in two contact tanks immediately after an out of area transfer of treated groundwater water joins the treatment stream site 5 was located before the transfer and site 6 was located after treated water exits the contact tank before entering distribution twenty one pesticides were detected at site 5 whereas eleven pesticides were detected at site 6 twelve pesticides were removed entirely during disinfection there was one instance isomethiozin one detection where a pesticide present at site 6 was absent at site 5 possibly indicating that the transfer is the source of the detection at site 6 the detection frequency of pesticides detected at site 6 ranged from 5 three pesticides to 100 for deet removal efficacy was 22 number of detections at sites 5 and 6 or 48 number of pesticides at sites 5 and 6 pesticides detected at site 6 included six herbicides four tps one repellent and one fungicide table 1 no insecticides were present after disinfection 3 4 pesticide fate through the treatment stream and risk in treated water monitoring of the process stream of dwtps and benchtop studies have found that a majority of pesticide attenuation is attributable to chemical oxidation and adsorption with activated carbon adsorbents dong et al 2021 matsushita et al 2018 ormad et al 2008 stackelberg et al 2007 stackelberg et al 2007 found that hydrophilic micropollutants could persist through the treatment stream at detectable concentrations with percentage removal in treated waters ranging from 25 to 100 similarly matsushita et al 2018 found a negative correlation between hydrophilicity and removal by activated carbon pesticide fate at sites 3 4 5 and 6 is thought to be of greatest importance to understanding the risk here defined as the likelihood of an individual pesticide exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 posed by pesticides this is because these sites are located after pesticides have entered the treatment stream and also include the treatment processes responsible for most pesticide attenuation the 23 pesticides occurring at either site 5 or site 6 table 2 are likewise thought to pose the greatest risk as detection at these sites indicates either gac breakthrough formation during disinfection or introduction in the transfer entering the treatment stream after the gac adsorbers fig 2 presents clustering of the 23 pesticides based on similarities in fate at sites 3 4 5 and 6 representing ozonation gac filtration and disinfection processes six pesticide clusters clusters 0 5 are determined according to k means clustering of the normalised log2 average peak abundance at each site measured through passive sampling coupled to screening a differential distance metric was used k means partitions clusters of data points according to the closest random centroid number of centroids equals number of clusters selected followed by iteration where the centroid of each cluster is set to the mean value of data points within the cluster iteration continues until the distance separating clusters from the cluster centroids is minimised this allows for similarities in variation at progressive sites within qualitative datasets to be identified table s3 presents the pesticides present in each cluster alongside associated values for removal efficacy these are calculated based on detection frequency normalised abundance the sum of raw abundance and the average of raw abundance of pesticides in samples where positive detections are made 3 4 1 cluster 0 cluster 0 contains one pesticide epoxiconazole which is completely removed during treatment with ozonation gac filtration and chlorination each contributing to removal if the number of detections at subsequent sites is used to calculate attenuation ozonation 43 and gac filtration 50 are each responsible for a similar percentage of removal however if the sum of abundance at each site is used gac filtration is responsible for the majority of attenuation 82 with additional attenuation during chlorination effectively removing any epoxiconazole in gac filtrate 3 4 2 cluster 1 cluster 1 contains four pesticides of which one foramsulfuron is detected at site 6 pesticides in this cluster show little response to gac displaying zero or in the case of foramsulfuron and pirimicarb negative removal indicating the source of some of these detections at site 5 is desorption from the gac media foramsulfuron is the only cluster 1 pesticide detected at site 6 removal of foramsulfuron is 38 based on the average raw abundance in samples where it is detected at sites 4 and 5 and 24 based on the sum of raw abundance at these sites indicating that the gac still reduces the concentration of foramsulfuron during episodic increases all pesticides in cluster 1 occur infrequently at very low abundances and are thought to pose little risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs 0 1 μg l 1 in the treatment stream despite the apparent ineffectiveness of gac for their removal 3 4 3 cluster 2 cluster 2 contains five pesticides one of which atrazine desethyl is detected at site 6 pesticides in this cluster are characterised by negative removals during ozonation possibly due to the effect this has on increasing uptake to psds there is significant removal during gac filtration followed by complete removal during chlorination for all but atrazine desethyl gac removal efficacy for atrazine desethyl based on detection frequency normalised abundance and the sum of raw abundance show good agreement at 82 83 and 81 respectively this is slightly better than the 60 efficacy observed by ormad et al 2008 however if the average raw abundance in samples where atrazine desethyl is detected at sites 4 and 5 is used to calculate removal this is slightly negative 2 inspection of the deployment specific detection data at sites 4 and 5 for atrazine desethyl reveal that the first of the two detections at site 5 followed five deployments of raised abundance at site 4 the second detection at site 5 occurred following a gap of a deployment where atrazine desethyl was absent at sites 4 after resumed raised abundance at site 4 again lead to gac breakthrough this indicates that gac removal efficacy for atrazine desethly drops after sustained presence in the treatment stream possibly due to saturation of gac media it should be noted that removal in gac adsorbers is concentration dependant cosgrove et al 2019 patiño et al 2015 on occasions gac breakthrough occurred the abundance at site 4 had been sustained and stable 10 000 instrument peak area if the abundance at site 4 increased in this situation it is probable that removal efficacy would likewise increase until gac media again became saturated unlike other pesticides in cluster 2 negative removal is observed for atrazine desethyl between sites 5 and 6 deployment specific detection data suggests this is likely attributable to the presence of atrazine desethyl in the out of area transfer entering the stream between these sites supplementing gac breakthrough 3 4 4 cluster 3 cluster 3 contains seven pesticides three of which deet metazachlor and propyzamide are detected at site 6 negative removal during ozonation was observed for most pesticides in this group with a few exceptions for deet metazachlor and diuron depending on the calculation method the mean ozonation removal efficacies for cluster 3 pesticides are 23 32 63 and 36 based on detection frequency normalised abundance the sum of raw abundance and the average raw abundance respectively like cluster 2 this is likely due to ozonation promoting uptake to the psd a possibility supported by the larger change observed in the sum of raw abundance between sites 4 and 5 for pesticides in clusters 2 and 3 the fate of pesticides in cluster 3 are divergent during gac filtration for example gac breakthrough of clothianidin occurs on two occasions the first of these happened following three deployments of clothianidin presence at the gac inlet over which the abundance was falling from an initial peak the second occurred after a gap where clothianidin was absent at the inlet for the next deployment with its resumed presence at the gac inlet again leading to breakthrough gac breakthrough of clothianidin and atrazine desethyl happened during the same deployments and the source of both pesticides in the treatment stream is the groundwater abstraction gac breakthrough of clothianidin is thought to result from reduced adsorption to and desorption from saturated media leading to incomplete removal and supplementation of clothianidin at the gac inlet at the tail end of a sustained episode of pollution during the initial peak of the pollution episode the gac effectively removes clothianidin however as the inlet concentration falls so does removal efficacy until desorption results in higher abundance at the outlet which we observed in the deployment specific data boscalid and 2 hydroxyterbuthylazine each display similar fate to clothianidin diuron did not display the same behaviour however as it occurred at site 5 during a deployment where it was absent at site 4 and had been for a sustained period it is possible that this is a false positive because diuron was detected in field blanks possibly due to contamination and underwent blank subtraction see table s1 despite this chlorination effectively removed all pesticides in cluster 3 except deet metazachlor and propyzamide propyzamide and metazachlor displayed partial gac breakthrough during episodic pollution propyzamide was only detected at site 5 during the initial peak of pollution events when abundance at the gac inlet was greatest resulting in incomplete removal the abundance of propyzamide at site 5 increased with abundance at the gac inlet as did the removal efficacy of the gac chlorination had good removal efficacy for propyzamide however removing 89 of the sum raw abundance between sites 5 and 6 the removal efficacy between sites 3 and 6 was high for propyzamide at 75 76 or 83 based on detection frequency normalised abundance and the sum of raw abundance respectively metazachlor fate is similar to propyzamide in that gac breakthrough occurs during the initial peak of a pollution episode however breakthrough is maintained throughout sustained periods of pollution and similar to clothianidin appears to be influenced by the degree of saturation of gac media metazachlor removal efficacy during gac was 66 70 based on abundance at sites 4 and 5 which is comparable to biela et al 2020 who observed gac removal efficacy between 58 and 86 metazachlor is also amenable to removal during chlorination to a lesser degree however gac adsorption is the main mechanism for attenuation in the dwtp metazachlor is thought to pose a risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 to water quality throughout sustained pollution events with this risk greatest during the initial and any subsequent peaks in pollution deet is ubiquitously observed in environmental waters merel and snyder 2016 and has been observed in dwtps at high concentrations 844 ng l 1 wang et al 2022 here it displays incomplete removal between sites 3 and 6 with zero removal based on detection frequency and 69 removal if abundance based on the instrumental response is used this second figure is similar to those reported previously by stackelberg et al 2007 25 75 ling et al 2017 40 70 and tröger et al 2021 88 98 3 4 5 cluster 4 cluster 4 contains two pesticides atrazine and dichlorobenzamide ozonation has little effect on the fate of these pesticides however significant removal occurs during gac filtration cluster 4 pesticides occur in 50 of samples at the gac inlet gac removal efficacy is higher for atrazine 85 86 than dichlorobenzamide 61 79 if calculated using detection frequency normalised abundance or sum raw abundance at sites 4 and 5 gac breakthrough of atrazine occurred after periods of sustained raised abundance at the gac inlet whilst dichlorobenzamide breakthrough was more regular however the magnitude of dichlorobenzamide breakthrough increased during periods of sustained raised abundance at the gac inlet dichlorobenzamide underwent attenuation during chlorination which was broadly similar in magnitude to that observed during gac filtration atrazine underwent less attenuation between sites 5 and 6 possibly due to supplementation from the transfer entering the treatment stream and or resistance to chlorination 3 4 6 cluster 5 cluster 5 contains four pesticides which all occur infrequently at low abundance cluster 5 pesticides occur at sites downstream of those from which they are absent such negative removal may be caused by desorption from the gac media or introduction to the treatment stream in the transfer ultimately it is not thought cluster 5 pesticides pose a risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 to water quality at the dwtp and there is no need to confirm the sources of these pesticides in the treatment stream at present these pesticides are not thought to pose a risk because of their infrequent detection and the low abundance instrumental response when detections do occur additionally these pesticides have not demonstrated the ability to breakthrough the main barrier to treatment gac adsorbers 3 5 managing the current and future risk to water quality in the dwtp eleven pesticides were detected in treated drinking waters totalling 46 detections table 2 this represents 19 of pesticides detected in the dwtp elfikrie et al 2020 found 9 pesticides in raw water 4 of these were detected in treated waters at a dwtp removal efficiencies for these compounds imidacloprid propiconazole buprofezin and tebuconazole ranged between 77 and 88 indicating good attenuation through treatment we observed similar removal throughout treatment for most of the pesticides present at site 6 with the exception of deet and metazachlor for the six pesticides thought to pose the greatest risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 we have devised example critical control points triggers and responses to manage risks to water quality at the dwtp table 3 the rationale for inclusion of these six pesticides was made based on the description of pesticide fate in the treatment stream for individual and clusters of pesticides provided in section 3 4 pesticides that showed breakthrough of the main treatment barrier and were resistant to chlorination were thought to pose the greatest risk this example has been informed by the results of passive sampling and can be expanded to other pesticides detected in the dwtp e g compounds that could breakthrough the gac but were not present at site 6 the proposed controls and triggers table 3 can all be accommodated within the current and enhanced monitoring programme spot water sampling and targeted analysis of the water utility triggers are based on the presence and fate of pesticides determined from passive sampling and are set at appropriate concentrations approaching the legislated threshold concentration dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 triggers direct which responses should be undertaken in future by the water utility enhanced monitoring and risk assessments and how these should be interpreted to ensure the necessary information is available to manage each risk as it develops the controls triggers and responses have been designed so the water utility can use existing tools spot sampling and targeted analysis and procedures risk assessments to manage the risks identified using passive sampling currently of the eleven pesticides detected in the treated drinking water only four atrazine atrazine desethyl metazachlor and propyzamide are routinely monitored by the water utility as part of their current monitoring programme this illustrates the usefulness of using passive sampling coupled to suspect screening to enhance the understanding of pesticide risk and inform operational monitoring within the water industry the approach taken in this work could be repeated in other dwtps to produce controls triggers and responses to manage risks to water quality likelihood of any pesticide exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 a similar approach has been used within catchment monitoring for pesticides by taylor et al 2021 and likewise shows how passive sampling can provide new insights compared to relying on spot water sampling alone 4 conclusions chemcatcher with an hlb receiving phase in combination with high resolution suspect screening was used to provide the first long term characterisation of polar pesticide fate through an operational dwtp fifty eight polar pesticides from a range of classes were detected at various points throughout the treatment works the multivariate statistical approach allowed pesticide fate throughout the treatment stream to be interpreted within the complex qualitative passive sampling data set using k means analysis pesticides with a similar fate during ozonation gac filtration and chlorination could be identified and formed into 6 clusters this monitoring approach can be used to inform water quality management plans that contain controls triggers and responses for pesticides assessed to pose the greatest current and future risk to water quality the study shows how passive sampling coupled to screening can enhance the understanding of pesticide fate within dwtps the work flow could be expanded to include other classes of emerging

15628,emerging contaminants such as polar pesticides pose a potential risk to human health due to their presence in drinking water however their occurrence and fate in drinking water treatment plants is poorly understood in this study we use passive sampling coupled to suspect screening and multivariate analysis to describe pesticide fate throughout the treatment stream of an operational drinking water treatment plant chemcatcherò passive sampling devices were deployed at sites n 6 positioned at all stages of the treatment stream during consecutive deployments n 20 over a twelve month period sample extracts n 120 were analysed using high resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and compounds identified against a commercially available database a total of 58 pesticides and transformation products from different classes were detected statistical analysis of the qualitative screening data was performed to identify clusters of pesticides with similar fate during ozonation granular activated carbon gac filtration and chlorination the performance of each treatment process was investigated adsorption to gac media was found to account for the greatest proportion of pesticide attenuation average removal of 70 based on detection frequency however operational performance varied for certain pesticides during periods of episodic and sustained pollution gac breakthrough occurred for 21 compounds detected in the gac filtrate eleven pesticides were found to occur in potable water following treatment we developed a management plan containing controls

this risk is more acute during drinking water treatment where threshold concentrations are set for pesticides and hence various treatment processes have been adopted to remove pesticides dong et al

migration from the point of application is a more economical alternative currently favoured by water utilities ukwir 2015 monitoring is performed to establish variation in pesticide occurrence and fate associated with event driven pollution and long term trends schreiner et al 2016 monitoring typically comprises discrete spot sampling coupled to quantitative analysis of an a priori target measurement suite jones et al 2015 analysis of environmental samples can routinely detect trace concentrations of aqueous pesticides ng l 1 to μg l 1 schäfer et al 2019 these sampling and analytical methods have recognised limitations impeding their utility within pesticide monitoring reemtsma et al 2016 spot sampling only provides a snap shot at the time of sample collection lacking the temporal resolution to accurately describe pesticide flux furthermore a priori measurement suites neglect pesticides not included despite the potential presence of such pesticides poulier et al 2015 increasing the resolution of spot sampling is prohibitively expensive demanding considerable resource and expertise likewise expanding the target measurement suite requires the adoption of additional sample extraction and enrichment steps in addition to development of the instrumental method reemtsma et al 2016 comprehensive methods for pesticide monitoring that overcome these limitations are needed moschet et al 2014 consequently passive sampling is increasingly used as an alternative or to complement spot water sampling taylor et al 2020a 2020b during passive sampling freely dissolved pesticides are sequestered in the receiving phase of the passive sampling device psd during in situ deployment in sampled waters passive sampling and its advantages are described elsewhere jones et al 2015 taylor et al 2020b 2019 briefly passive sampling can be used for quantitative and qualitative monitoring quantitative monitoring provides time weighted average twa concentrations calculated using compound specific sampling rates and the sampled mass of analyte qualitative monitoring can be used to determine the presence or absence of a compound in the sample matrix here the abundance of the compound measured as the integrated peak area on the analytical instrument is used for this purpose gravell et al 2020 chemcatcher and polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis psds have previously been deployed in drinking water treatment plants castle et al 2019 escher et al 2011 sultana et al 2018 the desire for more comprehensive analytical methods has encouraged the qualitative

substantially expand the size of the measurement suite taylor et al 2021 2020a however affinity selectivity and sensitivity should be confirmed for the psd configuration and monitored pesticides prior

consecutive separate deployments in a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in south east england psd extracts were analysed without a priori knowledge of pesticides present using a suspect screening approach to identify polar pesticides a filtering procedure was manually applied to the workflow to increase confidence in pesticide identification k means clustering was applied to reduce data complexity and highlight similarities in fate within and between groups of pesticides during several drinking water treatment processes our approach combining long term passive sampling for polar pesticides and multivariate statistical analysis at representative sites in a dwtp process stream has not been attempted previously this research will enable water utilities to 1 select pesticides for mitigation through catchment interventions 2 describe pesticide fate during treatment 3 identify appropriate controls triggers and responses for water quality management plans 4 improve the design of future monitoring campaigns in river catchments and dwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study dwtp the trial was undertaken at six points within a dwtp located in the arun and western rother river catchment in south east england a description of the type and position of processes within the treatment stream along with site location is presented in fig 1 the locations of the six sites were chosen based on the rationale of stackelberg et al 2007 i e to account for the introduction of raw waters and pesticide attenuation during treatment processes the catchment supplying the dwtp has varied hydrology and pollution sources abstraction occurs from three raw water sources with distinct water quality and availability two of these sources are surface waters with abstraction occurring from two rivers within the catchment whilst the final abstraction is groundwater occurring from a wellfield on the dwtp site a further description is provided in the supplementary material

membrane preparation of the chemcatcher used in this work is described elsewhere taylor et al 2021 2020a field and blank psds were prepared using the same procedure blank psds were included so contamination occurring during preparation and deployment of devices could be identified 2 4 dwtp deployment of psds chemcatcher psds were deployed at the six sampling sites fig 1 for 20 consecutive deployments over a twelve month period march 2019 to march 2020 deployments lasted 2 3 weeks with an average duration of 2 5 weeks sampling occurred over a year to ensure the effects of seasonal variability on pesticide occurrence and abundance in raw waters and or removal efficacy during treatment processes were captured e g climatic conditions pesticide usage operational conditions and physiochemical status of the raw waters at each site two samplers were removed from their transport container and placed into the deployment enclosure fig s1 the deployment enclosure contained a support plate mounting fig s2 to which two samplers were secured with the sampling surface facing downwards this was to ensure water exiting the inlet pipe at the bottom of the enclosure flowed over the sampling surface the water sample line containing an adjustable valve was connected to the top of the inlet pipe of each deployment enclosure fig s2 after deployment chemcatcher samplers were removed from the deployment enclosure and transported to the laboratory in a cool box and stored at 4 c until extraction which usually occurred on the same day during each deployment and retrieval operation two new psds were exposed to serve as field blanks 2 5 chemcatcher extraction exposed and blank chemcatcher samplers were disassembled in the laboratory the hlb disk and pes membrane were removed and the latter discarded the hlb l disks were then dried 24 h on meoh rinsed aluminium foil at room temperature after which they were stored at 18 c then thawed prior to extraction disks were extracted as per taylor et al 2021 2020a only one exposed and one blank were extracted the other set of disks were used as back up samples 2 6 instrumental analysis and filtering procedure instrumental analysis of passive sampling extracts was performed with liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof details of which have been reported elsewhere taylor et al 2020a and are given in the sm instrument stability and mass accuracy was periodically checked through analysis of reference standards hystar software rev 3 2 and target analysis for screening and quantification tasq 1 4 software bruker daltonics bremen germany were used for data acquisition and interpretation respectively the coupled hardware and software are commercially available and optimised for bruker s pesticidescreener v2 1 database against which samples were screened the full method has been described previously taylor et al 2021 2020a with the exception that here the theoretical mass accuracy was 15 ppm any analytes present in the mobile phase were removed from the list of analytes found in the chemcatcher extracts analytes present in the field blank were also removed if the response was less than three times those of the field exposed samplers following filtering a final list of identified pesticides was compiled details of the removal of pesticides detected in the mobile phase and in the field blanks are shown in table s1 2 7 multi variate statistical analysis microsoft excel was used to calculate descriptive statistics of identified pesticides after transferring outputs from tasq multivariate analysis was performed in agilent mass profiler professional mpp b 14 9 1 data was imported to mpp in a generic format pesticide abundance defined as the integrated peak area of the analytical instrumental response were interrogated using k means clusters concentrations of the individual pesticides were not calculated as the compound specific sampling rate and the mass of analyte sampled were not known instead the abundance of the compound measured as the integrated peak area on the analytical instrument was used as a surrogate for the pesticide concentration in sampled waters this identified trends in fate for identified pesticides and characterised the efficacy of removal by treatment processes multivariate statistical analysis using k means clustering enabled reduction of data dimensionality so clusters within the large data set could be visualised for groups of pesticides possessing similar fate throughout treatment processes for non detections a value of 0 was used this substitution likely casues variance to be biased low the workflow for the instrumental analysis filtering and statistical treatment of data is presented in fig s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 use of chemcatcher sampling was performed at six sites over a twelve month period this comprised 20 consecutive deployments totalling 240 deployed samplers all samplers were retrieved but only one sampler of each duplicate was analysed 120 analyses fouling on the pes membrane was limited to site 1 fig s2 and varied between deployments the increased fouling at site 1 was due to the greater turbidity and suspended particulate matter present in raw water it is possible that fouling of devices at this site acted to reduce transport of analytes across the pes membrane thus potentially suppressing uptake as all deployments occurred in uniform enclosures within the treatment stream the dissimilarity in ambient hydrological conditions was expected to be low in this work however a difference in matrix composition was expected at each site as a consequence of dwtp treatment these factors were thought to have had only minimal effect on device performance with any variation substantially lower than that observed in surface waters where large variation in ambient conditions is possible djomte et al 2018 taylor et al 2021 2020b as the hydraulic retention time of the dwtp was less than 24 h and deployments occurred over 2 5 weeks the delay time of travel of water through treatment processes was not expected to have a pronounced effect on passive sampling data 3 2 pesticides identified in chemcatcher extracts suspect screening identified 58 pesticide compounds defined as actives and other compounds used in pesticide and biocide formulations table 1 of these pesticides 50 have not been monitored before in this dwtp identified pesticides are those that were amenable to the sampling and instrumental methods used in this work and are not exhaustive of all the pesticides potentially present pesticides not amenable to the methods used here include acid herbicides and metaldehyde the log k ow of identified pesticides ranged between 1 83 and 5 9 with the exception of merphos log k ow 7 67 which was only detected twice this is a similar range to that found by ahrens et al 2015 1 9 to 5 3 using the pocis passive sampler containing hlb receiving phase and grodtke et al 2021 1 74 to 3 77 and taylor et al 2021 1 0 to 5 9 both using the same configuration of chemcatcher as in this work there was a total of 647 detections within the 120 samples analysed the limits of detection of the method used were unknown and will vary between analytes this could have an influence on the number of detections found amongst the different pesticide classes reported passive sampling generally has a lower detection limit compared to discrete sampling methods due to in situ preconcentration taylor et al 2019 2020b fungicides and herbicides each accounted for 31 18 compounds of detected pesticides insecticides and tps each made up just 16 9 compounds with plant growth regulators pgr 3 compounds and repellents 1 compound accounting for 5 and 2 of detected pesticides respectively herbicides had the most detections 202 31 followed by tps 140 22 fungicides 138 21 and repellents 118 18 with significantly fewer detections of insecticides 44 7 and only 6 detections of pgrs 1 if the mean detections per compound for each pesticide type is calculated this is greatest for repellents at 118 solely due to deet which is often found to be ubiquitous in various environmental compartments merel and snyder 2016 taylor et al 2021 tps had the next highest mean detections per compound at 16 followed by herbicides 11 fungicides 8 insecticides 5 and pgrs 2 only deet and dichlorobenzamide had a detection frequency 50 with the next highest detection frequency being the herbicide metazachlor at 31 reduced detection frequency between sites 1 and 2 4 and 5 and 5 and 6 was observed and an increase in abundance between sites 2 and 3 can be attributed to groundwater entering the process stream here however an increase in detection frequency between sites 3 and 4 is not a result of any inputs site 4 had the largest values amongst all sites for total detections 198 and number of pesticides 48 compounds 3 3 treatment

transformation via chemical oxidation e g ozonation and chlorination and photodegradation e g ultraviolet epa 2011 miklos et al 2018 taylor et al 2020b see sm removal most commonly occurs through adsorption to activated carbon sorbents deployed in granular form in filter beds ahmad et al 2010 table s2 presents a review of treatment process performance for a selection of polar pesticides comparison of process performance between studies must be done cautiously as lab based investigations are often not representative of an operational dwtp e g unrealistically high oxidant dose 18 mg

presented in table 2 and described in the following sections 3 3 1 abstraction of raw waters site 1 abstracted waters enter the dwtp where they are sampled at site 1 prior to undergoing clarification thirty four pesticides were present at site 1 with a total of 116 detections most of the pesticides present at site 1 were herbicides and fungicides used on oil seed rape and cereals in addition to insecticides and repellents with both diffuse and point sources two pesticides detected at site 1 were not seen at subsequent sites namely dimethylaniline and maleic hydrazide which are a tp and a pgr respectively these were present in 10 of samples at site 1 3 3 2 clarification site 2 three clarifiers were operated in parallel with site 2 located directly after clarification of the 34 pesticides present at site 1 nine were absent at site 2 but occurred later in the treatment stream potentially from the introduction of water from borehole abstraction clarification removal efficacy over a wide range 0 75 was also observed by stackelberg et al 2007 it was likely that attenuation was partly responsible for the reductions in detection frequency and number of pesticides observed between sites 1 and 2 in this work huerta fontela et al 2011 observed that moderately hydrophobic micropollutants with a log k ow 2 5 could sorb to particles during clarification nam et al 2014 found between 9 and 100 removal for micropollutants during clarification with the removal of micropollutants with a log k ow 2 5 increasing with turbidity here we found that removal during clarification was not correlated to log k ow and solubility although we found removal occurred over a similar range to nam et al 2014 understanding the mechanisms driving attenuation during clarification here is a low priority as subsequent treatment steps contribute to a greater proportion of attenuation of pesticides present in potable water 3 3 3 rgf filtration and groundwater dilution site 3 groundwater enters the treatment stream in a filter channel prior to the rgfs where it is mixed with the supernatant water from the clarifiers the mixing process is uneven meaning the composition of water in the rgfs favours the clarifier supernatant composed of surface water towards rgf a and groundwater towards rgf f located at the opposite end of the filter gallery fig 1 only two pesticides had their final detection in the treatment stream at site 2 whereas nine pesticides appeared for the first time at site 3 simazine a known groundwater contaminant is detected for the first time at site 3 whilst the frequency of atrazine detection 75 was significantly greater than at previous sites where it was only detected in a single sample atrazine desisopropyl a tp of both simazine and atrazine formed in soil university of hertfordshire 2015 was detected for the first time at site 3 similarly atrazine desethyl an atrazine tp also formed in soil university of hertfordshire 2015 displays a similar relationship to its parent compound at site 3 with significantly increased detection frequency our findings suggest that ground water abstraction is the major source of these pesticides in the dwtp such pesticide presence in groundwater is well documented kiefer et al 2021 2019 soulier et al 2016 it is not possible to distinguish between attenuation due to removal in the rgfs or dilution with groundwater for pesticides present at site 2 at higher abundance than site 3 however rgf filtration is not performed for pesticide removal and limited removal is anticipated for most pesticides the removal efficacy between sites 2 and 3 was 126 determined by the change in the total number of detections and 74 determined by the change in the total number of pesticides present our observations support the hypothesis that removal in the rgfs is negligible with the apparent negative removal rates caused by pesticides entering the treatment stream in groundwater leading to supplementation of pesticides already present and or the introduction of pesticides not found in raw surface waters 3 3 4 ozonation site 4 ozonation has been used as both a disinfectant and for pre treatment of process water prior to absorption as practiced at this dwtp there were 48 pesticides after ozonation eight more than the previous site the mean removal through ozonation was 25 based on the number of detections at sites 3 and 4 and 20 based on the number of pesticides with negative removal occurring for many compounds this compares to removal of between 18 and 100 in a variety of laboratory and field trails investigating ozone doses of between 0 5 and 4 3 mg o3 l 1 dong et al 2021 found that tebuconazole and imidacloprid removal in a full scale dwtp with a residual dose of 0 5 to 1 5 mg o3 l 1 was 20 and slightly greater for azoxystrobin at 30 this is a similar dose to the dwtp studied in this work 1 mg l 1 where mean removal of tebuconazole and imidacloprid was 11 and 11 respectively the lower efficacy observed in this work may result from the effect of ozonation in promoting adsorption this is performed to increase removal by gac media but may also promote uptake to psds as the same mechanisms drive both phenomena this effect of ozonation on compound specific uptake into the sampler requires further study and was beyond the remit of this study 3 3 5 gac adsorption site 5 site 5 is located after the gac adsorbers forty eight pesticides were detected at site 4 whereas 21 pesticides were detected at site 5 table 2 twenty eight pesticides were removed entirely in the gac adsorbers there was one instance primicarb one detection where a pesticide present at site 5 was absent at site 4 indicating that desorption from gac media may be the source the mean gac removal efficacy was 70 based on the total number of detections at site 4 198 and site 5 59 whereas removal efficacy was 56 based on pesticides present at each site the frequency of gac breakthrough defined as the number of detections at site 4 divided by 100 then multiplied by the number of detections at site 5 for each pesticide varied between 100 and 0 with deet and foramsulfuron each occurring on one more occasion at site 5 negative removals may result from in situ formation of tps following degradation of a parent compound unrepresentative sampling or due to analytical artefacts tröger et al 2018 however desorption from gac media is the suspected cause here gac breakthrough frequency varied between 11 simazine and 86 metazachlor for the remainder of pesticides stackelberg et al 2007 found that 50 of the removal of micropollutants in the treatment stream of a dwtp was attributable to gac however the contact time of 1 5 3 min investigated is unusually short and is not analogous to the dwtp in this study which has a current target contact time of 10 min 3 3 6 final disinfection and transfer site 6 the final treatment process was disinfection through chlorination dosed in the form of hypochlorite naocl leaving a residual for distribution 1 2 mg l 1 chlorination occurred in two contact tanks immediately after an out of area transfer of treated groundwater water joins the treatment stream site 5 was located before the transfer and site 6 was located after treated water exits the contact tank before entering distribution twenty one pesticides were detected at site 5 whereas eleven pesticides were detected at site 6 twelve pesticides were removed entirely during disinfection there was one instance isomethiozin one detection where a pesticide present at site 6 was absent at site 5 possibly indicating that the transfer is the source of the detection at site 6 the detection frequency of pesticides detected at site 6 ranged from 5 three pesticides to 100 for deet removal efficacy was 22 number of detections at sites 5 and 6 or 48 number of pesticides at sites 5 and 6 pesticides detected at site 6 included six herbicides four tps one repellent and one fungicide table 1 no insecticides were present after disinfection 3 4 pesticide fate through the treatment stream and risk in treated water monitoring of the process stream of dwtps and benchtop studies have found that a majority of pesticide attenuation is attributable to chemical oxidation and adsorption with activated carbon adsorbents dong et al 2021 matsushita et al 2018 ormad et al 2008 stackelberg et al 2007 stackelberg et al 2007 found that hydrophilic micropollutants could persist through the treatment stream at detectable concentrations with percentage removal in treated waters ranging from 25 to 100 similarly matsushita et al 2018 found a negative correlation between hydrophilicity and removal by activated carbon pesticide fate at sites 3 4 5 and 6 is thought to be of greatest importance to understanding the risk here defined as the likelihood of an individual pesticide exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 posed by pesticides this is because these sites are located after pesticides have entered the treatment stream and also include the treatment processes responsible for most pesticide attenuation the 23 pesticides occurring at either site 5 or site 6 table 2 are likewise thought to pose the greatest risk as detection at these sites indicates either gac breakthrough formation during disinfection or introduction in the transfer entering the treatment stream after the gac adsorbers fig 2 presents clustering of the 23 pesticides based on similarities in fate at sites 3 4 5 and 6 representing ozonation gac filtration and disinfection processes six pesticide clusters clusters 0 5 are determined according to k means clustering of the normalised log2 average peak abundance at each site measured through passive sampling coupled to screening a differential distance metric was used k means partitions clusters of data points according to the closest random centroid number of centroids equals number of clusters selected followed by iteration where the centroid of each cluster is set to the mean value of data points within the cluster iteration continues until the distance separating clusters from the cluster centroids is minimised this allows for similarities in variation at progressive sites within qualitative datasets to be identified table s3 presents the pesticides present in each cluster alongside associated values for removal efficacy these are calculated based on detection frequency normalised abundance the sum of raw abundance and the average of raw abundance of pesticides in samples where positive detections are made 3 4 1 cluster 0 cluster 0 contains one pesticide epoxiconazole which is completely removed during treatment with ozonation gac filtration and chlorination each contributing to removal if the number of detections at subsequent sites is used to calculate attenuation ozonation 43 and gac filtration 50 are each responsible for a similar percentage of removal however if the sum of abundance at each site is used gac filtration is responsible for the majority of attenuation 82 with additional attenuation during chlorination effectively removing any epoxiconazole in gac filtrate 3 4 2 cluster 1 cluster 1 contains four pesticides of which one foramsulfuron is detected at site 6 pesticides in this cluster show little response to gac displaying zero or in the case of foramsulfuron and pirimicarb negative removal indicating the source of some of these detections at site 5 is desorption from the gac media foramsulfuron is the only cluster 1 pesticide detected at site 6 removal of foramsulfuron is 38 based on the average raw abundance in samples where it is detected at sites 4 and 5 and 24 based on the sum of raw abundance at these sites indicating that the gac still reduces the concentration of foramsulfuron during episodic increases all pesticides in cluster 1 occur infrequently at very low abundances and are thought to pose little risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs 0 1 μg l 1 in the treatment stream despite the apparent ineffectiveness of gac for their removal 3 4 3 cluster 2 cluster 2 contains five pesticides one of which atrazine desethyl is detected at site 6 pesticides in this cluster are characterised by negative removals during ozonation possibly due to the effect this has on increasing uptake to psds there is significant removal during gac filtration followed by complete removal during chlorination for all but atrazine desethyl gac removal efficacy for atrazine desethyl based on detection frequency normalised abundance and the sum of raw abundance show good agreement at 82 83 and 81 respectively this is slightly better than the 60 efficacy observed by ormad et al 2008 however if the average raw abundance in samples where atrazine desethyl is detected at sites 4 and 5 is used to calculate removal this is slightly negative 2 inspection of the deployment specific detection data at sites 4 and 5 for atrazine desethyl reveal that the first of the two detections at site 5 followed five deployments of raised abundance at site 4 the second detection at site 5 occurred following a gap of a deployment where atrazine desethyl was absent at sites 4 after resumed raised abundance at site 4 again lead to gac breakthrough this indicates that gac removal efficacy for atrazine desethly drops after sustained presence in the treatment stream possibly due to saturation of gac media it should be noted that removal in gac adsorbers is concentration dependant cosgrove et al 2019 patiño et al 2015 on occasions gac breakthrough occurred the abundance at site 4 had been sustained and stable 10 000 instrument peak area if the abundance at site 4 increased in this situation it is probable that removal efficacy would likewise increase until gac media again became saturated unlike other pesticides in cluster 2 negative removal is observed for atrazine desethyl between sites 5 and 6 deployment specific detection data suggests this is likely attributable to the presence of atrazine desethyl in the out of area transfer entering the stream between these sites supplementing gac breakthrough 3 4 4 cluster 3 cluster 3 contains seven pesticides three of which deet metazachlor and propyzamide are detected at site 6 negative removal during ozonation was observed for most pesticides in this group with a few exceptions for deet metazachlor and diuron depending on the calculation method the mean ozonation removal efficacies for cluster 3 pesticides are 23 32 63 and 36 based on detection frequency normalised abundance the sum of raw abundance and the average raw abundance respectively like cluster 2 this is likely due to ozonation promoting uptake to the psd a possibility supported by the larger change observed in the sum of raw abundance between sites 4 and 5 for pesticides in clusters 2 and 3 the fate of pesticides in cluster 3 are divergent during gac filtration for example gac breakthrough of clothianidin occurs on two occasions the first of these happened following three deployments of clothianidin presence at the gac inlet over which the abundance was falling from an initial peak the second occurred after a gap where clothianidin was absent at the inlet for the next deployment with its resumed presence at the gac inlet again leading to breakthrough gac breakthrough of clothianidin and atrazine desethyl happened during the same deployments and the source of both pesticides in the treatment stream is the groundwater abstraction gac breakthrough of clothianidin is thought to result from reduced adsorption to and desorption from saturated media leading to incomplete removal and supplementation of clothianidin at the gac inlet at the tail end of a sustained episode of pollution during the initial peak of the pollution episode the gac effectively removes clothianidin however as the inlet concentration falls so does removal efficacy until desorption results in higher abundance at the outlet which we observed in the deployment specific data boscalid and 2 hydroxyterbuthylazine each display similar fate to clothianidin diuron did not display the same behaviour however as it occurred at site 5 during a deployment where it was absent at site 4 and had been for a sustained period it is possible that this is a false positive because diuron was detected in field blanks possibly due to contamination and underwent blank subtraction see table s1 despite this chlorination effectively removed all pesticides in cluster 3 except deet metazachlor and propyzamide propyzamide and metazachlor displayed partial gac breakthrough during episodic pollution propyzamide was only detected at site 5 during the initial peak of pollution events when abundance at the gac inlet was greatest resulting in incomplete removal the abundance of propyzamide at site 5 increased with abundance at the gac inlet as did the removal efficacy of the gac chlorination had good removal efficacy for propyzamide however removing 89 of the sum raw abundance between sites 5 and 6 the removal efficacy between sites 3 and 6 was high for propyzamide at 75 76 or 83 based on detection frequency normalised abundance and the sum of raw abundance respectively metazachlor fate is similar to propyzamide in that gac breakthrough occurs during the initial peak of a pollution episode however breakthrough is maintained throughout sustained periods of pollution and similar to clothianidin appears to be influenced by the degree of saturation of gac media metazachlor removal efficacy during gac was 66 70 based on abundance at sites 4 and 5 which is comparable to biela et al 2020 who observed gac removal efficacy between 58 and 86 metazachlor is also amenable to removal during chlorination to a lesser degree however gac adsorption is the main mechanism for attenuation in the dwtp metazachlor is thought to pose a risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 to water quality throughout sustained pollution events with this risk greatest during the initial and any subsequent peaks in pollution deet is ubiquitously observed in environmental waters merel and snyder 2016 and has been observed in dwtps at high concentrations 844 ng l 1 wang et al 2022 here it displays incomplete removal between sites 3 and 6 with zero removal based on detection frequency and 69 removal if abundance based on the instrumental response is used this second figure is similar to those reported previously by stackelberg et al 2007 25 75 ling et al 2017 40 70 and tröger et al 2021 88 98 3 4 5 cluster 4 cluster 4 contains two pesticides atrazine and dichlorobenzamide ozonation has little effect on the fate of these pesticides however significant removal occurs during gac filtration cluster 4 pesticides occur in 50 of samples at the gac inlet gac removal efficacy is higher for atrazine 85 86 than dichlorobenzamide 61 79 if calculated using detection frequency normalised abundance or sum raw abundance at sites 4 and 5 gac breakthrough of atrazine occurred after periods of sustained raised abundance at the gac inlet whilst dichlorobenzamide breakthrough was more regular however the magnitude of dichlorobenzamide breakthrough increased during periods of sustained raised abundance at the gac inlet dichlorobenzamide underwent attenuation during chlorination which was broadly similar in magnitude to that observed during gac filtration atrazine underwent less attenuation between sites 5 and 6 possibly due to supplementation from the transfer entering the treatment stream and or resistance to chlorination 3 4 6 cluster 5 cluster 5 contains four pesticides which all occur infrequently at low abundance cluster 5 pesticides occur at sites downstream of those from which they are absent such negative removal may be caused by desorption from the gac media or introduction to the treatment stream in the transfer ultimately it is not thought cluster 5 pesticides pose a risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 to water quality at the dwtp and there is no need to confirm the sources of these pesticides in the treatment stream at present these pesticides are not thought to pose a risk because of their infrequent detection and the low abundance instrumental response when detections do occur additionally these pesticides have not demonstrated the ability to breakthrough the main barrier to treatment gac adsorbers 3 5 managing the current and future risk to water quality in the dwtp eleven pesticides were detected in treated drinking waters totalling 46 detections table 2 this represents 19 of pesticides detected in the dwtp elfikrie et al 2020 found 9 pesticides in raw water 4 of these were detected in treated waters at a dwtp removal efficiencies for these compounds imidacloprid propiconazole buprofezin and tebuconazole ranged between 77 and 88 indicating good attenuation through treatment we observed similar removal throughout treatment for most of the pesticides present at site 6 with the exception of deet and metazachlor for the six pesticides thought to pose the greatest risk likelihood of exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 we have devised example critical control points triggers and responses to manage risks to water quality at the dwtp table 3 the rationale for inclusion of these six pesticides was made based on the description of pesticide fate in the treatment stream for individual and clusters of pesticides provided in section 3 4 pesticides that showed breakthrough of the main treatment barrier and were resistant to chlorination were thought to pose the greatest risk this example has been informed by the results of passive sampling and can be expanded to other pesticides detected in the dwtp e g compounds that could breakthrough the gac but were not present at site 6 the proposed controls and triggers table 3 can all be accommodated within the current and enhanced monitoring programme spot water sampling and targeted analysis of the water utility triggers are based on the presence and fate of pesticides determined from passive sampling and are set at appropriate concentrations approaching the legislated threshold concentration dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 triggers direct which responses should be undertaken in future by the water utility enhanced monitoring and risk assessments and how these should be interpreted to ensure the necessary information is available to manage each risk as it develops the controls triggers and responses have been designed so the water utility can use existing tools spot sampling and targeted analysis and procedures risk assessments to manage the risks identified using passive sampling currently of the eleven pesticides detected in the treated drinking water only four atrazine atrazine desethyl metazachlor and propyzamide are routinely monitored by the water utility as part of their current monitoring programme this illustrates the usefulness of using passive sampling coupled to suspect screening to enhance the understanding of pesticide risk and inform operational monitoring within the water industry the approach taken in this work could be repeated in other dwtps to produce controls triggers and responses to manage risks to water quality likelihood of any pesticide exceeding the dwqs of 0 1 μg l 1 a similar approach has been used within catchment monitoring for pesticides by taylor et al 2021 and likewise shows how passive sampling can provide new insights compared to relying on spot water sampling alone 4 conclusions chemcatcher with an hlb receiving phase in combination with high resolution suspect screening was used to provide the first long term characterisation of polar pesticide fate through an operational dwtp fifty eight polar pesticides from a range of classes were detected at various points throughout the treatment works the multivariate statistical approach allowed pesticide fate throughout the treatment stream to be interpreted within the complex qualitative passive sampling data set using k means analysis pesticides with a similar fate during ozonation gac filtration and chlorination could be identified and formed into 6 clusters this monitoring approach can be used to inform water quality management plans that contain controls triggers and responses for pesticides assessed to pose the greatest current and future risk to water quality the study shows how passive sampling coupled to screening can enhance the understanding of pesticide fate within dwtps the work flow could be expanded to include other classes of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products to help to understand the fate of these compounds in dwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15629,the blooming of beach cast seaweed has caused environmental degradation in some coastal regions therefore a proper treating and utilizing method of beach cast seaweed is demanded this study investigated the potential of producing power or biofuel from pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed and the effect of the ash washing process first the raw and washed beach cast seaweeds rs and ws were prepared thereafter thermogravimetric analysis tg bench scale pyrolysis experiment process simulation and life cycle assessment lca were conducted the tg results showed that the activation energies of thermal decomposition of the main organic contents of rs and ws were 44 23 and 58 45 kj mol respectively three peak temperatures of 400 500 and 600 c were used in the bench scale pyrolysis experiments of ws the 600 c case yielded the most desirable gas and liquid products the bench scale pyrolysis experiment of rs was conducted at 600 c as well also an lca was conducted based on the simulation result of 600 c pyrolysis of ws the further process simulation and lca results show that compare to producing liquid biofuel and syngas a process designed for electricity production is most favored it was estimated that treating 1 ton of dry ws can result in a negative cumulative energy demand of 2 98 gj and carbon emissions of 790 89 kg co2 equivalence graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyrolysis beach cast seaweed biochar lca negative emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication and global warming can affect the water ecosystem feuchtmayr et al 2009 it has been suggested that eutrophication and global warming have caused an expansion and an increased blooming of algae in different regions in the world xiao et al 2019 the blooming algae can be naturally accumulated e g by aeolian transport jiménez et al 2017 which forms the beach cast seaweed this beach cast seaweed is a complex organic mixture with high inorganic ash contents ranging from 3 6 to 79 yohannes 2015 the accumulated beach cast provides excess nutrients to shallow coastal water during decomposition which can cause a deterioration of water quality in the shallow coastal ecosystem in terms of eutrophication depletion of dissolved oxygen and weakening of the local food web structure prasad et al 2019 also the accumulation of beach cast seaweed and its odour affect the recreational qualities of local beaches malm et al 2004 risén et al 2017 2014 which decreases tourist satisfaction lück and o neill 2007 moreover greenhouse gas ghg emissions have also been promoted during the natural decomposition of beach cast seaweed harb and chow 2022 traditionally beach cast seaweed has been used as a bio fertilizer in some regions franzén et al 2019 however it has been found that the beach cast seaweed might contain a too high cadmium content franzén et al 2019 which is a highly toxic heavy metal element and which has high photostability and transferability causing it to easily be uptaken by crops li et al 2020 2021 thus it is important to treat or utilize beach cast seaweed properly the abundant organic content of the beach cast seaweed makes it a good candidate for bioenergy and biomaterial production elfar et al 2021 pyrolysis has been considered a promising process for converting organic rich biomass into renewable energy and materials fahmy et al 2020 gao et al 2022 during the pyrolysis process the biomass is heated to a temperature between 350 to 800 c in the absence of oxygen so that it is decomposed into biochar liquid and gas gollakota et al 2016 the produced char can be applied as soil remediation carbon sink catalyst and raw materials to produce electrodes etc wang and wang 2019 the bio oil can be used as biofuel feedstocks to synthesize different chemicals etc hu and gholizadeh 2020 the pyro gas can be used as industrial fuel and hydrogen etc sathiskumar and karthikeyan 2019 as a result the diversity of the pyrolytic products gives high flexibility to further applications and reduces the secondary pollution wang et al 2022a which makes pyrolysis to be seen as one of the most promising techniques to treat wastes chen et al 2014 numerous previous studies have focused on the pyrolysis of one or several specific species of algae for energy and materials production pourkarimi et al 2019 sekar et al 2021 li et al reviewed works on high quality biooil production from microalgae mainly through fast pyrolysis li et al 2019 however the research on pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed is still needed due to its more complex composition than pure algal biomass especially the indispensable ash content makes the pyrolysis performance different from that of a single species of algae thus other parameters need to be considered when optimizing the pyrolysis process katakula et al investigated the possibility of using the beach cast seaweed biochar as a fertilizer katakula et al 2020 sörbom evaluated biochar production from the pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed through a life cycle assessment sörbom 2020 however few studies are available investigating the potential of producing power or biofuel from the pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed it is also a fact that during the harvest of beach cast seaweed a lot of sand and ash is collected with seaweeds thus it would be much better to remove or wash such inorganics away before utilizing the seaweeds in order to evaluate the feasibility of producing power or biofuel from beach cast seaweed in an environmentally feasible way the pyrolysis behaviours of raw and washed beach cast seaweeds were studied using thermogravimetric analysis tg and bench scale slow pyrolysis experiments the kinetic data of the pyrolysis reactions were determined and the pyrolytic products were characterized based on the experimental result a process model of pyrolysis was developed using aspen plus v12 1 to study the influence of a washing pretreatment on the efficiency of the pyrolysis process based on the data from modelling and literature a life cycle assessment lca was employed to analyze the climate change impact and the cumulative energy demand ced of producing power or biofuel and the possibility of creating a carbon sink from the management of beach cast seaweeds 2 materials and methodologies the research procedure in this study can be divided into three parts materials preparation experiment and analysis as shown in fig 1 the materials preparation includes the processes of drying grinding sieving and ash washing of the received beach cast seaweed the samples with or without being washing treated were denoted as raw beach cast seaweed rs and washed beach cast seaweed ws respectively two different experiments namely tg and bench scale pyrolysis experiment were conducted to get the initial results of the pyrolysis performance of rs and ws the kinetic parameters of rs and ws pyrolysis were evaluated using the tg results on the other hand process simulations followed by an lca study were conducted based on the results obtained from the bench scaled pyrolysis experiments 2 1 materials the beach cast seaweed sample used in this study is a mixture of red algae furcellaria lumbracilis dominant species 30 50 polysiphonia ceramium sp brown algae fucus vesiculosis and seagrass the sample was harvested on the 6th of february 2020 at friggarsviken on the island of gotland in the baltic sea sweden furcellaria lumbracilis and polysiphonia ceramium are widespread red algae species in the baltic sea fucus vesiculosus is the most common brown algae and perennial algae in baltic sea countries therefore we assume that this sample mixture can represent most of the macroalgae species in the baltic sea area even though the proportion of each species could differ from season to season this study can be a preliminary analysis for practical usage of such beach cast macroalgae for the energy recovery the sample was first dried at 105 110 c in the oven for 24 h before being grinded and thereafter sieved to sizes smaller than 1 mm the obtained dried particles were denoted as rs the rs was washed using the following processes 1 adding 700 g of rs into 1 5 l of deionized water 2 stirring the mixed suspension using a glass rod for 1 min then leave it for 1 min to be stable 3 separate the washed seaweeds and the ash sediment by using gravity after the washing process the obtained washed seaweed was dried again at 105 110 c for 24 h the dried washed seaweed was denoted as ws the schematic process diagrams of the preparation of rs and ws are shown in fig 2 proximate and ultimate analyses were performed on rs and ws the method and corresponding system error are shown in table a1 in supplement a the higher heating value hhv and lower heating value lhv of rs and ws were calculated using eqs a1 a2 based on the results of the ultimate analysis respectively 2 2 thermo gravimetry differential thermal analysis a netzsch 449 f1 jupiter simultaneous thermal analyzer sta was used for the tg experiments this instrument can measure the result of differential thermal analyses dta while doing the tg experiment here 48 58 mg of rs or 22 65 mg of ws was heated from room temperature to 900 c with a heating rate of 20 c min in an argon atmosphere during the experiment the thermal decomposition behaviour was further studied according to the dtg curves the kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition reactions of pre exponential factors a min 1 and activation energies e a kj mol were calculated based on the nth order model fn by using netzsch kinetics neo software version 2 4 6 8 the related equations are presented by eqs a3 to a7 in the supplement a 2 3 bench scale pyrolysis experiment the setup of instruments for the bench scale pyrolysis experiment was introduced in the previous work wen et al 2021 briefly 50 g of rs or 30 g of ws was placed in a stainless steel crucible in each experiment the crucible was then installed in a vertical stainless steel cylinder which set in the middle of a resistance furnace the bottom of the cylinder was connected to a gas collecting system organized in the following order one condenser a two necked flask two gas washing bottles a micro gas chromatography micro gc and a gasbag during the experiment the condenser and gas washing bottles were kept at 20 c the ws rs sample was heated up from room temperature to 400 500 and 600 c using a heating rate of 15 c min the experiment was kept at peak temperature for 1 h n2 was introduced to the steel cylinder from the top as the carrier gas throughout the experiment with a 200 ml min gas flow rate after the experiment the produced char and permanent gas were collected from the sample crucible and gasbag the liquid product was condensed in the condenser two necked flask and gas washing bottles here the liquid product can be divided into oil and aqueous aq fractions by phase separation because of the different water solubilities of the produced compounds in the liquid product the compounds in the oil fraction present a low solubility in water while they have a high solubility in the aq fraction most of the produced oil fraction is stuck to the glasses of the flask and gas washing bottles the two liquid phases can be separated by pouring out the aq fraction carefully 2 4 product characterizations char ultimate analysis and proximate analyses were performed by using the methods shown in table a3 in supplement a the hhv of chars were calculated by using eq a1 in supplement a liquid a chns elemental analyser vario e l cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh germany was used to determine the c h n and s contents of the oil the water contents of the aq were determined by using the standard astm e203 method the water fraction of the aq is named reaction water and the rest of the aq is named light organics in this study the chemical components of the oil and aq fractions were characterized by using a gc ms system which is constructed by coupling an agilent 7890a gc and an agilent 5985c ms the setup and process of gc ms were introduced in the previous study wen et al 2021 briefly the liquid samples were firstly dissolved by methanol after injecting the sample the gc column was heated up to 45 c and held for 5 min to volatilize the methanol then the sample was heated to 250 c with a heating rate of 5 c min the chemicals in sample was separated by gc during the ramping and determined by ms gas an agilent 490 micro gc was used to determine the gas composition the gases of h2 ch4 co co2 c2h6 c3h6 c3h8 were calibrated and analyzed 2 5 process simulation in order to evaluate the process energy efficiency of the pyrolysis processes of rs and ws the process models at 600 c of each feedstock were developed by using aspen plus v12 1 as shown in fig b1 the process simulation includes drying pyrolysis condensation and syngas combustion for the heat and electricity generations 2 5 1 components specification in aspen plus all the components from raw materials to the final product involved in this chemical process are defined with major classes three component classes were used in this study conventional solid and non conventional components all the involved components in this simulation were defined properly to maximize the reliability of this model 2 5 1 1 feedstock and char due to the large amount of sand physically trapped in the matrix of seaweeds the ws and rs samples were defined as a mixture of sio2 and sand free seaweeds the mass of sio2 was calculated based on the si content of the feedstock the sio2 was defined as a solid inert component the moisture content was defined as the water flow in the stream of feedstock a previous study reveals that natural predrying reduces the moisture content of seaweeds to a value between 18 to 20 naylor 1976 therefore the moisture content of seaweeds was defined as 20 wt of the total feedstock the ash free seaweeds and char product were defined as being non conventional components hcoalgen and dcoaligt models combined with the ultimate and proximate analysis of rs ws and produced chars were used to estimate the physical and chemical properties of these non conventional components gao et al 2021 2 5 1 2 liquid and gas according to the experimental results the liquid product is separated into an oil fraction and an aq fraction gc ms analysis determined that the major components in both the aq and oil fractions according to the gc ms results the compounds in the liquid product were classified into different chemical groups the compounds in the same chemical group have similar physical and chemical properties due to that they contain the same functional groups and a similar chemical structure this model compounds method is further introduced in chapter 1 in supplement b in the modelling 15 model compounds were selected for each group to simplify the model listed in table 1 the yield of each model compound is set according to the liquid composition from the result of gc ms the yield of each gas product is set as the experimental result the gases h2 ch4 co co2 c2h6 c3h6 c3h8 are included in the simulation 2 5 2 simulation setup and assumption the uniquac method was used as the base property method in this simulation uniquac is the only property method that enables parameter estimation and binary parameter runs for the selected model compounds the stream class was set to mixcinc because the ci soild and non conventional components were included in this simulation the pyrolysis process of seaweeds includes drying pyrolysis char separation and condensing 2 5 2 1 feedstock pretreatment the feedstock stream was defined as consisting of a mixture of dry sand free seaweeds sio2 and water as mentioned above the water content was set as 20 after a natural drying sörbom 2020 the thermal drying process was simulated by using a flash2 unit the parameters of this process block were set as a 105 c temperature and an atmospheric pressure 2 5 2 2 pyrolysis reactor the pyrolysis reactor was simulated by using a heater and an ryield unit the dry feedstock was preheated to 600 c in the heater unit thereafter the flow of feedstock was introduced into the ryield to form the pyrolytic products the product yield in the ryield unit was defined based on the experimental data in this study the net heat duty of the heater and ryield referred to the heat required to heat the feedstock from 25 to 600 c and the heat of pyrolysis reaction respectively 2 5 2 3 combined heat and power production from syngas the permanent gas was rich in co ch4 h2 and other combustible gases in this process the cogeneration of power from a permanent gas through using a combined heat and power chp production is proposed the lhv of the permanent gas is derived from the aspen model s stream result the chp production is calculated outside of the aspen model the efficiency of chp was simulated by using a triangular model which is shown in chapter 6 in the supplement b the efficiency was chosen to be the most likely value 25 and 52 for electricity and heat production respectively the produced heat and electricity were used in the pyrolysis process internally 2 5 2 4 biochar application biochar can be applied for land applications such as a carbon sink a fertilizer or as a soil amendment the large n p and k content in biochar from seaweeds pyrolysis promotes the biochar application as a fertilizer salim 2016 the biochar modelled was assumed to have a 100 year stability of 82 in line with the latest methodology available woolf et al 2021 and the biochar hydrogen to organic carbon molar ratio 2 5 2 5 upgrading process of biooil the energy and mass balance of upgrading process of biooil was calculated outside of the aspen software the hydrogen consumption was defined based on literature data jones et al 2009 sorunmu et al 2018 the partial electrochemical deoxygenation combined with hydrodeoxygenation processes were selected to upgrade the biooil sorunmu et al 2018 which is described in chapter 8 in the supplement b the biooil produced from pyrolysis was firstly upgraded in the electrochemical deoxygenation reactor then compressed and introduced into the hydrodeoxygenation reactor where it reacted with the introduced hydrogen gas the heating value of the derived liquid biofuel was assumed to be 44 mj kg which is comparable to the value for fossil diesel nuclear essentials 2021 2 6 life cycle assessment in this study three scenarios which integrated the process of converting beach cast seaweeds into useful product liquid biofuel electricity syngas through pyrolysis and upgrading processes were proposed as shown in fig 3 in all the scenarios the biochar is produced as by product which act as carbon sink for land application a well to tank lca was conducted in order to evaluate the environmental impact of this proposed process with different scenarios a previous study has estimated the annual global co2 c flux of seagrass wrack to be between 1 31 and 19 04 tgc yr liu et al 2019a another work has found that 20 to 6000 tons per km of the shoreline of beach cast seaweed can be harvested in the southern baltic sea region per year chubarenko et al 2021 thus there is no doubt that the natural degradation of beach cast seaweed can contribute to a considerable amount of greenhouse gases emission moreover the proper treatment of beach cast seaweed can also decrease other secondary pollution effects caused by the natural degradation of beach cast seaweed including the strong odour and eutrophication lymperatou et al 2022 in this study the harvest transportation drying pyrolysis biooil upgrading chp steam reforming and the use of the biochar as a soil amendment were considered possible emissions from decomposition of beach cast on beaches is a subject of ongoing research robust estimates are not yet available so these are not included in the present study the impurities of the wastewater of prewashing process are mainly sand removed from the raw sample therefore the purification of such wastewater is not critical and has not been considered in the lca study the system boundaries of the lca are shown in fig 3 in scenario 1 2 3 s1 s2 s3 the main product are set as liquid biofuel electricity and syngas respectively biochar is here seen as a co product used as a soil amendment sequestering carbon in all the scenarios in s1 the pyrolysis gas was introduced to chp which provide heat and electricity back to the system in s2 the heat produced from chp of pyrolytic vapor is employed to meet up the heat requirement from drying and pyrolysis in s3 the steam reforming was designed to use the steam produced from the drying process wang et al 2022b 2022c therefore no external steam is needed the environmental impact of using external water and power for steam reforming can be avoided two functional unit were chosen as management of 1 ton dry seaweeds and 1 mj of bioenergy delivered the selection of multi functional unites can reveal a broader insight including both waste management and energy production possible excess heat obtained from chp and possible nutrient substitutions from biochar use was cut off which is a conservative choice in a previous study it was revealed that the environmental impacts are not sensitive to the infrastructure and equipment zaimes et al 2017 therefore in this lca the infrastructure and equipment were neglected the revised renewable energy directive red ii implemented from 2020 is widely used in european countries eu 2018 in sweden red ii is applied for the calculation of swedish reduction obligation system haus et al 2020 the red calculation method see details in annex vi in red ii is simplified from the iso standard of lca calculation finkbeiner et al 2006 according to red ii the carbon footprint of process is calculated as the global warming potential within a 100 year time frame gwp100 in this study the global warming potential is defined as emissions quantified as co2 equivalence co2eq according to red ii the following eq 1 is used for calculation of gwp100 1 e e e c e l e p e t d e u e s c a e c c s e c c r where e refers to the total emission from the usage of the fuel eec refers to the emissions from raw materials extraction or cultivation el refers to the emissions from land use changes ep refers to the emission from processing etd refers to the emission released during transportation and distribution eu refers to the emission released from fuel in use esca eccs and eccr refers to the emission saving from the soil carbon accumulation and co2 capture storage and co2 replacement respectively 2018 in this study the eec is represented by the emission from the usage of the external energy during the collection and cultivation which is detailed described in chapter 3 in supplement b thomas et al 2021 the parameter el is set to zero because the beach cast seaweeds as algae waste is a feedstock which recognized for an advanced biofuel production according to red ii 2018 the usage of such advanced feedstock has no impact on land use change the parameter ep is emissions generated during processes such as electricity consumption for thermal processing which is estimated from process simulation chapter 5 in supplement b in this study etd includes the transportation of seaweeds from beach to biorefinery plant final product from plant to place in use gas station for s1 and s2 grid for s3 as shown in chapter 4 in supplement b as an advanced biofuel production process the eu emission from the combustion of part of the product syngas and pyrolytic vapour is recognized as having a zero value according to red ii 2018 the emissions saving parameters esca eccs eccr are represented by the land application of biochar the emissions which can be stored in biochar in a 100 year frame is estimated by using equation described in chapter2 in supplement b woolf et al 2021 based on eq 1 the life cycle of ghg emissions of the proposed process in a 100 year frame gwp100 can be estimated on the other hand the cumulative energy demand ced refer to the direct and indirect energy required to deliver a unit of product throughout its life cycle which a critical indicator of a natural resource use arvesen and hertwich 2015 in this study ced is estimated based on energy harvested approach frischknecht et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 proximate and ultimate analyses of rs and ws the proximate analyses of rs and ws are given in table 2 it can be seen that the ash content of beach cast seaweed is reduced from 72 95 to 33 30 wt which means that 81 49 wt of the ash is successfully removed during the washing process in this case the removed ash is mainly consisting of such sand which previously trapped on the sticky surface of seaweeds also the fixed carbon c fix and volatile matter are increased from 3 80 and 23 30 to 9 80 and 56 90 dewatered respectively these results indicate that the washing process in this work effectively removes ash as a result of the reduction of the ash content all the contents of c h n o s and cl in the beach cast seaweed are increased as shown in table 2 notably the contents of c and h of ws are nearly triple the values of rs these results reveal that the ws could be a much more promising feedstock than rs for the pyrolysis process the ash compositions of rs and ws are given in table 3 the highest ash elements in both the rs and ws samples are si and ca which are mainly contributed by the sand fragments of shells and rocks the ash contents of the elements of k ca mg and fe are even increased after the washing process this is because of the high abundance of these elements in algae ross et al 2009 3 2 tg dtg the tg and dtg results of rs and ws are shown in fig 4 the relative dta results are given in fig a1 for reference it can be seen that the pyrolysis processes of rs and ws can be roughly divided into three stages when the temperature is below 210 c there exist two small peaks in the ws and rs curves which probably are due to the moisture removal stage 2 takes place between 210 and 600 c where the thermal decomposition of organic fractions in the rs and ws samples occurs the temperature range of 600 to 900 c is defined as stage 3 in this work which is connected to the ash decomposition behavior when the tg experiments were finished at 900 c the remaining weight of rs and ws are 77 05 and 47 22 wt respectively on the other hand as a result of the higher organic fraction the dtg peak of the ws sample is more significant than that of the rs sample in stage 2 the e a values of stage 2 of the pyrolysis of rs and ws were estimated as 44 23 and 58 45 kj mol respectively the higher e a value of ws is caused by the higher organic fraction which is decomposable during stage 2 the corresponding kinetic parameters of a and n are given in table a4 in supplement a the r2 values of the produced kinetic results of rs and ws are 0 9986 and 0 9989 respectively the deduced conversion curves and their fitting results are shown in fig a2 in supplement a the fitting results show that the kinetic calculations resulted in acceptable values 3 3 product characterization 3 3 1 mass balance the normalized mass distribution results of the bench scale pyrolysis experiments of rs 400 500 and 600 c and ws 600 c are present in table 4 the corresponding results of ws produced at 400 and 500 c are given in fig a3 the sums of the mass yield rate of different products from the four cases range from 90 34 to 95 03 which is acceptable for the bench scale experiment the reaction water is the water which produced during pyrolysis determined by using the water content analysis the char yield of rs was 81 31 which was higher than for all the ws results this can correspond to rs s higher ash content and lower volatile matter compared to that of ws for the ws cases it can be seen that when the peak temperature is raised from 400 to 600 c the yields of chars decrease from 63 15 to 59 57 as a result of that more volatiles of char products have been decomposed into condensable and permanent gases he et al 2020 this also led to the increase of the yields of gas from 14 82 to 18 07 on the other hand the yield of oil was first decreased from 4 70 to 3 25 and then raised to 3 58 when the temperature increased from 400 to 600 c the yield of light organics had a reversed trend compared to that of oil this can be explained by the fact that when the temperature rises from 400 to 500 c more big molecules decompose into smaller ones this can lead to a lower yield of oil and a higher yield of light organics however if the temperature continued to increase from 500 to 600 c second reactions among the condensable gases would happen which would result in the production of more oil and less light organics a more detailed discussion is given in section 3 3 3 liquid analysis 3 3 2 elemental analysis of chars the results of the elemental analysis of chars are shown in table 5 for the chars produced from ws the contents of c and ash increased when the peak temperature raised from 400 to 500 c on the other hand the contents of h n and o showed reversed trends this was due to the higher decomposition level of the volatile matters in ws when the temperature rises the main contents of chars were c fix and ash over 90 of char produced from the rs at 600 c was ash which explained the higher char yield of rs compared to that of ws 3 3 3 liquid analysis the liquid product from pyrolysis of ws is analyzed by using gc ms the phase separation of oil and aq is a result of using the step cooling process as well as the different water solubility of compounds in seaweeds pyrolysis the protein is first decomposed into amides and amines thereafter n heterocycles is generated from the cyclization reaction of the amides and amines from the proteins pyrolysis leng et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the nitrogen heterocyclic compounds are classified depending on the number of nitrogen atoms on the heterocycle structure as shown in fig 5 the 1n heterocycles and 2n heterocycles groups exist in both oil and aq however the component in those groups differs from each other in oil and aq the 1n heterocycles mainly consists of the hydrophobic indoles in the oil while it consists of hydrophilic pyridines in the aq chen et al has investigated the reaction pathways of n containing species during algae pyrolysis chen et al 2017 and similar nitrogen heterocyclic compounds were found however a difference from the current study is that amines and amides were detected in the previous study the absence of amides and amines is probably due to the long reaction time which enables a thorough cyclization reaction of amides and amines that promotes the production of produce nitrogen heterocyclic compounds in fig 5 a typical components are present beyond its belonging group the fahs group refers to the long chain hydrocarbons derived from fatty acids the fads group refers to fatty acids derivates other than the fahs such as long chain nitriles long chain ketones etc it can be seen that at 600 c the produced oil fraction has the highest area percentage of fads 40 52 and the lowest area percentages of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds 22 22 and phenols 8 03 compared to the other two cases the higher content of the long chain components and the lower content of the cyclic compound of the oil fraction produced from 600 c indicates that the oil has a larger potential to be used as liquid after the upgrading process e g hydrodeoxygenation the main component of phenols in the oil fraction is p cresol this is due to the lipophilic property of p cresol vanholder et al 1999 on the other hand as shown in fig 5 b the main phenols component in the aq is phenol which is because of the hydrophilic property of phenol froehner et al 2009 from fig 5 b it can be seen that the area percentage of ketones shows a positive correlation to the temperature when the area percentage of phenols sugars and sulfur containing components show opposite trends the main component of the sulfur containing is so2 which is probably is a result of the decomposition of s containing proteins the results of the elemental analysis of produced oil fraction are given in table a5 in supplement a for the oil produced from ws at different peak temperatures the contents of c h n s and o were similar among the different cases namely approximately 64 8 7 5 0 85 and 19 respectively compared to the results of ws the oil produced from rs at 600 c had a higher c content of 68 53 and lower s and o contents of 0 59 and 16 07 3 3 4 micro gc of gases the compositions of the produced gases were determined by using micro gc and the results are shown in fig 6 the main gases produced from the four cases were h2 ch4 co and co2 obviously when the temperature is raised from 400 to 600 c the gas produced from the pyrolysis of ws contained more h2 ch4 co and less co2 these results indicate that the peak temperature of 600 c favored the gas product of the pyrolysis of ws the composition of c2h6 c3h6 c3h8 of the gases produced from the pyrolysis of ws would decrease with a higher temperature it should be noted that the pyrolysis of rs at 600 c yielded a gas product with a higher volume percentage of combustible gases 3 4 process evaluation the model of pyrolysis was validated by using the experimental result the chp and biooil upgrading processes were validated by using data from the literature sorunmu et al 2018 zaimes et al 2017 based on the analyses of process simulations and the experimental results the energy flows of pyrolysis of rs and ws at 600 c are illustrated in sankey diagrams as shown in fig 7 the detailed data of the sankey diagram is shown in tables a6 a7 in supplement a the energy amount of each stream shown in fig 7 is calculated based on 1 tonne of dry solid feedstock in this process the energy inlets are chemical heat of the seaweed feedstock heat for drying and heat for pyrolysis the energy outputs include heat losses steam from drying sensible as well as the and chemical heat of pyrolytic products the power generations from the chp of syngas is 1162 2 and 403 2 mj in fig 7 a and b respectively the power production from chp of syngas is used to compensate for the heat needed in the pyrolysis process in fig 7 a the direct energy required for the whole process is 1121 0 mj while it is 1485 8 mj in fig 7 b as shown in fig 7 the prewash can decrease the external energy needs for drying and pyrolysis therefore a prewash of the seaweeds would be essential for improving the energy efficiency of the proposed process it should be noted that the latent heat of char aqueous fraction oil fraction and syngas have the potential to be recovered to optimize the process efficiency even more 3 5 cumulative energy demands and global warming potential in order to utilize the product from the pyrolysis process a well to tank lca is studied with respect to the designed three scenarios s1 liquid biofuel production s2 electricity production s3 syngas production table 6 presents the ced and climate change impacts in order to manage 1 ton dry beach cast seaweeds or deliver 1 mj product from beach cast seaweeds the detailed calculation is presented in supplement c see in sheet lca s1 lca s2 and lca s3 the result of lca indicates that the lowest ced and gwp100 values can be obtained from scenario 2 negative ced values is only obtained when scenario 2 is applied while negative gwp100 values can be achieved in both scenarios 1 and 2 when we take the priority on waste management scenario 2 shows the most desirable result however when we take the priority on bioenergy production the result needs to be further discussed by comparing scenario 1 with other researches on lca of biofuel production 0 95 mj mj biofuel scenario 1 shows that the proposed process has a higher energy efficiency than it of fossil fuel production which is from 1 02 to 1 28 mj mj fossil fuel kim and dale 2003 the gwp100 value of s1 65 55 g co2eq mj is lower than that of jet fuel 80 7 109 3 g co2eq mj for us 80 4 105 7 g co2eq mj for eu de jong et al 2017 biofuel derived from food 48 131 g co2eq mj ou et al 2009 and biofuel derived from pyrolysis combined with hdo 39 13 39 41 g co2eq mj peters et al 2015 a previous lca study of bioenergy produced from algae reports 173 02 to 265 26 g co2eq mj bioenergy production by using different processes transesterification pyrolysis anaerobic digestion etc mishra et al 2019 in this study process of s2 gwp100 value 680 62 g co2eq mj shows higher potential of emission saving than the reported processes the result of the lca studies reveals that the proposed s1 and s2 of integrated process could be suitable from a climate change mitigation perspective 3 6 limitations the s1 and s2 of integrated process shows a comparable ced value compared to fossil fuel production and a negative gwp100 however there are some limitations that could affect the feasibility of this process previous studies studied lca performance of different processes producing bioenergy from lignocellulosic biomass through machine learning cheng et al 2020a 2020b results reported by those studies show that the pyrolysis condition could affect the lca in a way therefore a more comprehensive lca study is required to define the most optimum parameters of thermal processes in this study cadmium cd is accumulated in seaweeds previous research has reported that the cd in biochar produced from the pyrolysis of seaweeds shows less leaching toxicity than in raw seaweeds liu et al 2019b this result shows that pyrolysis can stabilize the cd in the biochar matrix which will reduce the cd emission to the soil however the melting point of cd is 321 c while the boiling point is 767 c therefore a low peak temperature of pyrolysis could be favourable with respect to cd stabilization future lca studies using the pyrolysis temperature as a sensitive factor to analyze the potential cd emission are of interest to carry out in addition an experimental study should be conducted to support the lca result the carbon stability of the biochar was assumed at 82 in this study which was estimated based on woody biomass the stability of biochar from beach cast seaweeds could be different from woody biochar a better understanding with respect to the seaweeds biochar stability is required in order to optimize the lca results of this proposed process 4 conclusion this study combined tg and bench scale pyrolysis experiments process simulations and lca studies to evaluate the integrated process of converting beach cast seaweeds into biofuel and creating a carbon sink the pyrolysis behavior of the raw seaweed rs and washed seaweed ws were firstly investigated by using tg the ash contents of rs and ws were 72 95 and 33 30 respectively it was estimated that the activation energies of the pyrolysis of the main organic contents of rs and ws were 44 23 and 58 45 kj mol respectively three temperatures of 400 500 and 600 c were used for the bench scale pyrolysis experiments using ws the case of 600 c showed the best potential to be used for fuel and energy production as it produced the best oil and gas products among the studied cases the bench scale pyrolysis experiment of rs was also conducted at 600 c the process simulations show that the ash washing process is necessary for the improvement of process energy efficiency three scenarios were designed for the lca study with the production focusing on liquid biofuel electricity and syngas the lca result of the scenario for producing electricity showed the best energy and environmental performances among the three proposed scenarios a negative cumulative energy demand 2 98 gj and gwp100 790 89 kg co2eq were obtained when treating 1 ton of dry ws declaration of competing interest the

15629,the blooming of beach cast seaweed has caused environmental degradation in some coastal regions therefore a proper treating and utilizing method of beach cast seaweed is demanded this study investigated the potential of producing power or biofuel from pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed and the effect of the ash washing process first the raw and washed beach cast seaweeds rs and ws were prepared thereafter thermogravimetric analysis tg bench scale pyrolysis experiment process simulation and life cycle assessment lca were conducted the tg results showed that the activation energies of thermal decomposition of the main organic contents of rs and ws were 44 23 and 58 45 kj mol respectively three peak temperatures of 400 500 and 600 c were used in the bench scale pyrolysis experiments of ws the 600 c case yielded the most desirable gas and liquid products the bench scale pyrolysis experiment of rs was conducted at 600 c as well also an lca was conducted based on the simulation result of 600 c pyrolysis of ws the further process simulation and lca results show that compare to producing liquid biofuel and syngas a process designed for electricity production is most favored it was estimated that treating 1 ton of dry ws can result in a negative cumulative energy demand of 2 98 gj and carbon emissions of 790 89 kg co2 equivalence graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyrolysis beach cast seaweed biochar lca negative emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication and global warming can affect the water ecosystem feuchtmayr et al 2009 it has been suggested that eutrophication and global warming have caused an expansion and an increased blooming of algae in different regions in the world xiao et al 2019 the blooming algae can be naturally accumulated e g by aeolian transport jiménez et al 2017 which forms the beach cast seaweed this beach cast seaweed is a complex organic mixture with high inorganic ash contents ranging from 3 6 to 79 yohannes 2015 the accumulated beach cast provides excess nutrients to shallow coastal water during decomposition which can cause a deterioration of water quality in the shallow coastal ecosystem in terms of eutrophication depletion of dissolved oxygen and weakening of the local food web structure prasad et al 2019 also the accumulation of beach cast seaweed and its odour affect the recreational qualities of local beaches malm et al 2004 risén et al 2017 2014 which decreases tourist satisfaction lück and o neill 2007 moreover greenhouse gas ghg emissions have also been promoted during the natural decomposition of beach cast seaweed harb and chow 2022 traditionally beach cast seaweed has been used as a bio fertilizer in some regions franzén et al 2019 however it has been found that the beach cast seaweed might contain a too high cadmium content franzén et al 2019 which is a highly toxic heavy metal element and which has high photostability and transferability causing it to easily be uptaken by crops li et al 2020 2021 thus it is important to treat or utilize beach cast seaweed properly the abundant organic content of the beach cast seaweed makes it a good candidate for bioenergy and biomaterial production elfar et al 2021 pyrolysis has been considered a promising process for converting organic rich biomass into renewable energy and materials fahmy et al 2020 gao et al 2022 during the pyrolysis process the biomass is heated to a temperature between 350 to 800 c in the absence of oxygen so that it is decomposed into biochar liquid and gas gollakota et al 2016 the produced char can be applied as soil remediation carbon sink catalyst and raw materials to produce electrodes etc wang and wang 2019 the bio oil can be used as biofuel feedstocks to synthesize different chemicals etc hu and gholizadeh 2020 the pyro gas can be used as industrial fuel and hydrogen etc sathiskumar and karthikeyan 2019 as a result the diversity of the pyrolytic products gives high flexibility to further applications and reduces the secondary pollution wang et al 2022a which makes pyrolysis to be seen as one of the most promising techniques to treat wastes chen et al 2014 numerous previous studies have focused on the pyrolysis of one or several specific species of algae for energy and materials production pourkarimi et al 2019 sekar et al 2021 li et al reviewed works on high quality biooil production from microalgae mainly through fast pyrolysis li et al 2019 however the research on pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed is still needed due to its more complex composition than pure algal biomass especially the indispensable ash content makes the pyrolysis performance different from that of a single species of algae thus other parameters need to be considered when optimizing the pyrolysis process katakula et al investigated the possibility of using the beach cast seaweed biochar as a fertilizer katakula et al 2020 sörbom evaluated biochar production from the pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed through a life cycle assessment sörbom 2020 however few studies are available investigating the potential of producing power or biofuel from the pyrolysis of beach cast seaweed it is also a fact that during the harvest of beach cast seaweed a lot of sand and ash is collected with seaweeds thus it would be much better to remove or wash such inorganics away before utilizing the seaweeds in order to evaluate the feasibility of producing power or biofuel from beach cast seaweed in an environmentally feasible way the pyrolysis behaviours of raw and washed beach cast seaweeds were studied using thermogravimetric analysis tg and bench scale slow pyrolysis experiments the kinetic data of the pyrolysis reactions were determined and the pyrolytic products were characterized based on the experimental result a process model of pyrolysis was developed using aspen plus v12 1 to study the influence of a washing pretreatment on the efficiency of the pyrolysis process based on the data from modelling and literature a life cycle assessment lca was employed to analyze the climate change impact and the cumulative energy demand ced of producing power or biofuel and the possibility of creating a carbon sink from the management of beach cast seaweeds 2 materials and methodologies the research procedure in this study can be divided into three parts materials preparation experiment and analysis as shown in fig 1 the materials preparation includes the processes of drying grinding sieving and ash washing of the received beach cast seaweed the samples with or without being washing treated were denoted as raw beach cast seaweed rs and washed beach cast seaweed ws respectively two different experiments namely tg and bench scale pyrolysis experiment were conducted to get the initial results of the pyrolysis performance of rs and ws the kinetic parameters of rs and ws pyrolysis were evaluated using the tg results on the other hand process simulations followed by an lca study were conducted based on the results obtained from the bench scaled pyrolysis experiments 2 1 materials the beach cast seaweed sample used in this study is a mixture of red algae furcellaria lumbracilis dominant species 30 50 polysiphonia ceramium sp brown algae fucus vesiculosis and seagrass the sample was harvested on the 6th of february 2020 at friggarsviken on the island of gotland in the baltic sea sweden furcellaria lumbracilis and polysiphonia ceramium are widespread red algae species in the baltic sea fucus vesiculosus is the most common brown algae and perennial algae in baltic sea countries therefore we assume that this sample mixture can represent most of the macroalgae species in the baltic sea area even though the proportion of each species could differ from season to season this study can be a preliminary analysis for practical usage of such beach cast macroalgae for the energy recovery the sample was first dried at 105 110 c in the oven for 24 h before being grinded and thereafter sieved to sizes smaller than 1 mm the obtained dried particles were denoted as rs the rs was washed using the following processes 1 adding 700 g of rs into 1 5 l of deionized water 2 stirring the mixed suspension using a glass rod for 1 min then leave it for 1 min to be stable 3 separate the washed seaweeds and the ash sediment by using gravity after the washing process the obtained washed seaweed was dried again at 105 110 c for 24 h the dried washed seaweed was denoted as ws the schematic process diagrams of the preparation of rs and ws are shown in fig 2 proximate and ultimate analyses were performed on rs and ws the method and corresponding system error are shown in table a1 in supplement a the higher heating value hhv and lower heating value lhv of rs and ws were calculated using eqs a1 a2 based on the results of the ultimate analysis respectively 2 2 thermo gravimetry differential thermal analysis a netzsch 449 f1 jupiter simultaneous thermal analyzer sta was used for the tg experiments this instrument can measure the result of differential thermal analyses dta while doing the tg experiment here 48 58 mg of rs or 22 65 mg of ws was heated from room temperature to 900 c with a heating rate of 20 c min in an argon atmosphere during the experiment the thermal decomposition behaviour was further studied according to the dtg curves the kinetic parameters of the thermal decomposition reactions of pre exponential factors a min 1 and activation energies e a kj mol were calculated based on the nth order model fn by using netzsch kinetics neo software version 2 4 6 8 the related equations are presented by eqs a3 to a7 in the supplement a 2 3 bench scale pyrolysis experiment the setup of instruments for the bench scale pyrolysis experiment was introduced in the previous work wen et al 2021 briefly 50 g of rs or 30 g of ws was placed in a stainless steel crucible in each experiment the crucible was then installed in a vertical stainless steel cylinder which set in the middle of a resistance furnace the bottom of the cylinder was connected to a gas collecting system organized in the following order one condenser a two necked flask two gas washing bottles a micro gas chromatography micro gc and a gasbag during the experiment the condenser and gas washing bottles were kept at 20 c the ws rs sample was heated up from room temperature to 400 500 and 600 c using a heating rate of 15 c min the experiment was kept at peak temperature for 1 h n2 was introduced to the steel cylinder from the top as the carrier gas throughout the experiment with a 200 ml min gas flow rate after the experiment the produced char and permanent gas were collected from the sample crucible and gasbag the liquid product was condensed in the condenser two necked flask and gas washing bottles here the liquid product can be divided into oil and aqueous aq fractions by phase separation because of the different water solubilities of the produced compounds in the liquid product the compounds in the oil fraction present a low solubility in water while they have a high solubility in the aq fraction most of the produced oil fraction is stuck to the glasses of the flask and gas washing bottles the two liquid phases can be separated by pouring out the aq fraction carefully 2 4 product characterizations char ultimate analysis and proximate analyses were performed by using the methods shown in table a3 in supplement a the hhv of chars were calculated by using eq a1 in supplement a liquid a chns elemental analyser vario e l cube elementar analysensysteme gmbh germany was used to determine the c h n and s contents of the oil the water contents of the aq were determined by using the standard astm e203 method the water fraction of the aq is named reaction water and the rest of the aq is named light organics in this study the chemical components of the oil and aq fractions were characterized by using a gc ms system which is constructed by coupling an agilent 7890a gc and an agilent 5985c ms the setup and process of gc ms were introduced in the previous study wen et al 2021 briefly the liquid samples were firstly dissolved by methanol after injecting the sample the gc column was heated up to 45 c and held for 5 min to volatilize the methanol then the sample was heated to 250 c with a heating rate of 5 c min the chemicals in sample was separated by gc during the ramping and determined by ms gas an agilent 490 micro gc was used to determine the gas composition the gases of h2 ch4 co co2 c2h6 c3h6 c3h8 were calibrated and analyzed 2 5 process simulation in order to evaluate the process energy efficiency of the pyrolysis processes of rs and ws the process models at 600 c of each feedstock were developed by using aspen plus v12 1 as shown in fig b1 the process simulation includes drying pyrolysis condensation and syngas combustion for the heat and electricity generations 2 5 1 components specification in aspen plus all the components from raw materials to the final product involved in this chemical process are defined with major classes three component classes were used in this study conventional solid and non conventional components all the involved components in this simulation were defined properly to maximize the reliability of this model 2 5 1 1 feedstock and char due to the large amount of sand physically trapped in the matrix of seaweeds the ws and rs samples were defined as a mixture of sio2 and sand free seaweeds the mass of sio2 was calculated based on the si content of the feedstock the sio2 was defined as a solid inert component the moisture content was defined as the water flow in the stream of feedstock a previous study reveals that natural predrying reduces the moisture content of seaweeds to a value between 18 to 20 naylor 1976 therefore the moisture content of seaweeds was defined as 20 wt of the total feedstock the ash free seaweeds and char product were defined as being non conventional components hcoalgen and dcoaligt models combined with the ultimate and proximate analysis of rs ws and produced chars were used to estimate the physical and chemical properties of these non conventional components gao et al 2021 2 5 1 2 liquid and gas according to the experimental results the liquid product is separated into an oil fraction and an aq fraction gc ms analysis determined that the major components in both the aq and oil fractions according to the gc ms results the compounds in the liquid product were classified into different chemical groups the compounds in the same chemical group have similar physical and chemical properties due to that they contain the same functional groups and a similar chemical structure this model compounds method is further introduced in chapter 1 in supplement b in the modelling 15 model compounds were selected for each group to simplify the model listed in table 1 the yield of each model compound is set according to the liquid composition from the result of gc ms the yield of each gas product is set as the experimental result the gases h2 ch4 co co2 c2h6 c3h6 c3h8 are included in the simulation 2 5 2 simulation setup and assumption the uniquac method was used as the base property method in this simulation uniquac is the only property method that enables parameter estimation and binary parameter runs for the selected model compounds the stream class was set to mixcinc because the ci soild and non conventional components were included in this simulation the pyrolysis process of seaweeds includes drying pyrolysis char separation and condensing 2 5 2 1 feedstock pretreatment the feedstock stream was defined as consisting of a mixture of dry sand free seaweeds sio2 and water as mentioned above the water content was set as 20 after a natural drying sörbom 2020 the thermal drying process was simulated by using a flash2 unit the parameters of this process block were set as a 105 c temperature and an atmospheric pressure 2 5 2 2 pyrolysis reactor the pyrolysis reactor was simulated by using a heater and an ryield unit the dry feedstock was preheated to 600 c in the heater unit thereafter the flow of feedstock was introduced into the ryield to form the pyrolytic products the product yield in the ryield unit was defined based on the experimental data in this study the net heat duty of the heater and ryield referred to the heat required to heat the feedstock from 25 to 600 c and the heat of pyrolysis reaction respectively 2 5 2 3 combined heat and power production from syngas the permanent gas was rich in co ch4 h2 and other combustible gases in this process the cogeneration of power from a permanent gas through using a combined heat and power chp production is proposed the lhv of the permanent gas is derived from the aspen model s stream result the chp production is calculated outside of the aspen model the efficiency of chp was simulated by using a triangular model which is shown in chapter 6 in the supplement b the efficiency was chosen to be the most likely value 25 and 52 for electricity and heat production respectively the produced heat and electricity were used in the pyrolysis process internally 2 5 2 4 biochar application biochar can be applied for land applications such as a carbon sink a fertilizer or as a soil amendment the large n p and k content in biochar from seaweeds pyrolysis promotes the biochar application as a fertilizer salim 2016 the biochar modelled was assumed to have a 100 year stability of 82 in line with the latest methodology available woolf et al 2021 and the biochar hydrogen to organic carbon molar ratio 2 5 2 5 upgrading process of biooil the energy and mass balance of upgrading process of biooil was calculated outside of the aspen software the hydrogen consumption was defined based on literature data jones et al 2009 sorunmu et al 2018 the partial electrochemical deoxygenation combined with hydrodeoxygenation processes were selected to upgrade the biooil sorunmu et al 2018 which is described in chapter 8 in the supplement b the biooil produced from pyrolysis was firstly upgraded in the electrochemical deoxygenation reactor then compressed and introduced into the hydrodeoxygenation reactor where it reacted with the introduced hydrogen gas the heating value of the derived liquid biofuel was assumed to be 44 mj kg which is comparable to the value for fossil diesel nuclear essentials 2021 2 6 life cycle assessment in this study three scenarios which integrated the process of converting beach cast seaweeds into useful product liquid biofuel electricity syngas through pyrolysis and upgrading processes were proposed as shown in fig 3 in all the scenarios the biochar is produced as by product which act as carbon sink for land application a well to tank lca was conducted in order to evaluate the environmental impact of this proposed process with different scenarios a previous study has estimated the annual global co2 c flux of seagrass wrack to be between 1 31 and 19 04 tgc yr liu et al 2019a another work has found that 20 to 6000 tons per km of the shoreline of beach cast seaweed can be harvested in the southern baltic sea region per year chubarenko et al 2021 thus there is no doubt that the natural degradation of beach cast seaweed can contribute to a considerable amount of greenhouse gases emission moreover the proper treatment of beach cast seaweed can also decrease other secondary pollution effects caused by the natural degradation of beach cast seaweed including the strong odour and eutrophication lymperatou et al 2022 in this study the harvest transportation drying pyrolysis biooil upgrading chp steam reforming and the use of the biochar as a soil amendment were considered possible emissions from decomposition of beach cast on beaches is a subject of ongoing research robust estimates are not yet available so these are not included in the present study the impurities of the wastewater of prewashing process are mainly sand removed from the raw sample therefore the purification of such wastewater is not critical and has not been considered in the lca study the system boundaries of the lca are shown in fig 3 in scenario 1 2 3 s1 s2 s3 the main product are set as liquid biofuel electricity and syngas respectively biochar is here seen as a co product used as a soil amendment sequestering carbon in all the scenarios in s1 the pyrolysis gas was introduced to chp which provide heat and electricity back to the system in s2 the heat produced from chp of pyrolytic vapor is employed to meet up the heat requirement from drying and pyrolysis in s3 the steam reforming was designed to use the steam produced from the drying process wang et al 2022b 2022c therefore no external steam is needed the environmental impact of using external water and power for steam reforming can be avoided two functional unit were chosen as management of 1 ton dry seaweeds and 1 mj of bioenergy delivered the selection of multi functional unites can reveal a broader insight including both waste management and energy production possible excess heat obtained from chp and possible nutrient substitutions from biochar use was cut off which is a conservative choice in a previous study it was revealed that the environmental impacts are not sensitive to the infrastructure and equipment zaimes et al 2017 therefore in this lca the infrastructure and equipment were neglected the revised renewable energy directive red ii implemented from 2020 is widely used in european countries eu 2018 in sweden red ii is applied for the calculation of swedish reduction obligation system haus et al 2020 the red calculation method see details in annex vi in red ii is simplified from the iso standard of lca calculation finkbeiner et al 2006 according to red ii the carbon footprint of process is calculated as the global warming potential within a 100 year time frame gwp100 in this study the global warming potential is defined as emissions quantified as co2 equivalence co2eq according to red ii the following eq 1 is used for calculation of gwp100 1 e e e c e l e p e t d e u e s c a e c c s e c c r where e refers to the total emission from the usage of the fuel eec refers to the emissions from raw materials extraction or cultivation el refers to the emissions from land use changes ep refers to the emission from processing etd refers to the emission released during transportation and distribution eu refers to the emission released from fuel in use esca eccs and eccr refers to the emission saving from the soil carbon accumulation and co2 capture storage and co2 replacement respectively 2018 in this study the eec is represented by the emission from the usage of the external energy during the collection and cultivation which is detailed described in chapter 3 in supplement b thomas et al 2021 the parameter el is set to zero because the beach cast seaweeds as algae waste is a feedstock which recognized for an advanced biofuel production according to red ii 2018 the usage of such advanced feedstock has no impact on land use change the parameter ep is emissions generated during processes such as electricity consumption for thermal processing which is estimated from process simulation chapter 5 in supplement b in this study etd includes the transportation of seaweeds from beach to biorefinery plant final product from plant to place in use gas station for s1 and s2 grid for s3 as shown in chapter 4 in supplement b as an advanced biofuel production process the eu emission from the combustion of part of the product syngas and pyrolytic vapour is recognized as having a zero value according to red ii 2018 the emissions saving parameters esca eccs eccr are represented by the land application of biochar the emissions which can be stored in biochar in a 100 year frame is estimated by using equation described in chapter2 in supplement b woolf et al 2021 based on eq 1 the life cycle of ghg emissions of the proposed process in a 100 year frame gwp100 can be estimated on the other hand the cumulative energy demand ced refer to the direct and indirect energy required to deliver a unit of product throughout its life cycle which a critical indicator of a natural resource use arvesen and hertwich 2015 in this study ced is estimated based on energy harvested approach frischknecht et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 proximate and ultimate analyses of rs and ws the proximate analyses of rs and ws are given in table 2 it can be seen that the ash content of beach cast seaweed is reduced from 72 95 to 33 30 wt which means that 81 49 wt of the ash is successfully removed during the washing process in this case the removed ash is mainly consisting of such sand which previously trapped on the sticky surface of seaweeds also the fixed carbon c fix and volatile matter are increased from 3 80 and 23 30 to 9 80 and 56 90 dewatered respectively these results indicate that the washing process in this work effectively removes ash as a result of the reduction of the ash content all the contents of c h n o s and cl in the beach cast seaweed are increased as shown in table 2 notably the contents of c and h of ws are nearly triple the values of rs these results reveal that the ws could be a much more promising feedstock than rs for the pyrolysis process the ash compositions of rs and ws are given in table 3 the highest ash elements in both the rs and ws samples are si and ca which are mainly contributed by the sand fragments of shells and rocks the ash contents of the elements of k ca mg and fe are even increased after the washing process this is because of the high abundance of these elements in algae ross et al 2009 3 2 tg dtg the tg and dtg results of rs and ws are shown in fig 4 the relative dta results are given in fig a1 for reference it can be seen that the pyrolysis processes of rs and ws can be roughly divided into three stages when the temperature is below 210 c there exist two small peaks in the ws and rs curves which probably are due to the moisture removal stage 2 takes place between 210 and 600 c where the thermal decomposition of organic fractions in the rs and ws samples occurs the temperature range of 600 to 900 c is defined as stage 3 in this work which is connected to the ash decomposition behavior when the tg experiments were finished at 900 c the remaining weight of rs and ws are 77 05 and 47 22 wt respectively on the other hand as a result of the higher organic fraction the dtg peak of the ws sample is more significant than that of the rs sample in stage 2 the e a values of stage 2 of the pyrolysis of rs and ws were estimated as 44 23 and 58 45 kj mol respectively the higher e a value of ws is caused by the higher organic fraction which is decomposable during stage 2 the corresponding kinetic parameters of a and n are given in table a4 in supplement a the r2 values of the produced kinetic results of rs and ws are 0 9986 and 0 9989 respectively the deduced conversion curves and their fitting results are shown in fig a2 in supplement a the fitting results show that the kinetic calculations resulted in acceptable values 3 3 product characterization 3 3 1 mass balance the normalized mass distribution results of the bench scale pyrolysis experiments of rs 400 500 and 600 c and ws 600 c are present in table 4 the corresponding results of ws produced at 400 and 500 c are given in fig a3 the sums of the mass yield rate of different products from the four cases range from 90 34 to 95 03 which is acceptable for the bench scale experiment the reaction water is the water which produced during pyrolysis determined by using the water content analysis the char yield of rs was 81 31 which was higher than for all the ws results this can correspond to rs s higher ash content and lower volatile matter compared to that of ws for the ws cases it can be seen that when the peak temperature is raised from 400 to 600 c the yields of chars decrease from 63 15 to 59 57 as a result of that more volatiles of char products have been decomposed into condensable and permanent gases he et al 2020 this also led to the increase of the yields of gas from 14 82 to 18 07 on the other hand the yield of oil was first decreased from 4 70 to 3 25 and then raised to 3 58 when the temperature increased from 400 to 600 c the yield of light organics had a reversed trend compared to that of oil this can be explained by the fact that when the temperature rises from 400 to 500 c more big molecules decompose into smaller ones this can lead to a lower yield of oil and a higher yield of light organics however if the temperature continued to increase from 500 to 600 c second reactions among the condensable gases would happen which would result in the production of more oil and less light organics a more detailed discussion is given in section 3 3 3 liquid analysis 3 3 2 elemental analysis of chars the results of the elemental analysis of chars are shown in table 5 for the chars produced from ws the contents of c and ash increased when the peak temperature raised from 400 to 500 c on the other hand the contents of h n and o showed reversed trends this was due to the higher decomposition level of the volatile matters in ws when the temperature rises the main contents of chars were c fix and ash over 90 of char produced from the rs at 600 c was ash which explained the higher char yield of rs compared to that of ws 3 3 3 liquid analysis the liquid product from pyrolysis of ws is analyzed by using gc ms the phase separation of oil and aq is a result of using the step cooling process as well as the different water solubility of compounds in seaweeds pyrolysis the protein is first decomposed into amides and amines thereafter n heterocycles is generated from the cyclization reaction of the amides and amines from the proteins pyrolysis leng et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the nitrogen heterocyclic compounds are classified depending on the number of nitrogen atoms on the heterocycle structure as shown in fig 5 the 1n heterocycles and 2n heterocycles groups exist in both oil and aq however the component in those groups differs from each other in oil and aq the 1n heterocycles mainly consists of the hydrophobic indoles in the oil while it consists of hydrophilic pyridines in the aq chen et al has investigated the reaction pathways of n containing species during algae pyrolysis chen et al 2017 and similar nitrogen heterocyclic compounds were found however a difference from the current study is that amines and amides were detected in the previous study the absence of amides and amines is probably due to the long reaction time which enables a thorough cyclization reaction of amides and amines that promotes the production of produce nitrogen heterocyclic compounds in fig 5 a typical components are present beyond its belonging group the fahs group refers to the long chain hydrocarbons derived from fatty acids the fads group refers to fatty acids derivates other than the fahs such as long chain nitriles long chain ketones etc it can be seen that at 600 c the produced oil fraction has the highest area percentage of fads 40 52 and the lowest area percentages of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds 22 22 and phenols 8 03 compared to the other two cases the higher content of the long chain components and the lower content of the cyclic compound of the oil fraction produced from 600 c indicates that the oil has a larger potential to be used as liquid after the upgrading process e g hydrodeoxygenation the main component of phenols in the oil fraction is p cresol this is due to the lipophilic property of p cresol vanholder et al 1999 on the other hand as shown in fig 5 b the main phenols component in the aq is phenol which is because of the hydrophilic property of phenol froehner et al 2009 from fig 5 b it can be seen that the area percentage of ketones shows a positive correlation to the temperature when the area percentage of phenols sugars and sulfur containing components show opposite trends the main component of the sulfur containing is so2 which is probably is a result of the decomposition of s containing proteins the results of the elemental analysis of produced oil fraction are given in table a5 in supplement a for the oil produced from ws at different peak temperatures the contents of c h n s and o were similar among the different cases namely approximately 64 8 7 5 0 85 and 19 respectively compared to the results of ws the oil produced from rs at 600 c had a higher c content of 68 53 and lower s and o contents of 0 59 and 16 07 3 3 4 micro gc of gases the compositions of the produced gases were determined by using micro gc and the results are shown in fig 6 the main gases produced from the four cases were h2 ch4 co and co2 obviously when the temperature is raised from 400 to 600 c the gas produced from the pyrolysis of ws contained more h2 ch4 co and less co2 these results indicate that the peak temperature of 600 c favored the gas product of the pyrolysis of ws the composition of c2h6 c3h6 c3h8 of the gases produced from the pyrolysis of ws would decrease with a higher temperature it should be noted that the pyrolysis of rs at 600 c yielded a gas product with a higher volume percentage of combustible gases 3 4 process evaluation the model of pyrolysis was validated by using the experimental result the chp and biooil upgrading processes were validated by using data from the literature sorunmu et al 2018 zaimes et al 2017 based on the analyses of process simulations and the experimental results the energy flows of pyrolysis of rs and ws at 600 c are illustrated in sankey diagrams as shown in fig 7 the detailed data of the sankey diagram is shown in tables a6 a7 in supplement a the energy amount of each stream shown in fig 7 is calculated based on 1 tonne of dry solid feedstock in this process the energy inlets are chemical heat of the seaweed feedstock heat for drying and heat for pyrolysis the energy outputs include heat losses steam from drying sensible as well as the and chemical heat of pyrolytic products the power generations from the chp of syngas is 1162 2 and 403 2 mj in fig 7 a and b respectively the power production from chp of syngas is used to compensate for the heat needed in the pyrolysis process in fig 7 a the direct energy required for the whole process is 1121 0 mj while it is 1485 8 mj in fig 7 b as shown in fig 7 the prewash can decrease the external energy needs for drying and pyrolysis therefore a prewash of the seaweeds would be essential for improving the energy efficiency of the proposed process it should be noted that the latent heat of char aqueous fraction oil fraction and syngas have the potential to be recovered to optimize the process efficiency even more 3 5 cumulative energy demands and global warming potential in order to utilize the product from the pyrolysis process a well to tank lca is studied with respect to the designed three scenarios s1 liquid biofuel production s2 electricity production s3 syngas production table 6 presents the ced and climate change impacts in order to manage 1 ton dry beach cast seaweeds or deliver 1 mj product from beach cast seaweeds the detailed calculation is presented in supplement c see in sheet lca s1 lca s2 and lca s3 the result of lca indicates that the lowest ced and gwp100 values can be obtained from scenario 2 negative ced values is only obtained when scenario 2 is applied while negative gwp100 values can be achieved in both scenarios 1 and 2 when we take the priority on waste management scenario 2 shows the most desirable result however when we take the priority on bioenergy production the result needs to be further discussed by comparing scenario 1 with other researches on lca of biofuel production 0 95 mj mj biofuel scenario 1 shows that the proposed process has a higher energy efficiency than it of fossil fuel production which is from 1 02 to 1 28 mj mj fossil fuel kim and dale 2003 the gwp100 value of s1 65 55 g co2eq mj is lower than that of jet fuel 80 7 109 3 g co2eq mj for us 80 4 105 7 g co2eq mj for eu de jong et al 2017 biofuel derived from food 48 131 g co2eq mj ou et al 2009 and biofuel derived from pyrolysis combined with hdo 39 13 39 41 g co2eq mj peters et al 2015 a previous lca study of bioenergy produced from algae reports 173 02 to 265 26 g co2eq mj bioenergy production by using different processes transesterification pyrolysis anaerobic digestion etc mishra et al 2019 in this study process of s2 gwp100 value 680 62 g co2eq mj shows higher potential of emission saving than the reported processes the result of the lca studies reveals that the proposed s1 and s2 of integrated process could be suitable from a climate change mitigation perspective 3 6 limitations the s1 and s2 of integrated process shows a comparable ced value compared to fossil fuel production and a negative gwp100 however there are some limitations that could affect the feasibility of this process previous studies studied lca performance of different processes producing bioenergy from lignocellulosic biomass through machine learning cheng et al 2020a 2020b results reported by those studies show that the pyrolysis condition could affect the lca in a way therefore a more comprehensive lca study is required to define the most optimum parameters of thermal processes in this study cadmium cd is accumulated in seaweeds previous research has reported that the cd in biochar produced from the pyrolysis of seaweeds shows less leaching toxicity than in raw seaweeds liu et al 2019b this result shows that pyrolysis can stabilize the cd in the biochar matrix which will reduce the cd emission to the soil however the melting point of cd is 321 c while the boiling point is 767 c therefore a low peak temperature of pyrolysis could be favourable with respect to cd stabilization future lca studies using the pyrolysis temperature as a sensitive factor to analyze the potential cd emission are of interest to carry out in addition an experimental study should be conducted to support the lca result the carbon stability of the biochar was assumed at 82 in this study which was estimated based on woody biomass the stability of biochar from beach cast seaweeds could be different from woody biochar a better understanding with respect to the seaweeds biochar stability is required in order to optimize the lca results of this proposed process 4 conclusion this study combined tg and bench scale pyrolysis experiments process simulations and lca studies to evaluate the integrated process of converting beach cast seaweeds into biofuel and creating a carbon sink the pyrolysis behavior of the raw seaweed rs and washed seaweed ws were firstly investigated by using tg the ash contents of rs and ws were 72 95 and 33 30 respectively it was estimated that the activation energies of the pyrolysis of the main organic contents of rs and ws were 44 23 and 58 45 kj mol respectively three temperatures of 400 500 and 600 c were used for the bench scale pyrolysis experiments using ws the case of 600 c showed the best potential to be used for fuel and energy production as it produced the best oil and gas products among the studied cases the bench scale pyrolysis experiment of rs was also conducted at 600 c the process simulations show that the ash washing process is necessary for the improvement of process energy efficiency three scenarios were designed for the lca study with the production focusing on liquid biofuel electricity and syngas the lca result of the scenario for producing electricity showed the best energy and environmental performances among the three proposed scenarios a negative cumulative energy demand 2 98 gj and gwp100 790 89 kg co2eq were obtained when treating 1 ton of dry ws declaration of competing interest the
