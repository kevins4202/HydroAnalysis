17715,microplastics mps are ubiquitous in freshwater environments and represent an emerging anthropogenic vector for contaminants such as trace metals in this study virgin expanded polystyrene ps particles were placed in a eutrophic urban lake and a reservoir serving as the resource of domestic water for 4 weeks to develop biofilms on the surface for comparison natural adsorbents in the form of suspended particles and surficial sediment were also sampled from these waterbodies the trace metal adsorption properties of anthropogenic virgin and biofilm covered microplastics and natural substrates were investigated and compared via batch adsorption experiments the adsorption isotherms fitted the langmuir model revealed that biofilms could enhance the trace metal adsorption capacity of mps however natural substrates still had a greater adsorption capacity biofilms also alter the adsorption kinetics of trace metals onto mps the process of adsorption onto virgin mps was dominated by intraparticle diffusion whereas film diffusion governed adsorption onto biofilm covered microplastics and natural substrates the trace metal adsorption of all the substrates was significantly dependent on ph and ionic strength the adsorption mechanisms were further analyzed by sem eds and ft ir the enhancement of adsorption was mainly attributed to complexation with functional groups contained in the biofilms including carboxyl amino and phenyl oh collectively biofilm development intensifies the role of mps in the migration and fate of trace metals in freshwater since it does not give mps an edge over natural substrates in adsorption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic adsorption biofilm surficial sediment suspended particles adsorption mechanism 1 introduction with increasing plastic production and usage plastic waste has become vast and ubiquitous with an estimated global weight of 6300 million metric tons at the end of 2015 geyer et al 2017 recently the fragmentation of plastic waste into microplastics mps diameter 5 mm has attracted increasing public and regulatory concern thompson et al 2004 do sul et al 2014 eerkes medrano et al 2015 until now most mp studies have focused on the marine environment however there is still a lack of research on freshwater environments which are the source and method of transport of mps to the ocean current studies have revealed that mps are ubiquitous in inland freshwater systems and may additionally accumulate within lakes and reservoirs where they may persist for decades similar to the timescales predicted for marine habitats dris et al 2015 li et al 2017 lambert and wanger 2018 zhang et al 2015 2018 thus inland lakes and reservoirs may serve as important sinks and hotspots for mps in freshwater due to their durability and capacity for mobility mps represent a significant anthropogenic adsorbent in aquatic environments serving as a vector for various contaminants over a long time period and or transport distance ashton et al 2010 turner and holmes 2015 furthermore various microorganisms including bacteria fungi algae archaea protozoa and protists which are frequently embedded in or associated with a polymeric matrix of extracellular polymeric substances epss can readily colonize on the surfaces of mps in the form of biofilms creating the plastisphere zettler et al 2013 flemming 2020 the formation and development of biofilms may alter the morphology and physicochemical properties of mps and the adsorption capacity of contaminants onto biofilm covered microplastics bmps may be enhanced rummel et al 2017 biofilms ubiquitous in freshwater environments are a dynamic microbial system comprised of complex taxonomically diverse microorganisms acting as a complex adsorbent system which can trap and accumulate a wide range of substances with different adsorption mechanisms and binding sites flemming et al 2016 seviour et al 2019 wang et al 2019 therefore biofilms may be crucial for predicting the adsorption capacity of mps and may have a significant influence on the environmental processes and fate of different pollutants in aquatic environments trace metals can pose serious threats to ecosystem and human health owing to their unique properties of bioaccumulation non degradability and high toxicity their adsorption to natural solid materials including suspended particles sps and surficial sediment ss is considered as an essential process that controls their environmental behavior and fate in natural aquatic environments stumm and morgan 2012 akcil et al 2015 however the adsorption of trace metals onto mps has also been documented suggesting mps particularly bmps may also act as vectors for trace metals brennecke et al 2016 koelmans et al 2016 lang et al 2020 in natural waters anthropogenic and natural substrates commonly coexist consequently it is necessary to compare the adsorption capacity kinetics and mechanisms between them for trace metals in order to systematically and precisely evaluate the vector effects of mps currently little research has been conducted on these parameters in this study expanded polystyrene was selected to represent mps as it is one of the most common types of mp in both marine and inland freshwater environments worldwide the aims of this study are 1 to compare the trace metal adsorption capacity and kinetics of sps ss mps and bmps 2 to reveal the effects of solution ph and ionic strength on the uptake of trace metals 3 to investigate the adsorption mechanisms by characterization of surface properties and discuss the vector effects of microplastics and their potential environmental implications 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization the nanhu lake 43 51 n 125 18 e and shitoukoumen reservoir 125 50 18 e 43 50 27 n were selected for collection of ss and sp samples and cultivation of biofilms on mps the nanhu lake is a eutrophic urban lake located in the center of changchun city p r china with a total storage capacity of 3 37 106 m3 the water of this lake is supplied by terrestrial runoff precipitation and municipal sewage the shitoukoumen reservoir located in the midstream of the yinma river supplies urban domestic water for changchun city agricultural irrigation water and water for fish farms in the surrounding region the total storage capacity is 1 28 109 m3 providing over 80 of the potable water for the metropolitan area in changchun guan et al 2019 the ss samples were collected from both the waters at depths ranging from 0 to 10 cm gravel animal and plant residues and other impurities were subsequently removed via a 1 9 mm pore nylon sieve 10 mesh the sps were separated from the water using a membrane filter 0 45 μm and the sp samples retained on the filters were rinsed and transferred into a minimal mineral salts mms solution table s1 the classification of ss sps and bmps followed the previously reported method of hua et al 2012 and the results are provided in fig s1 virgin expanded ps particles were obtained from a local material plant weitai water purification material co ltd gongyi china the virgin expanded ps particles with a diameter of around 2 mm were washed and placed into several homemade equipment fig s2 in the superficial oxic waters of the lake and reservoir at a depth of around 30 cm the particles were left there for a period of 4 weeks in the summer season june july in order to develop biofilms and become bmps after collection the bmps were rinsed and kept in an mms solution all samples were stored at 4 c until analysis the morphology of the solid materials was characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem xl 30 esem feg fei company at 10 0 kv energy dispersive spectroscopy eds x max oxford instruments was used to determine the elements comprising the biofilms and their distribution on the solid material surfaces fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet antaris ii was carried out to identify transformations of the functional groups before and after adsorption 2 2 batch adsorption experiments adsorption isotherm experiments of co ii ni ii cu ii zn ii cd ii and ag i onto ss sps bmps and mps were conducted in mms solution using seven different metal concentrations 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000 μg l a total of 30 mg dry weight of ss sps bmps and mps was added to 50 ml of the solutions in 100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene centrifuge tubes the tubes were shaken continuously at 25 1 c while maintaining a ph of 6 0 0 1 using 0 01 mol l hno3 and naoh and an ionic strength of 0 02 with nano3 after 48 h the solid sample was separated from the solution using a 0 22 μm millipore polyethersulfone pes membrane filter all the isotherm adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate kinetic experiments were conducted under the same conditions as the isotherm experiments using a series of polytetrafluoroethylene centrifuge tubes the initial concentration of all the trace metals was 1000 μg l samples were collected at specified time intervals 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h and passed through a 0 22 μm millipore pes membrane filter to analyze aqueous concentrations of trace metals all the adsorption kinetic experiments were performed in duplicate the effects of solution ph and ion strength on the adsorption of trace metals to different solid materials were evaluated the initial solution ph was adjusted using naoh and hcl solutions and a range of ph values from 4 0 to 7 0 was investigated nano3 was used to investigate the effects of ion strength which had a range from 0 01 to 0 10 the amount of each trace metal adsorbed per unit mass of solid material upon equilibrium was estimated with the mass balance equation table s2 the equilibrium concentrations of trace metals in the liquid phase were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer agilent 7500 usa in the analytical laboratory of the northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences which is certificated by china metrology accreditation and the total background concentrations of trace metals in ss sps bmps and mps were also measured table s3 laboratory quality assurance and quality control were established in our previous study guan et al 2018 and the recoveries were 91 9 108 4 for all the trace metals the adsorption of trace metals onto the polytetrafluoroethylene centrifuge tube was also tested table s4 all of the reagents were of analytical grade and all of the solutions were prepared with ultra pure water all of the containers for the trace metal adsorption experiment and analysis were soaked in hno3 10 for at least 24 h and rinsed repeatedly with ultra pure water 2 3 microbial community analysis by high throughput sequencing the microorganism community structure was determined using the high throughput sequencing method 50 mg biofilm samples from bmps in the shitoukoumen reservoir and nanhu lake were collected and then stored below 20 c before being delivered to allwegene co ltd beijing china for high throughput sequencing the details are provided in supplementary documents 2 4 data analyses parameters and fitted curves for sorption isotherm and kinetic models table s2 were determined by the nonlinear least squares fitting or linear least squares method using originpro 2018 originlab northampton ma usa the means and standard deviations of three replicates were calculated analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss software package the significance of the parameters was tested using duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 following one way anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption isotherms of trace metals onto different solid materials fig 1 and table 1 show the fitting results and related parameters of the langmuir isotherm of co ii ni ii cu ii zn ii cd ii and ag i adsorption onto ss sps bmps and mps and the parameter results for freundlich isotherms are listed in table s5 the results indicated that both the isotherms were well fitted to the adsorption experimental data for all the trace metals onto different solids p 0 01 although the coefficients of determination r2 indicated that the adsorption isotherms followed the langmuir model better than the freundlich model the fit of langmuir model to the experimental data indicated that the adsorption of the trace metals may have occurred as monolayer adsorption langmuir 1918 for a certain solid material the maximum adsorption capacity qm for different trace metals varied largely and cu ii showed the largest adsorption capacity on all the solids of 2521 9 μg g 1700 9 μg g and 819 9 μg g for sps ss and bmps respectively in the shitoukoumen reservoir and 2732 6 μg g 1897 1 μg g and 1048 μg g for sps ss and bmps respectively in the nanhu lake whereas that for mps was 643 1 μg g the adsorption capacities for co ii and ag i were the lowest of the different metals furthermore as listed in table s6 qm of co ii ni ii ag i onto virgin expanded ps in the current study was higher than that of virgin pe polyethylene and beached pe pellets for cu ii qm was comparable to that of virgin pe and ps but lower than that of pp polypropylene qm of zn ii was comparable to that of pe and pvc polyvinyl chloride qm of cd ii onto virgin expanded ps showed the highest value among that of virgin pellets of pe pa polyamide pp ps and pvc and of the beached pe for all the trace metals their adsorption capacity onto different solid materials followed the same trend of sps ss bmps mps indicating that biofilms significantly enhanced the trace metal adsorption capacity of mps which is in line with the previous studies table s6 however this adsorption capacity is still lower than that of natural substrates furthermore the equilibrium parameter rl based on the langmuir isotherm may represent different isotherm types table s7 and all the values fluctuated between 0 and 1 fig s3 indicating that although the solid materials showed different adsorption capacities they were all favorable for adsorption of the trace metals hall et al 1966 3 2 adsorption kinetics of the trace metals onto different solid materials the plots of adsorption kinetics for co ii ni ii cu ii zn ii cd ii and ag i onto sps ss bmps and mps are shown in fig s4 accordingly for sps ss and bmps the majority of the adsorption capacity was attained between 4 and 8 h after 12 h the trace metal adsorption amounts generally showed no significant variation indicating the adsorption processes had achieved quasi equilibrium in contrast for mps the adsorption equilibrium was commonly reached only after 24 h the different adsorption rates displayed by these solid materials indicated that the adsorption of trace metals may occur via different adsorption mechanisms the fitting parameters of the experimental data of different solid materials using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models are listed in table s8 and s9 respectively according to r2 the pseudo first order model did not fit the experimental data well particularly for sps ss and bmps r2 ranged from 0 32 to 0 93 moreover the calculated equilibrium adsorption amounts were generally lower than those of the experimental data however the pseudo second order model fitted the experimental data better than the pseudo first order model and the gap between the calculated and experimental data was negligible with the exception of mps this indicates that chemical adsorption may be the rate limiting step including valent forces via sharing or exchanging of electrons between the adsorbent and adsorbate complexation coordination and or chelation ho and mckay 1999 zhao et al 2011 in addition qiu et al 2009 argued that this type of adsorption may follow the langmuir isotherm equation which is in line with the current study in the intraparticle diffusion model it is hypothesized that the adsorption process is preceded by a complicated process of mixed physical and chemical adsorption which was utilized to investigate the rate limiting step during adsorption the adsorption of trace metal ions from bulk solution to solid surfaces is generally controlled through the following steps first external mass transfer of ions from the bulk solution to the external surface of the solids takes place followed by internal diffusion of the ions to the adsorption sites such as film diffusion and pore transportation and finally the adsorption itself largitte and pasquier 2016 the intraparticle diffusion plots for the adsorption of trace metals onto different solid materials are shown in fig 2 and the results of the parameters are listed in table s10 the plots are divided into three or two linear segments indicating different stages of adsorption during the trace metal adsorption processes it is suggested that if the plots are linear and intersect the origin the rate limiting step is interparticle diffusion otherwise it is film diffusion wang et al 2020 according to fig 2 plots of mps show a relatively linear trend and come close to intersecting the origin implying that intraparticle diffusion played a major role during adsorption onto mps for sps ss and bmps the plots are not linear and do not intersect the origin indicating that adsorption may have been limited by film diffusion the trace metal adsorption process of mps can be divided into two stages whereas adsorption onto other particle types occurred in three stages which is in agreement with other reports wang et al 2019 the initial linear segments represent film diffusion with a rapid adsorption rate the pursuant linear segments are related to intraparticle diffusion during the transition portion and quasi equilibrium stages the values of s increased constantly during the adsorption processes indicating an enhancement of the boundary layer effect the values of kp decreased throughout adsorption suggesting the diffusion rate slowed down and chemical adsorption achieved the quasi equilibrium stage 3 3 the influence of ph the effect of ph on the amount of trace metals adsorbed onto sps ss bmps and mps is shown in fig 3 while the adsorption efficiency of trace metals onto different solids and the calculation methods are presented in fig s5 the amount of adsorption increased with the initial ph value the adsorption efficiency of trace metals showed a similar trend i e increasing with ph value and roughly followed the order of pk1 fig s5 the maximum adsorption efficiency was observed for cu ii at ph 7 0 which may be attributed to the formation of hydroxides according to its pk1 the trace metal species in solution was calculated by mineql schecher and mcavoy 2001 according to the results fig s6 the speciation of all the trace metal ions was dominated by cations in the solution at ph values of 4 0 7 0 the literature overwhelmingly suggests that sp ss and biofilm surfaces have relatively low phpzc values pouran 2018 consequently they create an overall negative charge when introduced to the ph range of natural environments ph 5 0 9 0 this results in strong electrostatic interactions between positively charged trace metal ions and negatively charged surfaces which may intensify with an increase in ph value furthermore ps possesses a low phpzc of 3 3 indicating that the trace metal adsorption mechnisms of mps may also contribute significantly to electrostatic interactions godoy et al 2019 at a low ph a large quantity of h ions prevent the mass transfer of trace metal ions towards the solid surfaces and moreover the competition effects of h may also result in a limited amount of metal adsorption tang et al 2020 3 4 the influence of ionic strength fig 4 displays a plot of the amount of each trace metal adsorbed onto sps ss bmps and mps under different ionic strengths for sps ss and bmps the adsorption amount first decreased and then remained stable when the ionic strength increased from 0 05 to 0 10 for mps the adsorption amount decreased consistently as ionic strength increased ionic strength can be used to distinguish selective and non selective adsorption the adsorption reaction can be described as surface complexation comprising inner sphere surface complexes and outer sphere surface complexes the inner sphere surface complex reaction is described as specific adsorption via a chemical binding reaction which is selective and irreversible the outer sphere surface complex is nonspecific adsorption via an electrostatic binding reaction at a certain distance from the surface which is a non selective and reversible reaction liang et al 2013 fedorov and kornyshev 2014 outer sphere surface complexes are expected to be more susceptible to ionic strength variations than inner sphere complexes as the addition of na may not only intensify the competition effects for trace metal adsorption but may also compress the thickness of the electrical double layer particularly the diffusion layer surrounding the solid surfaces li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 hence the outer sphere surface complexation may have dominated the adsorption of trace metals onto mps but only partly contributed to adsorption onto other solids 3 4 characterization and adsorption mechanisms of microplastics 3 4 1 sem eds the surfaces of bmps and mps before and after the adsorption of trace metals were characterized by sem fig 5 visual inspection showed that bmps had a high biomass and were colonized by green algae from both waters fig s7 more importantly surface damage was also observed on mps showing clear porous structures which may further intensify the adsorption of trace metals and encourage inhabitation by microorganisms microorganisms observed in sem images included rod like filamentous spherical and palisade bacteria and there was no obvious detachment after adsorption indicating a strong attachment of biofilms to the mps furthermore cubic crystals were also observed on the surface of bmps after adsorption indicating that insoluble metal compounds may generate via chemical reactions between the metals in solution and the substances produced and excreted by bacteria such as hpo4 2 s2 etc van hullebusch et al 2003 the eds spectra fig s8 indicate that c was the only dominant element on the surface of virgin mps whereas for bmps in addition to c the main elements of the geochemical components actively adsorbing trace metals including si al and fe were also observed on the surfaces indicating certain organic detritus clay materials and inorganic materials such as hydrous fe oxides and precipitate in biofilms which may strongly influence the biofilm composition and their capacity for adsorbing trace metals dong et al 2000 flemming et al 2016 furthermore the weight percentage of si al and fe in bmps in the shitoukoumen reservoir were 0 67 0 50 and 0 33 respectively which were higher than that in nanhu lake si 0 60 al 0 13 and fe 0 24 the shitoukoumen reservoir may exert an important influence on the hydrochemical regimes serving as a geochemical barrier for fe transported from the upstream majority of fe entered the reservoir is within and or associated with clay minerals which may precipitate onto the biofilms guan et al 2019 figs 6 and s9 show the sem eds elemental mapping of the trace metals and the main geochemical components on the surfaces of bmps and mps before and after adsorption in bmps p and s are essential elements for microbial growth which may reflect the abundance of microorganisms to a certain extent johansen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 on the bmps trace metals including co ni cd and ag were distributed in similar regions to the elements p s and o indicating that the biofilms facilitated the accumulation of trace metals on bmps moreover the weight percentage of p 0 78 and s 0 36 in bmps in nanhu lake was higher than that in the shitoukoumen reservoir p 0 08 s 0 04 fig s8 due to the fact that the nanhu lake is an urban eutrophic lake resulting in a relatively high biomass in bmps in this lake for mps all of the trace metals were distributed evenly after adsorption indicating that trace metals may be unselectively adsorbed 3 4 2 ft ir fig 7 shows the ft ir spectra of bmps before and after adsorption together with those of virgin mps the assignment of the prominent bands is listed in table s11 the characteristic peaks of virgin mps were in line with ft ir spectra of pure ps bhutto et al 2003 ft ir spectra of virgin mps before and after adsorption did not show significantly alteration indicating the physical adsorption may dominate the adsorption process compared with mps more peaks were observed in bmps which may correspond to the functional groups contained in biofilms and their epss flemming and wuertz 2019 eps generated from the biofilm cells comprises various ionizable functional groups such as carboxyl phosphoryl amino and hydroxyl which can further enhance the affinity for trace metals ancion et al 2013 the peaks from 900 cm 1 to 1700 cm 1 may indicate various functional groups including co in peptide bonds 1648 cm 1 nh and cn from amide ii 1540 cm 1 co 1375 cm 1 and phenyl oh 1242 cm 1 the ft ir spectra of bmps after trace metal adsorption were similar to those before adsorption however the peak of co stretching of the carboxylate anion and coc stretching was shifted from 1375 cm 1 to 1348 cm 1 in bmps from the shitoukoumen reservoir and to 1337 cm 1 in those form the nanhu lake indicating that certain interactions may occur between the carboxylate anion and trace metals guo and wang 2019 tang et al 2020 furthermore weakening of the peaks at 1242 cm 1 1540 cm 1 and 1648 cm 1 was also observed in the bmps loaded with trace metals indicating that trace metals may complex with the phenyl oh and amide groups clement et al 1998 yang et al 2015 dobrowolski et al 2017 thus according to the results of ft ir spectra and sem eds elemental mapping surface complexation may contribute significantly to the adsorption of trace metals onto bmps 3 4 3 composition of microbial communities on biofilm covered microplastics the microbial assemblages on bmps were dominated at the phylum level by proteobacteria 92 34 in the shitoukoumen reservoir and by proteobacteria 58 37 and cyanobacteria 35 43 in the nanhu lake fig 8 which are both common components of freshwater biofilms gong et al 2019 proteobacteria are frequently observed as the early colonizers of bmps in fresh water indicating the bacterial biofilm community that grew on bmps in this study was analyzed in the early stage of development jiang et al 2018 mccormick et al 2014 cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in water when overabundant they can pose a serious threat to water quality ecosystem stability and public health via producing cyanotoxins the interaction of mps and cyanobacteria is important due to the fact that cyanobacteria represent a majority of the microbial communities in the biofilms on a variety of microplastics types de oliveira et al 2020 thus consumption of bmps by aquatic organisms may lead to combined toxic effects particularly in the eutrophic lakes curren and leong 2019 biofouling of mps was also evident which is consistent with previous research performed in freshwater systems showing distinct bacterial and fungal assemblages growing on mps mccormick et al 2014 miao et al 2019 furthermore certain researchers have argued that the microbial communities in bmps are more diverse than those in the surrounding waters indicating that mps may provide a favorable living habitat for aquatic microorganisms which may further influence the adsorption behavior of mps 3 4 4 adsorption mechanisms based on the above results and discussion the adsorption mechanisms of trace metals onto bmps and mps are summarized as follows in aquatic environments virgin mps were weathered by solar radiation wave action microorganisms etc and attached by biofilms the physiochemical properties of microplastic surfaces were changed by the development of biofilms the bmps developed an increase in trace metal adsorption capacity fig 1 and table 1 via the mechanisms fig s10 including electrostatic interaction cation ion exchange complexation with the functional groups on the biofilms fig 7 and precipitation fig 5 whereas for mps physical adsorption including electrostatic interaction dominated the trace metal adsorption processes furthermore intraparticle diffusion was involved in adsorption by mps whereas adsorption by bmps was governed by film diffusion fig 2 therefore the adsorption of trace metals onto bmps was driven by a complex set of physical and chemical processes which can be influenced by multiple factors such as ph ionic strength and the type of metal fig 3 and 4 3 5 vector effects of microplastics and relative environmental implications due to the large quantity in aquatic environments mps has become an emerging anthropogenic substrate in addition to natural solids when they coexist in waters it can be a fact that a competition between natural and anthropogenic substrates may exist in adsorbing contaminants which not only exerts a significant influence on the environmental processes and fate of the contaminants but also plays an essential role in evaluation of the vector effects of mps various studies have shown that mps can be the vectors for different contaminants and the vector effects of mps may be significantly affected by biofilms due to their adhesive properties and ability to metabolize certain pollutants harrison et al 2018 johansen et al 2018 2019 richard et al 2019 the results of this study indicate that both the thermodynamic and kinetic processes of trace metal adsorption may be influenced by biofilms furthermore adsorption onto bmps may be governed by chemical adsorption sharing similar mechanisms with ss and sps which was in line with previous research fang et al 2011 hua et al 2012 however the amounts of trace metal adsorbed onto mps and bmps were still lower than those adsorbed onto ss and sps moreover unlike ss and sps biofilms are not an inert chemical structure but a highly dynamic system in which various components are synthesized assembled modified and finally detached from mps into the environment zhang 2020 consequently the immobilization of trace metal ions in the biofilms can be reversible since the biological sites will be degraded sooner or later thus both mps and bmps may act as potential sinks for the trace metals however it does not give them an edge over natural substrates in adsorption of trace metals due to the low stability of biofilms and relatively limited adsorption capacity which may enhance exchange rates of the trace metals between water and solid materials and further alter their migration and fate in freshwater in addition the physical processes contributing to the movement of mps differ between freshwater and seawater in which continuous downstream movement is the key distinction eerkes medrano et al 2015 hydrology in most lakes and reservoirs involves at least one upstream inlet and downstream outlet and the residence time of mps may be influenced by water volume and currents harrison et al 2018 flooding can redistribute materials among the upstream downstream riparian and aquatic components of lakes which may increase the accumulation of mps and their associated contaminants in lakes and reservoirs as well as their migration downstream zhang et al 2015 watkins et al 2019 therefore as an emerging anthropogenic substrate it is necessary to take account of mps and especially bmps in evaluation and modeling of the migration and fate of trace metals in lakes and reservoirs in particular 4 conclusion the development of biofilms enhanced the trace metal adsorption and stabilization capacity onto microplastics via alteration of the physical and chemical properties of the surfaces the complexation reactions between the trace metals and the biofilm components were stronger than the electrostatic affinity of virgin mps for adsorbates meanwhile the diffusion mechanism transformed from intraparticle diffusion into film diffusion both ph and ionic strength have a significant effect on the trace metal adsorption bmps exhibited similar adsorption mechanisms to those of natural substrates and were governed by chemical adsorption while mps were dominated by physical adsorption however mps and bmps exhibited adsorption capacities and stabilization that were not as strong as those of natural substrates therefore as a type of emerging anthropogenic adsorbent mps particularly bmps may further intensify the migration of trace metals in freshwater and it is necessary to take account of them in evaluation and modeling of the migration and fate of trace metals in lakes and reservoirs declaration of competing interest the authors

17715,microplastics mps are ubiquitous in freshwater environments and represent an emerging anthropogenic vector for contaminants such as trace metals in this study virgin expanded polystyrene ps particles were placed in a eutrophic urban lake and a reservoir serving as the resource of domestic water for 4 weeks to develop biofilms on the surface for comparison natural adsorbents in the form of suspended particles and surficial sediment were also sampled from these waterbodies the trace metal adsorption properties of anthropogenic virgin and biofilm covered microplastics and natural substrates were investigated and compared via batch adsorption experiments the adsorption isotherms fitted the langmuir model revealed that biofilms could enhance the trace metal adsorption capacity of mps however natural substrates still had a greater adsorption capacity biofilms also alter the adsorption kinetics of trace metals onto mps the process of adsorption onto virgin mps was dominated by intraparticle diffusion whereas film diffusion governed adsorption onto biofilm covered microplastics and natural substrates the trace metal adsorption of all the substrates was significantly dependent on ph and ionic strength the adsorption mechanisms were further analyzed by sem eds and ft ir the enhancement of adsorption was mainly attributed to complexation with functional groups contained in the biofilms including carboxyl amino and phenyl oh collectively biofilm development intensifies the role of mps in the migration and fate of trace metals in freshwater since it does not

1 introduction with increasing plastic production and usage plastic waste has become vast and ubiquitous with an estimated global weight of 6300 million metric tons at the end of 2015 geyer et al 2017 recently the fragmentation of plastic waste into microplastics mps diameter 5 mm has attracted increasing public and regulatory concern thompson et al 2004 do sul et al 2014 eerkes medrano et al 2015 until now most mp studies have focused on the marine environment however there is still a lack of research on freshwater environments which are the source and method of transport of mps to the ocean current studies have revealed that mps are ubiquitous in inland freshwater systems and may additionally accumulate within lakes and reservoirs where they may persist for decades similar to the

from 0 to 10 cm gravel animal and plant residues and other impurities were subsequently removed via a 1 9 mm pore nylon sieve 10 mesh the sps were separated from the water using a membrane filter 0 45 μm and the sp samples retained on the filters were rinsed and transferred into a minimal mineral salts mms solution table s1 the classification of ss sps and bmps followed the previously reported method of hua et al 2012 and the results are provided in fig s1 virgin expanded ps particles were obtained from a local material plant weitai water purification material co ltd gongyi china the virgin expanded ps particles with a diameter of around 2 mm were washed and placed into several homemade equipment fig s2 in the superficial oxic waters of the lake and reservoir at a depth of around 30 cm the particles were left there for a period of 4 weeks in the summer season june july in order to develop biofilms and become bmps after collection the bmps were rinsed and kept in an mms solution all samples were stored at 4 c until analysis the morphology of the solid materials was characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem xl 30 esem feg fei company at 10 0 kv energy dispersive spectroscopy eds x max oxford instruments was used to determine the elements comprising the biofilms and their distribution on the solid material surfaces fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet antaris ii was carried out to identify transformations of the functional groups before and after adsorption 2 2 batch adsorption experiments adsorption isotherm experiments of co ii ni ii cu ii zn ii cd ii and ag i onto ss sps bmps and mps were conducted in mms solution using seven different metal concentrations 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000 μg l a total of 30 mg dry weight of ss sps bmps and mps was added to 50 ml of the solutions in 100 ml polytetrafluoroethylene centrifuge tubes the tubes were shaken continuously at 25 1 c while maintaining a ph of 6 0 0 1 using 0 01 mol l hno3 and naoh and an ionic strength of 0 02 with nano3 after 48 h the solid sample was separated from the solution using a 0 22 μm millipore polyethersulfone pes membrane filter all the isotherm adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate kinetic experiments were conducted under the same conditions as the isotherm experiments using a series of polytetrafluoroethylene centrifuge tubes the initial concentration of all the trace metals was 1000 μg l samples were collected at specified time intervals 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h and passed through a 0 22 μm millipore pes membrane filter to analyze aqueous concentrations of trace metals all the adsorption kinetic experiments were performed in duplicate the effects of solution ph and ion strength on the adsorption of trace metals to different solid materials were evaluated the initial solution ph was adjusted using naoh and hcl solutions and a range of ph values from 4 0 to 7 0 was investigated nano3 was used to investigate the effects of ion strength which had a range from 0 01 to 0 10 the amount of each trace metal adsorbed per unit mass of solid material upon equilibrium was estimated with the mass balance equation table s2 the equilibrium concentrations of trace metals in the liquid phase were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer agilent 7500 usa in the analytical laboratory of the northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences which is certificated by china metrology accreditation and the total background concentrations of trace metals in ss sps bmps and mps were also measured table s3 laboratory quality assurance and quality control were established in our previous study guan et al 2018 and the recoveries were 91 9 108 4 for all the trace metals the adsorption of trace metals onto the polytetrafluoroethylene centrifuge tube was also tested table s4 all of the reagents were of analytical grade and all of the solutions were prepared with ultra pure water all of the containers for the trace metal adsorption experiment and analysis were soaked in hno3 10 for at least 24 h and rinsed repeatedly with ultra pure water 2 3 microbial community analysis by high throughput sequencing the microorganism community structure was determined using the high throughput sequencing method 50 mg biofilm samples from bmps in the shitoukoumen reservoir and nanhu lake were collected and then stored below 20 c before being delivered to allwegene co ltd beijing china for high throughput sequencing the details are provided in supplementary documents 2 4 data analyses parameters and fitted curves for sorption isotherm and kinetic models table s2 were determined by the nonlinear least squares fitting or linear least squares method using originpro 2018 originlab northampton ma usa the means and standard deviations of three replicates were calculated analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss software package the significance of the parameters was tested using duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 following one way anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption isotherms of trace metals onto different solid materials fig 1 and table 1 show the fitting results and related parameters of the langmuir isotherm of co ii ni ii cu ii zn ii cd ii and ag i adsorption onto ss sps bmps and mps and the parameter results for freundlich isotherms are listed in table s5 the results indicated that both the isotherms were well fitted to the adsorption experimental data for all the trace metals onto different solids p 0 01 although the coefficients of determination r2 indicated that the adsorption isotherms followed the langmuir model better than the freundlich model the fit of langmuir model to the experimental data indicated that the adsorption of the trace metals may have occurred as monolayer adsorption langmuir 1918 for a certain solid material the maximum adsorption capacity qm for different trace metals varied largely and cu ii showed the largest adsorption capacity on all the solids of 2521 9 μg g 1700 9 μg g and 819 9 μg g for sps ss and bmps respectively in the shitoukoumen reservoir and 2732 6 μg g 1897 1 μg g and 1048 μg g for sps ss and bmps respectively in the nanhu lake whereas that for mps was 643 1 μg g the adsorption capacities for co ii and ag i were the lowest of the different metals furthermore as listed in table s6 qm of co ii ni ii ag i onto virgin expanded ps in the current study was higher than that of virgin pe polyethylene and beached pe pellets for cu ii qm was comparable to that of virgin pe and ps but lower than that of pp polypropylene qm of zn ii was comparable to that of pe and pvc polyvinyl chloride qm of cd ii onto virgin expanded ps showed the highest value among that of virgin pellets of pe pa polyamide pp ps and pvc and of the beached pe for all the trace metals their adsorption capacity onto different solid materials followed the same trend of sps ss bmps mps indicating that biofilms significantly enhanced the trace metal adsorption capacity of mps which is in line with the previous studies table s6 however this adsorption capacity is still lower than that of natural substrates furthermore the equilibrium parameter rl based on the langmuir isotherm may represent different isotherm types table s7 and all the values fluctuated between 0 and 1 fig s3 indicating that although the solid materials showed different adsorption capacities they were all favorable for adsorption of the trace metals hall et al 1966 3 2 adsorption kinetics of the trace metals onto different solid materials the plots of adsorption kinetics for co ii ni ii cu ii zn ii cd ii and ag i onto sps ss bmps and mps are shown in fig s4 accordingly for sps ss and bmps the majority of the adsorption capacity was attained between 4 and 8 h after 12 h the trace metal adsorption amounts generally showed no significant variation indicating the adsorption processes had achieved quasi equilibrium in contrast for mps the adsorption equilibrium was commonly reached only after 24 h the different adsorption rates displayed by these solid materials indicated that the adsorption of trace metals may occur via different adsorption mechanisms the fitting parameters of the experimental data of different solid materials using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models are listed in table s8 and s9 respectively according to r2 the pseudo first order model did not fit the experimental data well particularly for sps ss and bmps r2 ranged from 0 32 to 0 93 moreover the calculated equilibrium adsorption amounts were generally lower than those of the experimental data however the pseudo second order model fitted the experimental data better than the pseudo first order model and the gap between the calculated and experimental data was negligible with the exception of mps this indicates that chemical adsorption may be the rate limiting step including valent forces via sharing or exchanging of electrons between the adsorbent and adsorbate complexation coordination and or chelation ho and mckay 1999 zhao et al 2011 in addition qiu et al 2009 argued that this type of adsorption may follow the langmuir isotherm equation which is in line with the current study in the intraparticle diffusion model it is hypothesized that the adsorption process is preceded by a complicated process of mixed physical and chemical adsorption which was utilized to investigate the rate limiting step during adsorption the adsorption of trace metal ions from bulk solution to solid surfaces is generally controlled through the following steps first external mass transfer of ions from the bulk solution to the external surface of the solids takes place followed by internal diffusion of the ions to the adsorption sites such as film diffusion and pore transportation and finally the adsorption itself largitte and pasquier 2016 the intraparticle diffusion plots for the adsorption of trace metals onto different solid materials are shown in fig 2 and the results of the parameters are listed in table s10 the plots are divided into three or two linear segments indicating different stages of adsorption during the trace metal adsorption processes it is suggested that if the plots are linear and intersect the origin the rate limiting step is interparticle diffusion otherwise it is film diffusion wang et al 2020 according to fig 2 plots of mps show a relatively linear trend and come close to intersecting the origin implying that intraparticle diffusion played a major role during adsorption onto mps for sps ss and bmps the plots are not linear and do not intersect the origin indicating that adsorption may have been limited by film diffusion the trace metal adsorption process of mps can be divided into two stages whereas adsorption onto other particle types occurred in three stages which is in agreement with other reports wang et al 2019 the initial linear segments represent film diffusion with a rapid adsorption rate the pursuant linear segments are related to intraparticle diffusion during the transition portion and quasi equilibrium stages the values of s increased constantly during the adsorption processes indicating an enhancement of the boundary layer effect the values of kp decreased throughout adsorption suggesting the diffusion rate slowed down and chemical adsorption achieved the quasi equilibrium stage 3 3 the influence of ph the effect of ph on the amount of trace metals adsorbed onto sps ss bmps and mps is shown in fig 3 while the adsorption efficiency of trace metals onto different solids and the calculation methods are presented in fig s5 the amount of adsorption increased with the initial ph value the adsorption efficiency of trace metals showed a similar trend i e increasing with ph value and roughly followed the order of pk1 fig s5 the maximum adsorption efficiency was observed for cu ii at ph 7 0 which may be attributed to the formation of hydroxides according to its pk1 the trace metal species in solution was calculated by mineql schecher and mcavoy 2001 according to the results fig s6 the speciation of all the trace metal ions was dominated by cations in the solution at ph values of 4 0 7 0 the literature overwhelmingly suggests that sp ss and biofilm surfaces have relatively low phpzc values pouran 2018 consequently they create an overall negative charge when introduced to the ph range of natural environments ph 5 0 9 0 this results in strong electrostatic interactions between positively charged trace metal ions and negatively charged surfaces which may intensify with an increase in ph value furthermore ps possesses a low phpzc of 3 3 indicating that the trace metal adsorption mechnisms of mps may also contribute significantly to electrostatic interactions godoy et al 2019 at a low ph a large quantity of h ions prevent the mass transfer of trace metal ions towards the solid surfaces and moreover the competition effects of h may also result in a limited amount of metal adsorption tang et al 2020 3 4 the influence of ionic strength fig 4 displays a plot of the amount of each trace metal adsorbed onto sps ss bmps and mps under different ionic strengths for sps ss and bmps the adsorption amount first decreased and then remained stable when the ionic strength increased from 0 05 to 0 10 for mps the adsorption amount decreased consistently as ionic strength increased ionic strength can be used to distinguish selective and non selective adsorption the adsorption reaction can be described as surface complexation comprising inner sphere surface complexes and outer sphere surface complexes the inner sphere surface complex reaction is described as specific adsorption via a chemical binding reaction which is selective and irreversible the outer sphere surface complex is nonspecific adsorption via an electrostatic binding reaction at a certain distance from the surface which is a non selective and reversible reaction liang et al 2013 fedorov and kornyshev 2014 outer sphere surface complexes are expected to be more susceptible to ionic strength variations than inner sphere complexes as the addition of na may not only intensify the competition effects for trace metal adsorption but may also compress the thickness of the electrical double layer particularly the diffusion layer surrounding the solid surfaces li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 hence the outer sphere surface complexation may have dominated the adsorption of trace metals onto mps but only partly contributed to adsorption onto other solids 3 4 characterization and adsorption mechanisms of microplastics 3 4 1 sem eds the surfaces of bmps and mps before and after the adsorption of trace metals were characterized by sem fig 5 visual inspection showed that bmps had a high biomass and were colonized by green algae from both waters fig s7 more importantly surface damage was also observed on mps showing clear porous structures which may further intensify the adsorption of trace metals and encourage inhabitation by microorganisms microorganisms observed in sem images included rod like filamentous spherical and palisade bacteria and there was no obvious detachment after adsorption indicating a strong attachment of biofilms to the mps furthermore cubic crystals were also observed on the surface of bmps after adsorption indicating that insoluble metal compounds may generate via chemical reactions between the metals in solution and the substances produced and excreted by bacteria such as hpo4 2 s2 etc van hullebusch et al 2003 the eds spectra fig s8 indicate that c was the only dominant element on the surface of virgin mps whereas for bmps in addition to c the main elements of the geochemical components actively adsorbing trace metals including si al and fe were also observed on the surfaces indicating certain organic detritus clay materials and inorganic materials such as hydrous fe oxides and precipitate in biofilms which may strongly influence the biofilm composition and their capacity for adsorbing trace metals dong et al 2000 flemming et al 2016 furthermore the weight percentage of si al and fe in bmps in the shitoukoumen reservoir were 0 67 0 50 and 0 33 respectively which were higher than that in nanhu lake si 0 60 al 0 13 and fe 0 24 the shitoukoumen reservoir may exert an important influence on the hydrochemical regimes serving as a geochemical barrier for fe transported from the upstream majority of fe entered the reservoir is within and or associated with clay minerals which may precipitate onto the biofilms guan et al 2019 figs 6 and s9 show the sem eds elemental mapping of the trace metals and the main geochemical components on the surfaces of bmps and mps before and after adsorption in bmps p and s are essential elements for microbial growth which may reflect the abundance of microorganisms to a certain extent johansen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 on the bmps trace metals including co ni cd and ag were distributed in similar regions to the elements p s and o indicating that the biofilms facilitated the accumulation of trace metals on bmps moreover the weight percentage of p 0 78 and s 0 36 in bmps in nanhu lake was higher than that in the shitoukoumen reservoir p 0 08 s 0 04 fig s8 due to the fact that the nanhu lake is an urban eutrophic lake resulting in a relatively high biomass in bmps in this lake for mps all of the trace metals were distributed evenly after adsorption indicating that trace metals may be unselectively adsorbed 3 4 2 ft ir fig 7 shows the ft ir spectra of bmps before and after adsorption together with those of virgin mps the assignment of the prominent bands is listed in table s11 the characteristic peaks of virgin mps were in line with ft ir spectra of pure ps bhutto et al 2003 ft ir spectra of virgin mps before and after adsorption did not show significantly alteration indicating the physical adsorption may dominate the adsorption process compared with mps more peaks were observed in bmps which may correspond to the functional groups contained in biofilms and their epss flemming and wuertz 2019 eps generated from the biofilm cells comprises various ionizable functional groups such as carboxyl phosphoryl amino and hydroxyl which can further enhance the affinity for trace metals ancion et al 2013 the peaks from 900 cm 1 to 1700 cm 1 may indicate various functional groups including co in peptide bonds 1648 cm 1 nh and cn from amide ii 1540 cm 1 co 1375 cm 1 and phenyl oh 1242 cm 1 the ft ir spectra of bmps after trace metal adsorption were similar to those before adsorption however the peak of co stretching of the carboxylate anion and coc stretching was shifted from 1375 cm 1 to 1348 cm 1 in bmps from the shitoukoumen reservoir and to 1337 cm 1 in those form the nanhu lake indicating that certain interactions may occur between the carboxylate anion and trace metals guo and wang 2019 tang et al 2020 furthermore weakening of the peaks at 1242 cm 1 1540 cm 1 and 1648 cm 1 was also observed in the bmps loaded with trace metals indicating that trace metals may complex with the phenyl oh and amide groups clement et al 1998 yang et al 2015 dobrowolski et al 2017 thus according to the results of ft ir spectra and sem eds elemental mapping surface complexation may contribute significantly to the adsorption of trace metals onto bmps 3 4 3 composition of microbial communities on biofilm covered microplastics the microbial assemblages on bmps were dominated at the phylum level by proteobacteria 92 34 in the shitoukoumen reservoir and by proteobacteria 58 37 and cyanobacteria 35 43 in the nanhu lake fig 8 which are both common components of freshwater biofilms gong et al 2019 proteobacteria are frequently observed as the early colonizers of bmps in fresh water indicating the bacterial biofilm community that grew on bmps in this study was analyzed in the early stage of development jiang et al 2018 mccormick et al 2014 cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in water when overabundant they can pose a serious threat to water quality ecosystem stability and public health via producing cyanotoxins the interaction of mps and cyanobacteria is important due to the fact that cyanobacteria represent a majority of the microbial communities in the biofilms on a variety of microplastics types de oliveira et al 2020 thus consumption of bmps by aquatic organisms may lead to combined toxic effects particularly in the eutrophic lakes curren and leong 2019 biofouling of mps was also evident which is consistent with previous research performed in freshwater systems showing distinct bacterial and fungal assemblages growing on mps mccormick et al 2014 miao et al 2019 furthermore certain researchers have argued that the microbial communities in bmps are more diverse than those in the surrounding waters indicating that mps may provide a favorable living habitat for aquatic microorganisms which may further influence the adsorption behavior of mps 3 4 4 adsorption mechanisms based on the above results and discussion the adsorption mechanisms of trace metals onto bmps and mps are summarized as follows in aquatic environments virgin mps were weathered by solar radiation wave action microorganisms etc and attached by biofilms the physiochemical properties of microplastic surfaces were changed by the development of biofilms the bmps developed an increase in trace metal adsorption capacity fig 1 and table 1 via the mechanisms fig s10 including electrostatic interaction cation ion exchange complexation with the functional groups on the biofilms fig 7 and precipitation fig 5 whereas for mps physical adsorption including electrostatic interaction dominated the trace metal adsorption processes furthermore intraparticle diffusion was involved in adsorption by mps whereas adsorption by bmps was governed by film diffusion fig 2 therefore the adsorption of trace metals onto bmps was driven by a complex set of physical and chemical processes which can be influenced by multiple factors such as ph ionic strength and the type of metal fig 3 and 4 3 5 vector effects of microplastics and relative environmental implications due to the large quantity in aquatic environments mps has become an emerging anthropogenic substrate in addition to natural solids when they coexist in waters it can be a fact that a competition between natural and anthropogenic substrates may exist in adsorbing contaminants which not only exerts a significant influence on the environmental processes and fate of the contaminants but also plays an essential role in evaluation of the vector effects of mps various studies have shown that mps can be the vectors for different contaminants and the vector effects of mps may be significantly affected by biofilms due to their adhesive properties and ability to metabolize certain pollutants harrison et al 2018 johansen et al 2018 2019 richard et al 2019 the results of this study indicate that both the thermodynamic and kinetic processes of trace metal adsorption may be influenced by biofilms furthermore adsorption onto bmps may be governed by chemical adsorption sharing similar mechanisms with ss and sps which was in line with previous research fang et al 2011 hua et al 2012 however the amounts of trace metal adsorbed onto mps and bmps were still lower than those adsorbed onto ss and sps moreover unlike ss and sps biofilms are not an inert chemical structure but a highly dynamic system in which various components are synthesized assembled modified and finally detached from mps into the environment zhang 2020 consequently the immobilization of trace metal ions in the biofilms can be reversible since the biological sites will be degraded sooner or later thus both mps and bmps may act as potential sinks for the trace metals however it does not give them an edge over natural substrates in adsorption of trace metals due to the low stability of biofilms and relatively limited adsorption capacity which may enhance exchange rates of the trace metals between water and solid materials and further alter their migration and fate in freshwater in addition the physical processes contributing to the movement of mps differ between freshwater and seawater in which continuous downstream movement is the key distinction eerkes medrano et al 2015 hydrology in most lakes and reservoirs involves at least one upstream inlet and downstream outlet and the residence time of mps may be influenced by water volume and currents harrison et al 2018 flooding can redistribute materials among the upstream downstream riparian and aquatic components of lakes which may increase the accumulation of mps and their associated contaminants in lakes and reservoirs as well as their migration downstream zhang et al 2015 watkins et al 2019 therefore as an emerging anthropogenic substrate it is necessary to take account of mps and especially bmps in evaluation and modeling of the migration and fate of trace metals in lakes and reservoirs in particular 4 conclusion the development of biofilms enhanced the trace metal adsorption and stabilization capacity onto microplastics via alteration of the physical and chemical properties of the surfaces the complexation reactions between the trace metals and the biofilm components were stronger than the electrostatic affinity of virgin mps for adsorbates meanwhile the diffusion mechanism transformed from intraparticle diffusion into film diffusion both ph and ionic strength have a significant effect on the trace metal adsorption bmps exhibited similar adsorption mechanisms to those of natural substrates and were governed by chemical adsorption while mps were dominated by physical adsorption however mps and bmps exhibited adsorption capacities and stabilization that were not as strong as those of natural substrates therefore as a type of emerging anthropogenic adsorbent mps particularly bmps may further intensify the migration of trace metals in freshwater and it is necessary to take account of them in evaluation and modeling of the migration and fate of trace metals in lakes and reservoirs declaration of competing interest the authors

precursors of pfaa or others pfas groups are each pfaa related compound e g pfos related compounds mean c8 16 pfsas and their precursors pfhxs related compounds mean c6 7 pfsas and their precursors short chain pfsa related compounds mean c3 5 pfsas and their precursors the main average standard deviation composition by mw were 30 3 at 300 400 27 2 at 400 500 and 19 4 at 500 600 the main compositions by functional group were 13 1 carboxylic acids 47 2 sulfonic acids and 24 2 sulfonamides the main compositions of perfluoroalkyl chain lengths were 10 1 as c4 14 2 as c5 and 26 3 as c6 the composition of long perfluoroalkyl chain lengths the definition is c8 12 perfluoroalkyl chain lengths e g pfos was 16 of all proposed pfass some pfass with defined polyfluoroalkyl chain lengths were categorized as others e g polyfluoroalkyl ether acids pfecas according to their molecular formulas in the original screening lists hopkins et al 2018 detected pfecas in river water and drinking water the composition of pfas types was 28 6 pfsas and pfcas 51 2 pfsa and pfca precursors and 21 4 others in pfas types others have the unique structures of perfluoroalkyl chain double bond cyclic ether ketone or h substituted according to the original suspect screening lists the composition of different pfas groups was 22 2 short chain pfsa related compounds 23 4 pfhxs related compounds 7 1 pfos related compounds and 10 1 pfoa related compounds boone et al 2019 reported that 6 of 25 dwtps surveyed had specific pfas profiles e g dominated by pfoa or perfluorobutanoic acid pfba we expected our results to show similar characteristics of contamination because the pfas profiles did not differ notably between samples details of pfas profiles with their peak areas are discussed in the next section for pfaa quantification the concentrations of pfaa in river water r2 5 hijya river and dakujyaku river around the firefighting training area at different sampling dates are shown in table s4 the concentration of pfos in river water was 65 196 ng l pfhxs was 88 444 ng l pfoa was 0 4 19 ng l perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa was 25 78 ng l respectively assuming a certain relationship with concentrations with the suspects of profile analysis pfos and pfhxs were more significant than the other pfass and could account for the majority of the profile in addition it was suspected that c4 6 fasas perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides which are precursors of pfsas were significant proportion of pfass since their peak areas were lager than other pfaa precursors however it is difficult to compare between substances because the sensitivity of ionization differs depending on the substances in the future a new semi quantitative method and rules should be developed to predict pfas concentrations considering structural information e g functional groups mws therefore in this study we challenged to understand and compare the profile of pfass in environmental samples by utilizing each peak area of suspects as one of the present best available information for clustering 3 2 profile analysis of pfass in firefighting foam impacted environment waters cluster analysis fig s5 divided the 116 proposed pfass into five clusters cluster 1 2 pfass 2 5 3 15 4 49 and 5 45 fig 4 a in fig 4 b the percentage of samples means influential factors in each cluster the main sample explaining more than 80 of cluster 1 was r1 which was collected from the nagata river we suspect another source than the firefighting area since perfluoroundecanoic acid pfunda and perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoda was specifically detected in this sample unlike other clusters the upstream of nagata river had previously been ammunition storage the main samples explaining cluster 2 were r5 g7 and g8 around the firefighting training area the pfass of cluster 2 had high mws 500 800 and included only potential precursors to pfsas and pfcas fig 4 c and we suspect that they were present in the used firefighting foam the main sample explaining cluster 3 was g2 also around the firefighting training area the pfass in cluster 3 had high mws of 500 700 and in contrast to cluster 2 there was no major difference between pfas types the main pfaas of cluster 3 were perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa and long chain pfaas e g perfluorodecanoic acid pfda linear perfluorononane sulfonic acid pfns branched pfns and perfluorodecane sulfonic acid pfds we suspect that much of the long chain pfass used at the firefighting training area might not reach the hijya river through the groundwater but rather be concentrated in soils around the source of contamination because long chain pfass sorbs to particles it is necessary to conduct suspect screening of pfass also on the particle phase since these results only show pfass in filtered waters in cluster 3 the precursors e g 8 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid fts and others perfluoroalkyl chain structures of 9 1db 10 1o and 10 2o according to the original screening lists db double bond 1o an ether and 2o two ethers also had long chain structures similar to the pfaas on the other hand most pfass 94 of 116 were categorized in clusters 4 and 5 and the main samples explaining those clusters were g3 g6 which were close to each other the importance of sampling point g1 downstream of g3 g6 was stronger in cluster 5 than in cluster 4 pfass in cluster 4 had higher mws 400 700 comparing with cluster 5 and precursors were present in high proportion those in cluster 5 in contrast had lower mws 200 500 compared with cluster 4 and precursors were present in moderate proportion we suspect that the precursors in cluster 4 degraded to the pfaas in cluster 5 by environmental processes because g1 lies downstream of the other sampling points as suggested previously dauchy et al 2019 previous testing also showed leaching and transport of pfass derived from afffs in unsaturated soil in a firefighting training area høisæter et al 2019 in particular ultra short chain pfsas can be released into the environment in this way björnsdotter et al 2019 the retention times rts of most compounds became longer as their mws increased fig 5 in contrast compounds with two or three water soluble functional groups e g carboxylic acids sulfonic acids amines had high mws but short rts all these compounds were potential precursors of pfsas and pfcas with perfluoroalkyl chain lengths of 4 6 in cluster 1 the pfass were perfluoroalkyl chain lengths of c10 11 pfcas pfunda and pfdoda as mentioned above in cluster 2 the pfass were c5 10 pfaa precursors in cluster 3 the pfass were c6 10 pfaas c3 8 pfaa precursors the sampling points in clusters 2 and 3 were around the source of contamination but pfass types were different and their behavior due to physical properties were expected to be different in cluster 4 pfass were c8 10 pfaas e g pfos pfns and precursors of c4 6 pfaas with two or three ionized functional groups as mentioned above in cluster 5 the pfass were c4 7 pfaas e g pfbs pfhxs and c3 5 pfaa precursors we suspect that observed environmental distribution between samples of pfsas pfcas and others could be explained by the similarity of their perfluoroalkyl structures as mentioned above we expect that c4 6 pfaa precursors in cluster 4 with two or three ionized functional groups could degrade to c4 6 pfaas in cluster 5 by environmental processes we expect that precursors were converted at the site before reaching groundwater suspected intermediate transformation products of pfaa precursors in afffs accounted for about half of the total precursor concentration in samples at another training site houtz et al 2013 degradation products from pfaa precursors may accumulate during biotransformation harding marjanovic et al 2015 our results show that the cluster analysis separated the sampling points by the pfas characteristics influenced by environmental processes in the future it will be necessary to assess pfas contamination of firefighting foam impacted soils and biota 3 3 behavior of pfass in drinking water treatment processes the results of pfsas pfcas and their precursors differed among the drinking water treatment processes by bac filtration the fasas e g linear perfluoro 1 hexanesulfonamide fhxsa linear perfluoro 1 butanesulfonamide fbsa branched fhxsa and linear perfluoro 1 pentanesulfonamide fpesa with higher peak areas than other precursors had positive removal ratios meaning removal of pfass fig 6 by sedimentation and ozonation the removal ratios of most pfsas were 20 to 0 meaning formation of pfaas schaefer et al 2018 also observed formation of pfaas from fasas in firefighting foam impacted groundwater by oxidative electrochemical treatment ozonation was not effective for pfas removal rahman et al 2014 and pfas concentrations were not affected by conventional treatment processes but remain unchanged in the downstream public water supply qu et al 2019 in contrast by bac filtration the removal ratios of pfcas e g pfoa and pfhxa were 60 to 0 because biological activated carbon treatment also can initiate degradation of precursors forming carboxylic acids as result using high resolution orbitrap ms shaw et al 2019 identified 16 biotransformed metabolites e g 6 2 fts by biodegradation rahman et al 2014 reported that granular activated carbon can remove pfass but may need frequent reactivation we found it difficult to identify the relationships among identified pfas using suspect screening because we relied on peak areas therefore semi quantification of pfass without authentic standards will be required next to determine more accurate and detailed profiles of pfass in treatment of firefighting foam impacted waters 4 conclusions we used profile analysis with suspect screening to characterize pfas contamination in waters affected by firefighting training and identified 116 proposed pfass and their characteristics e g mws functional groups and perfluoroalkyl chain lengths some high mw precursors of pfaas and long chain pfaas were specifically observed in the firefighting training area on the other hand we suspect that pfaas were formed from their precursors in groundwater by environmental influences in drinking water treatment processes pfsas can be formed from precursors such as fasas and pfcas can be formed by bac filtration as our methods covered only substance in the dissolved water phase that could be ionized by esi with lc other substances including those bound to particulates must be targeted next by electron ionization ei by gas chromatography gc the proposed pfass identified only according to their molecular formulas need higher identification confidence level which can be achieved by high resolution target ms ms furthermore because we characterized the pfass by their peak areas it will be necessary to use semi quantification to measure concentrations declaration of competing interest

suggested previously dauchy et al 2019 previous testing also showed leaching and transport of pfass derived from afffs in unsaturated soil in a firefighting training area høisæter et al 2019 in particular ultra short chain pfsas can be released into the environment in this way björnsdotter et al 2019 the retention times rts of most compounds became longer as their mws increased fig 5 in contrast compounds with two or three water soluble functional groups e g carboxylic acids sulfonic acids amines had high mws but short rts all these compounds were potential precursors of pfsas and pfcas with perfluoroalkyl chain lengths of 4 6 in cluster 1 the pfass were perfluoroalkyl chain lengths of c10 11 pfcas pfunda and pfdoda as mentioned above in cluster 2 the pfass were c5 10 pfaa precursors in cluster 3 the pfass were c6 10 pfaas c3 8 pfaa precursors the sampling points in clusters 2 and 3 were around the source of contamination but pfass types were different and their behavior due to physical properties were expected to be different in cluster 4 pfass were c8 10 pfaas e g pfos pfns and precursors of c4 6 pfaas with two or three ionized functional groups as mentioned above in cluster 5 the pfass were c4 7 pfaas e g pfbs pfhxs and c3 5 pfaa precursors we suspect that observed environmental distribution between samples of pfsas pfcas and others could be explained by the similarity of their perfluoroalkyl structures as mentioned above we expect that c4 6 pfaa precursors in cluster 4 with two or three ionized functional groups could degrade to c4 6 pfaas in cluster 5 by environmental processes we expect that precursors were converted at the site before reaching groundwater suspected intermediate transformation products of pfaa precursors in afffs accounted for about half of the total precursor concentration in samples at another training site houtz et al 2013 degradation products from pfaa precursors may accumulate during biotransformation harding marjanovic et al 2015 our results show that the cluster analysis separated the sampling points by the pfas characteristics influenced by environmental processes in the future it will be necessary to assess pfas contamination of firefighting foam impacted soils and biota 3 3 behavior of pfass in drinking water treatment processes the results of pfsas pfcas and their precursors differed among the drinking water treatment processes by bac filtration the fasas e g linear perfluoro 1 hexanesulfonamide fhxsa linear perfluoro 1 butanesulfonamide fbsa branched fhxsa and linear perfluoro 1 pentanesulfonamide fpesa with higher peak areas than other precursors had positive removal ratios meaning removal of pfass fig 6 by sedimentation and ozonation the removal ratios of most pfsas were 20 to 0 meaning formation of pfaas schaefer et al 2018 also observed formation of pfaas from fasas in firefighting foam impacted groundwater by oxidative electrochemical treatment ozonation was not effective for pfas removal rahman et al 2014 and pfas concentrations were not affected by conventional treatment processes but remain unchanged in the downstream public water supply qu et al 2019 in contrast by bac filtration the removal ratios of pfcas e g pfoa and pfhxa were 60 to 0 because biological activated carbon treatment also can initiate degradation of precursors forming carboxylic acids as result using high resolution orbitrap ms shaw et al 2019 identified 16 biotransformed metabolites e g 6 2 fts by biodegradation rahman et al 2014 reported that granular activated carbon can remove pfass but may need frequent reactivation we found it difficult to identify the relationships among identified pfas using suspect screening because we relied on peak areas therefore semi quantification of pfass without authentic standards will be required next to determine more accurate and detailed profiles of pfass in treatment of firefighting foam impacted waters 4 conclusions we used profile analysis with suspect screening to characterize pfas contamination in waters affected by firefighting training and identified 116 proposed pfass and their characteristics e g mws functional groups and perfluoroalkyl chain lengths some high mw precursors of pfaas and long chain pfaas were specifically observed in the firefighting training area on the other hand we suspect that pfaas were formed from their precursors in groundwater by environmental influences in drinking water treatment processes pfsas can be formed from precursors such as fasas and pfcas can be formed by bac filtration as our methods covered only substance in the dissolved water phase that could be ionized by esi with lc other substances including those bound to particulates must be targeted next by electron ionization ei by gas chromatography gc the proposed pfass identified only according to their molecular formulas need higher identification confidence level which can be achieved by high resolution target ms ms furthermore because we characterized the pfass by their peak areas it will be necessary to use semi quantification to measure concentrations declaration of competing interest

17717,current fecal indicators for environmental health monitoring are primarily based on fecal indicator bacteria fib which do not accurately represent viral pathogens there is a need for highly abundant human associated viral fecal indicators to represent viral pathogens in sewage contaminated water in the present study we evaluate the abundance of the emerging viral fecal indicator crassphage in 156 italian wastewater samples collected between 2014 and 2018 samples were collected using two separate viral concentration methods glycine cf and peg dextran and qpcr assays were run for crassphage cpq56 and human polyomavirus hpyv and endpoint pcr assays were run for human bocavirus hboc and hepatitis e virus hepe crassphage was detected in 96 of samples and no statistically significant difference was observed in crassphage abundance between concentration methods p 0 39 crassphage concentrations also did not correlate with location latitude or size load and capacity of the wastewater treatment plant hpyv detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 64 and 100 respectively and the concentrations of hpyv were statistically significantly influenced by the concentration method p 0 0001 crassphage was measured at significantly higher concentrations than hpyv for both concentration methods p 0 0001 the observed concentration ranges were 3 84 7 29 log10gc 100 ml for crassphage and 3 45 5 17 log10gc 100 ml for hpyv there was a strong positive correlation between crassphage and hpyv abundance for both concentration methods however the slope of the correlation depended on the concentration method crassphage presence correlated with the presence of hboc in samples concentrated with glycine cf but did not correlate with the presence of hboc concentrated with the peg dextran method or with the presence of hepe overall these results demonstrate that crassphage is an abundant viral fecal indicator in wastewater with statistically significant correlation with human viral pathogens e g hpyv and viral concentration methods influence the interpretation of fecal viral indicator detection graphical abstract image 1 keywords crassphage polyomavirus qpcr italy water quality wastewater bocavirus hepatitis e 1 introduction gastrointestinal diseases resulting from exposure to wastewater impacted water account for an estimated 842 000 deaths globally per year who 2014 and viruses are predicted to account for the majority of gastrointestinal infections from exposure to sewage contaminated water boehm et al 2015 crank et al 2019 mcbride et al 2013 current water quality monitoring criteria utilize fecal indicator bacteria fib which do not adequately represent risk from infectious pathogenic viruses for example in recreational water exposure scenarios viral outbreaks have occurred when fib were at or below acceptable levels hauri et al 2005 rose et al 1987 sinclair et al 2009 viruses enter the water environment through the release of untreated or poorly treated wastewater thus evaluation of potential viral indicators in wastewater is a necessary first step in supporting their use for environmental monitoring improved methods to monitor viral pathogens in wastewater impacted waters are vital to informing regulatory agencies and engineering efforts to protect human health the bacteriophage crassphage short for cross assembly phage was discovered in 2014 in human fecal metagenomes and was an order of magnitude more abundant than previously known gut bacteriophages dutilh et al 2014 and was subsequently suggested as a viral fecal pollution indicator stachler and bibby 2014b crassphage has a dsdna genome an isolate has recently been cultured using bacteroides intestinalis as a host shkoporov et al 2018 and a recent metagenomic survey demonstrated that crassphage is globally distributed edwards et al 2019 in a 2014 metagenomic study assessing crassphage relative abundance in sewage from the united states and europe alongside pepper mild mottle virus adenovirus human polyomavirus torque teno virus and norovirus crassphage was found to be significantly more abundant than the other viruses studied stachler and bibby 2014b we note that although novel crass like phages have recently been described guerin et al 2018 here we use crassphage to refer to prototypical crassphage i e p crassphage or crassphage sensu stricto crassphage is abundant in wastewater which facilitates the detection of low level wastewater pollution in the environment stachler et al 2017 2018b 2019 crassphage appears to be human associated however it has been detected in a limited number of seagull dog duck pig and chicken fecal samples ahmed et al 2018a malla et al 2019b stachler et al 2017 crassphage has also been successfully deployed to detect fecal pollution in environmental waters in the united states australia the united kingdom nepal japan and thailand ahmed et al 2018b farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019a malla et al 2019a stachler et al 2018b 2019 crassphage along with pepper mild mottle virus has also been proposed for application in quantitative microbial risk assessment to predict the probability of illness from swimming in wastewater polluted water with the potential to lower the detectable risk threshold by detecting wastewater concentrations that are below the detection limit of fib based recreational water quality indicators crank et al 2019 the driving factor in the ability to lower risk thresholds is the high abundance of the studied indicators in wastewater and it is expected that highly abundant alternative molecular indicators would perform similarly in the studied model despite the promise of crassphage as a viral water quality indicator large scale evaluation efforts in wastewater are necessary to support its continued development and eventual application there is a great diversity of viral pathogens that may exist in wastewater as demonstrated by previous metagenomic surveys bibby and peccia 2013 bibby et al 2011 thus targeted surveys typically select a subset of potential human pathogens with increased relevance or abundance in wastewater human polyomavirus hpyv is a double stranded dna virus of the family polyomaviridae this pathogen does not normally cause symptomatic infections in healthy individuals but can cause serious infections in immunocompromised populations hpyv occurs globally in wastewater and has been widely proposed as a viral fecal pollution indicator albinana gimenez et al 2006 bofill mas et al 2000 2013 cantalupo et al 2011 iaconelli et al 2015 human bocavirus hboc is a single stranded dna virus of the family parvoviridae hboc is an emerging infectious disease first identified in 2005 that can cause both enteric and respiratory infections having been isolated from both stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis as well as respiratory tract samples of patients with respiratory infections allander et al 2005 iaconelli et al 2016 the role of hboc as a pathogen is still not fully understood as it co occurs in stool samples with other known viral pathogens ong et al 2016 hboc is also globally distributed bibby et al 2019 iaconelli et al 2016 hepatitis e virus hepe is a rna virus of the family hepeviridae this fecal oral pathogen causes acute liver infections in symptomatic cases with an estimated 3 3 million symptomatic cases of hepe reported in 2005 who 2019 hepe is also globally distributed la rosa et al 2011 the ideal viral indicator of human pathogenic viruses has three characteristics specificity to human wastewater high abundance in human wastewater and known geographic variability additional considerations also include ease of detection speed and cost effectiveness in this study we address crassphage abundance in wastewater and geographic variability greater understanding of crassphage quantitative occurrence and abundance across geographic regions was recently highlighted as a research needs to inform crassphage application for fecal source monitoring bivins et al 2020b specifically we survey 156 previously collected italian wastewater samples to demonstrate the presence and abundance of crassphage in italian wastewater and compare it to the occurrence of three human viral pathogens hboc hepe and hpyv these viruses were chosen so as to include a human pathogen that has also been suggested as an indicator hpyv an enteric pathogen hboc and an rna viral pathogen hepe this study informs the prevalence of crassphage in italian wastewater the influence of wastewater treatment plant wwtp location and size on crassphage concentration and the co occurrence of crassphage with representative human pathogens in italian wastewater ultimately this data allows the evaluation of the relationship between crassphage and human viral pathogens as well as the abundance of crassphage across italy which furthers the application of crassphage as a viral fecal pollution indicator 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection grab samples of wastewater influent were collected as a part of a large sampling effort from 25 wwtps across italy in 2014 n 43 2015 n 34 and 2016 n 49 composite samples representing a 24hr period of time were collected in 2017 n 26 and 2018 n 4 as previously described iaconelli et al 2016 sampling locations are shown in fig 1 sample details are available in table s1 2 2 sample concentration and dna extraction samples collected between 2014 and 2016 were concentrated and extracted as previously described la rosa et al 2014 which we refer to as the glycine cf method briefly a 20 ml aliquot of wastewater was treated with 2 ml of 2 5m glycine at ph 9 5 and incubated on ice for 30 min the solution was then treated with 2 2 ml chloroform and centrifuged at 2300 g for 10 min the viral nucleic acids were extracted from 10 ml of chloroform treated samples using the nuclisens minimag semi automated extraction system with magnetic silica according to the manufacturer s instructions biomerieux marcy l etoile france 2017 2018 samples were concentrated using a two phase separation as detailed in the 2003 who guidelines for environmental surveillance of poliovirus protocol and will be referred to as the peg dextran method who 2003 in brief the wastewater sample 250 ml was centrifuged to pellet the wastewater solids the pellet was stored at 4 c to be combined with the concentrated supernatant the clarified wastewater was mixed with dextran t40 and polyethylene glycol peg 6000 and the mixture was left to stand overnight at 4 c in a separation funnel the bottom layer and the interphase were then collected drop wise the pellet from the initial centrifugation was suspended in this concentrate which was then treated with 1 20 v v chloroform 10 ml of clear supernatant was recovered and 5 ml was subjected to extraction eluates 100 μl each were divided into small aliquots and subsequently frozen at 70 c until analyzed the samples were tested using endpoint pcr for the presence absence of hboc and hepe and were quantitatively tested for crassphage and hpyv using qpcr for the peg dextran concentration method samples underwent spiking with a known quantity of murine norovirus mnv 1 used as a control process in order to monitor the efficiency of the entire procedure recovery efficiency calculated on selected samples showed an average mnv recovery of 1 5 recovery efficiency was not calculated for the glycine cf method 2 3 endpoint pcr pcr assay information is shown in table 1 hboc presence absence was determined with nested pcr pcr was performed using 2 μl of dna and 22 pmol of each primer in a 25 μl reaction cycling profile included an initial denaturing at 94 c 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 94 c 30 s annealing at 50 c 30 s 72 c 1 min a final extension at 72 c 5 min and a hold at 4 c two microliters of the pcr product were used as a template in the nested pcr assay under the same cycling conditions hepe presence absence was determined with a nested rt pcr assay targeting the methyltransferase mtase gene in orf1 the universal primers amplify a 172 bp region of all hepe genotypes fogeda et al 2009 pcr amplification was performed using a mytaq one step rt pcr kit bioline in a t100 thermal cycler bio rad pcr reactions were prepared in a 25 μl mixture containing 12 5 μl

of 95 c 10 s 51 c 10 s and 72 c 30 s and a final step at 72 c 5 min after the first round of pcr amplification one μl of pcr product underwent nested amplification 35 cycles performed using mytaq red mix kit bioline cycling profile included an initial denaturing at 95 c 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 c 15 s 48 c 15 s 72 c 10 s and a final elongation step at 72 c 5 min 2 4 qpcr standard curves primers and probes for human polyomavirus hpyv and crassphage cpq56 are shown in table 1 synthetic dna strands were synthesized as gblocks gene fragments integrated dna technologies coralville ia the fragments were suspended in 1 te buffer affymetrix cleveland oh and diluted to concentrations of 10 102 103 104 105 gc 2 μl using a nanodrop nd 1000 uv spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de three independent calibration standard runs were performed to generate an average calibration standard curve for each of the assays lower limit of quantification lloq 95 ci with 10 gc 2 μl values were calculated using rstudio version 1 1 442 by assuming the corresponding quantification cycle cq at 10 gc 2 μl was normally distributed the lloq for the cpq56 assay corresponded to 3 86 log10gc 100 ml and 2 77 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively the lloq for the hpyv assay corresponded to 3 86 log10gc 100 ml and 2 76 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively qpcr performance standards are shown in table 2 2 5 qpcr assays one quarter of the volume of extracted dna from all samples was lyophilized for sample shipment samples were rehydrated in 50 μl te buffer and stored at 20 c before analysis each 25 μl qpcr reaction contained 1 taqman environmental master mix thermo fisher scientific 0 2 mg ml bovine serum

samples below the lloq were re run with 6 μl of extracted dna and molecular water was reduced accordingly to maintain a 25 μl reaction volume and the resulting data was normalized accordingly all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate on a cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca with the rfu relative florescent units manually set to 100 for both assays cao et al 2015 the thermocycling conditions for all reactions were as follows initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s with a final annealing and elongation step for 1 min at 60 c for each run six no template controls ntcs were included a detect was defined as amplification of one or more of the three replicates concentrations were calculated from the standard curve in microsoft excel redmond ca as described previously stachler et al 2018b three samples were excluded from the hpyv assay due to laboratory handling issues 2 6 statistical analysis qpcr concentrations were calculated from raw data using microsoft excel the results were then exported to graphpad prism for descriptive statistics graphpad software la jolla ca the results were not normally distributed so a non parametric approach was taken by using the mann whitney u test with graphpad prism linear regressions and spearman s rank analyses were performed between the qpcr concentrations and latitude capacity of the wwtp and load these analyses were also performed using graphpad prism the level of significance was alpha 0 05 3 results 3 1 abundance of crassphage and hpyv in wastewater in this study 156 previously collected dna samples from untreated wastewater were analyzed for crassphage cpq56 and human polyomavirus hpyv molecular markers two separate viral concentration methods namely the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were used during the sample collection period samples collected between 2014 and 2016 were concentrated with the glycine cf method n 126 and samples collected between 2017 and 2018 were concentrated with the peg dextran method n 30 sample concentration data for positive crassphage and hpyv detections is shown in fig 2 crassphage detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran concentration methods were 95 n 120 126 and 100 n 30 30 respectively with a combined detection rate of 96 hpyv detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 64 n 79 123 and 100 n 30 30 respectively positive detection concentration ranges were 3 84 7 29 log10gc 100 ml for crassphage and 3 45 5 17 log10gc 100 ml for hpyv the mean concentrations of crassphage were 5 62 0 74 log10gc 100 ml and 5 72 0 71 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively no statistically significant difference was observed in crassphage concentration between concentration methods p 0 38 fig 2a the mean concentrations of hpyv were 4 13 0 38 log10gc 100 ml and 4 89 0 72 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively the concentrations of hpyv between the glycine cf and the peg dextran methods were significantly different p 0 0001 fig 2b crassphage concentrations were significantly higher than hpyv for both concentration methods p 0 0001 glycine cf p 0 0001 peg dextran 3 2 wwtp location capacity load and abundance of viral markers the relationship between the wwtp location as measured by latitude and virus concentration was examined using spearman s rank analysis to investigate a potential relationship between wwtp location and the abundance of crassphage and hpyv fig 3 latitude was selected as a surrogate of wwtp location as latitude has been previously suggested to be a driven of human gut microbiome diversity dikongué and ségurel 2017 no statistically significant correlations were observed between either crassphage or hpyv concentration and the latitude of the wwtp in addition we investigated correlations between crassphage or hpyv concentration and the size of the wwtp the capacity of the wwtp in liters served as a surrogate measure of maximum population that can be served and load in liters served as a surrogate measure of the population being served at time of sampling neither measure demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the concentration of crassphage or hpyv all p values generated by the mann whitney non parametric statistical test are shown in fig 3 3 3 crassphage correlation with molecular viral markers we further evaluated the correlation between crassphage and the concentration of hpyv using spearman s rank analysis and a linear regression since concentration method was found to affect hpyv concentrations the comparison was separated by concentration method fig 4 shows the results of a linear regression with spearman s rank and significance levels there was a strong positive correlation between crassphage and hpyv abundance for both concentration methods fig 4 however the slope for the correlation with the glycine cf concentration method was 0 43 whereas the slope for the correlation with the peg dextran concentration method was 0 89 this demonstrates the importance of sample concentration method in the interpretation of the correlation between crassphage and hpyv we also evaluated the relationship between crassphage concentration and presence absence of hboc and hepe as measured by endpoint pcr we note that endpoint pcr assays were not carried out on all samples samples without endpoint pcr measurements were excluded from this analysis comparisons were separated by concentration method as the influence of concentration method on hboc and hepe detection is unknown fig 5 a shows the concentrations of crassphage for hboc positive and hboc negative samples hboc detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 72 8 n 83 114 and 72 4 n 21 29 respectively with a combined detection rate of 72 7 for samples that were concentrated using the glycine cf method there was a statistically significant increase p 0 0016 in crassphage concentrations in hboc positive samples than in hboc negative samples this was not observed in samples concentrated with the peg dextran method which showed no statistically significant difference p 0 65 in crassphage concentrations between hboc positive and negative samples fig 5b shows the concentrations of crassphage for hepe positive and hepe negative samples concentrated with the glycine cf method we note that this comparison was not possible for samples concentrated using the peg dextran method as there was a single hepe positive sample in that dataset hepe detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 7 5 n 9 120 and 3 3 n 1 30 respectively with a combined detection rate of 6 7 crassphage concentration was not statistically significantly different between hepe positive and negative samples for samples concentrated using the glycine cf method p 0 32 4 discussion 4 1 crassphage presence and abundance prospective viral human fecal source tracking organisms must be highly abundant in wastewater to facilitate their detection once released and diluted in the environment in the present study we assess crassphage abundance in 156 italian wastewater samples as well as crassphage correlation with other molecular viral markers crassphage was present in 150 out of 156 samples with a 96 overall detection rate this is notable as prior studies have shown a 100 crassphage detection rate in untreated wastewater ahmed et al 2018a 2018b garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 the current study has significantly expanded the number of described crassphage concentration samples in untreated wastewater summarized in fig 6 farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019a wu et al 2020 garcía aljaro et al 2017 malla et al 2019a crassphage concentrations in crassphage positive samples in the current study ranged between 3 84 and 7 29 log10gc 100 ml a wider range than previous studies a recent study in the united states examining fecal source tracking marker removal efficiencies of a wwtp found 100 of untreated wastewater samples n 11 were positive for crassphage at an average of 7 23 0 36 log10gc 100 ml wu et al 2020 using the same crassphage assay ahmed et al found that 100 of tested united states wastewater samples n 8 were positive for crassphage with a range of 6 08 6 98 log10 gc 100 ml ahmed et al 2018a similarly 100 of australian tested raw wastewater samples n 12 were positive for crassphage using the same assay with an average of 6 43 0 14 log10gc 100 ml ahmed et al 2018b in spain primers targeting a different crassphage genomic region were utilized on 23 samples of wastewater and all were positive for crassphage at a range of 5 4 6 9 log10gc 100 ml garcía aljaro et al 2017 in thailand 100 of wastewater samples n 23 were positive for crassphage with concentrations ranging from 5 28 to 7 38 log10gc 100 ml crassphage concentrations reported here are similar to previously reported concentrations of alternative human fecal indicators adenovirus and f specific coliphage in untreated wastewater pouillot et al performed a meta analysis of f specific coliphage concentrations in untreated wastewater across 62 wwtps and found the average concentration to be 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml 95 ci 5 1 6 4 log10 pfu 100 ml pouillot et al 2015 in 2019 verani et al found adenovirus concentrations in wastewater at an average of 7 78 1 19 log10 gc 100 ml with 100 of samples testing positive verani et al 2019 ultimately when compared to culturable bacteriophages crassphage as a molecular indicator has the strong advantage of being more rapid human specific and more strongly associated with human pathogens bivins et al 2020 in this study we demonstrate a lower detection rate and a wider range of crassphage concentration in italian wastewater than has been shown previously this may be due to multiple factors first the scope of this study vastly exceeds other similar studies using direct pcr measurement of viral markers and pathogens in wastewater the expanded scope encompassing five years of sampling efforts may have captured natural variability in the crassphage concentration that was not observed in other studies second we have previously identified variability in concentration due to the quantification method stachler et al 2019 a multi laboratory effort would be useful to exclude potential variability due to laboratory handling or quantification approach this variability may also extend to the application of emerging viral quantification approaches and additional efforts are necessary to establish concordance between concentration methods farkas et al 2020 hamza and bibby 2019 third differing studies use variable concentration approaches which may influence observed crassphage concentrations fourth this study uses historical samples while every effort was made for sample preservation the possibility that some negative detections were due to sample processing cannot be excluded it should be noted that negative detections may also include samples containing crassphage but with concentrations below the study detection limit finally recent studies have highlighted the diversity of crass like phages in human gut metagenomes it is possible that natural variability in crass like phages was not captured by the cpq56 assay used here which is targeted at the prototypical crassphage ultimately while further data would be beneficial to confirm these observations this study at a minimum suggests caution when assuming the ubiquitous presence of crassphage in wastewater 4 2 geographic and population variation fecal pollution indicators may vary geographically and based on the population size served as lifestyles and diets affect the makeup of the gut microbiome kau et al 2011 examining the geographic and population distribution of prospective viral indicator crassphage can facilitate its implementation across geographically diverse areas geographic variability was measured by latitude and population size was represented by wwtp capacity and load none of these parameters had a statistically significant effect on crassphage abundance most wwtps represented in this study are in populous urban areas and so results presented here are representative of a large mixture of diets and potential fecal pathogens in wastewater we note that local verification is necessary for application in new geographic areas especially less populous areas future research should aim to assess crassphage and human viral pathogen concentrations in wastewater from communities with non westernized diets or lifestyles 4 3 crassphage correlation with viral markers viral human fecal indicators must correlate with viral pathogens in wastewater to adequately represent the viral risk posed by human fecal pollution in this study crassphage concentration was compared with hpyv concentration and hboc and hepe presence hpyv abundance correlated with crassphage abundance for both concentration methods p 0 0001 crassphage was also measured at significantly higher concentrations than hpyv p 0 0001 suggesting that measuring crassphage in a dilute environment e g water contaminated by wastewater as an indicator is more favorable than directly measuring hpyv this is consistent with a report of crassphage concentration correlating with hpyv through a wwtp wu et al 2020 conversely a study examining a wastewater impacted stream found poor crassphage and hpyv correlation suggesting that further work may be necessary to examine the comparative fates of crassphage and hpyv in the environment stachler et al 2018b crassphage concentrations were significantly higher in samples concentrated with the glycine cf method where hboc was detected suggesting that crassphage abundance correlates with hboc presence crassphage concentration did not correlate with hepe presence thus crassphage correlates with the dna viruses evaluated in this study hpyv and hboc but not the rna virus evaluated hepe we note that our ability to make conclusions about the suitability of crassphage as an indicator for hepe was limited by the low number of samples in which hepe was tested positive n 9 further work is necessary to evaluate the suitability of crassphage as an indicator for hepe and other rna viruses additionally future work should study other commonly established human fecal indicators alongside crassphage to assess which indicators perform strongest for individual pathogens and pathogen groupings 4 4 importance of concentration method the results of this study highlight the importance of concentration method when quantifying viruses in wastewater similar to recent reports on norovirus and adenovirus maunula et al 2019 crassphage concentrations did not vary significantly by concentration method however hpyv did show a significant difference in abundance between concentration methods p 0 0001 the differing behavior of viral targets by concentration method implies that viral fecal indicator suitability is dependent on the viral concentration method used assessing the efficiency of specific concentration methods is outside the scope of this study however more research is needed to determine which concentration methods best fits each scenario perhaps more importantly the specific concentration method should be considered when evaluating viral indicator suitability as performance metrics may vary based upon the specific concentration method used the two methods used in this study were the glycine cf and peg dextran methods the glycine cf method has the advantage of being faster and requires a low amount of wastewater 20 ml which is good for limited samples however the peg dextran method while more laborious and time consuming is the standard concentration method recommended by who for viral sewage monitoring there are tradeoffs when determining a viral concentration method researchers must consider downstream applications quantity of available wastewater sample target available laboratory resources and the time it takes to concentrate for previous viral molecular experimentation the ideal concentration method has been determined as they are needed rather than referring to a collective resource of concentration methods bivins et al 2020 however two recent reviews have examined viral concentration methods hjelmsø et al examine viral concentration methods in the context of metagenomic sequencing as a downstream application and haramoto et al focus more broadly on the concentration of viruses from a water matrix haramoto et al 2018 hjelmsø et al 2017 both provide useful scenario specific recommendations and can inform future research in addition to these studies the current study suggests using caution when combining quantitative viral abundance data that has been collected using different concentration methods and that the most appropriate approach may be to separate data based upon the concentration method used 5 conclusions the high abundance of crassphage as well as its co occurrence with pathogenic dna viruses hpyv and hboc suggests crassphage has the strong potential to serve as viral indicator of human fecal pollution while crassphage has been shown to be globally distributed by metagenomic analysis of fecal samples a full global survey of molecular concentration data is needed to aid in application of this bacteriophage as a fecal indicator here we contribute to the growing literature of crassphage and pathogen quantitative detection by showing that crassphage is abundant in italian wastewater and that its presence correlates with the presence of two viral human pathogens crassphage is highly abundant in italian wastewater crassphage abundance correlates with dna viral pathogens hpyv and hboc in wastewater concentration methods have a significant effect on the concentrations of viruses and future studies should take care to standardize concentration methods crassphage concentration did not correlate with latitude load or capacity of the wwtp suggesting that crassphage concentration did not vary geographically or by population size funding information this work was supported by national science foundation grant 1748019 to k b declaration of competing

17717,current fecal indicators for environmental health monitoring are primarily based on fecal indicator bacteria fib which do not accurately represent viral pathogens there is a need for highly abundant human associated viral fecal indicators to represent viral pathogens in sewage contaminated water in the present study we evaluate the abundance of the emerging viral fecal indicator crassphage in 156 italian wastewater samples collected between 2014 and 2018 samples were collected using two separate viral concentration methods glycine cf and peg dextran and qpcr assays were run for crassphage cpq56 and human polyomavirus hpyv and endpoint pcr assays were run for human bocavirus hboc and hepatitis e virus hepe crassphage was detected in 96 of samples and no statistically significant difference was observed in crassphage abundance between concentration methods p 0 39 crassphage concentrations also did not correlate with location latitude or size load and capacity of the wastewater treatment plant hpyv detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 64 and 100 respectively and the concentrations of hpyv were statistically significantly influenced by the concentration method p 0 0001 crassphage was measured at significantly higher concentrations than hpyv for both concentration methods p 0 0001 the observed concentration ranges were 3 84 7 29 log10gc 100 ml for crassphage and 3 45 5 17 log10gc 100 ml for hpyv there was a strong positive correlation between crassphage and hpyv abundance for both concentration methods however the slope of the correlation depended on the concentration method crassphage presence correlated with the presence of hboc in samples concentrated with glycine cf but did not correlate with the presence of hboc concentrated with the peg dextran method or with the presence of hepe overall these results demonstrate that crassphage is an abundant viral fecal indicator in wastewater with statistically significant correlation with human viral pathogens e g hpyv and viral concentration methods influence the interpretation of fecal viral indicator detection graphical abstract image 1 keywords crassphage polyomavirus qpcr italy water quality wastewater bocavirus hepatitis e 1 introduction gastrointestinal diseases resulting from exposure to wastewater impacted water account for an estimated 842 000 deaths globally per year who 2014 and viruses are predicted to account for the majority of gastrointestinal infections from exposure to sewage contaminated water boehm et al 2015 crank et al 2019 mcbride et al 2013 current water quality monitoring criteria utilize fecal indicator bacteria fib which do not adequately represent risk from infectious pathogenic viruses for example in recreational water exposure scenarios viral outbreaks have occurred when fib were at or below acceptable levels hauri et al 2005 rose et al 1987 sinclair et al 2009 viruses enter the water environment through the release of untreated or poorly treated wastewater thus evaluation of potential viral indicators in wastewater is a necessary first step in supporting their use for environmental monitoring improved methods to monitor viral pathogens in wastewater impacted waters are vital to informing regulatory agencies and engineering efforts to protect human health the bacteriophage crassphage short for cross assembly phage was discovered in 2014 in human fecal metagenomes and was an order of magnitude more abundant than previously known gut bacteriophages dutilh et al 2014 and was subsequently suggested as a viral fecal pollution indicator stachler and bibby 2014b crassphage has a dsdna genome an isolate has recently been cultured using bacteroides intestinalis as a host shkoporov et al 2018 and a recent metagenomic survey demonstrated that crassphage is globally distributed edwards et al 2019 in a 2014 metagenomic study assessing crassphage relative abundance in sewage from the united states and europe alongside pepper mild mottle virus adenovirus human polyomavirus torque teno virus and norovirus crassphage was found to be significantly more abundant than the other viruses studied stachler and bibby 2014b we note that although novel crass like phages have recently been described guerin et al 2018 here we use crassphage to refer to prototypical crassphage i e p crassphage or crassphage sensu stricto crassphage is abundant in wastewater which facilitates the detection of low level wastewater pollution in the environment stachler et al 2017 2018b 2019 crassphage appears to be human associated however it has been detected in a limited number of seagull dog duck pig and chicken fecal samples ahmed et al 2018a malla et al 2019b stachler et al 2017 crassphage has also been successfully deployed to detect fecal pollution in environmental waters in the united states australia the united kingdom nepal japan and thailand ahmed et al 2018b farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019a malla et al 2019a stachler et al 2018b 2019 crassphage along with pepper mild mottle virus has also been proposed for application in quantitative microbial risk assessment to predict the probability of illness from swimming in wastewater polluted water with the potential to lower the detectable risk threshold by detecting wastewater concentrations that are below the detection limit of fib based recreational water quality indicators crank et al 2019 the driving factor in the ability to lower risk thresholds is the high abundance of the studied indicators in wastewater and it is expected that highly abundant alternative molecular indicators would perform similarly in the studied model despite the promise of crassphage as a viral water quality indicator large scale evaluation efforts in wastewater are necessary to support its continued development and eventual application there is a great diversity of viral pathogens that may exist in wastewater as demonstrated by previous metagenomic surveys bibby and peccia 2013 bibby et al 2011 thus targeted surveys typically select a subset of potential human pathogens with increased relevance or abundance in wastewater human polyomavirus hpyv is a double stranded dna virus of the family polyomaviridae this pathogen does not normally cause symptomatic infections in healthy individuals but can cause serious infections in immunocompromised populations hpyv occurs globally in wastewater and has been widely proposed as a viral fecal pollution indicator albinana gimenez et al 2006 bofill mas et al 2000 2013 cantalupo et al 2011 iaconelli et al 2015 human bocavirus hboc is a single stranded dna virus of the family parvoviridae hboc is an emerging infectious disease first identified in 2005 that can cause both enteric and respiratory infections having been isolated from both stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis as well as respiratory tract samples of patients with respiratory infections allander et al 2005 iaconelli et al 2016 the role of hboc as a pathogen is still not fully understood as it co occurs in stool samples with other known viral pathogens ong et al 2016 hboc is also globally distributed bibby et al 2019 iaconelli et al 2016 hepatitis e virus hepe is a rna virus of the family hepeviridae this fecal oral pathogen causes acute liver infections in symptomatic cases with an estimated 3 3 million symptomatic cases of hepe reported in 2005 who 2019 hepe is also globally distributed la rosa et al 2011 the ideal viral indicator of human pathogenic viruses has three characteristics specificity to human wastewater high abundance in human wastewater and known geographic variability additional considerations also include ease of detection speed and cost effectiveness in this study we address crassphage abundance in wastewater and geographic variability greater understanding of crassphage quantitative occurrence and abundance across geographic regions was recently highlighted as a research needs to inform crassphage application for fecal source monitoring bivins et al 2020b specifically we survey 156 previously collected italian wastewater samples to demonstrate the presence and abundance of crassphage in italian wastewater and compare it to the occurrence of three human viral pathogens hboc hepe and hpyv these viruses were chosen so as to include a human pathogen that has also been suggested as an indicator hpyv an enteric pathogen hboc and an rna viral pathogen hepe this study informs the prevalence of crassphage in italian wastewater the influence of wastewater treatment plant wwtp location and size on crassphage concentration and the co occurrence of crassphage with representative human pathogens in italian wastewater ultimately this data allows the evaluation of the relationship between crassphage and human viral pathogens as well as the abundance of crassphage across italy which furthers the application of crassphage as a viral fecal pollution indicator 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection grab samples of wastewater influent were collected as a part of a large sampling effort from 25 wwtps across italy in 2014 n 43 2015 n 34 and 2016 n 49 composite samples representing a 24hr period of time were collected in 2017 n 26 and 2018 n 4 as previously described iaconelli et al 2016 sampling locations are shown in fig 1 sample details are available in table s1 2 2 sample concentration and dna extraction samples collected between 2014 and 2016 were concentrated and extracted as previously described la rosa et al 2014 which we refer to as the glycine cf method briefly a 20 ml aliquot of wastewater was treated with 2 ml of 2 5m glycine at ph 9 5 and incubated on ice for 30 min the solution was then treated with 2 2 ml chloroform and centrifuged at 2300 g for 10 min the viral nucleic acids were extracted from 10 ml of chloroform treated samples using the nuclisens minimag semi automated extraction system with magnetic silica according to the manufacturer s instructions biomerieux marcy l etoile france 2017 2018 samples were concentrated using a two phase separation as detailed in the 2003 who guidelines for environmental surveillance of poliovirus protocol and will be referred to as the peg dextran method who 2003 in brief the wastewater sample 250 ml was centrifuged to pellet the wastewater solids the pellet was stored at 4 c to be combined with the concentrated supernatant the clarified wastewater was mixed with dextran t40 and polyethylene glycol peg 6000 and the mixture was left to stand overnight at 4 c in a separation funnel the bottom layer and the interphase were then collected drop wise the pellet from the initial centrifugation was suspended in this concentrate which was then treated with 1 20 v v chloroform 10 ml of clear supernatant was recovered and 5 ml was subjected to extraction eluates 100 μl each were divided into small aliquots and subsequently frozen at 70 c until analyzed the samples were tested using endpoint pcr for the presence absence of hboc and hepe and were quantitatively tested for crassphage and hpyv using qpcr for the peg dextran concentration method samples underwent spiking with a known quantity of murine norovirus mnv 1 used as a control process in order to monitor the efficiency of the entire procedure recovery efficiency calculated on selected samples showed an average mnv recovery of 1 5 recovery efficiency was not calculated for the glycine cf method 2 3 endpoint pcr pcr assay information is shown in table 1 hboc presence absence was determined with nested pcr pcr was performed using 2 μl of dna and 22 pmol of each primer in a 25 μl reaction cycling profile included an initial denaturing at 94 c 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 94 c 30 s annealing at 50 c 30 s 72 c 1 min a final extension at 72 c 5 min and a hold at 4 c two microliters of the pcr product were used as a template in the nested pcr assay under the same cycling conditions hepe presence absence was determined with a nested rt pcr assay targeting the methyltransferase mtase gene in orf1 the universal primers amplify a 172 bp region of all hepe genotypes fogeda et al 2009 pcr amplification was performed using a mytaq one step rt pcr kit bioline in a t100 thermal cycler bio rad pcr reactions were prepared in a 25 μl mixture containing 12 5 μl

of 95 c 10 s 51 c 10 s and 72 c 30 s and a final step at 72 c 5 min after the first round of pcr amplification one μl of pcr product underwent nested amplification 35 cycles performed using mytaq red mix kit bioline cycling profile included an initial denaturing at 95 c 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 c 15 s 48 c 15 s 72 c 10 s and a final elongation step at 72 c 5 min 2 4 qpcr standard curves primers and probes for human polyomavirus hpyv and crassphage cpq56 are shown in table 1 synthetic dna strands were synthesized as gblocks gene fragments integrated dna technologies coralville ia the fragments were suspended in 1 te buffer affymetrix cleveland oh and diluted to concentrations of 10 102 103 104 105 gc 2 μl using a nanodrop nd 1000 uv spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de three independent calibration standard runs were performed to generate an average calibration standard curve for each of the assays lower limit of quantification lloq 95 ci with 10 gc 2 μl values were calculated using rstudio version 1 1 442 by assuming the corresponding quantification cycle cq at 10 gc 2 μl was normally distributed the lloq for the cpq56 assay corresponded to 3 86 log10gc 100 ml and 2 77 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively the lloq for the hpyv assay corresponded to 3 86 log10gc 100 ml and 2 76 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively qpcr performance standards are shown in table 2 2 5 qpcr assays one quarter of the volume of extracted dna from all samples was lyophilized for sample shipment samples were rehydrated in 50 μl te buffer and stored at 20 c before analysis each 25 μl qpcr reaction contained 1 taqman environmental master mix thermo fisher scientific 0 2 mg ml bovine serum

samples below the lloq were re run with 6 μl of extracted dna and molecular water was reduced accordingly to maintain a 25 μl reaction volume and the resulting data was normalized accordingly all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate on a cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca with the rfu relative florescent units manually set to 100 for both assays cao et al 2015 the thermocycling conditions for all reactions were as follows initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s with a final annealing and elongation step for 1 min at 60 c for each run six no template controls ntcs were included a detect was defined as amplification of one or more of the three replicates concentrations were calculated from the standard curve in microsoft excel redmond ca as described previously stachler et al 2018b three samples were excluded from the hpyv assay due to laboratory handling issues 2 6 statistical analysis qpcr concentrations were calculated from raw data using microsoft excel the results were then exported to graphpad prism for descriptive statistics graphpad software la jolla ca the results were not normally distributed so a non parametric approach was taken by using the mann whitney u test with graphpad prism linear regressions and spearman s rank analyses were performed between the qpcr concentrations and latitude capacity of the wwtp and load these analyses were also performed using graphpad prism the level of significance was alpha 0 05 3 results 3 1 abundance of crassphage and hpyv in wastewater in this study 156 previously collected dna samples from untreated wastewater were analyzed for crassphage cpq56 and human polyomavirus hpyv molecular markers two separate viral concentration methods namely the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were used during the sample collection period samples collected between 2014 and 2016 were concentrated with the glycine cf method n 126 and samples collected between 2017 and 2018 were concentrated with the peg dextran method n 30 sample concentration data for positive crassphage and hpyv detections is shown in fig 2 crassphage detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran concentration methods were 95 n 120 126 and 100 n 30 30 respectively with a combined detection rate of 96 hpyv detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 64 n 79 123 and 100 n 30 30 respectively positive detection concentration ranges were 3 84 7 29 log10gc 100 ml for crassphage and 3 45 5 17 log10gc 100 ml for hpyv the mean concentrations of crassphage were 5 62 0 74 log10gc 100 ml and 5 72 0 71 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively no statistically significant difference was observed in crassphage concentration between concentration methods p 0 38 fig 2a the mean concentrations of hpyv were 4 13 0 38 log10gc 100 ml and 4 89 0 72 log10gc 100 ml for the glycine cf and peg dextran methods respectively the concentrations of hpyv between the glycine cf and the peg dextran methods were significantly different p 0 0001 fig 2b crassphage concentrations were significantly higher than hpyv for both concentration methods p 0 0001 glycine cf p 0 0001 peg dextran 3 2 wwtp location capacity load and abundance of viral markers the relationship between the wwtp location as measured by latitude and virus concentration was examined using spearman s rank analysis to investigate a potential relationship between wwtp location and the abundance of crassphage and hpyv fig 3 latitude was selected as a surrogate of wwtp location as latitude has been previously suggested to be a driven of human gut microbiome diversity dikongué and ségurel 2017 no statistically significant correlations were observed between either crassphage or hpyv concentration and the latitude of the wwtp in addition we investigated correlations between crassphage or hpyv concentration and the size of the wwtp the capacity of the wwtp in liters served as a surrogate measure of maximum population that can be served and load in liters served as a surrogate measure of the population being served at time of sampling neither measure demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the concentration of crassphage or hpyv all p values generated by the mann whitney non parametric statistical test are shown in fig 3 3 3 crassphage correlation with molecular viral markers we further evaluated the correlation between crassphage and the concentration of hpyv using spearman s rank analysis and a linear regression since concentration method was found to affect hpyv concentrations the comparison was separated by concentration method fig 4 shows the results of a linear regression with spearman s rank and significance levels there was a strong positive correlation between crassphage and hpyv abundance for both concentration methods fig 4 however the slope for the correlation with the glycine cf concentration method was 0 43 whereas the slope for the correlation with the peg dextran concentration method was 0 89 this demonstrates the importance of sample concentration method in the interpretation of the correlation between crassphage and hpyv we also evaluated the relationship between crassphage concentration and presence absence of hboc and hepe as measured by endpoint pcr we note that endpoint pcr assays were not carried out on all samples samples without endpoint pcr measurements were excluded from this analysis comparisons were separated by concentration method as the influence of concentration method on hboc and hepe detection is unknown fig 5 a shows the concentrations of crassphage for hboc positive and hboc negative samples hboc detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 72 8 n 83 114 and 72 4 n 21 29 respectively with a combined detection rate of 72 7 for samples that were concentrated using the glycine cf method there was a statistically significant increase p 0 0016 in crassphage concentrations in hboc positive samples than in hboc negative samples this was not observed in samples concentrated with the peg dextran method which showed no statistically significant difference p 0 65 in crassphage concentrations between hboc positive and negative samples fig 5b shows the concentrations of crassphage for hepe positive and hepe negative samples concentrated with the glycine cf method we note that this comparison was not possible for samples concentrated using the peg dextran method as there was a single hepe positive sample in that dataset hepe detection rates with the glycine cf and peg dextran methods were 7 5 n 9 120 and 3 3 n 1 30 respectively with a combined detection rate of 6 7 crassphage concentration was not statistically significantly different between hepe positive and negative samples for samples concentrated using the glycine cf method p 0 32 4 discussion 4 1 crassphage presence and abundance prospective viral human fecal source tracking organisms must be highly abundant in wastewater to facilitate their detection once released and diluted in the environment in the present study we assess crassphage abundance in 156 italian wastewater samples as well as crassphage correlation with other molecular viral markers crassphage was present in 150 out of 156 samples with a 96 overall detection rate this is notable as prior studies have shown a 100 crassphage detection rate in untreated wastewater ahmed et al 2018a 2018b garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 the current study has significantly expanded the number of described crassphage concentration samples in untreated wastewater summarized in fig 6 farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019a wu et al 2020 garcía aljaro et al 2017 malla et al 2019a crassphage concentrations in crassphage positive samples in the current study ranged between 3 84 and 7 29 log10gc 100 ml a wider range than previous studies a recent study in the united states examining fecal source tracking marker removal efficiencies of a wwtp found 100 of untreated wastewater samples n 11 were positive for crassphage at an average of 7 23 0 36 log10gc 100 ml wu et al 2020 using the same crassphage assay ahmed et al found that 100 of tested united states wastewater samples n 8 were positive for crassphage with a range of 6 08 6 98 log10 gc 100 ml ahmed et al 2018a similarly 100 of australian tested raw wastewater samples n 12 were positive for crassphage using the same assay with an average of 6 43 0 14 log10gc 100 ml ahmed et al 2018b in spain primers targeting a different crassphage genomic region were utilized on 23 samples of wastewater and all were positive for crassphage at a range of 5 4 6 9 log10gc 100 ml garcía aljaro et al 2017 in thailand 100 of wastewater samples n 23 were positive for crassphage with concentrations ranging from 5 28 to 7 38 log10gc 100 ml crassphage concentrations reported here are similar to previously reported concentrations of alternative human fecal indicators adenovirus and f specific coliphage in untreated wastewater pouillot et al performed a meta analysis of f specific coliphage concentrations in untreated wastewater across 62 wwtps and found the average concentration to be 5 2 log10 pfu 100 ml 95 ci 5 1 6 4 log10 pfu 100 ml pouillot et al 2015 in 2019 verani et al found adenovirus concentrations in wastewater at an average of 7 78 1 19 log10 gc 100 ml with 100 of samples testing positive verani et al 2019 ultimately when compared to culturable bacteriophages crassphage as a molecular indicator has the strong advantage of being more rapid human specific and more strongly associated with human pathogens bivins et al 2020 in this study we demonstrate a lower detection rate and a wider range of crassphage concentration in italian wastewater than has been shown previously this may be due to multiple factors first the scope of this study vastly exceeds other similar studies using direct pcr measurement of viral markers and pathogens in wastewater the expanded scope encompassing five years of sampling efforts may have captured natural variability in the crassphage concentration that was not observed in other studies second we have previously identified variability in concentration due to the quantification method stachler et al 2019 a multi laboratory effort would be useful to exclude potential variability due to laboratory handling or quantification approach this variability may also extend to the application of emerging viral quantification approaches and additional efforts are necessary to establish concordance between concentration methods farkas et al 2020 hamza and bibby 2019 third differing studies use variable concentration approaches which may influence observed crassphage concentrations fourth this study uses historical samples while every effort was made for sample preservation the possibility that some negative detections were due to sample processing cannot be excluded it should be noted that negative detections may also include samples containing crassphage but with concentrations below the study detection limit finally recent studies have highlighted the diversity of crass like phages in human gut metagenomes it is possible that natural variability in crass like phages was not captured by the cpq56 assay used here which is targeted at the prototypical crassphage ultimately while further data would be beneficial to confirm these observations this study at a minimum suggests caution when assuming the ubiquitous presence of crassphage in wastewater 4 2 geographic and population variation fecal pollution indicators may vary geographically and based on the population size served as lifestyles and diets affect the makeup of the gut microbiome kau et al 2011 examining the geographic and population distribution of prospective viral indicator crassphage can facilitate its implementation across geographically diverse areas geographic variability was measured by latitude and population size was represented by wwtp capacity and load none of these parameters had a statistically significant effect on crassphage abundance most wwtps represented in this study are in populous urban areas and so results presented here are representative of a large mixture of diets and potential fecal pathogens in wastewater we note that local verification is necessary for application in new geographic areas especially less populous areas future research should aim to assess crassphage and human viral pathogen concentrations in wastewater from communities with non westernized diets or lifestyles 4 3 crassphage correlation with viral markers viral human fecal indicators must correlate with viral pathogens in wastewater to adequately represent the viral risk posed by human fecal pollution in this study crassphage concentration was compared with hpyv concentration and hboc and hepe presence hpyv abundance correlated with crassphage abundance for both concentration methods p 0 0001 crassphage was also measured at significantly higher concentrations than hpyv p 0 0001 suggesting that measuring crassphage in a dilute environment e g water contaminated by wastewater as an indicator is more favorable than directly measuring hpyv this is consistent with a report of crassphage concentration correlating with hpyv through a wwtp wu et al 2020 conversely a study examining a wastewater impacted stream found poor crassphage and hpyv correlation suggesting that further work may be necessary to examine the comparative fates of crassphage and hpyv in the environment stachler et al 2018b crassphage concentrations were significantly higher in samples concentrated with the glycine cf method where hboc was detected suggesting that crassphage abundance correlates with hboc presence crassphage concentration did not correlate with hepe presence thus crassphage correlates with the dna viruses evaluated in this study hpyv and hboc but not the rna virus evaluated hepe we note that our ability to make conclusions about the suitability of crassphage as an indicator for hepe was limited by the low number of samples in which hepe was tested positive n 9 further work is necessary to evaluate the suitability of crassphage as an indicator for hepe and other rna viruses additionally future work should study other commonly established human fecal indicators alongside crassphage to assess which indicators perform strongest for individual pathogens and pathogen groupings 4 4 importance of concentration method the results of this study highlight the importance of concentration method when quantifying viruses in wastewater similar to recent reports on norovirus and adenovirus maunula et al 2019 crassphage concentrations did not vary significantly by concentration method however hpyv did show a significant difference in abundance between concentration methods p 0 0001 the differing behavior of viral targets by concentration method implies that viral fecal indicator suitability is dependent on the viral concentration method used assessing the efficiency of specific concentration methods is outside the scope of this study however more research is needed to determine which concentration methods best fits each scenario perhaps more importantly the specific concentration method should be considered when evaluating viral indicator suitability as performance metrics may vary based upon the specific concentration method used the two methods used in this study were the glycine cf and peg dextran methods the glycine cf method has the advantage of being faster and requires a low amount of wastewater 20 ml which is good for limited samples however the peg dextran method while more laborious and time consuming is the standard concentration method recommended by who for viral sewage monitoring there are tradeoffs when determining a viral concentration method researchers must consider downstream applications quantity of available wastewater sample target available laboratory resources and the time it takes to concentrate for previous viral molecular experimentation the ideal concentration method has been determined as they are needed rather than referring to a collective resource of concentration methods bivins et al 2020 however two recent reviews have examined viral concentration methods hjelmsø et al examine viral concentration methods in the context of metagenomic sequencing as a downstream application and haramoto et al focus more broadly on the concentration of viruses from a water matrix haramoto et al 2018 hjelmsø et al 2017 both provide useful scenario specific recommendations and can inform future research in addition to these studies the current study suggests using caution when combining quantitative viral abundance data that has been collected using different concentration methods and that the most appropriate approach may be to separate data based upon the concentration method used 5 conclusions the high abundance of crassphage as well as its co occurrence with pathogenic dna viruses hpyv and hboc suggests crassphage has the strong potential to serve as viral indicator of human fecal pollution while crassphage has been shown to be globally distributed by metagenomic analysis of fecal samples a full global survey of molecular concentration data is needed to aid in application of this bacteriophage as a fecal indicator here we contribute to the growing literature of crassphage and pathogen quantitative detection by showing that crassphage is abundant in italian wastewater and that its presence correlates with the presence of two viral human pathogens crassphage is highly abundant in italian wastewater crassphage abundance correlates with dna viral pathogens hpyv and hboc in wastewater concentration methods have a significant effect on the concentrations of viruses and future studies should take care to standardize concentration methods crassphage concentration did not correlate with latitude load or capacity of the wwtp suggesting that crassphage concentration did not vary geographically or by population size funding information this work was supported by national science foundation grant 1748019 to k b declaration of competing

17718,understanding the complex microbiota of agricultural irrigation water is vital to multiple sectors of sustainable agriculture and public health to date microbiome characterization methods have provided comprehensive profiles of aquatic microbiotas but have not described which taxa are likely metabolically active here we combined 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine brdu labeling with 16s rrna and shotgun sequencing to identify metabolically active bacteria in reclaimed and agricultural pond water samples n 28 recovered from the mid atlantic united states between march 2017 and january 2018 brdu treated samples were significantly less diverse alpha diversity compared to non brdu treated samples the most abundant taxa in the metabolically active fraction of water samples brdu treated samples were unclassified actinobacteria flavobacterium spp pseudomonas spp and aeromonas spp interestingly we also observed that antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene profiles seemed to be more diverse and more abundant in non brdu treated water samples compared to brdu treated samples these findings raise the possibility that these genes may be associated more with relic inactive dna present in the tested water types rather than viable metabolically active microorganisms our study demonstrates that the coupled use of brdu labeling and sequencing can enhance understanding of the metabolically active fraction of bacterial communities in alternative irrigation water sources agricultural pond and reclaimed waters are vital to the future of sustainable agriculture and thus the full understanding of the pathogenic potential of these waters is important to guide mitigation strategies that ensure appropriate water quality for intended purposes graphical abstract image graphical

irrigation water sources such as reclaimed water advanced treated wastewater and agricultural ponds are integral to the future of sustainable agriculture these sources will likely be called upon more frequently to complement reserves from aquifers in multiple regions of the world ortega reig et al 2014 parsons et al 2010 sapkota 2019 wade miller 2006 alternative irrigation waters however have often been exposed to significant anthropogenic and wildlife pressures the full understanding of which will be important to a wide range of food safety and public health concerns agricultural ponds are one of the most reliable and economical sources of water for agricultural irrigation downing 2010 previous studies describing agricultural pond microbiota have identified proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and cyanobacteria alfiansah et al 2018 chopyk et al 2018 qin et al 2016 fecal indicator bacteria total coliforms generic escherichia coli and enterococci e coli o157 h7 salmonella spp and shiga toxin producing e coli stec genes have also been reported in agricultural ponds and in produce irrigated with pond water antaki et al 2016 decol et al 2017 topalcengiz et al 2017 a salmonella newport outbreak that caused more than 500 illnesses across 26 states was attributed to consumption of tomatoes irrigated with pond water from the eastern shore of virginia greene et al 2008 another recent study describes the diverse and dynamic bacterial and viral populations in an agricultural freshwater pond in the mid atlantic region chopyk et al 2018 this pond was dominated by actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes as well as temperate bacteriophages including those of the siphoviridae and myoviridae families with regard to advanced treated wastewater methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and vancomycin resistant enterococci have been detected in both the influent and effluent of u s tertiary wastewater treatment plants mid atlantic and midwest by goldstein et al 2012 and 2014 goldstein et al 2012 rosenberg goldstein et al 2014 additionally balkhair 2016 detected e coli pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella spp vibrio spp and listeria spp in soil and radishes irrigated with reclaimed water in saudi arabia balkhair 2016 recently genes conferring resistance to commonly used antibiotics aminoglycosides sulfonamides rifamycins macrolides cephalosporins fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were also observed in water samples from a reclamation facility and a wastewater impacted creek located in the mid atlantic region by chopyk et al 2020 together these studies provide evidence that bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes may persist in reclaimed water and could potentially be transferred to the produce irrigated with these water sources in the mid 1970s outbreaks associated with food irrigated with raw sewage or primary treated wastewater were described by bryan 1977 similarly katzenelson et al 1976 reported that the incidence of shigellosis salmonellosis typhoid fever and infectious hepatitis was four fold higher in kibbutzim israel using wastewater irrigation practices katzenelson et al 1976 to date however there have been no documented illnesses resulting from the use of reclaimed water tertiary treated in irrigation activities in the united states us epa us fda currently to ensure that the microbiological quality of reclaimed water is suitable for irrigation applications culture based methods focused on the detection of generic e coli as an indicator of water quality are commonly used additionally molecular assays are used to identify specific targets and broad metagenomic surveys powered by next generation sequencing techniques are commonly used to characterize microbial communities in complex environmental matrices schuster 2008 while these methods have provided insights into agricultural water ecosystems mandal et al 2015 most approaches cannot differentiate between live and dead bacteria li et al 2017 as demand for reclaimed water and other alternatives to groundwater continues to grow it will be important to improve our understanding of the pathogenic potential of water used to manage food crops steele and odumeru 2004 to provide data to address this knowledge gap we combined bromodeoxyuridine brdu dna labeling with targeted and target independent next generation sequencing aiming to characterize the metabolically active fraction of bacteria in multiple alternative irrigation water sources reclaimed water and ponds brdu is a synthetic thymidine analog that incorporates into replicating dna the brdu within the dna can subsequently be detected using antibody immunocapture and characterized functionally and taxonomically by annotating next generation sequencing data this approach distinguishes between live metabolically active and dead relic bacterial communities galand 2013 urbach et al 1999 by annotating our shotgun sequencing data we also provided an important characterization of antimicrobial resistance amr gene and virulence gene profiles by brdu treatment and by water type the data presented here demonstrate that the coupled use of brdu labeling and sequencing provides an enhanced understanding of the metabolically active fraction of bacterial communities in alternative irrigation water sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites two water sources in the mid atlantic united states were included in the study an agricultural pond and a tertiary wastewater treatment plant and reclamation facility the agricultural pond is a temperate freshwater pond with a maximum depth of approximately 3 35 m and a surface area of approximately 0 26 ha permission to obtain pond water samples was granted by the farm manager the tertiary wastewater treatment plant is located in a rural area and treats between 1 135 62 and 1 419 53 m3 of domestic wastewater per day with a maximum daily capacity of 1 892 70 m3 raw influent consists of residential municipal wastewater and light industry wastewater the primary treatments involve the use of screens grinders and grit chambers activated sludge reactors aeration tanks and sedimentation tanks secondary clarifiers are the secondary treatments used the secondary clarified wastewater is then piped to an open air lagoon and chlorinated before land application via spray irrigation to achieve further nutrient removal and ultimate groundwater recharge permission to collect reclaimed water for the purposes of this study was granted by the town administrator 2 2 sample collection from march 2017 to january 2018 two liters of water from each source were collected during bi weekly sampling trips a total of 13 reclaimed water samples and 15 pond water samples reclaimed water samples could not be obtained during the winter months of november december and january were used for further analyses in addition a prodss digital sampling system ysi yellow springs oh usa was used to measure in triplicate water temperature c conductivity spc us cm ph dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential mv turbidity fnu nitrate mg l and chloride mg l 2 3 sample processing 200μl of 100 mm brdu was added to 1 l of water while the other liter was not treated with brdu the brdu treated samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and then incubated for 2 days in the dark at room temperature this allowed brdu to incorporate into replicating dna of the brdu treated samples enabling us to detect the metabolically active fractions of the bacterial communities within our water samples the non brdu labeled samples were also incubated for 2 days such that all samples were treated the same except for the addition of the brdu previous studies have utilized brdu incubation times ranging from 1 hour to 30 days edlund et al 2008 edlund and jansson 2006 galand 2013 goldfarb et al 2011 pernthaler et al 2002 pernthaler and pernthaler 2005 urbach et al 1999 based on these studies we tested a 24 hour incubation and a 48 hour incubation with multiple environmental sample types including tobacco soil and water data not shown these experiments demonstrated that we achieved better pcr amplification across all sample types with the 48 hour incubation period and therefore we chose a two day brdu incubation period for this study no additional nutrients or carbon sources were added to the samples since we wanted to maintain the original water conditions as much as possible both the brdu treated and non treated samples were then filtered on the same day through 0 2 µm 47 mm filters pall corporation port washington ny usa using sterile filter funnels thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the filters were then dissected into four quadrants placed in lysing matrix b tubes mp biomedicals solon oh usa and stored at 80 c until dna extraction 2 4 dna extraction dna extractions were performed using protocols previously published by our group chopyk et al 2017a 2017b briefly 1 ml of pbs was added to the filters in the lysing matrix b tubes before incubation in enzymatic cocktails containing lysozyme mutanolysin proteinase k and lysostaphin after which the cells were mechanically lysed using an mp biomedical fastprep 24 santa ana ca the dna was then purified using the qiagen qiamp dna mini kit germantown ma per the manufacturer s protocol 2 5 immunocapture of brdu treated samples immunocapture and isolation of brdu labeled dna were performed using a previously published protocol urbach et al 1999 briefly a 1 9 ratio of sheared and denatured herring sperm dna hs dna and monoclonal anti brdu α brdu antibody was mixed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature to form the hs dna α brdu antibody complex the extracted dna from the water samples was then denatured by heating for 5 min at 100 c and transferred to ice the mixture of hs dna α brdu antibody complex was then added to the denatured dna from the water samples and incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature with agitation to form the dna hs dna α brdu antibody complex meanwhile magnetic beads dynabeads dynal inc invitrogen by thermofisher scientific coated with goat anti mouse immunoglobulin g were washed three times with 1 mg ml acetylated bovine serum albumin bsa in phosphate buffered saline pbs buffer using a magnetic particle concentrator the washed dynabeads were then added to the dna hs dna α brdu antibody complex and incubated for an additional 1 h in the dark at room temperature after incubation the samples were washed in 0 5 ml pbs bsa and the brdu containing dna fraction was eluted by adding 1 7 mm brdu in pbs bsa and incubating for 1 h in the dark at room temperature 2 6 16s rrna pcr amplification and sequencing extracted dna was pcr amplified for the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene using the universal primers 319f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat and sequenced on an illumina hiseq2500 illumina san diego ca using a method developed at the institute for genome sciences holm et al 2019 and described previously chopyk et al 2017a 2017b briefly pcr reactions were carried out using phusion high fidelity dna polymerase thermo fisher waltham ma usa and 2 ng of template dna in a total reaction volume of 25 μl an additional 0 375 μl of bovine serum albumin bsa 20 mg ml was added to the pcr reactions to avoid potential pcr inhibition negative controls without dna template were included for both primer sets the following pcr conditions were employed 30 s at 98 c followed by 10 s at 98 c 15 s at 66 c and 15 s at 72 c with a final step of 10 min at 72 c amplicon presence was confirmed using gel electrophoresis after which the sequelprep normalization kit invitrogen inc carlsbad ca usa was used for cleanup and normalization 25 ng of 16s pcr amplicons from each sample were included prior to pooling and sequencing using illumina illumina san diego ca hiseq2500 2 300 bp pe reads holm et al 2019 2 7 shotgun library preparation and sequencing dna libraries for shotgun sequencing were prepared using the nextera xt kit illumina san diego ca usa per the

for chimeras using uchime in de novo mode implemented in quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime release v 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 quality trimmed sequences were then clustered de novo into operational taxonomic units otus and taxonomic assignments were performed using vsearch rognes et al 2016 with a minimum confidence threshold of 0 97 the silva 16s database quast et al 2012 in qiime caporaso et al 2010 was used for taxonomy assignments downstream data analysis and visualization was completed in rstudio v 1 1 423 using r packages biomformat mcmurdie and paulson joseph n 2017 vegan oksanen et al 2017 ggplot2 wickham 2009 phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 bioconductor huber et al 2015 and metagenomeseq joseph nathaniel paulson 2017 visualization of bacterial otus was performed using genus level classifications and when genus level assignments could not be made by the rdp classifier uncl unclassified was added to the deepest taxonomic assignment available i e from phylum to family when appropriate data were normalized with metagenomeseq s cumulative sum scaling css joseph nathaniel paulson 2017 to account for uneven sampling depth prior to normalization alpha diversity was measured using both the observed richness metric and the shannon diversity index shannon 1948 bray curtis dissimilarity was used for calculating beta diversity and was compared using analysis of similarities anosim on normalized data 999 permutations pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to identify associations between the water characteristics and the relative abundance of the bacterial phyla and visualized via heatmaps created in r via vegan heatplus ploner 2012 2 8 2 metagenomic data analysis unassembled metagenomic sequencing reads were annotated using the genius bioinformatics software package cosmosid inc rockville md as described previously in detail connelly et al 2018 2017 hasan et al 2014 hourigan et al 2018 janes et al 2017 jumat et al 2017 junqueira et al 2017 kaleko et al 2016 lax et al 2014 leddy et al 2017 ottesen et al 2016 ponnusamy et al 2016 roy et al 2018 which provided microbial community composition as well as predicted antibiotic resistance and virulence genes the system utilizes a highly curated cosmosid database genbook and a high performance data mining k mer algorithm to annotate sequence reads the genbook databases are composed of over 150 000 microbial genomes and gene sequences representing over 1 000 bacterial 5 000 viral 250 protists and 1 500 fungal species as well as over 5 500antibiotic resistance and virulence associated genes the genbook database constitutes both publicly available data from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi as well as a subset of genomes sequenced by cosmosid and its collaborators the cosmosid pipeline employs two k mer based algorithms 5vce and nmerce hasan et al 2014 for the putative identification of microorganisms at the species or strain level the pipeline consists of a pre computation phase for the reference database and a per sample computation the input to the pre computation phase is a reference microbial genome or antibiotic resistance or virulence gene database and its output is phylogenic trees with sets of variable length k mer fingerprints biomarkers that are uniquely identified with distinct nodes branches and leaves of the tree the second per sample computational phase searches the millions of sequence reads against the fingerprint sets the second comparator uses edit distance scoring techniques to compare a target genome or gene with a reference set the algorithm provides similar functionality to blast but sacrifices some recall precision for a one or two order of magnitude processing gain the resulting statistics are analyzed to give fine grain composition and relative abundance estimates at all nodes of the tree the relative abundance describes the contribution of a given taxon to the total microbial community detected relative abundance is expressed in and calculated as follows relative abundance abundance score taxon n sum of abundance score all taxa this metric is suitable for downstream comparative analysis enhanced detection specificity is achieved by running the comparators in sequence the first comparator finds reads in which there is an exact match with a k mer uniquely identified with a reference genome or antibiotic resistance or virulence gene the second comparator then statistically scores the entire read against the reference to verify that the read is indeed uniquely identified to that reference overall classification precision is achieved through aggregation statistics to visualize the relative abundance of bacterial phyla amr and virulence genes stacked bar charts were generated using tableau version 9 1 additionally bacterial taxa were normalized and visualized using several r packages vegan oksanen et al 2017 dplyr wickham et al 2018 circlize gu et al 2014 reshape2 wickham 2017 and stringr wickham 2019 and reads with a relative abundance greater than 5 in at least one sample were used to build the microbial profile as well as shared and unique data based on the water type and treatments brdu or no brdu also when species or genus level assignments could not be assigned uncl unclassified was added to the deepest taxonomic assignment available i e from phylum to family 2 9 availability of data data concerning the samples included in this study are deposited in the ncbi bioproject database under bioproject accession

gene sequence data from brdu treated pond water included hgcl clade actinobacteria flavobacterium candidatus planktophila pseudarcicella and uncl planctomycetaceae while non brdu treated samples were dominated byhgcl clade actinobacteria flavobacterium candidatus planktophila pseudarcicella pseudomonas cl500 29 marine group actinobacteria polynucleobacter and limnohabitans fig 1c the hgcl clade actinobacteria pseudarcicella and candidatus planktophila were present in all months irrespective of the treatments similarly flavobacterium was present in all time points but at a higher relative abundance from march june and october january uncl planctomycetaceae was observed in brdu treated pond water from june september supplementary figure 2a the predominant bacterial taxa observed in the metabolically active fraction brdu of the reclaimed water were the hgcl clade actinobacteria flavobacterium aeromonas pseudarcicella pseudomonas rheinhheimera and chryseobacterium while in the non

from october to january the ph of both water types was neutral to slightly basic across all sampling points all other water characteristics showed slight variations between sampling months table 1 several bacterial phyla irrespective of water sample type were significantly correlated p 0 05 with certain water metrics fig 2 in pond water for example an increased relative abundance of verrucomicrobia was positively correlated with chloride planctomycetes were positively correlated with ambient temperature turbidity and water temperature conversely the relative abundance of proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen and bacteroidetes was negatively correlated with ambient temperature turbidity and water temperature in reclaimed water the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and od1 were positively correlated with ph while chloroflexi was positively correlated with both conductivity and salinity negative correlations with nitrate and ph were observed for planctomycetes and actinobacteria respectively while verrucomicrobia was negatively correlated with both dissolved oxygen and ph additionally the relative abundance of bacteroidetes in reclaimed water samples was negatively correlated with conductivity and salinity 3 5 shotgun taxonomic analysis by site and brdu treatment in metagenomic data predominant

sphingopyxis s salmoneum polynucleobacter p alcaligenes p mandeii methylomonas methylocystis limnohabitans flavobacterium f sasangense uncl chitinophagia bacteroides bacteroides vulgatus bacillus bacillus infantis aeromonas and a media fig 3a a greater diversity of taxa was observed in the non brdu treated water compared to brdu treated water irrespective of water type 3b and 3c in pond water fig 3b uncl actinobacteria were observed in both treatments throughout the sampling period and were most prevalent in brdu treated water from march through july and then from october through december however we were unable to discern the specific types of actinobacteria present across these time periods though uncl alphaproteobacteria was observed throughout the sampling time points it was highly abundant in the non brdu treated samples additionally flavobacterium was observed at a high relative abundance in the brdu treated fraction from august to december contrary to pond water in reclaimed water fig 3c uncl actinobacteria was typically observed at a higher relative abundance in profiles of non brdu treated samples while flavobacterium was present from august through november at a higher relative abundance in brdu treated water samples a media was well represented in the metabolically active fraction brdu treated from april through june and a hydrophilia was predominant in may and june additionally we observed the highest relative abundance of pseudomonas in march and p fluorescens in august and september in the metabolically active profiles brdu treated samples 3 6 shared and unique bacterial taxa by site and brdu treatment detected using shotgun metagenomics bacterial taxa unique to pond water samples were methylomonas and limnohabitans while bacterial taxa unique to

mandelii s salmoneum uncl alphaproteobacteria uncl opituaceae uncl betaproteobacteria and uncl actinobacteria were present in both water sample types fig 4 a unique taxa associated with brdu treated pond water samples includeduncl chitinophagia pseudomonas p fluorescens flavobacterium anduncl cyanobacteria fig 4b while brdu treated reclaimed water samples were comprised of rhizobium sphingopyxis pseudomonas p fluorescens flavobacterium arcobacter aeromonas a media and a hydrophila fig 4c 3 7 antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes the relative abundance of amr genes was much higher in reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples and in non brdu treated samples compared to brdu treated samples for both water types fig 5 a and b additionally we observed that amr genes could be detected throughout the year in reclaimed water samples except in august and september but were primarily detected only from august through october in pond water samples greater diversity of resistance elements was also observed in profiles of reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples the efflux pump gene msre beta lactam resistance gene blaoxa quinolone resistance gene qnrs2 macrolide resistance gene mphe macrolide resistance gene emrf aminoglycoside resistance gene aada6 sulphonamide resistance gene sul2 and mpha gene that inactivates 14 membered macrolides were the most prominent amr genes detected in brdu treated reclaimed water samples while only the aminoglycoside resistance gene aph3 was detected in brdu treated pond water samples as with the prevalence of amr elements a higher relative abundance of virulence genes was detected in reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples fig 6 a and b virulence genes predicted to be present within klebsiella pneumoniae dominated brdu treated reclaimed water while those predicted to be present within e coli dominated in brdu treated pond water other virulence genes observed in brdu treated reclaimed water were predicted to be associated with enterobacter aerogenes proteus mirabilis pseudomonas aerogenes vibrio cholerae salmonella typhimurium and salmonella infantis in contrast virulence genes predicted to be associated with proteus mirabilis pseudomonas aerogenes and pseudomonas putida were observed in brdu treated pond water bacteroides fragilis was observed in both non brdu treated water types 4 discussion while pond and reclaimed water sources are necessary alternatives to traditional ground water sources of irrigation water our data suggest that additional water treatment may be needed to ensure that bacterial water quality is appropriate for the intended use our study showed that the bacterial communities of both reclaimed water samples and untreated pond water samples are diverse and may include bacterial species of importance to human health coupling brdu labeling with 16srrna and shotgun sequencing provided a novel understanding of the metabolically active fraction of bacterial communities present in these important irrigation water types while diverse antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were detected in both reclaimed water and pond water these genes were more frequently identified in non brdu treated samples compared to brdu treated samples these findings raise the possibility that these genes may be associated more with relic inactive dna present in the water samples rather than viable metabolically active organisms the presence of uncl actinobacteria flavobacterium a media a hydophila p fluorescens s putrefaciens and arcobacter species or genera containing specific strains that have been associated with human and or animal diseases was observed in brdu treated water samples representing the metabolically active fraction of the detected bacterial communities figs 3 and 4 uncl actinobacteria in particular which dominated in brdu treated pond water throughout the sampling period as shown by our 16s rrna sequence data were identified as the hgcl clade of the phylum actinobacteria this finding is consistent with other work that has described specific bacterial taxa among freshwater microbiota hosen et al 2017 llirós et al 2014 the 16s rrna gene data also described the presence of currently non culturable members hahn 2009 of the phylum actinobacteria candidatus aquiluna canditatus rhodoluna candidatus planktoluna and candidatus planktophila in both brdu treated and non brdu treated samples these bacterial taxa have been previously described in water hahn 2009 jezbera et al 2009 however to our knowledge our data are the first to apply a coupled brdu labeling and sequencing approach to describe the metabolically active fraction of these taxa in both reclaimed water and pond water aeromonas arcobacter pseudomonas and shewanella species were observed at a high relative abundance across our brdu treated reclaimed water samples aeromonas spp are ubiquitous in nature and found in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world daskalov 2006 they are detected globally in a broad range of foods surface water ground water and bottled mineral water as well as in chlorinated and non chlorinated drinking water igbinosa et al 2012 they are gram negative rod shaped facultative anaerobes and certain members are emerging as important enteric pathogens of significant concern to public health bhunia 2018 a hydrophila detected at a high relative abundance in brdu treated reclaimed water is an important foodborne pathogen and is widely distributed in aquatic environments igbinosa et al 2012 in 2012 a foodborne outbreak of a hydrophila in a college in china was associated with salad ingredients that had been washed in contaminated water zhang et al 2012 additionally many strains of a hydrophila are highly resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics daskalov 2006 moreover arcobacter spp lappi et al 2013 phillips 2001 prouzet mauléon et al 2006 van den abeele et al 2014 vandenberg et al 2004 have been regarded as an underestimated enteropathogen present in environmental samples especially in untreated water these bacteria are very similar to campylobacter spp and hence have been misclassified and misdiagnosed in many instances phillips 2001 prouzet mauléon et al 2006 vandenberg et al 2004 p fluorescens detected in brdu treated pond and reclaimed water in this study is another opportunistic pathogen that inhabits multiple environments including soil water and plant surfaces scales et al 2014 p fluorescens is typically resistant to a wide array of antibiotics patil s 2015 and has been associated with nosocomial infections including blood transfusion related septicemia catheter related bacteremia and peritonitis wong et al 2011 shewanella spp also detected in brdu treated reclaimed water samples are gram negative bacilli and opportunistic pathogens and have been isolated from multiple foods and sewage as well as fresh and salt water sharma and kalawat 2010 recently a study evaluating the microbiological quality of leafy green vegetables sold in local markets of saudi arabia found the presence of s putrefaciens in dill leaves and green onions el sayed et al 2013 the presence of these bacteria in brdu treated reclaimed water indicates that they are likely metabolically active providing evidence that the type of reclaimed water analyzed in this work is likely to require additional treatment if the water is to be used for purposes such as the irrigation of fresh produce interestingly we also observed a high relative abundance of certain flavobacterium spp such as f aquaticum f psychrophilum f cauense f saliperosum and f sasangense across both water types within the brdu treated samples however in a previous study urbach et al 1999 that utilized a 20 hour brdu incubation time flavobacterium did not assimilate brdu into its dna it has been shown that flavobacterium species like f psychrophilum are slow growing microorganisms that require specialized media for optimal growth in the laboratory cain and lafrentz 2007 hence the discrepancy between the two studies could be explained by our longer brdu incubation time which allowed the capture of slower growing metabolically active flavobacterium species in our water samples most of the flavobacterium spp observed in our study are shown to be associated with infections in fish loch and faisal 2015 qu et al 2009 schiff 1961 starliper 2011 subhash et al 2013 verma and rathore 2015 wang 2006 and to date none of these species have been associated with human infections amr is of growing concern due to use overuse and misuse of antibiotics as well as inappropriate disposal of antibiotics into the environment that has resulted in an increase in antimicrobial resistant bacteria in multiple environmental niches we observed beta lactam resistance genes blaoxa in brdu treated reclaimed water samples fig 5a additionally we documented the presence of klebsiella pneumoniae a gram negative opportunistic pathogen known for its high frequency and diversity of amr genes wyres and holt 2018 in brdu treated reclaimed water types fig 6a these bacteria are known to cause a range of illnesses pneumonia thrombophlebitis urinary tract infection uti bacteremia and septicemia qureshi 2019 and act as key traffickers of drug resistance genes from environmental to clinically important gram negative bacteria wyres and holt 2018 previous studies have shown the presence of these blaoxa genes in klebsiella pneumoniae conferring resistance to ampicillin ticarcillin piperacillin and cephalosporins sugumar et al 2014 we also observed aminoglycoside resistance genes fig 5a and the presence of aeromonas species especially a hydophilia fig 3c in brdu treated reclaimed water during our may sampling period recently a case study indicated the presence of aminoglycoside resistant a hydophilia as part of multi microbial infection following a traumatic fall into the chattahoochee river in georgia usa shak et al 2011 the presence of aminoglycoside resistant a hydophilia in our brdu treated reclaimed water samples shows that these bacteria are capable of surpassing even secondary treatments and chlorination similarly in brdu treated pond water we observed aminoglycoside aph 3 genes and e coli figs 5b and 6b aminoglycosides are an important class of antibiotics that include clinically important drugs such as gentamicin amikacin tobramycin and streptomycin extensively used to treat many bacterial diseases wright and thompson 1999 recently the emergence of aminoglycoside resistant e coli has been observed primarily due to the presence of modifying enzymes like aminoglycoside phosphotransferases e g aph3 ojdana et al 2018 infection with these amr bacteria are difficult to treat in both humans and animals conventional screening approaches for antibiotic resistant bacteria involve plating samples on non selective or antibiotic selective agar plates purifying the bacterial colonies and using different methods to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration for a wide array of antibiotics weinstein and clinical and laboratory standards institute 2019 since this is considerably time consuming molecular based techniques like pcr microarrays and next generation sequencing techniques are also used for more rapid surveys however in most of these approaches it cannot be discerned whether or not metabolically active taxa carry these genes in our data both amr and virulence genes were observed at a significantly higher relative abundance in reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples additionally we observed a lower abundance of these genes in the brdu treated water samples raising the possibility that amr and virulence genes present in these water bodies may not be predominantly within metabolically active bacteria rather these amr elements appear to be predominantly present in potentially relic dna and thus may represent a reservoir for transfer to other bacteria through transformation rather than horizontal gene transfer events to our knowledge these are the first data of their kind indicating that the majority of amr and virulence genes detected in diverse water samples may be associated with relic dna rather than viable metabolically active microorganisms however future work that hones in on the detection limit of coupled brdu labeling and sequencing assays in identifying antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes is needed in order to discern whether there are any biases inherent in the brdu labeling method with regard to the detection of these genes future studies investigating the specific mechanisms at play are also warranted on the other hand our findings that amr and virulence genes predominate in non brdu treated samples may only be valid under laboratory conditions it is possible that bacteria carrying and or expressing amr and virulence genes may be more active in their natural environments strengths of this study include the sample size and analysis of multiple sampling time points using both 16s rrna and shotgun sequencing strategies however like all sequencing based studies our study also had limitations including inherent biases from pcr amplification and our limited ability to assign species level classifications due to the limitations in the databases used additionally to better understand the origins of amr and virulence genes from environmental samples there is a need for further investigation of other metagenomic assembly methods including the proximity ligation hic method stalder et al 2019 or metagene noguchi et al 2006 both of which can improve assignments of specific bacterial hosts to their respective amr or virulence genes future directions also include identifying species level functional profiles of our metagenomes using humann2 franzosa et al 2018 to gain a better understanding of the functional profiles of microbial communities that are present in these water sources in terms of the brdu labeling method the detection of metabolically active bacteria in our study may have been limited since not all bacteria are able to uptake and incorporate brdu effectively or at similar rates also it is possible that the two day incubation period that we utilized for both brdu labeled and non labeled samples may have influenced the bacterial communities observed in our study in future studies it would be beneficial to follow samples longitudinally extracting dna immediately upon arrival of the sample in the lab and then again after a brdu incubation in order to understand whether or not incubation time significantly shifts bacterial community composition 5 conclusion in summary our coupled brdu labeling and sequencing approach provides a novel temporal snapshot of total and metabolically active bacterial communities in two types of alternative irrigation water sources moreover our methods can be utilized to assess the efficacy of future risk mitigation efforts including on farm irrigation water treatments to enhance water quality and promote food safety future work applying our coupled labeling and sequencing approach to other water types across a broader geographic area is needed and will help to discern the generalizability of these data the main conclusions drawn from this study are coupling brdu labeling and next generation sequencing can enable the characterization of metabolically active bacterial communities in alternative irrigation waters amr and virulence gene profiles seem to be more diverse and more abundant in non brdu treated water samples raising the possibility that the majority of amr and virulence genes in multiple water types may be associated with relic dna rather than viable cells the presence of metabolically active bacterial communities in nontraditional irrigation waters may pose an exposure risk to crops that are irrigated with these waters

17718,understanding the complex microbiota of agricultural irrigation water is vital to multiple sectors of sustainable agriculture and public health to date microbiome characterization methods have provided comprehensive profiles of aquatic microbiotas but have not described which taxa are likely metabolically active here we combined 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine brdu labeling with 16s rrna and shotgun sequencing to identify metabolically active bacteria in reclaimed and agricultural pond water samples n 28 recovered from the mid atlantic united states between march 2017 and january 2018 brdu treated samples were significantly less diverse alpha diversity compared to non brdu treated samples the most abundant taxa in the metabolically active fraction of water samples brdu treated samples were unclassified actinobacteria flavobacterium spp pseudomonas spp and aeromonas spp interestingly we also observed that antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene profiles seemed to be more diverse and more abundant in non brdu treated water samples compared to brdu treated samples these findings raise the possibility that these genes may be associated more with relic inactive dna present in the tested water types rather than viable metabolically active microorganisms our study demonstrates that the coupled use of brdu labeling and sequencing can enhance understanding of the metabolically active fraction of bacterial communities in alternative irrigation water sources agricultural pond and reclaimed waters are vital to the future of sustainable agriculture and thus the full

irrigation water sources such as reclaimed water advanced treated wastewater and agricultural ponds are integral to the future of sustainable agriculture these sources will likely be called upon more frequently to complement reserves from aquifers in multiple regions of the world ortega reig et al 2014 parsons et al 2010 sapkota 2019 wade miller 2006 alternative irrigation waters however have often been exposed to significant anthropogenic and wildlife pressures the full understanding of which will be important to a wide range of food safety and public health concerns agricultural ponds are one of the most reliable and economical sources of water for agricultural irrigation downing 2010 previous studies describing agricultural pond microbiota have identified proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and cyanobacteria alfiansah et al 2018 chopyk et al 2018 qin et al 2016 fecal indicator bacteria total coliforms generic escherichia coli and enterococci e coli o157 h7 salmonella spp and shiga toxin producing e coli stec genes have also been reported in agricultural ponds and in produce irrigated with pond water antaki et al 2016 decol et al 2017 topalcengiz et al 2017 a salmonella newport outbreak that caused more than 500 illnesses across 26 states was attributed to consumption of tomatoes irrigated with pond water from the eastern shore of virginia greene et al 2008 another recent study describes the diverse and dynamic bacterial and viral populations in an agricultural freshwater pond in the mid atlantic region chopyk et al 2018 this pond was dominated by actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes as well as temperate bacteriophages including those of the siphoviridae and myoviridae families with regard to advanced treated wastewater methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and vancomycin resistant enterococci have been detected in both the influent and effluent of u s tertiary wastewater treatment plants mid atlantic and midwest by goldstein et al 2012 and 2014 goldstein et al 2012 rosenberg goldstein et al 2014 additionally balkhair 2016 detected e coli pseudomonas aeruginosa salmonella spp vibrio spp and listeria spp in soil and radishes irrigated with reclaimed water in saudi arabia balkhair 2016 recently genes conferring resistance to commonly used antibiotics aminoglycosides sulfonamides rifamycins macrolides cephalosporins fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines were also observed in water samples from a reclamation facility and a wastewater impacted creek located in the mid atlantic region by chopyk et al 2020 together these studies provide evidence that bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes may persist in reclaimed water and could potentially be transferred to the produce irrigated with these water sources in the mid 1970s outbreaks associated with food irrigated with raw sewage or primary treated wastewater were described by bryan 1977 similarly katzenelson et al 1976 reported that the incidence of shigellosis salmonellosis typhoid fever and infectious hepatitis was four fold higher in kibbutzim israel using wastewater irrigation practices katzenelson et al 1976 to date however there have been no documented illnesses resulting from the use of reclaimed water tertiary treated in irrigation activities in the united states us epa us fda currently to ensure that the microbiological quality of reclaimed water is suitable for irrigation applications culture based methods focused on the detection of generic e coli as an indicator of water quality are commonly used additionally molecular assays are used to identify specific targets and broad metagenomic surveys powered by next generation sequencing techniques are commonly used to characterize microbial communities in complex environmental matrices schuster 2008 while these methods have provided insights into agricultural water ecosystems mandal et al 2015 most approaches cannot differentiate between live and dead bacteria li et al 2017 as demand for reclaimed water and other alternatives to groundwater continues to grow it will be important to improve our understanding of the pathogenic potential of water used to manage food crops steele and odumeru 2004 to provide data to address this knowledge gap we combined bromodeoxyuridine brdu dna labeling with targeted and target independent next generation sequencing aiming to characterize the metabolically active fraction of bacteria in multiple alternative irrigation water sources reclaimed water and ponds brdu is a synthetic thymidine analog that incorporates into replicating dna the brdu within the dna can subsequently be detected using antibody immunocapture and characterized functionally and taxonomically by annotating next generation sequencing data this approach distinguishes between live metabolically active and dead relic bacterial communities galand 2013 urbach et al 1999 by annotating our shotgun sequencing data we also provided an important characterization of antimicrobial resistance amr gene and virulence gene profiles by brdu treatment and by water type the data presented here demonstrate that the coupled use of brdu labeling and sequencing provides an enhanced understanding of the metabolically active fraction of bacterial communities in alternative irrigation water sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites two water sources in the mid atlantic united states were included in the study an agricultural pond and a tertiary wastewater treatment plant and reclamation facility the agricultural pond is a temperate freshwater pond with a maximum depth of approximately 3 35 m and a surface area of approximately 0 26 ha permission to obtain pond water samples was granted by the farm manager the tertiary wastewater treatment plant is located in a rural area and treats between 1 135 62 and 1 419 53 m3 of domestic wastewater per day with a maximum daily capacity of 1 892 70 m3 raw influent consists of residential municipal wastewater and light industry wastewater the primary treatments involve the use of screens grinders and grit chambers activated sludge reactors aeration tanks and sedimentation tanks secondary clarifiers are the secondary treatments used the secondary clarified wastewater is then piped to an open air lagoon and chlorinated before land application via spray irrigation to achieve further nutrient removal and ultimate groundwater recharge permission to collect reclaimed water for the purposes of this study was granted by the town administrator 2 2 sample collection from march 2017 to january 2018 two liters of water from each source were collected during bi weekly sampling trips a total of 13 reclaimed water samples and 15 pond water samples reclaimed water samples could not be obtained during the winter months of november december and january were used for further analyses in addition a prodss digital sampling system ysi yellow springs oh usa was used to measure in triplicate water temperature c conductivity spc us cm ph dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential mv turbidity fnu nitrate mg l and chloride mg l 2 3 sample processing 200μl of 100 mm brdu was added to 1 l of water while the other liter was not treated with brdu the brdu treated samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and then incubated for 2 days in the dark at room temperature this allowed brdu to incorporate into replicating dna of the brdu treated samples enabling us to detect the metabolically active fractions of the bacterial communities within our water samples the non brdu labeled samples were also incubated for 2 days such that all samples were treated the same except for the addition of the brdu previous studies have utilized brdu incubation times ranging from 1 hour to 30 days edlund et al 2008 edlund and jansson 2006 galand 2013 goldfarb et al 2011 pernthaler et al 2002 pernthaler and pernthaler 2005 urbach et al 1999 based on these studies we tested a 24 hour incubation and a 48 hour incubation with multiple environmental sample types including tobacco soil and water data not shown these experiments demonstrated that we achieved better pcr amplification across all sample types with the 48 hour incubation period and therefore we chose a two day brdu incubation period for this study no additional nutrients or carbon sources were added to the samples since we wanted to maintain the original water conditions as much as possible both the brdu treated and non treated samples were then filtered on the same day through 0 2 µm 47 mm filters pall corporation port washington ny usa using sterile filter funnels thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the filters were then dissected into four quadrants placed in lysing matrix b tubes mp biomedicals solon oh usa and stored at 80 c until dna extraction 2 4 dna extraction dna extractions were performed using protocols previously published by our group chopyk et al 2017a 2017b briefly 1 ml of pbs was added to the filters in the lysing matrix b tubes before incubation in enzymatic cocktails containing lysozyme mutanolysin proteinase k and lysostaphin after which the cells were mechanically lysed using an mp biomedical fastprep 24 santa ana ca the dna was then purified using the qiagen qiamp dna mini kit germantown ma per the manufacturer s protocol 2 5 immunocapture of brdu treated samples immunocapture and isolation of brdu labeled dna were performed using a previously published protocol urbach et al 1999 briefly a 1 9 ratio of sheared and denatured herring sperm dna hs dna and monoclonal anti brdu α brdu antibody was mixed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature to form the hs dna α brdu antibody complex the extracted dna from the water samples was then denatured by heating for 5 min at 100 c and transferred to ice the mixture of hs dna α brdu antibody complex was then added to the denatured dna from the water samples and incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature with agitation to form the dna hs dna α brdu antibody complex meanwhile magnetic beads dynabeads dynal inc invitrogen by thermofisher scientific coated with goat anti mouse immunoglobulin g were washed three times with 1 mg ml acetylated bovine serum albumin bsa in phosphate buffered saline pbs buffer using a magnetic particle concentrator the washed dynabeads were then added to the dna hs dna α brdu antibody complex and incubated for an additional 1 h in the dark at room temperature after incubation the samples were washed in 0 5 ml pbs bsa and the brdu containing dna fraction was eluted by adding 1 7 mm brdu in pbs bsa and incubating for 1 h in the dark at room temperature 2 6 16s rrna pcr amplification and sequencing extracted dna was pcr amplified for the v3 v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene using the universal primers 319f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat and sequenced on an illumina hiseq2500 illumina san diego ca using a method developed at the institute for genome sciences holm et al 2019 and described previously chopyk et al 2017a 2017b briefly pcr reactions were carried out using phusion high fidelity dna polymerase thermo fisher waltham ma usa and 2 ng of template dna in a total reaction volume of 25 μl an additional 0 375 μl of bovine serum albumin bsa 20 mg ml was added to the pcr reactions to avoid potential pcr inhibition negative controls without dna template were included for both primer sets the following pcr conditions were employed 30 s at 98 c followed by 10 s at 98 c 15 s at 66 c and 15 s at 72 c with a final step of 10 min at 72 c amplicon presence was confirmed using gel electrophoresis after which the sequelprep normalization kit invitrogen inc carlsbad ca usa was used for cleanup and normalization 25 ng of 16s pcr amplicons from each sample were included prior to pooling and sequencing using illumina illumina san diego ca hiseq2500 2 300 bp pe reads holm et al 2019 2 7 shotgun library preparation and sequencing dna libraries for shotgun sequencing were prepared using the nextera xt kit illumina san diego ca usa per the

for chimeras using uchime in de novo mode implemented in quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime release v 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 quality trimmed sequences were then clustered de novo into operational taxonomic units otus and taxonomic assignments were performed using vsearch rognes et al 2016 with a minimum confidence threshold of 0 97 the silva 16s database quast et al 2012 in qiime caporaso et al 2010 was used for taxonomy assignments downstream data analysis and visualization was completed in rstudio v 1 1 423 using r packages biomformat mcmurdie and paulson joseph n 2017 vegan oksanen et al 2017 ggplot2 wickham 2009 phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 bioconductor huber et al 2015 and metagenomeseq joseph nathaniel paulson 2017 visualization of bacterial otus was

diversity was measured using both the observed richness metric and the shannon diversity index shannon 1948 bray curtis dissimilarity was used for calculating beta diversity and was compared using analysis of similarities anosim on normalized data 999 permutations pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to identify associations between the water characteristics and the relative abundance of the bacterial phyla and visualized via heatmaps created in r via vegan heatplus ploner 2012 2 8 2 metagenomic data analysis unassembled metagenomic sequencing reads were annotated using the genius bioinformatics software package cosmosid inc rockville md as described previously in detail connelly et al 2018 2017 hasan et al 2014 hourigan et al 2018 janes et al 2017 jumat et al 2017 junqueira et al 2017 kaleko et al 2016 lax et al 2014 leddy et al 2017 ottesen et al 2016 ponnusamy et al 2016 roy et al 2018 which provided microbial community composition as well as predicted antibiotic resistance and virulence genes the system utilizes a highly curated cosmosid database genbook and a high performance data mining k mer algorithm to annotate sequence reads the genbook databases are composed of over 150 000 microbial genomes and gene sequences representing over 1 000 bacterial 5 000 viral 250 protists and 1 500 fungal species as well as over 5 500antibiotic resistance and virulence associated genes the genbook database constitutes both publicly available data from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi as well as a subset of genomes sequenced by cosmosid and its collaborators the cosmosid pipeline employs two k mer based algorithms 5vce and nmerce hasan et al 2014 for the putative identification of microorganisms at the species or strain level the pipeline consists of a pre computation phase for the reference database and a per sample computation the input to the pre computation phase is a reference microbial genome or antibiotic resistance or virulence gene database and its output is phylogenic trees with sets of variable length k mer fingerprints biomarkers that are uniquely identified with distinct nodes branches and leaves of the tree the second per sample computational phase searches the millions of sequence reads against the fingerprint sets the second comparator uses edit distance scoring techniques to compare a target genome or gene with a reference set the algorithm provides similar functionality to blast but sacrifices some recall precision for a one or two order of magnitude processing gain the resulting statistics are analyzed to give fine grain composition and relative abundance estimates at all nodes of the tree the relative abundance describes the contribution of a given taxon to the total microbial community detected relative abundance is expressed in and calculated as follows relative abundance abundance score taxon n sum of abundance score all taxa this metric is suitable for downstream comparative analysis enhanced detection specificity is achieved by running the comparators in sequence the first comparator finds reads in which there is an exact match with a k mer uniquely identified with a reference genome or antibiotic resistance or virulence gene the second comparator then statistically scores the entire read against the reference to verify that the read is indeed uniquely identified to that reference overall classification precision is achieved through aggregation statistics to visualize the relative abundance of bacterial phyla amr and virulence genes stacked bar charts were generated using tableau version 9 1 additionally bacterial taxa were normalized and visualized using several r packages vegan oksanen et al 2017 dplyr wickham et al 2018 circlize gu et al 2014 reshape2 wickham 2017 and stringr wickham 2019 and reads with a relative abundance greater than 5 in at least one sample were used to build the microbial profile as well as shared and unique data based on the water type and treatments brdu or no brdu also when species or genus level assignments could not be assigned uncl unclassified was added to the deepest taxonomic assignment available i e from phylum to family 2 9 availability of data data concerning the samples included in this study are deposited in the ncbi bioproject database under bioproject accession

verrucomicrobia was positively correlated with chloride planctomycetes were positively correlated with ambient temperature turbidity and water temperature conversely the relative abundance of proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen and bacteroidetes was negatively correlated with ambient temperature turbidity and water temperature in reclaimed water the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and od1 were positively correlated with ph while chloroflexi was positively correlated with both conductivity and salinity negative correlations with nitrate and ph were observed for planctomycetes and actinobacteria respectively while verrucomicrobia was negatively correlated with both dissolved oxygen and ph additionally the relative

abundant in the non brdu treated samples additionally flavobacterium was observed at a high relative abundance in the brdu treated fraction from august to december contrary to pond water in reclaimed water fig 3c uncl actinobacteria was typically observed at a higher relative abundance in profiles of non brdu treated samples while flavobacterium was present from august through november at a higher relative abundance in brdu treated water samples a media was well represented in the metabolically active fraction brdu treated from april through june and a hydrophilia was predominant in may and june additionally we observed the highest relative abundance of pseudomonas in march and p fluorescens in august and september in the metabolically active profiles brdu treated samples 3 6 shared and unique bacterial taxa by site and brdu treatment detected using shotgun metagenomics bacterial taxa unique to pond water samples were methylomonas and limnohabitans while bacterial taxa unique to reclaimed water samples included aeromonas a media a hydrophila arcobacter bacteroides f sasangense methylocystis pseudomonas p fluorescens uncl chitinophagia flavobacterium polynucleobacter p mandelii s salmoneum uncl alphaproteobacteria uncl opituaceae uncl betaproteobacteria and uncl actinobacteria were present in both water sample types fig 4 a unique taxa associated with brdu treated pond water samples includeduncl chitinophagia pseudomonas p fluorescens flavobacterium anduncl cyanobacteria fig 4b while brdu treated reclaimed water samples were comprised of rhizobium sphingopyxis pseudomonas p fluorescens flavobacterium arcobacter aeromonas a media and a hydrophila fig 4c 3 7 antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes the relative abundance of amr genes was much higher in reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples and in non brdu treated samples compared to brdu treated samples for both water types fig 5 a and b additionally we observed that amr genes could be detected throughout the year in reclaimed water samples except in august and september but were primarily detected only from august through october in pond water samples greater diversity of resistance elements was also observed in profiles of reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples the efflux pump gene msre beta lactam resistance gene blaoxa quinolone resistance gene qnrs2 macrolide resistance gene mphe macrolide resistance gene emrf aminoglycoside resistance gene aada6 sulphonamide resistance gene sul2 and mpha gene that inactivates 14 membered macrolides were the most prominent amr genes detected in brdu treated reclaimed water samples while only the aminoglycoside resistance gene aph3 was detected in brdu treated pond water samples as with the prevalence of amr elements a higher relative abundance of virulence genes was detected in reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples fig 6 a and b virulence genes predicted to be present within klebsiella pneumoniae dominated brdu treated reclaimed water while those predicted to be present within e coli dominated in brdu treated pond water other virulence genes observed in brdu treated reclaimed water were predicted to be associated with enterobacter aerogenes proteus mirabilis pseudomonas aerogenes vibrio cholerae salmonella typhimurium and salmonella infantis in contrast virulence genes predicted to be associated with proteus mirabilis pseudomonas aerogenes and pseudomonas putida were observed in brdu treated pond water bacteroides fragilis was observed in both non brdu treated water types 4 discussion while pond and reclaimed water sources are necessary alternatives to traditional ground water sources of irrigation water our data suggest that additional water treatment may be needed to ensure that bacterial water quality is appropriate for the intended use our study showed that the bacterial communities of both reclaimed water samples and untreated pond water samples are diverse and may include bacterial species of importance to human health coupling brdu labeling with 16srrna and shotgun sequencing provided a novel understanding of the metabolically active fraction of bacterial communities present in these important irrigation water types while diverse antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were detected in both reclaimed water and pond water these genes were more frequently identified in non brdu treated samples compared to brdu treated samples these findings raise the possibility that these genes may be associated more with relic inactive dna present in the water samples rather than viable metabolically active organisms the presence of uncl actinobacteria flavobacterium a media a hydophila p fluorescens s putrefaciens and arcobacter species or genera containing specific strains that have been associated with human and or animal diseases was observed in brdu treated water samples representing the metabolically active fraction of the detected bacterial communities figs 3 and 4 uncl actinobacteria in particular which dominated in brdu treated pond water throughout the sampling period as shown by our 16s rrna sequence data were identified as the hgcl clade of the phylum actinobacteria this finding is consistent with other work that has described specific bacterial taxa among freshwater microbiota hosen et al 2017 llirós et al 2014 the 16s rrna gene data also described the presence of currently non culturable members hahn 2009 of the phylum actinobacteria candidatus aquiluna canditatus rhodoluna candidatus planktoluna and candidatus planktophila in both brdu treated and non brdu treated samples these bacterial taxa have been previously described in water hahn 2009 jezbera et al 2009 however to our knowledge our data are the first to apply a coupled brdu labeling and sequencing approach to describe the metabolically active fraction of these taxa in both reclaimed water and pond water aeromonas arcobacter pseudomonas and shewanella species were observed at a high relative abundance across our brdu treated reclaimed water samples aeromonas spp are ubiquitous in nature and found in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world daskalov 2006 they are detected globally in a broad range of foods surface water ground water and bottled mineral water as well as in chlorinated and non chlorinated drinking water igbinosa et al 2012 they are gram negative rod shaped facultative anaerobes and certain members are emerging as important enteric pathogens of significant concern to public health bhunia 2018 a hydrophila detected at a high relative abundance in brdu treated reclaimed water is an important foodborne pathogen and is widely distributed in aquatic environments igbinosa et al 2012 in 2012 a foodborne outbreak of a hydrophila in a college in china was associated with salad ingredients that had been washed in contaminated water zhang et al 2012 additionally many strains of a hydrophila are highly resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics daskalov 2006 moreover arcobacter spp lappi et al 2013 phillips 2001 prouzet mauléon et al 2006 van den abeele et al 2014 vandenberg et al 2004 have been regarded as an underestimated enteropathogen present in environmental samples especially in untreated water these bacteria are very similar to campylobacter spp and hence have been misclassified and misdiagnosed in many instances phillips 2001 prouzet mauléon et al 2006 vandenberg et al 2004 p fluorescens detected in brdu treated pond and reclaimed water in this study is another opportunistic pathogen that inhabits multiple environments including soil water and plant surfaces scales et al 2014 p fluorescens is typically resistant to a wide array of antibiotics patil s 2015 and has been associated with nosocomial infections including blood transfusion related septicemia catheter related bacteremia and peritonitis wong et al 2011 shewanella spp also detected in brdu treated reclaimed water samples are gram negative bacilli and opportunistic pathogens and have been isolated from multiple foods and sewage as well as fresh and salt water sharma and kalawat 2010 recently a study evaluating the microbiological quality of leafy green vegetables sold in local markets of saudi arabia found the presence of s putrefaciens in dill leaves and green onions el sayed et al 2013 the presence of these bacteria in brdu treated reclaimed water indicates that they are likely metabolically active providing evidence that the type of reclaimed water analyzed in this work is likely to require additional treatment if the water is to be used for purposes such as the irrigation of fresh produce interestingly we also observed a high relative abundance of certain flavobacterium spp such as f aquaticum f psychrophilum f cauense f saliperosum and f sasangense across both water types within the brdu treated samples however in a previous study urbach et al 1999 that utilized a 20 hour brdu incubation time flavobacterium did not assimilate brdu into its dna it has been shown that flavobacterium species like f psychrophilum are slow growing microorganisms that require specialized media for optimal growth in the laboratory cain and lafrentz 2007 hence the discrepancy between the two studies could be explained by our longer brdu incubation time which allowed the capture of slower growing metabolically active flavobacterium species in our water samples most of the flavobacterium spp observed in our study are shown to be associated with infections in fish loch and faisal 2015 qu et al 2009 schiff 1961 starliper 2011 subhash et al 2013 verma and rathore 2015 wang 2006 and to date none of these species have been associated with human infections amr is of growing concern due to use overuse and misuse of antibiotics as well as inappropriate disposal of antibiotics into the environment that has resulted in an increase in antimicrobial resistant bacteria in multiple environmental niches we observed beta lactam resistance genes blaoxa in brdu treated reclaimed water samples fig 5a additionally we documented the presence of klebsiella pneumoniae a gram negative opportunistic pathogen known for its high frequency and diversity of amr genes wyres and holt 2018 in brdu treated reclaimed water types fig 6a these bacteria are known to cause a range of illnesses pneumonia thrombophlebitis urinary tract infection uti bacteremia and septicemia qureshi 2019 and act as key traffickers of drug resistance genes from environmental to clinically important gram negative bacteria wyres and holt 2018 previous studies have shown the presence of these blaoxa genes in klebsiella pneumoniae conferring resistance to ampicillin ticarcillin piperacillin and cephalosporins sugumar et al 2014 we also observed aminoglycoside resistance genes fig 5a and the presence of aeromonas species especially a hydophilia fig 3c in brdu treated reclaimed water during our may sampling period recently a case study indicated the presence of aminoglycoside resistant a hydophilia as part of multi microbial infection following a traumatic fall into the chattahoochee river in georgia usa shak et al 2011 the presence of aminoglycoside resistant a hydophilia in our brdu treated reclaimed water samples shows that these bacteria are capable of surpassing even secondary treatments and chlorination similarly in brdu treated pond water we observed aminoglycoside aph 3 genes and e coli figs 5b and 6b aminoglycosides are an important class of antibiotics that include clinically important drugs such as gentamicin amikacin tobramycin and streptomycin extensively used to treat many bacterial diseases wright and thompson 1999 recently the emergence of aminoglycoside resistant e coli has been observed primarily due to the presence of modifying enzymes like aminoglycoside phosphotransferases e g aph3 ojdana et al 2018 infection with these amr bacteria are difficult to treat in both humans and animals conventional screening approaches for antibiotic resistant bacteria involve plating samples on non selective or antibiotic selective agar plates purifying the bacterial colonies and using different methods to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration for a wide array of antibiotics weinstein and clinical and laboratory standards institute 2019 since this is considerably time consuming molecular based techniques like pcr microarrays and next generation sequencing techniques are also used for more rapid surveys however in most of these approaches it cannot be discerned whether or not metabolically active taxa carry these genes in our data both amr and virulence genes were observed at a significantly higher relative abundance in reclaimed water samples compared to pond water samples additionally we observed a lower abundance of these genes in the brdu treated water samples raising the possibility that amr and virulence genes present in these water bodies may not be predominantly within metabolically active bacteria rather these amr elements appear to be predominantly present in potentially relic dna and thus may represent a reservoir for transfer to other bacteria through transformation rather than horizontal gene transfer events to our knowledge these are the first data of their kind indicating that the majority of amr and virulence genes detected in diverse water samples may be associated with relic dna rather than viable metabolically active microorganisms however future work that hones in on the detection limit of coupled brdu labeling and sequencing assays in identifying antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes is needed in order to discern whether there are any biases inherent in the brdu labeling method with regard to the detection of these genes future studies investigating the specific mechanisms at play are also warranted on the other hand our findings that amr and virulence genes predominate in non brdu treated samples may only be valid under laboratory conditions it is possible that bacteria carrying and or expressing amr and virulence genes may be more active in their natural environments strengths of this study include the sample size and analysis of multiple sampling time points using both 16s rrna and shotgun sequencing strategies however like all sequencing based studies our study also had limitations including inherent biases from pcr amplification and our limited ability to assign species level classifications due to the limitations in the databases used additionally to better understand the origins of amr and virulence genes from environmental samples there is a need for further investigation of other metagenomic assembly methods including the proximity ligation hic method stalder et al 2019 or metagene noguchi et al 2006 both of which can improve assignments of specific bacterial hosts to their respective amr or virulence genes future directions also include identifying species level functional profiles of our metagenomes using humann2 franzosa et al 2018 to gain a better understanding of the functional profiles of microbial communities that are present in these water sources in terms of the brdu labeling method the detection of metabolically active bacteria in our study may have been limited since not all bacteria are able to uptake and incorporate brdu effectively or at similar rates also it is possible that the two day incubation period that we utilized for both brdu labeled and non labeled samples may have influenced the bacterial communities observed in our study in future studies it would be beneficial to follow samples longitudinally extracting dna immediately upon arrival of the sample in the lab and then again after a brdu incubation in order to understand whether or not incubation time significantly shifts bacterial community composition 5 conclusion in summary our coupled brdu labeling and sequencing approach provides a novel temporal snapshot of total and metabolically active bacterial communities in two types of alternative irrigation water sources moreover our methods can be utilized to assess the efficacy of future risk mitigation efforts including on farm irrigation water treatments to enhance water quality and promote food safety future work applying our coupled labeling and sequencing approach to other water types across a broader geographic area is needed and will help to discern the generalizability of these data the main conclusions drawn from this study are coupling brdu labeling and next generation sequencing can enable the characterization of metabolically active bacterial communities in alternative irrigation waters amr and virulence gene profiles seem to be more diverse and more abundant in non brdu treated water samples raising the possibility that the majority of amr and virulence genes in multiple water types may be associated with relic dna rather than viable cells the presence of metabolically active bacterial communities in nontraditional irrigation waters may pose an exposure risk to crops that are irrigated with these waters

17719,hydroxylamine is a key intermediate in several biological reactions of the global nitrogen cycle however the role of hydroxylamine in anammox is still not fully understood in this work the impact of hydroxylamine also in combination with other substrates on the metabolism of a planktonic enrichment culture of the anammox species ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was studied anammox bacteria were observed to produce ammonium both from hydroxylamine and hydrazine and hydroxylamine was consumed simultaneously with nitrite hydrazine accumulation signature for the presence of anammox bacteria strongly depended on the available substrates being higher with ammonium and lower with nitrite furthermore the results presented here indicate that hydrazine accumulation is not the result of the inhibition of hydrazine dehydrogenase as commonly assumed but the product of hydroxylamine disproportionation all kinetic parameters for the identified reactions were estimated by mathematical modelling moreover the simultaneous consumption and growth on ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine of anammox bacteria was demonstrated this was accompanied by a reduction in the nitrate production ultimately this study advances the fundamental understanding of the metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria and highlights the potential role played by metabolic intermediates i e hydroxylamine hydrazine in shaping natural and engineered microbial communities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox intermediate disproportionation hydrazine nitrate 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox were first reported in the 90s in a wastewater treatment plant mulder et al 1995 anammox bacteria autotrophically oxidize ammonium to dinitrogen gas with nitrite as electron acceptor jetten et al 1998 before their discovery even if predicted thermodynamically ammonium activation in absence of oxygen had never been identified in nature broda 1977 since then significant efforts focused on understanding the central metabolism of anammox bacteria e g kartal et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016 strous et al 1998 van de graaf et al 1997 initially hydroxylamine was hypothesized to be an obligate intermediate of anammox catabolism and hydrazine was shown to accumulate when hydroxylamine was added in anammox cultures van de graaf et al 1997 more recently no was proposed to be the actual intermediate in the catabolic pathway kartal et al 2011 the current working hypothesis for the anammox metabolism involves three reactions first nitrite is converted to no eq 1 via a nitric reductase nir enzyme then no is used to activate nh4 and form the n n bond needed to produce hydrazine n2h4 eq 2 catalysed by hydrazine synthase hzs finally hydrazine is further converted to dinitrogen gas eq 3 by hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh 1 n o 2 2 h e n o h 2 o 2 n o n h 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e however even with no as the central intermediate hydroxylamine seems to play a key yet elusive role in anammox metabolism for example ca brocadia spp strains do not encode for a nir enzyme oshiki et al 2015 thus either ca brocadia spp have hydroxylamine as central intermediate as proposed by oshiki and coworkers oshiki et al 2016 or another enzyme like kustc0458 rather than nir is converting nitrite to no hu et al 2019 moreover different studies showed that one of the most highly expressed enzyme in anammox bacteria is the hydroxylamine oxidase hox kustc1601 which is proposed to convert hydroxylamine to no hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 the reason for anammox bacteria to invest energy to express hox at such high levels has been hypothesized to be the possibility to reuse any hydroxylamine leaking from hzs dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 briefly the actual reaction mechanisms of hzs is proposed to involve no transformation to hydroxylamine and ammonium and hydroxylamine reacting to form hydrazine dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 overall the role of hydroxylamine in anammox metabolism remains poorly understood in the environment where anammox bacteria thrive free hydroxylamine has been measured hu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 poot et al 2016 soler jofra et al 2018 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019 terada et al 2017 yang and alleman 1992 yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2010 yu et al 2018 for instance hydroxylamine has been shown to transiently accumulate in concentrations ranging from 0 006 1 mg n l in different ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob pure cultures liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2010 yu et al 2018 or mixed consortia hu et al 2017 poot et al 2016 soler jofra et al 2018 su et al 2019 terada et al 2017 yang and alleman 1992 thus anammox exposure to external hydroxylamine cannot be ruled out in particular in biofilm systems where hydroxylamine can be produced by a nitrifying population and can reach higher concentrations than in the bulk liquid sabba et al 2015 in these systems hydroxylamine can be produced in the external oxic layers where aob are present diffuse through the biofilm and reach the anoxic anammox bacteria layers sabba et al 2015 batch tests with hydroxylamine addition are generally used to study the short term effects of hydroxylamine on anammox bacteria primarily to i demonstrate anammox activity egli et al 2001 jetten et al 1998 and ii study the boosting effect of intermediates on anammox activity hu et al 2011 zekker et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge the effect of different substrate combinations on anammox hydroxylamine consumption has not been dedicatedly studied the only in depth study on the effect of hydroxylamine on anammox metabolism used ammonium as sole co substrate van der star et al 2008b in the present work the impact of different combinations of substrates together with hydroxylamine on a planktonic anammox ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis culture in batch tests was studied also the long term impacts of hydroxylamine addition were studied and the effects on stoichiometry and microbial composition were quantified finally a thermodynamic and modelling approach was developed to estimate the key kinetic parameters and further understand the anammox metabolism with hydroxylamine as co substrate 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch test preparation and procedure biomass was collected from a 10l mbr highly enriched in planktonic ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis 79 4 as estimated by 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing analysis see supplementary information si and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4200 rpm at room temperature cells were re suspended in n2 sparged mineral medium to the desired biomass concentration the mineral medium had the same composition as described in si but without ammonium or nitrite and supplemented with 1g l nahco3 the ph and optical density at 660nm od660 were measured before aliquoting 50ml of cell suspension among 112 ml serum bottles the optical density was correlated with gvss l fig s1 biomass used in negative controls was boiled for 5 minutes before aliquoting the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and anoxic conditions were achieved by sparging ca 1 minute and vacuuming ca 3 minutes with argon three times per bottle bottles were placed on a shaker incubator hood th30 edmund bühler gmbh bodelshausen germany at 30 c and 170 rpm the ph was not adjusted but remained between 8 0 and 8 5 within the optimal range for anammox bacteria kartal et al 2012 bottles were incubated overnight with stoichiometric concentrations of ammonium and nitrite to ensure activity after overnight incubation the experiment was performed by adding a pulse of ammonium nitrite hydroxylamine and or hydrazine from anoxic stock solutions to reach the desired initial concentration in each batch test see table 1 sampling was done over time depending on the biomass activity by removing 4 ml of cell suspension with a syringe samples were centrifuged for 3 5 minutes 4200 rpm 4 c and the supernatant was kept for further analysis of the dissolved nitrogen compounds see si samples used for hydrazine watt and chrisp 1952 and hydroxylamine frear and burrell 1955 determination were treated with 200 µl of a 0 1 g ml sulfamic acid solution to remove the dissolved nitrite nitrite was previously shown to interfere in the hydroxylamine determination soler jofra et al 2016 in the present study nitrite was also shown to interfere the hydrazine measurement see fig s2 nitrogen consumption production rates calculations are described in si microbial community dynamics were not followed during the batch tests but they would not be expected to shift significantly as no significant changes were observed during long term hydroxylamine feeding in a continuous reactor see section 3 2 2 2 batch tests thermodynamic analysis based on the batch test data the thermodynamics of the putative reactions involved in hydroxylamine consumption were studied see table 2 reactions 3 6 7 10 and 11 were originally postulated by van der star van der star et al 2008b half reactions were derived based on n o h and charge balances see example in si based on kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 the standard gibbs energy change δgo r of each reaction in table 2 was calculated with the standard gibbs energy of formation g f of each compound table s1 and eq s1 δgo r was corrected with the measured concentration of each compound at each batch test time point to obtain the actual gibbs energy change of reaction δg1 r evolution during the batch tests eq s2 and s3 the aim was to detect any possible thermodynamics limitations to explain the hydrazine accumulation behaviour or the possibility to have no as intermediate in reactions involving hydroxylamine the approach calculations and results are detailed in si 2 3 batch tests kinetic parameters determination a kinetic model table s2 and s3 was proposed and adapted from van der star van der star et al 2008b to obtain the kinetic parameters of the reactions involved in the batch tests the model was implemented in matlab r2018b and aimed to minimize the error between the experimental data and the set of differential equations proposed for each compound as the experiments were performed in batch the set of differential equations were equal to the results of a matrix multiplication between the proposed stoichiometric matrix and the process rate matrix table s2 and s3 respectively a step wise approach to obtain the kinetic constants from more simple to more complex batch tests was followed fig s3 this was combined with the use of different objective functions eqs s4 s7 to assess if the solution of the optimization performed was independent of the objective function used full description of the procedure is detailed in si 2 4 reactor operation continuous long term study one litre of biomass from the same 10l mbr used in batch tests and described in si was used as inoculum for a 2l mbr reactor fig s4 the hrt was kept at 2 3 0 2 d during the whole operation using a custom made ultrafiltration membrane unit van der star et al 2008a an srt of 8 7 1 0 d was maintained throughout the operation period by withdrawing the desired reactor content per day temperature was controlled at 30 c with an external jacket and the reactor was stirred at 170rpm the reactor ph was controlled at 7 04 0 04 with a 53g l nahco3 solution when hydroxylamine was continuously fed phase ii days 38 54 in table s4 two bottles were used to avoid hydroxylamine reaction with any of the mineral medium components the total volumetric mineral medium loads were maintained by correcting media preparation samples were collected daily from the effluent line and centrifuged supernatant was collected for further analysis of the dissolved nitrogen compounds see si and treated with sulfamic acid if needed the biomass pellets were kept at 80 c a fresh sample from the reactor was used to monitor daily optical density during reactor operation volatile suspended solids vss were measured periodically and the specific correlation between od660 and vss was used for calculations fig s5 dna samples from days 23 33 38 40 45 50 and 55 were analysed at novogen for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing see si 3 results discussion 3 1 short term anammox metabolism with hydroxylamine as substrate anammox bacteria primarily convert ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas yet are also capable to metabolize other substrates such as hydroxylamine hydrazine and organic carbon jetten et al 1998 in biofilm systems hydroxylamine can leak from aob communities liu et al 2017 su et al 2019 yang and alleman 1992 diffuse through the biofilm sabba et al 2015 and reach anammox bacteria in anoxic layers batch tests to evaluate the capacity of anammox bacteria to metabolize hydroxylamine were performed by supplying hydroxylamine together with different combination of substrates to a ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis enrichment the aim was to investigate if different combination of substrates impacted the conversion dynamics of the nitrogen species hydroxylamine concentrations used in batch are higher than those to which anammox bacteria might be exposed in nature i e values of 0 006 1 mg n l hydroxylamine have been reported in different nitrification systems liu et al 2017 su et al 2019 yang and alleman 1992 among others but were needed to be able to investigate the conversions trends in nitrogen compounds consumption and production were independent of the initial concentrations table 1 therefore only tests with higher initial concentrations are discussed here fig 1 unless differently stated fig s6 the impact of substrate combinations on hydroxylamine metabolism will be discussed in the present section whereas the impact on hydrazine accumulation will be discussed further in the next section positive controls to assess anammox activity with ammonium and nitrite fig s7a were included data from the positive controls indicated that once nitrite was consumed no significant changes in the ammonium concentrations were detected denitrifying activity was ruled out by providing nitrite as substrate fig s7d to the anammox enrichment culture abiotic controls with boiled biomass and all the substrates used in the batch test were performed and did not show significant activity compared to the biological rates for example an increase of ca 0 1 mg n l of ammonium was detected in the abiotic control after ca 7h fig s7c and e compared to 5 mg n l of ammonium produced in 2h in biological tests fig 1a 3 1 1 ammonium production occurs from both hydroxylamine and hydrazine when hydroxylamine was added as the only substrate batches 2 5 table 1 hydrazine did accumulate as expected from previous studies van de graaf et al 1997 van der star et al 2010 however two distinct ammonium production events occurred fig 1a and fig s6 the first ammonium production started as soon as hydroxylamine was added ca 0 2 4h in fig 1a see also fig s6 when the hydroxylamine concentration became low hydrazine started to accumulate around 1 6h in fig 1a after ca 15 25min in fig s6 with lower initial hydroxylamine concentration once hydroxylamine was depleted a second ammonium production period started correlating with the decrease of hydrazine from ca 2 4h onwards in fig 1a see also fig s6 thus ammonium was produced both with hydroxylamine and hydrazine fig 1a apparently with preference for utilization of hydroxylamine over hydrazine fig s7b the initial production of ammonium from hydroxylamine is in accordance with the hydroxylamine disproportionation reactions reaction 7 table 2 proposed by van de star et al van der star et al 2008b hydroxylamine disproportionation occurs via two intermediate reactions reaction 3 and 6 in table 2 the imbalance of reactions 3 and 6 resulted in the observed hydrazine accumulation see section 3 1 4 for further details the experimental stoichiometric ratio of consumed hydroxylamine per ammonium produced was 3 8 mol mol which is quite close to the theoretically expected of 3 for hydroxylamine disproportionation reaction 7 in table 2 the second ammonium production from hydrazine was not observed by van der star et al van der star et al 2008b most likely obscured by the high initial ammonium concentration used in the tests 2 8 mm 28 112 mg n l the consumption of hydrazine was proposed to follow two possible reactions reaction 10 or 11 table 2 van der star et al 2008b in the present study once hydroxylamine was totally consumed ca 1 4 mm of ammonium were produced per mm of hydrazine consumed close to the 1 3 theoretical ratio of hydrazine disproportionation via reaction 10 in table 1 fig 1a furthermore hydrazine disproportionation via reaction 10 was confirmed by performing a batch test with hydrazine as the only substrate fig 1b batch 7 in table 1 1 2 mm mole of ammonium were produced per mm of hydrazine which is in agreement with the proposed stoichiometry of hydrazine disproportionation reaction 10 table 2 producing 1 3 moles of ammonium per mol of hydrazine similar stoichiometries for ammonium produced per hydrazine consumed were previously shown in a batch test performed with only hydrazine present but no mechanisms were proposed van de graaf et al 1997 based on the experimental stoichiometry the production of ammonium from hydrazine is most likely to result from hydrazine disproportionation as in reaction 10 table 2 see also fig 4 and section 3 1 8 for a discussion on putative enzymes involved the occurrence of hydrazine disproportionation throughout the batch test contributed to the ammonium production when hydroxylamine is still present multiple confirmations were obtained from the experimental data sets and the mathematical model for instance when hydroxylamine and hydrazine were provided together as substrates both were consumed simultaneously batch 13 in table 1 and fig s7b hydroxylamine was initially consumed c a 2 5 times faster than hydrazine 60 4 and 24 2 mg n gvss h respectively and a transient slow down on hydrazine consumption could be observed furthermore the proposed mathematical model with the parameters obtained see section 3 1 9 for further details was used to compute the rates of reaction 3 6 and 7 during a batch tests with hydroxylamine as substrate the simulations indicate that hydrazine disproportionation is occurring throughout the batch test even if at one order of magnitude lower rate than hydroxylamine disproportionation see fig s16 overall two ammonium production events were observed in the same batch test with only hydroxylamine as substrate test 2 to 4 in table 1 when hydroxylamine is present hydroxylamine disproportionation to ammonium and dinitrogen gas via reaction 7 is the dominant process table 2 with hydrazine disproportionation taking place at one order of magnitude lower rate see fig s16 once hydroxylamine is consumed the accumulated hydrazine is disproportionated to ammonium and dinitrogen gas via reaction 10 table 2 3 1 2 ammonium produced from hydroxylamine and hydrazine is used to consume nitrite to further analyse the ammonium production capacity of anammox bacteria from either hydroxylamine or hydrazine batch tests 8 and 9 table 1 were performed hydroxylamine and nitrite were dosed simultaneously to assess if the ammonium production capacity from hydroxylamine and hydrazine could support nitrite consumption as expected the ammonium produced from hydroxylamine was used to consume nitrite fig 1c a slight transient accumulation of hydrazine and ammonium was measured nitrite consumption stopped as soon as all the ammonium produced from hydroxylamine and hydrazine was consumed fig 1c or fig s7f furthermore the ca 20 mg n l hydroxylamine consumed via the disproportionation reaction reaction 7 table 1 would lead to ca 6 6 mg n l nh4 which could be consumed via normal anammox metabolism if we assume a stoichiometry close to that reported by lotti et al lotti et al 2014 of 1 146 mol no2 mol nh4 a maximum consumption of 7 6 mg n l nitrite could be converted which is close to the experimentally observed of 6 4 mg n l of nitrite consumed these observations together with the fact that in the rest of tests except tests 10 12 in table 1 that also had nitrite ammonium accumulated instead of being consumed confirmed that the substrate consumed together with nitrite was ammonium the transient accumulation of ammonium with nitrite was shown by hu and coworkers hu et al 2011 however no hydrazine accumulation was described in those tests also the hydroxylamine conversion slowed down with time maybe due to the higher concentrations used in their tests these results further expand the metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria if hydroxylamine is present with nitrite only i e without nh4 anammox bacteria can generate ammonium from hydroxylamine and consume nitrite via the canonical anammox conversion these results show a potential role of hydroxylamine in ca kuenenia stuttgartinesis metabolism in contrast to the prior unique implication of hydroxylamine in ca brocadia sinica oshiki et al 2016 this situation might occur in partial nitritation anammox pn a systems when ammonium is fully depleted while residual low concentrations of hydroxylamine might be still present e g in biofilms due to gradients between microcolonies 3 1 3 hydroxylamine is consumed simultaneously with nitrite but faster batch tests were performed to assess the impact of hydroxylamine when both nitrite and ammonium were present batches 10 11 12 table 1 this substrates combination is likely to occur in pn a biofilms although hydroxylamine concentrations might be lower than those used here hydroxylamine was consumed simultaneously with nitrite fig 1d the specific hydroxylamine consumption rate qnh2oh was 1 6 to 5 times higher than that of nitrite qno2 depending on the initial hydroxylamine concentration as soon as all hydroxylamine was depleted a 50 increase of nitrite consumption rate was measured table 1 interestingly even after hydroxylamine depletion nitrite consumption rates remained lower than the maximal rate measured in positive controls performed with nitrite and ammonium usual anammox substrates batch 1 table 1 thus these results suggest that hydroxylamine is consumed simultaneously with nitrite but faster than nitrite hydroxylamine presence together with nitrite and ammonium had a putative toxic or partially irreversible effect on nitrite consumption rates as when hydroxylamine was fully consumed nitrite consumption rates did not reach the levels of the positive controls within the range of concentrations tested the hydroxylamine consumption rate linearly depended on the initial hydroxylamine concentration fig 2 a and was not affected by the combination of available substrates the linear consumption of hydroxylamine observed is consistent with previously reported measurements with ammonium only van der star et al 2008b in biological systems monod like kinetics are usually observed for substrates consumption for monod kinetics to be linear the substrate concentration has to be smaller than the half saturation coefficient thus in the present study the hydroxylamine half saturation constant would then be unexpectedly high for suspended cells ca 22 mg n nh2oh l fig 2a as for example the half saturation constant for nitrite in a similar culture was 35 µg n l lotti et al 2014 another putative explanation for the observed linearity is the passive transport of hydroxylamine over the membrane hydroxylamine has a pka of 5 9 at 25 c haynes 2014 thus it is mostly unprotonated under the tested conditions ph 8 and 30 c in the batch tests as a result passive diffusion through the membrane strictly depending on the difference between the bulk and cell concentration of the substrate is likely alberts et al 2007 ultimately the presented results further expand the known metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria hydroxylamine and hydrazine disproportionation were proven to occur simultaneously and if available hydroxylamine was shown to be consumed simultaneously and faster than nitrite as substrate 3 1 4 hydroxylamine disproportionation controls hydrazine accumulation to date hydrazine accumulation has only been reported in the presence of hydroxylamine e g jetten et al 1998 kartal et al 2011 van de graaf et al 1997 however hydrazine is not usually analysed in anammox systems thus its actual concentration is unknown to understand the mechanisms underlying hydrazine turnover hydrazine concentration was measured during all batch tests table 1 hydrazine transiently accumulated when hydroxylamine was added as substrate batches 2 6 and 8 12 in table 1 and the time of the hydrazine peak depended on the initial specific hydroxylamine concentration mg n gvss fig 2b consistently with van der star van der star et al 2008b hydrazine transient accumulation can be explained with hydrazine disproportionation reaction 7 table 2 the disproportionation is the addition of two reactions reactions 3 and 6 table 2 hydrazine starts accumulating when hydroxylamine concentration is low ca 5 mg n l in fig 1a hydroxylamine concentration affects both hydrazine production reaction 3 table 2 and hydrazine consumption reaction 6 table 2 but two moles of hydroxylamine are needed for hydrazine consumption as opposed to one mole needed for its production thus a lower concentration of hydroxylamine decreases the hydrazine consumption rate more than the hydrazine production rate leading to transient hydrazine accumulation this was further supported by the mathematical model fig s16 the hydrazine consumption rate via reaction 6 in table 2 is always lower than the hydrazine production rate via reaction 3 in table 2 resulting in hydrazine accumulation originally the accumulation of hydrazine upon addition of hydroxylamine was ascribed to the inhibition of hdh the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hydrazine to dinitrogen gas this hypothesis was based on the observed in vitro inhibition of hdh by no and hydroxylamine maalcke et al 2016 van de graaf et al 1997 however our results show that hdh inhibition cannot be the explanation of hydrazine accumulation as hydrazine did not accumulate directly after hydroxylamine addition at high initial hydroxylamine concentrations ca 20 mg n l fig 1a instead the hydrazine peak occurred after the consumption of more than ca 15 mg n l of hydroxylamine when hydroxylamine concentration was 5 mg n l this delay was also observed by van der star et al van der star et al 2008b who initially proposed that hdh inhibition could not be the cause for hydrazine accumulation this is contradictory with the results of maalcke et al maalcke et al 2016 that showed that hdh was inhibited by no and hydroxylamine in vitro similarly hu and co workers did not observe any sign of hdh inhibition when no was fed continuously to an anammox culture hu et al 2019 overall the hdh inhibition by hydroxylamine and no demonstrated in vitro maalcke et al 2016 was not observed to occur in vivo meaning another process underlies the hydrazine accumulation instead the imbalance of the hydrazine production rate and consumption rate reaction 3 and 6 in table 1 during hydroxylamine disproportionation is the proposed cause of hydrazine accumulation 3 1 5 hydrazine accumulation depends on the available substrates the wide range of combinations of added substrates used in this research showed that hydrazine accumulation is strongly impacted by the used substrate combination fig 2c specifically the accumulation of hydrazine was higher when ammonium was present while the presence of nitrite resulted in lower accumulations fig 2c previous research on hydrazine accumulation used only ammonium and hydroxylamine as substrate van der star et al 2008b this can also be explained by the imbalance of reactions 3 and 6 during hydroxylamine disproportionation for the hydrazine production during hydroxylamine disproportionation ammonium is consumed reaction 3 table 2 thus higher concentration of ammonium would favour hydrazine production contrarily hydrazine consumption results in ammonium production reaction 6 table 2 thus the presence of ammonium would result in this reaction being less thermodynamically favourable see section 3 1 6 on the other hand nitrite decreased the hydrazine peak fig 2c when nitrite and hydroxylamine are present as the only substrates nitrite is consumed with the ammonium that is being produced from either hydroxylamine or hydrazine disproportionation fig 1c thus nitrite presence decreases the final ammonium concentration favouring hydrazine consumption reaction 6 table 2 when both ammonium and nitrite were present together with hydroxylamine batches 10 11 and 12 fig 1d ammonium dominated the possible effect of nitrite leading to high hydrazine accumulations overall we showed that hydrazine accumulation occurs in the presence of hydroxylamine and the accumulation is promoted by ammonium and reduced by nitrite elucidating the role and occurrence of hydrazine accumulation in biological systems requires further full scale experimental confirmation as measurements of hydrazine during reactor operation remain rare hydrazine accumulation or leakage by anammox would be unfavourable from an energetic point of view as hydrazine transformation to n2 is one of the anammox electron sources see eq 3 however leakage of hydrazine can be a potential advantage for anammox against other direct competitors as hydrazine is toxic to other microbes of the nitrogen cycle such as nob yao et al 2013 further discussion on the thermodynamics of hydrazine accumulation and the putative enzymes involved can be found in sections 3 1 6 3 1 8 3 1 6 thermodynamics cannot explain hydrazine accumulation to identify any possible thermodynamic limitation underlying the observed hydrazine accumulation a thermodynamic analysis of the reactions involved table 2 was performed along concentration profiles during batch tests figs s8 and s9 all reactions involved in hydrazine and hydroxylamine disproportionation were thermodynamically favourable as they had a negative gibbs energy change of reaction δg0 r with the exception of the half reaction of ammonium conversion to hydrazine reaction 2 table 2 even after the correction for actual batch conditions hydrazine production from ammonium had a positive actual gibbs energy change of reaction δg1 r fig 3 a even if one of the half reactions was not thermodynamically favourable reaction 2 the overall hydrazine production reaction 3 had negative actual gibbs free energy however the hydrazine production step reaction 3 table 2 was close to the equilibrium and batch conditions strongly impacted its overall δg1 r fig 3b thus hydrazine production thermodynamics heavily depend on batch test conditions fig 3a and b conversely the reactions involved in hydrazine consumption were strongly favourable fig 3c consequently the thermodynamic analysis does not explain the observed accumulation of hydrazine a kinetic limitation or and enzymatic biological bottleneck impacting hydrazine consumption might be the explanation as also discussed in the previous section and as shown by the mathematical model fig s16 impact of batch conditions namely ph temperature ammonium and hydroxylamine concentration on the potential hydrazine conversions were also investigated fig s11 higher hydroxylamine and ammonium concentration fig s11a and b resulted in a more favourable hydrazine production in agreement with the experimental results fig 2c higher ph was also shown to make hydrazine production more thermodynamically favourable fig s11e whereas temperature had little impact over the tested range fig s11d in this perspective it is worth noting that the anammoxosome where hydrazine is being produced is more acidic than the cytoplasm van der star et al 2010 van niftrik et al 2004 thus making hydrazine production less thermodynamically favourable 3 1 7 thermodynamics suggest that no is an unlikely intermediate in hydroxylamine turnover the feasibility and potential occurrence of no as intermediate in the reactions involving hydroxylamine reactions 12 17 table 2 fig s10 was analysed based on thermodynamic characteristics of the conversions hydroxylamine is hypothesized to be first transformed to no and then no is transformed to the final product the estimated δg1 r for the transformation of no to hydrazine during batch tests was close to equilibrium i e could potentially become unfavourable positive depending on the conditions fig 3d reaction 12 table 2 as a result considering the previously discussed close to equilibrium reaction 3 i e hydroxylamine to no table 2 the transformation of hydroxylamine via no would have two intermediate steps close to thermodynamic equilibrium form a thermodynamic point of view the forward conversion is possible but highly depending on the exact batch test conditions the experimental evidence on the potential role of no as intermediate in the hydroxylamine conversion would still be needed ultimately it should also be noted that a better characterization of hydroxylamine standard gibbs energy of formation g f nh2oh value is needed for a definitive thermodynamic study in literature different values for g f of hydroxylamine can be found table s1 which profoundly impact the obtained results fig s12 3 1 8 hydroxylamine and hydrazine disproportionation can be explained by known enzymatic anammox conversions we hypothesize that disproportionation of hydroxylamine and hydrazine might be catalysed by multiple enzymes most of which are already characterized in anammox bacteria for instance hydrazine production reaction 3 in table 2 in hydroxylamine disproportionation could be catalysed by different combination of enzymes either with no as intermediate or not in hydroxylamine conversions i nh2oh is first transformed to no reaction 12 13 and overall 14 by hox then no and nh4 could be reduced to hydrazine reaction 2 by hzs see fig 4 ii alternatively anammox bacteria encode more than 10 anammox hao like proteins in the genome the function of some of them is still unknown thus it could be that one of the hao like proteins in ca kuenenia could perform a similar conversion as the hzs in ca brocadia oshiki et al 2016 thus the brocadia like hzs transforms directly hydroxylamine and ammonium to hydrazine and hdh funnels hydrazine into dinitrogen gas reaction 1 2 leading to the overall reaction 3 see fig 4 hydrazine consumption reaction 6 in hydroxylamine disproportionation could be a combination of a hao like protein reducing nh2oh to ammonium reaction 4 and the known activity of hdh reaction 5 see fig 4 hydrazine disproportionation reaction 10 would need hdh reaction 9 and a dedicated enzyme to produce ammonium from hydrazine reaction 8 an enzyme catalysing this last conversion has not been described yet in anammox from the overall enzymatic conversions proposed ammonium production from hydroxylamine and hydrazine have not been shown in anammox bacteria however ammonium producing activity from hydroxylamine has been hypothesized to exist based on metagenomic data from the anammox bacterium ca scalindua profunda van de vossenberg et al 2013 furthermore hydroxylamine conversion to ammonium has been shown in ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas kostera et al 2008 and enzymatic activity found in the dissimilatory nitrate reducing bacteria nautilia profundicola hanson et al 2013 it is hypothesized that there is an hao like enzyme with an ammonium producing activity from hydroxylamine nevertheless to further confirm this hypothesis transcriptomics and proteomics data would be valuable 3 1 9 kinetic modelling supports the potential impact of hydroxylamine on nitrite metabolism the estimation of the kinetic parameters for the discussed reactions is the prerequisite for their inclusion in mathematical models henze et al 2000 experimental parameter determination requires highly precise measurements methods and usually kinetic models are applied van loosdrecht et al 2016 the fact that hydroxylamine is consumed via two simultaneous reactions reactions 3 6 table 2 and the need of both of them to describe hydrazine accumulation makes the experimental determination of parameters impossible instead a step wise modelling approach using different optimization functions was used to assess if the available data set allows for parameter determination see si to this end the kinetic model proposed by van der star van der star et al 2008b was adapted to take into account the impact of ammonium table s3 the anammox stoichiometry was also introduced in the set of reactions to model the impact of hydroxylamine addition with ammonium and nitrite table s3 two independent optimizations were performed to determine the kinetic parameters of hydrazine consumption k3 and k3 n2h4 and anammox k4 k4 no2 and k4 nh4 independently of the used optimization function a single set of parameters was obtained fig s13a and d and s14a and d however when hydroxylamine was the only substrate the values obtained for the remaining kinetic parameters k1 k1 nh2oh k1 nh4 k2 k2 nh2oh k2 n2h4 depended on the objective function used figs s13b and s14b the set of parameter values k1 k1 nh2oh k1 nh4 k2 k2 nh2oh k2 n2h4 resulting in the lowest sum of squared errors was selected table 3 and used in subsequent optimizations next parameters obtained with control k4 k4 no2 and k4 nh4 hydrazine k3 and k3 n2h4 and hydroxylamine tests k1 k1 nh2oh k1 nh4 k2 k2 nh2oh k2 n2h4 were used to simulate tests where ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine were simultaneously provided without any extra optimization step the parameters previously obtained were not able to describe the experimental data specifically the depletion of nitrite was predicted to be faster by the model fig s15a suggesting a direct impact of hydroxylamine on the regular anammox metabolism of nitrite consumption consequently parameters affecting the nitrite consumption k4 k4 no2 and k4 nh4 were optimized using the experimental data when hydroxylamine was present while the other parameters were kept constant figs s13c s14c and s15b the optimization resulted in ca a 50 decrease in the specific maximum anammox rate constant k4 and 50 increase in the nitrite half saturation coefficient k4 no2 consistently with the experimental results these observations further support the strong impact of hydroxylamine on the nitrite consumption by anammox bacteria in literature the only available set of parameters for the reactions involving hydroxylamine van der star et al 2008b estimated a maximum rate constant k one order of magnitude smaller than the ones reported in the present study table 3 this could be explained by the use of granular biomass van der star et al 2008b instead of planktonic culture as done here part of the biomass in the granules could be inactive leading to an apparent slower rate moreover differences in the average growth rates between the two systems could also contribute to the differences in maximum rate constants 3 2 long term continuous exposure to hydroxylamine reduces the no3 production the long term effects of continuous exposure of anammox bacteria to hydroxylamine had not been studied yet to this end a planktonic culture of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was operated in continuous mode for more than 54 days fig 5 a fig s17 and table s4 after the initial 20 days of stabilization two operational phases can be distinguished i phase i with ammonium and nitrite days 20 37 table s4 ii phase ii with ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine days 38 54 table s4 to mimic the expected low hydroxylamine accumulation by aob in pn a processes a small hydroxylamine load ca 26 mg n l d compared to the nitrite load ca 478 mg n l d table s4 was chosen the addition of hydroxylamine did not impact the microbial community composition as revealed by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing fig 5b the relative abundance of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis remained stable at 79 4 during 2 complete srts with hydroxylamine feeding the genus ignavibacterium represented the most abundant side population during the whole operation these results indicate that simultaneous consumption of hydroxylamine ammonium and nitrite does not impact anammox bacteria and might even represent a competitive advantage in biofilm pn a systems against canonical nob often reported to be inhibited by hydroxylamine blackburne et al 2004 blackburne et al 2008 castignetti and gunner 1982 hao and chen 1994 noophan et al 2004 wang et al 2015 during the whole experiment hydrazine and hydroxylamine concentrations remained below detection limits fig s17c as soon as hydroxylamine was fed a statistically significant decrease p 0 001 mann whitney rank sum test in the nitrate production to ammonium consumption ratio was observed from 0 24 0 03 phase i to 0 17 0 01 mol no3 mol nh4 phase ii table s4 and fig 5a thus hydroxylamine reduced the formation of nitrate in the anammox conversion it is noteworthy that the response was immediate without any visible adaptation effect based on the anammox biochemistry presented in this study hydroxylamine can be metabolized via two pathways i nh2oh is converted to no and then further to n2 via the conventional anammox metabolism in eqs 1 3 or ii nh2oh is transformed via hydroxylamine disproportionation reactions forming nh4 and n2 as in the batch tests reaction 7 table 2 from nitrogen mass balances only the hydroxylamine pathway could not be resolved given the low hydroxylamine load compared to nitrite hydroxylamine disproportionation would have resulted in ca 8 mg n l d of extra ammonium such low concentrations would be masked by the high residual ammonium concentration in the reactor nevertheless in a study from van de graaf and colleagues van de graaf et al 1997 the addition of 15nh2oh together with unlabelled ammonium and nitrite lead to 30n2 production most likely resulting from the reaction of 15nh4 produced from hydroxylamine and 15nh2oh itself thus based on the latter study and the batch tests performed here hydroxylamine disproportionation is likely to be the dominant pathway recently anammox bacteria were also shown to grow on only no and ammonium with no nitrate production hu et al 2019 these results challenged the common assumption that nitrite oxidation to nitrate is needed to provide the electrons to reduce co2 for biomass synthesis instead the new hypothesis proposed that the high energy electrons produced during hydrazine conversion to n2 are more likely those used in anabolism hu et al 2019 similarly in the present study a clear decrease in nitrate production was observed with continuous hydroxylamine feeding independent of the pathway hydroxylamine conversion releases extra high energy content electrons reducing the need for nitrite oxidation to nitrate this study further extends our knowledge of the metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria demonstrating the simultaneous consumption of ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine by anammox bacteria furthermore the reactions involved in hydroxylamine metabolism were further characterized using batch tests this characterization resulted in the following findings i ammonium can be produced from either hydroxylamine or hydrazine and ii the co metabolization of other substrates impacts hydrazine accumulation in addition hydrazine accumulation was analysed from a kinetics and thermodynamics point of view further confirming that hydrazine accumulation is governed by the reactions involved in hydroxylamine disproportionation rather than inhibition of hydrazine dehydrogenase overall this work highlights the huge metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria this unique ability to use a broad range of substrates represents a clear competitive advantage likely underlying the ability of anammox to thrive in different environments for example hydroxylamine is known to be toxic for nob directly competing with anammox for nitrite castignetti and gunner 1982 stüven et al 1992 yang and alleman 1992 from an engineering point of view this kind of competitive advantage can be useful in systems like partial nitritation anammox where nob are not desired for example hydroxylamine external addition has been tested to obtain a successful partial nitritation anammox process in laboratory conditions wang et al 2015 finally the present work sets the basis to further understand hydroxylamine metabolism by anammox bacteria next steps could be directed to further confirm the pathway followed by hydroxylamine in continuous operation with either 15n labelling or increased loads doing similar experiments with other anammox bacteria species i e ca brocadia would also help to assess putative differences between anammox species metabolism comparative transcriptomic or proteomic data would provide more information in the enzymes involved in the process overall intermediates of the nitrogen cycle are overlooked and not studied in depth and could be a source for not recognized conversions or interactions in microbial communities understanding such interactions is crucial for improving its implementation as technology 4 conclusions the combination of batch tests continuous feeding thermodynamics analysis and modelling allowed to elucidate more details about the hydroxylamine metabolism of anammox bacteria ammonium can be produced from both hydroxylamine and hydrazine if only nitrite and hydroxylamine are available ammonium can be produced from hydroxylamine and used for nitrite consumption when hydroxylamine ammonium and nitrite are present together in anammox batch tests hydroxylamine and nitrite are consumed simultaneously with hydroxylamine consumption being faster than nitrite consumption hydrazine accumulation only occurs when hydroxylamine is present and seems to be due to a biological imbalance rather than a thermodynamic limitation or enzymatic inhibition the extent of hydrazine accumulation depends on the combination of substrates provided i e promoted by ammonium and reduced by nitrite anammox bacteria can grow simultaneously with ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine reducing the nitrate production anammox microbial population is not impacted by long term feeding of hydroxylamine hydroxylamine if available in the environment might play an important yet overlooked role in the metabolism of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis declaration of

17719,hydroxylamine is a key intermediate in several biological reactions of the global nitrogen cycle however the role of hydroxylamine in anammox is still not fully understood in this work the impact of hydroxylamine also in combination with other substrates on the metabolism of a planktonic enrichment culture of the anammox species ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was studied anammox bacteria were observed to produce ammonium both from hydroxylamine and hydrazine and hydroxylamine was consumed simultaneously with nitrite hydrazine accumulation signature for the presence of anammox bacteria strongly depended on the available substrates being higher with ammonium and lower with nitrite furthermore the results presented here indicate that hydrazine accumulation is not the result of the inhibition of hydrazine dehydrogenase as commonly assumed but the product of hydroxylamine disproportionation all kinetic parameters for the identified reactions were estimated by mathematical modelling moreover the simultaneous consumption and growth on ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine of anammox bacteria was demonstrated this was accompanied by a reduction in the nitrate production ultimately this study advances the fundamental understanding of the metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria and highlights the potential role played by metabolic intermediates i e hydroxylamine hydrazine in shaping natural and engineered microbial communities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox intermediate disproportionation hydrazine nitrate 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox were first reported in the 90s in a wastewater treatment plant mulder et al 1995 anammox bacteria autotrophically oxidize ammonium to dinitrogen gas with nitrite as electron acceptor jetten et al 1998 before their discovery even if predicted thermodynamically ammonium activation in absence of oxygen had never been identified in nature broda 1977 since then significant efforts focused on understanding the central metabolism of anammox bacteria e g kartal et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016 strous et al 1998 van de graaf et al 1997 initially hydroxylamine was hypothesized to be an obligate intermediate of anammox catabolism and hydrazine was shown to accumulate when hydroxylamine was added in anammox cultures van de graaf et al 1997 more recently no was proposed to be the actual intermediate in the catabolic pathway kartal et al 2011 the current working hypothesis for the anammox metabolism involves three reactions first nitrite is converted to no eq 1 via a nitric reductase nir enzyme then no is used to activate nh4 and form the n n bond needed to produce hydrazine n2h4 eq 2 catalysed by hydrazine synthase hzs finally hydrazine is further converted to dinitrogen gas eq 3 by hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh 1 n o 2 2 h e n o h 2 o 2 n o n h 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e however even with no as the central intermediate hydroxylamine seems to play a key yet elusive role in anammox metabolism for example ca brocadia spp strains do not encode for a nir enzyme oshiki et al 2015 thus either ca brocadia spp have hydroxylamine as central intermediate as proposed by oshiki and coworkers oshiki et al 2016 or another enzyme like kustc0458 rather than nir is converting nitrite to no hu et al 2019 moreover different studies showed that one of the most highly expressed enzyme in anammox bacteria is the hydroxylamine oxidase hox kustc1601 which is proposed to convert hydroxylamine to no hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 the reason for anammox bacteria to invest energy to express hox at such high levels has been hypothesized to be the possibility to reuse any hydroxylamine leaking from hzs dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 briefly the actual reaction mechanisms of hzs is proposed to involve no transformation to hydroxylamine and ammonium and hydroxylamine reacting to form hydrazine dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 overall the role of hydroxylamine in anammox metabolism remains poorly understood in the environment where anammox bacteria thrive free hydroxylamine has been measured hu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 poot et al 2016 soler jofra et al 2018 stüven et al 1992 su et al 2019 terada et al 2017 yang and alleman 1992 yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2010 yu et al 2018 for instance hydroxylamine has been shown to transiently accumulate in concentrations ranging from 0 006 1 mg n l in different ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob pure cultures liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2010 yu et al 2018 or mixed consortia hu et al 2017 poot et al 2016 soler jofra et al 2018 su et al 2019 terada et al 2017 yang and alleman 1992 thus anammox exposure to external hydroxylamine cannot be ruled out in particular in biofilm systems where hydroxylamine can be produced by a nitrifying population and can reach higher concentrations than in the bulk liquid sabba et al 2015 in these systems hydroxylamine can be produced in the external oxic layers where aob are present diffuse through the biofilm and reach the anoxic anammox bacteria layers sabba et al 2015 batch tests with hydroxylamine addition are generally used to study the short term effects of hydroxylamine on anammox bacteria primarily to i demonstrate anammox activity egli et al 2001 jetten et al 1998 and ii study the boosting effect of intermediates on anammox activity hu et al 2011 zekker et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge the effect of different substrate combinations on anammox hydroxylamine consumption has not been dedicatedly studied the only in depth study on the effect of hydroxylamine on anammox metabolism used ammonium as sole co substrate van der star et al 2008b in the present work the impact of different combinations of substrates together with hydroxylamine on a planktonic anammox ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis culture in batch tests was studied also the long term impacts of hydroxylamine addition were studied and the effects on stoichiometry and microbial composition were quantified finally a thermodynamic and modelling approach was developed to estimate the key kinetic parameters and further understand the anammox metabolism with hydroxylamine as co substrate 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch test preparation and procedure biomass was collected from a 10l mbr highly enriched in planktonic ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis 79 4 as estimated by 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing analysis see supplementary information si and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4200 rpm at room temperature cells were re suspended in n2 sparged mineral medium to the desired biomass concentration the mineral medium had the same composition as described in si but without ammonium or nitrite and supplemented with 1g l nahco3 the ph and optical density at 660nm od660 were measured before aliquoting 50ml of cell suspension among 112 ml serum bottles the optical density was correlated with gvss l fig s1 biomass used in negative controls was boiled for 5 minutes before aliquoting the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and anoxic conditions were achieved by sparging ca 1 minute and vacuuming ca 3 minutes with argon three times per bottle bottles were placed on a shaker incubator hood th30 edmund bühler gmbh bodelshausen germany at 30 c and 170 rpm the ph was not adjusted but remained between 8 0 and 8 5 within the optimal range for anammox bacteria kartal et al 2012 bottles were incubated overnight with stoichiometric concentrations of ammonium and nitrite to ensure activity after overnight incubation the experiment was performed by adding a pulse of ammonium nitrite hydroxylamine and or hydrazine from anoxic stock solutions to reach the desired initial concentration in each batch test see table 1 sampling was done over time depending on the biomass activity by removing 4 ml of cell suspension with a syringe samples were centrifuged for 3 5 minutes 4200 rpm 4 c and the supernatant was kept for further analysis of the dissolved nitrogen compounds see si samples used for hydrazine watt and chrisp 1952 and hydroxylamine frear and burrell 1955 determination were treated with 200 µl of a 0 1 g ml sulfamic acid solution to remove the dissolved nitrite nitrite was previously shown to interfere in the hydroxylamine determination soler jofra et al 2016 in the present study nitrite was also shown to interfere the hydrazine measurement see fig s2 nitrogen consumption production rates calculations are described in si microbial community dynamics were not followed during the batch tests but they would not be expected to shift significantly as no significant changes were observed during long term hydroxylamine feeding in a continuous reactor see section 3 2 2 2 batch tests thermodynamic analysis based on the batch test data the thermodynamics of the putative reactions involved in hydroxylamine consumption were studied see table 2 reactions 3 6 7 10 and 11 were originally postulated by van der star van der star et al 2008b half reactions were derived based on n o h and charge balances see example in si based on kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 the standard gibbs energy change δgo r of each reaction in table 2 was calculated with the standard gibbs energy of formation g f of each compound table s1 and eq s1 δgo r was corrected with the measured concentration of each compound at each batch test time point to obtain the actual gibbs energy change of reaction δg1 r evolution during the batch tests eq s2 and s3 the aim was to detect any possible thermodynamics limitations to explain the hydrazine accumulation behaviour or the possibility to have no as intermediate in reactions involving hydroxylamine the approach calculations and results are detailed in si 2 3 batch tests kinetic parameters determination a kinetic model table s2 and s3 was proposed and adapted from van der star van der star et al 2008b to obtain the kinetic parameters of the reactions involved in the batch tests the model was implemented in matlab r2018b and aimed to minimize the error between the experimental data and the set of differential equations proposed for each compound as the experiments were performed in batch the set of differential equations were equal to the results of a matrix multiplication between the proposed stoichiometric matrix and the process rate matrix table s2 and s3 respectively a step wise approach to obtain the kinetic constants from more simple to more complex batch tests was followed fig s3 this was combined with the use of different objective functions eqs s4 s7 to assess if the solution of the optimization performed was independent of the objective function used full description of the procedure is detailed in si 2 4 reactor operation continuous long term study one litre of biomass from the same 10l mbr used in batch tests and described in si was used as inoculum for a 2l mbr reactor fig s4 the hrt was kept at 2 3 0 2 d during the whole operation using a custom made ultrafiltration membrane unit van der star et al 2008a an srt of 8 7 1 0 d was maintained throughout the operation period by withdrawing the desired reactor content per day temperature was controlled at 30 c with an external jacket and the reactor was stirred at 170rpm the reactor ph was controlled at 7 04 0 04 with a 53g l nahco3 solution when hydroxylamine was continuously fed phase ii days 38 54 in table s4 two bottles were used to avoid hydroxylamine reaction with any of the mineral medium components the total volumetric mineral medium loads were maintained by correcting media preparation samples were collected daily from the effluent line and centrifuged supernatant was collected for further analysis of the dissolved nitrogen compounds see si and treated with sulfamic acid if needed the biomass pellets were kept at 80 c a fresh sample from the reactor was used to monitor daily optical density during reactor operation volatile suspended solids vss were measured periodically and the specific correlation between od660 and vss was used for calculations fig s5 dna samples from days 23 33 38 40 45 50 and 55 were analysed at novogen for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing see si 3 results discussion 3 1 short term anammox metabolism with hydroxylamine as substrate anammox bacteria primarily convert ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas yet are also capable to metabolize other substrates such as hydroxylamine hydrazine and organic carbon jetten et al 1998 in biofilm systems hydroxylamine can leak from aob communities liu et al 2017 su et al 2019 yang and alleman 1992 diffuse through the biofilm sabba et al 2015 and reach anammox bacteria in anoxic layers batch tests to evaluate the capacity of anammox bacteria to metabolize hydroxylamine were performed by supplying hydroxylamine together with different combination of substrates to a ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis enrichment the aim was to investigate if different combination of substrates impacted the conversion dynamics of the nitrogen species hydroxylamine concentrations used in batch are higher than those to which anammox bacteria might be exposed in nature i e values of 0 006 1 mg n l hydroxylamine have been reported in different nitrification systems liu et al 2017 su et al 2019 yang and alleman 1992 among others but were needed to be able to investigate the conversions trends in nitrogen compounds consumption and production were independent of the initial concentrations table 1 therefore only tests with higher initial concentrations are discussed here fig 1 unless differently stated fig s6 the impact of substrate combinations on hydroxylamine metabolism will be discussed in the present section whereas the impact on hydrazine accumulation will be discussed further in the next section positive controls to assess anammox activity with ammonium and nitrite fig s7a were included data from the positive controls indicated that once nitrite was consumed no significant changes in the ammonium concentrations were detected denitrifying activity was ruled out by providing nitrite as substrate fig s7d to the anammox enrichment culture abiotic controls with boiled biomass and all the substrates used in the batch test were performed and did not show significant activity compared to the biological rates for example an increase of ca 0 1 mg n l of ammonium was detected in the abiotic control after ca 7h fig s7c and e compared to 5 mg n l of ammonium produced in 2h in biological tests fig 1a 3 1 1 ammonium production occurs from both hydroxylamine and hydrazine when hydroxylamine was added as the only substrate batches 2 5 table 1 hydrazine did accumulate as expected from previous studies van de graaf et al 1997 van der star et al 2010 however two distinct ammonium production events occurred fig 1a and fig s6 the first ammonium production started as soon as hydroxylamine was added ca 0 2 4h in fig 1a see also fig s6 when the hydroxylamine concentration became low hydrazine started to accumulate around 1 6h in fig 1a after ca 15 25min in fig s6 with lower initial hydroxylamine concentration once hydroxylamine was depleted a second ammonium production period started correlating with the decrease of hydrazine from ca 2 4h onwards in fig 1a see also fig s6 thus ammonium was produced both with hydroxylamine and hydrazine fig 1a apparently with preference for utilization of hydroxylamine over hydrazine fig s7b the initial production of ammonium from hydroxylamine is in accordance with the hydroxylamine disproportionation reactions reaction 7 table 2 proposed by van de star et al van der star et al 2008b hydroxylamine disproportionation occurs via two intermediate reactions reaction 3 and 6 in table 2 the imbalance of reactions 3 and 6 resulted in the observed hydrazine accumulation see section 3 1 4 for further details the experimental stoichiometric ratio of consumed hydroxylamine per ammonium produced was 3 8 mol mol which is quite close to the theoretically expected of 3 for hydroxylamine disproportionation reaction 7 in table 2 the second ammonium production from hydrazine was not observed by van der star et al van der star et al 2008b most likely obscured by the high initial ammonium concentration used in the tests 2 8 mm 28 112 mg n l the consumption of hydrazine was proposed to follow two possible reactions reaction 10 or 11 table 2 van der star et al 2008b in the present study once hydroxylamine was totally consumed ca 1 4 mm of ammonium were produced per mm of hydrazine consumed close to the 1 3 theoretical ratio of hydrazine disproportionation via reaction 10 in table 1 fig 1a furthermore hydrazine disproportionation via reaction 10 was confirmed by performing a batch test with hydrazine as the only substrate fig 1b batch 7 in table 1 1 2 mm mole of ammonium were produced per mm of hydrazine which is in agreement with the proposed stoichiometry of hydrazine disproportionation reaction 10 table 2 producing 1 3 moles of ammonium per mol of hydrazine similar stoichiometries for ammonium produced per hydrazine consumed were previously shown in a batch test performed with only hydrazine present but no mechanisms were proposed van de graaf et al 1997 based on the experimental stoichiometry the production of ammonium from hydrazine is most likely to result from hydrazine disproportionation as in reaction 10 table 2 see also fig 4 and section 3 1 8 for a discussion on putative enzymes involved the occurrence of hydrazine disproportionation throughout the batch test contributed to the ammonium production when hydroxylamine is still present multiple confirmations were obtained from the experimental data sets and the mathematical model for instance when hydroxylamine and hydrazine were provided together as substrates both were consumed simultaneously batch 13 in table 1 and fig s7b hydroxylamine was initially consumed c a 2 5 times faster than hydrazine 60 4 and 24 2 mg n gvss h respectively and a transient slow down on hydrazine consumption could be observed furthermore the proposed mathematical model with the parameters obtained see section 3 1 9 for further details was used to compute the rates of reaction 3 6 and 7 during a batch tests with hydroxylamine as substrate the simulations indicate that hydrazine disproportionation is occurring throughout the batch test even if at one order of magnitude lower rate than hydroxylamine disproportionation see fig s16 overall two ammonium production events were observed in the same batch test with only hydroxylamine as substrate test 2 to 4 in table 1 when hydroxylamine is present hydroxylamine disproportionation to ammonium and dinitrogen gas via reaction 7 is the dominant process table 2 with hydrazine disproportionation taking place at one order of magnitude lower rate see fig s16 once hydroxylamine is consumed the accumulated hydrazine is disproportionated to ammonium and dinitrogen gas via reaction 10 table 2 3 1 2 ammonium produced from hydroxylamine and hydrazine is used to consume nitrite to further analyse the ammonium production capacity of anammox bacteria from either hydroxylamine or hydrazine batch tests 8 and 9 table 1 were performed hydroxylamine and nitrite were dosed simultaneously to assess if the ammonium production capacity from hydroxylamine and hydrazine could support nitrite consumption as expected the ammonium produced from hydroxylamine was used to consume nitrite fig 1c a slight transient accumulation of hydrazine and ammonium was measured nitrite consumption stopped as soon as all the ammonium produced from hydroxylamine and hydrazine was consumed fig 1c or fig s7f furthermore the ca 20 mg n l hydroxylamine consumed via the disproportionation reaction reaction 7 table 1 would lead to ca 6 6 mg n l nh4 which could be consumed via normal anammox metabolism if we assume a stoichiometry close to that reported by lotti et al lotti et al 2014 of 1 146 mol no2 mol nh4 a maximum consumption of 7 6 mg n l nitrite could be converted which is close to the experimentally observed of 6 4 mg n l of nitrite consumed these observations together with the fact that in the rest of tests except tests 10 12 in table 1 that also had nitrite ammonium accumulated instead of being consumed confirmed that the substrate consumed together with nitrite was ammonium the transient accumulation of ammonium with nitrite was shown by hu and coworkers hu et al 2011 however no hydrazine accumulation was described in those tests also the hydroxylamine conversion slowed down with time maybe due to the higher concentrations used in their tests these results further expand the metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria if hydroxylamine is present with nitrite only i e without nh4 anammox bacteria can generate ammonium from hydroxylamine and consume nitrite via the canonical anammox conversion these results show a potential role of hydroxylamine in ca kuenenia stuttgartinesis metabolism in contrast to the prior unique implication of hydroxylamine in ca brocadia sinica oshiki et al 2016 this situation might occur in partial nitritation anammox pn a systems when ammonium is fully depleted while residual low concentrations of hydroxylamine might be still present e g in biofilms due to gradients between microcolonies 3 1 3 hydroxylamine is consumed simultaneously with nitrite but faster batch tests were performed to assess the impact of hydroxylamine when both nitrite and ammonium were present batches 10 11 12 table 1 this substrates combination is likely to occur in pn a biofilms although hydroxylamine concentrations might be lower than those used here hydroxylamine was consumed simultaneously with nitrite fig 1d the specific hydroxylamine consumption rate qnh2oh was 1 6 to 5 times higher than that of nitrite qno2 depending on the initial hydroxylamine concentration as soon as all hydroxylamine was depleted a 50 increase of nitrite consumption rate was measured table 1 interestingly even after hydroxylamine depletion nitrite consumption rates remained lower than the maximal rate measured in positive controls performed with nitrite and ammonium usual anammox substrates batch 1 table 1 thus these results suggest that hydroxylamine is consumed simultaneously with nitrite but faster than nitrite hydroxylamine presence together with nitrite and ammonium had a putative toxic or partially irreversible effect on nitrite consumption rates as when hydroxylamine was fully consumed nitrite consumption rates did not reach the levels of the positive controls within the range of concentrations tested the hydroxylamine consumption rate linearly depended on the initial hydroxylamine concentration fig 2 a and was not affected by the combination of available substrates the linear consumption of hydroxylamine observed is consistent with previously reported measurements with ammonium only van der star et al 2008b in biological systems monod like kinetics are usually observed for substrates consumption for monod kinetics to be linear the substrate concentration has to be smaller than the half saturation coefficient thus in the present study the hydroxylamine half saturation constant would then be unexpectedly high for suspended cells ca 22 mg n nh2oh l fig 2a as for example the half saturation constant for nitrite in a similar culture was 35 µg n l lotti et al 2014 another putative explanation for the observed linearity is the passive transport of hydroxylamine over the membrane hydroxylamine has a pka of 5 9 at 25 c haynes 2014 thus it is mostly unprotonated under the tested conditions ph 8 and 30 c in the batch tests as a result passive diffusion through the membrane strictly depending on the difference between the bulk and cell concentration of the substrate is likely alberts et al 2007 ultimately the presented results further expand the known metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria hydroxylamine and hydrazine disproportionation were proven to occur simultaneously and if available hydroxylamine was shown to be consumed simultaneously and faster than nitrite as substrate 3 1 4 hydroxylamine disproportionation controls hydrazine accumulation to date hydrazine accumulation has only been reported in the presence of hydroxylamine e g jetten et al 1998 kartal et al 2011 van de graaf et al 1997 however hydrazine is not usually analysed in anammox systems thus its actual concentration is unknown to understand the mechanisms underlying hydrazine turnover hydrazine concentration was measured during all batch tests table 1 hydrazine transiently accumulated when hydroxylamine was added as substrate batches 2 6 and 8 12 in table 1 and the time of the hydrazine peak depended on the initial specific hydroxylamine concentration mg n gvss fig 2b consistently with van der star van der star et al 2008b hydrazine transient accumulation can be explained with hydrazine disproportionation reaction 7 table 2 the disproportionation is the addition of two reactions reactions 3 and 6 table 2 hydrazine starts accumulating when hydroxylamine concentration is low ca 5 mg n l in fig 1a hydroxylamine concentration affects both hydrazine production reaction 3 table 2 and hydrazine consumption reaction 6 table 2 but two moles of hydroxylamine are needed for hydrazine consumption as opposed to one mole needed for its production thus a lower concentration of hydroxylamine decreases the hydrazine consumption rate more than the hydrazine production rate leading to transient hydrazine accumulation this was further supported by the mathematical model fig s16 the hydrazine consumption rate via reaction 6 in table 2 is always lower than the hydrazine production rate via reaction 3 in table 2 resulting in hydrazine accumulation originally the accumulation of hydrazine upon addition of hydroxylamine was ascribed to the inhibition of hdh the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hydrazine to dinitrogen gas this hypothesis was based on the observed in vitro inhibition of hdh by no and hydroxylamine maalcke et al 2016 van de graaf et al 1997 however our results show that hdh inhibition cannot be the explanation of hydrazine accumulation as hydrazine did not accumulate directly after hydroxylamine addition at high initial hydroxylamine concentrations ca 20 mg n l fig 1a instead the hydrazine peak occurred after the consumption of more than ca 15 mg n l of hydroxylamine when hydroxylamine concentration was 5 mg n l this delay was also observed by van der star et al van der star et al 2008b who initially proposed that hdh inhibition could not be the cause for hydrazine accumulation this is contradictory with the results of maalcke et al maalcke et al 2016 that showed that hdh was inhibited by no and hydroxylamine in vitro similarly hu and co workers did not observe any sign of hdh inhibition when no was fed continuously to an anammox culture hu et al 2019 overall the hdh inhibition by hydroxylamine and no demonstrated in vitro maalcke et al 2016 was not observed to occur in vivo meaning another process underlies the hydrazine accumulation instead the imbalance of the hydrazine production rate and consumption rate reaction 3 and 6 in table 1 during hydroxylamine disproportionation is the proposed cause of hydrazine accumulation 3 1 5 hydrazine accumulation depends on the available substrates the wide range of combinations of added substrates used in this research showed that hydrazine accumulation is strongly impacted by the used substrate combination fig 2c specifically the accumulation of hydrazine was higher when ammonium was present while the presence of nitrite resulted in lower accumulations fig 2c previous research on hydrazine accumulation used only ammonium and hydroxylamine as substrate van der star et al 2008b this can also be explained by the imbalance of reactions 3 and 6 during hydroxylamine disproportionation for the hydrazine production during hydroxylamine disproportionation ammonium is consumed reaction 3 table 2 thus higher concentration of ammonium would favour hydrazine production contrarily hydrazine consumption results in ammonium production reaction 6 table 2 thus the presence of ammonium would result in this reaction being less thermodynamically favourable see section 3 1 6 on the other hand nitrite decreased the hydrazine peak fig 2c when nitrite and hydroxylamine are present as the only substrates nitrite is consumed with the ammonium that is being produced from either hydroxylamine or hydrazine disproportionation fig 1c thus nitrite presence decreases the final ammonium concentration favouring hydrazine consumption reaction 6 table 2 when both ammonium and nitrite were present together with hydroxylamine batches 10 11 and 12 fig 1d ammonium dominated the possible effect of nitrite leading to high hydrazine accumulations overall we showed that hydrazine accumulation occurs in the presence of hydroxylamine and the accumulation is promoted by ammonium and reduced by nitrite elucidating the role and occurrence of hydrazine accumulation in biological systems requires further full scale experimental confirmation as measurements of hydrazine during reactor operation remain rare hydrazine accumulation or leakage by anammox would be unfavourable from an energetic point of view as hydrazine transformation to n2 is one of the anammox electron sources see eq 3 however leakage of hydrazine can be a potential advantage for anammox against other direct competitors as hydrazine is toxic to other microbes of the nitrogen cycle such as nob yao et al 2013 further discussion on the thermodynamics of hydrazine accumulation and the putative enzymes involved can be found in sections 3 1 6 3 1 8 3 1 6 thermodynamics cannot explain hydrazine accumulation to identify any possible thermodynamic limitation underlying the observed hydrazine accumulation a thermodynamic analysis of the reactions involved table 2 was performed along concentration profiles during batch tests figs s8 and s9 all reactions involved in hydrazine and hydroxylamine disproportionation were thermodynamically favourable as they had a negative gibbs energy change of reaction δg0 r with the exception of the half reaction of ammonium conversion to hydrazine reaction 2 table 2 even after the correction for actual batch conditions hydrazine production from ammonium had a positive actual gibbs energy change of reaction δg1 r fig 3 a even if one of the half reactions was not thermodynamically favourable reaction 2 the overall hydrazine production reaction 3 had negative actual gibbs free energy however the hydrazine production step reaction 3 table 2 was close to the equilibrium and batch conditions strongly impacted its overall δg1 r fig 3b thus hydrazine production thermodynamics heavily depend on batch test conditions fig 3a and b conversely the reactions involved in hydrazine consumption were strongly favourable fig 3c consequently the thermodynamic analysis does not explain the observed accumulation of hydrazine a kinetic limitation or and enzymatic biological bottleneck impacting hydrazine consumption might be the explanation as also discussed in the previous section and as shown by the mathematical model fig s16 impact of batch conditions namely ph temperature ammonium and hydroxylamine concentration on the potential hydrazine conversions were also investigated fig s11 higher hydroxylamine and ammonium concentration fig s11a and b resulted in a more favourable hydrazine production in agreement with the experimental results fig 2c higher ph was also shown to make hydrazine production more thermodynamically favourable fig s11e whereas temperature had little impact over the tested range fig s11d in this perspective it is worth noting that the anammoxosome where hydrazine is being produced is more acidic than the cytoplasm van der star et al 2010 van niftrik et al 2004 thus making hydrazine production less thermodynamically favourable 3 1 7 thermodynamics suggest that no is an unlikely intermediate in hydroxylamine turnover the feasibility and potential occurrence of no as intermediate in the reactions involving hydroxylamine reactions 12 17 table 2 fig s10 was analysed based on thermodynamic characteristics of the conversions hydroxylamine is hypothesized to be first transformed to no and then no is transformed to the final product the estimated δg1 r for the transformation of no to hydrazine during batch tests was close to equilibrium i e could potentially become unfavourable positive depending on the conditions fig 3d reaction 12 table 2 as a result considering the previously discussed close to equilibrium reaction 3 i e hydroxylamine to no table 2 the transformation of hydroxylamine via no would have two intermediate steps close to thermodynamic equilibrium form a thermodynamic point of view the forward conversion is possible but highly depending on the exact batch test conditions the experimental evidence on the potential role of no as intermediate in the hydroxylamine conversion would still be needed ultimately it should also be noted that a better characterization of hydroxylamine standard gibbs energy of formation g f nh2oh value is needed for a definitive thermodynamic study in literature different values for g f of hydroxylamine can be found table s1 which profoundly impact the obtained results fig s12 3 1 8 hydroxylamine and hydrazine disproportionation can be explained by known enzymatic anammox conversions we hypothesize that disproportionation of hydroxylamine and hydrazine might be catalysed by multiple enzymes most of which are already characterized in anammox bacteria for instance hydrazine production reaction 3 in table 2 in hydroxylamine disproportionation could be catalysed by different combination of enzymes either with no as intermediate or not in hydroxylamine conversions i nh2oh is first transformed to no reaction 12 13 and overall 14 by hox then no and nh4 could be reduced to hydrazine reaction 2 by hzs see fig 4 ii alternatively anammox bacteria encode more than 10 anammox hao like proteins in the genome the function of some of them is still unknown thus it could be that one of the hao like proteins in ca kuenenia could perform a similar conversion as the hzs in ca brocadia oshiki et al 2016 thus the brocadia like hzs transforms directly hydroxylamine and ammonium to hydrazine and hdh funnels hydrazine into dinitrogen gas reaction 1 2 leading to the overall reaction 3 see fig 4 hydrazine consumption reaction 6 in hydroxylamine disproportionation could be a combination of a hao like protein reducing nh2oh to ammonium reaction 4 and the known activity of hdh reaction 5 see fig 4 hydrazine disproportionation reaction 10 would need hdh reaction 9 and a dedicated enzyme to produce ammonium from hydrazine reaction 8 an enzyme catalysing this last conversion has not been described yet in anammox from the overall enzymatic conversions proposed ammonium production from hydroxylamine and hydrazine have not been shown in anammox bacteria however ammonium producing activity from hydroxylamine has been hypothesized to exist based on metagenomic data from the anammox bacterium ca scalindua profunda van de vossenberg et al 2013 furthermore hydroxylamine conversion to ammonium has been shown in ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas kostera et al 2008 and enzymatic activity found in the dissimilatory nitrate reducing bacteria nautilia profundicola hanson et al 2013 it is hypothesized that there is an hao like enzyme with an ammonium producing activity from hydroxylamine nevertheless to further confirm this hypothesis transcriptomics and proteomics data would be valuable 3 1 9 kinetic modelling supports the potential impact of hydroxylamine on nitrite metabolism the estimation of the kinetic parameters for the discussed reactions is the prerequisite for their inclusion in mathematical models henze et al 2000 experimental parameter determination requires highly precise measurements methods and usually kinetic models are applied van loosdrecht et al 2016 the fact that hydroxylamine is consumed via two simultaneous reactions reactions 3 6 table 2 and the need of both of them to describe hydrazine accumulation makes the experimental determination of parameters impossible instead a step wise modelling approach using different optimization functions was used to assess if the available data set allows for parameter determination see si to this end the kinetic model proposed by van der star van der star et al 2008b was adapted to take into account the impact of ammonium table s3 the anammox stoichiometry was also introduced in the set of reactions to model the impact of hydroxylamine addition with ammonium and nitrite table s3 two independent optimizations were performed to determine the kinetic parameters of hydrazine consumption k3 and k3 n2h4 and anammox k4 k4 no2 and k4 nh4 independently of the used optimization function a single set of parameters was obtained fig s13a and d and s14a and d however when hydroxylamine was the only substrate the values obtained for the remaining kinetic parameters k1 k1 nh2oh k1 nh4 k2 k2 nh2oh k2 n2h4 depended on the objective function used figs s13b and s14b the set of parameter values k1 k1 nh2oh k1 nh4 k2 k2 nh2oh k2 n2h4 resulting in the lowest sum of squared errors was selected table 3 and used in subsequent optimizations next parameters obtained with control k4 k4 no2 and k4 nh4 hydrazine k3 and k3 n2h4 and hydroxylamine tests k1 k1 nh2oh k1 nh4 k2 k2 nh2oh k2 n2h4 were used to simulate tests where ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine were simultaneously provided without any extra optimization step the parameters previously obtained were not able to describe the experimental data specifically the depletion of nitrite was predicted to be faster by the model fig s15a suggesting a direct impact of hydroxylamine on the regular anammox metabolism of nitrite consumption consequently parameters affecting the nitrite consumption k4 k4 no2 and k4 nh4 were optimized using the experimental data when hydroxylamine was present while the other parameters were kept constant figs s13c s14c and s15b the optimization resulted in ca a 50 decrease in the specific maximum anammox rate constant k4 and 50 increase in the nitrite half saturation coefficient k4 no2 consistently with the experimental results these observations further support the strong impact of hydroxylamine on the nitrite consumption by anammox bacteria in literature the only available set of parameters for the reactions involving hydroxylamine van der star et al 2008b estimated a maximum rate constant k one order of magnitude smaller than the ones reported in the present study table 3 this could be explained by the use of granular biomass van der star et al 2008b instead of planktonic culture as done here part of the biomass in the granules could be inactive leading to an apparent slower rate moreover differences in the average growth rates between the two systems could also contribute to the differences in maximum rate constants 3 2 long term continuous exposure to hydroxylamine reduces the no3 production the long term effects of continuous exposure of anammox bacteria to hydroxylamine had not been studied yet to this end a planktonic culture of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was operated in continuous mode for more than 54 days fig 5 a fig s17 and table s4 after the initial 20 days of stabilization two operational phases can be distinguished i phase i with ammonium and nitrite days 20 37 table s4 ii phase ii with ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine days 38 54 table s4 to mimic the expected low hydroxylamine accumulation by aob in pn a processes a small hydroxylamine load ca 26 mg n l d compared to the nitrite load ca 478 mg n l d table s4 was chosen the addition of hydroxylamine did not impact the microbial community composition as revealed by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing fig 5b the relative abundance of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis remained stable at 79 4 during 2 complete srts with hydroxylamine feeding the genus ignavibacterium represented the most abundant side population during the whole operation these results indicate that simultaneous consumption of hydroxylamine ammonium and nitrite does not impact anammox bacteria and might even represent a competitive advantage in biofilm pn a systems against canonical nob often reported to be inhibited by hydroxylamine blackburne et al 2004 blackburne et al 2008 castignetti and gunner 1982 hao and chen 1994 noophan et al 2004 wang et al 2015 during the whole experiment hydrazine and hydroxylamine concentrations remained below detection limits fig s17c as soon as hydroxylamine was fed a statistically significant decrease p 0 001 mann whitney rank sum test in the nitrate production to ammonium consumption ratio was observed from 0 24 0 03 phase i to 0 17 0 01 mol no3 mol nh4 phase ii table s4 and fig 5a thus hydroxylamine reduced the formation of nitrate in the anammox conversion it is noteworthy that the response was immediate without any visible adaptation effect based on the anammox biochemistry presented in this study hydroxylamine can be metabolized via two pathways i nh2oh is converted to no and then further to n2 via the conventional anammox metabolism in eqs 1 3 or ii nh2oh is transformed via hydroxylamine disproportionation reactions forming nh4 and n2 as in the batch tests reaction 7 table 2 from nitrogen mass balances only the hydroxylamine pathway could not be resolved given the low hydroxylamine load compared to nitrite hydroxylamine disproportionation would have resulted in ca 8 mg n l d of extra ammonium such low concentrations would be masked by the high residual ammonium concentration in the reactor nevertheless in a study from van de graaf and colleagues van de graaf et al 1997 the addition of 15nh2oh together with unlabelled ammonium and nitrite lead to 30n2 production most likely resulting from the reaction of 15nh4 produced from hydroxylamine and 15nh2oh itself thus based on the latter study and the batch tests performed here hydroxylamine disproportionation is likely to be the dominant pathway recently anammox bacteria were also shown to grow on only no and ammonium with no nitrate production hu et al 2019 these results challenged the common assumption that nitrite oxidation to nitrate is needed to provide the electrons to reduce co2 for biomass synthesis instead the new hypothesis proposed that the high energy electrons produced during hydrazine conversion to n2 are more likely those used in anabolism hu et al 2019 similarly in the present study a clear decrease in nitrate production was observed with continuous hydroxylamine feeding independent of the pathway hydroxylamine conversion releases extra high energy content electrons reducing the need for nitrite oxidation to nitrate this study further extends our knowledge of the metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria demonstrating the simultaneous consumption of ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine by anammox bacteria furthermore the reactions involved in hydroxylamine metabolism were further characterized using batch tests this characterization resulted in the following findings i ammonium can be produced from either hydroxylamine or hydrazine and ii the co metabolization of other substrates impacts hydrazine accumulation in addition hydrazine accumulation was analysed from a kinetics and thermodynamics point of view further confirming that hydrazine accumulation is governed by the reactions involved in hydroxylamine disproportionation rather than inhibition of hydrazine dehydrogenase overall this work highlights the huge metabolic versatility of anammox bacteria this unique ability to use a broad range of substrates represents a clear competitive advantage likely underlying the ability of anammox to thrive in different environments for example hydroxylamine is known to be toxic for nob directly competing with anammox for nitrite castignetti and gunner 1982 stüven et al 1992 yang and alleman 1992 from an engineering point of view this kind of competitive advantage can be useful in systems like partial nitritation anammox where nob are not desired for example hydroxylamine external addition has been tested to obtain a successful partial nitritation anammox process in laboratory conditions wang et al 2015 finally the present work sets the basis to further understand hydroxylamine metabolism by anammox bacteria next steps could be directed to further confirm the pathway followed by hydroxylamine in continuous operation with either 15n labelling or increased loads doing similar experiments with other anammox bacteria species i e ca brocadia would also help to assess putative differences between anammox species metabolism comparative transcriptomic or proteomic data would provide more information in the enzymes involved in the process overall intermediates of the nitrogen cycle are overlooked and not studied in depth and could be a source for not recognized conversions or interactions in microbial communities understanding such interactions is crucial for improving its implementation as technology 4 conclusions the combination of batch tests continuous feeding thermodynamics analysis and modelling allowed to elucidate more details about the hydroxylamine metabolism of anammox bacteria ammonium can be produced from both hydroxylamine and hydrazine if only nitrite and hydroxylamine are available ammonium can be produced from hydroxylamine and used for nitrite consumption when hydroxylamine ammonium and nitrite are present together in anammox batch tests hydroxylamine and nitrite are consumed simultaneously with hydroxylamine consumption being faster than nitrite consumption hydrazine accumulation only occurs when hydroxylamine is present and seems to be due to a biological imbalance rather than a thermodynamic limitation or enzymatic inhibition the extent of hydrazine accumulation depends on the combination of substrates provided i e promoted by ammonium and reduced by nitrite anammox bacteria can grow simultaneously with ammonium nitrite and hydroxylamine reducing the nitrate production anammox microbial population is not impacted by long term feeding of hydroxylamine hydroxylamine if available in the environment might play an important yet overlooked role in the metabolism of ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis declaration of
