13470,this study investigated the anodic microbial community and treatment efficiency of two mfc systems membrane mfc m mfc and membrane less mfcs ml mfc operated in the open environment under effect of sunlight both mfcs were inoculated with anaerobic sludge operated under continuous mode in the open environment effected by sunlight treated synthetic wastewater with step wise increasing of organic loading rates orls of 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 g cod l day the cod removal and the power generation were continuously monitored cod removal efficiency of m mfc for each olr was 34 7 23 7 76 7 6 7 71 9 0 7 and 67 9 2 8 respectively for the ml mfc cod removal efficiency was 54 3 13 5 73 1 7 73 7 1 6 and 68 1 4 respectively power density of ml mfc under all orls was much higher than that of the m mfc results from illumina high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that there was difference anodic microbial community structure between m mfc and ml mfc the microbial community in the ml mfc was more diverse than in the m mfc this variation attributed to the differences in the design as well as the effect of sunlight to which these systems exposed to m mfc and ml mfc shared the same dominant bacterial phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes and synergistetes with the most abundant bacterial genus in both mfcs belonging to rhodopseudomonas sunlight has found promote the growth of the rhodopseudomonas genus the efficiency of the mfcs was reduced at the high olr and longtime operated under open environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anode electrodes microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial community membrane less wastewater treatment 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs present a promising technology for renewable energy production and wastewater treatment asai et al 1 compared the effectiveness of wastewater treatment by mfc cassette electrode mfcs and activated sludge reactors asr obtained results showed that that both systems had similar cod removal efficiency while sludge produced by mfc was just 30 of sludge from asr besides the ability to remove organic matter and generate electric current mfc also could recover phosphorus researchers at gifu university in japan have found p recovery via p precipitation at the cathode electrode in a small scale laboratory experiment 2 input materials for mfc can be domestic industrial and agricultural waste such as straw the role of microbial populations in anode plays an important role especially with the persistent materials such as straw research by 3 showed that blending straw with microbes from anaerobic pond bottom mud caused an increasing of the mfc s current four time more mixing straw a difficult to decompose material with anaerobic sludge will make anaerobic microbial population in the anode rich and have a high bacterial density making the biological process at the anode more powerful basically the mfc is capable of directly converting metabolic energy of a bio convertible substrate into electricity this reactor omits the necessity for gas treatment and reduces of sludge production due to the harvesting of electrical energy 4 5 at the anode compartment oxidation occurs in which organic matter will be oxidized into intermediate compounds and eventually to form co2 nitrogen compounds turns into nitrite or nitrate sulfur oxidizes into sulfate n and p are also essential nutrients for biomass production at anode if there is oxygen it will cause the process of extracting electrons to occur poorly because of oxygen as electron acceptor which can accept electron donated from the decomposing of organic matter proton h formed from anode will be transported to the cathode to support the reduction process that occurs at cathodes h shipping via proton exchange membranes pem the pem key function is to keep the liquid contents of each chamber separated while still allowing protons to pass between chambers to be utilized in the cathode with the produced electrons logan 6 has reported that cation exchange membranes cem work in a similar way but more cost effective than pem and sometimes structurally stronger both pem and cem support in reducing oxygen diffusion in the anode chamber of the cell if this membrane is unable to transport h then it will cause reduction of ph in the anode and increasing of ph at cathodes however pem is quite expensive and very delicate to work with it cannot be reused and difficult to adapt to desired shapes cheaper alternative to pem was also found tamakloe 7 reported that local clay mixed with kaolin and bentonite a rigid cation exchange material can be an alternative to pem producing open circuit voltage ocv of up to 1 5 v another configuration is sediment mfc smfc which utilize the electro potential difference between oxic water and anoxic sediments to generate electricity for smfc the physical boundary between anode and cathode was not clear and pem was not needed at cathode in order to effectively reduced oxygen by protons and electrons from the anode it is often necessary to use a platinum catalyst the cost of the platinum catalyst used at the cathode is a major limitation to mfc application and economic viability 6 for this reason some researchers have recently started working on the concept of biocathodes that would use bacteria instead of platinum as a biocatalyst at the cathode 8 instead of being catalyzed by platinum the combination of protons electrons and oxidants at the cathode would be catalyzed by a bacterial reaction biocathodes are of two types aerobic biocathodes and anaerobic biocathodes from study of 9 mfcs operating with a biocathode was good at denitrification in the cathode chamber without using a platinum catalyst however it generated small electric currents due to very high internal resistance it can be seen that the power generation of mfcs is determined by many factors including bacterial metabolism 10 11 bacterial electron transfer 12 15 performance of proton exchange membranes 16 17 internal resistance 16 18 and efficiency of oxygen supply in cathodes 10 16 18 many studies have been done to improve design and operation to increase the efficiency of mfc systems however there are many problems that limit the applicability of this system in practice includes 1 processing efficiency 2 electric current formed 3 construction costs 4 effective operating conditions often the water treatment efficiency of mfc has not reached the emission standard so it needs to be combined with another treatment stage before reaching the emission standard high construction costs due to the cost of materials and the design of the system should continue to improve towards cost effectiveness besides the electric current is usually quite small this is a bottle neck that limits the exploration of this system for electricity generation the power density produced by these systems is often limited by high internal resistance and due to losses on the electrode further improvements need to be made to increase the current generated for practical applications of the system in addition the operation under open environment affected by sunlight can strongly influent the microbial community of this system but lack of information therefore this research focused on the issue related to the high cost of mfc due to the cost of proton exchange membrane and pt catalyst at the cathode electrode this study compared two mfc systems with and without membranes and eliminated the use of the catalytic cathode these two systems operated under open environment exposed to sunlight to further assess the effect of the operation condition to the efficiency of these systems 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were set up with membrane and membrane less mfcs made of acrylic in cylinder shape with 10 cm diameter and 100 cm high and open top there were tube and valve at the bottom to facilitate wastewater input fig 1 working volume of the anode compartments were 2 l the electrodes were made of round shaped carbon cloth with surface area of 79 cm2 each they are placed in cathode and anode compartments at 25 cm from the bottom and the top of the reactor respectively the electrodes were connected by copper wire a cation exchange membrane cem type 551652u supplied by vwr international ltd magna park uk was used in the m mfc the cem sheet of dimensions 125 125 mm was placed in the middle to separate the anode and the cathode in the ml mfc glass wool and glass bead was used for separating the two compartments 2 2 mfcs inoculation and operation conditions the anode chambers of both systems were inoculated with 10 ml anaerobic sludge obtained from the heineken vietnam brewery wastewater treatment plant in ho chi minh city vietnam this inoculum was selected based on our previous study 19 in which compared the effect of different inoculums on the mfc s performance and found that the anaerobic sludge inoculum obtained from the brewery wastewater treatment plant gave better performance compared to soil and waste water inoculums the average concentration of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 4 5 g l and 3 1 g l respectively the anolyte medium contained ch3coona 3 28 g l nh4cl 0 31 g l kcl 0 13 g l h2po4 2 69 g l na2hpo4 4 33 g l 10 ml vitamins solution 10 ml trace element solution in the inoculation phase the mfcs were operated in batch mode at temperature of 30 2 c and synthetic wastewater was fed at a rate of 5 ml min until obtaining stable power output the synthetic wastewater consisted of glucose 900 1400 mg l nahco3 750 mg l nh4cl 159 mg l k2hpo4 33 75 mg l kh2po4 11 25 mg l cacl2 2h2o 125 mg l mgso4 7h2o 32 mg l and

cod concentration in wastewater was 900 mg l after inoculation process the mfcs were operated with different olr levels of 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day in step wise manner each orl was run in 15 days then increased to the next higher orl level both mfcs were operated at a flow rate of 5 ml min in continuous mode under open environment exposed to sunlight 2 3 measurements and analysis the open circuit voltage was measured using the digital multimeter kyoritsu model 1009 japan the maximum power was measured and calculated by varying the external resistances the power density in mw m2 was calculated by dividing power with the anode surface area m2 to evaluate the wastewater treatment performance the influent and effluent were sampled every 5 days and analyzed for cod by the standard method 20 the ph was measured daily by ph meter milwaukee instruments mw102 us biofilm formation on the electrode surfaces was analyzed using scanning electron microscope sem s 4800 hi 9039 0006 hitachi japan at the end of the experiments the cells were disassembled a piece of carbon cloth anode electrode of each cell was cut off and fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 4 h at 400 c samples were then washed 3 times with water and dehydrated by soaking successively in ethanol with increasing concentration 30 50 70 80 90 and absolute ethanol for 10 min the samples were then dried attached to the stalk using graphite powder and then coated with gold for analysis the microbial community characteristics of the anode biofilms were determined by dna metagenome the dna of the carbon cloth anode samples were extracted using favorprep genomic dna extraction mini kit favorgen biotech corp different genomic regions v1 v9 belonging to the 16s rrna of bacteria were identified by specific primer sequences the process of creating a library was conducted according to the manufacturer s instructions the libraries were then sequenced using a new generation sequencing technique ngs next generation sequencing with a size of 2 150 pe on the illumina system usa 2 3 1 bioinformatics analysis adapters primers and low quality sequences were removed from the raw reads using cutdapt and trimmomatic amplicon sequence variants asvs were inferred from raw reads using the qiime2 dada2 pipeline chimeric sequences were also removed with the qiime2 dada2 pipeline taxonomy assignment was performed using classify consensus blast from qiime 2 2020 2 0 with the silva database silva provides comprehensive quality checked and regularly updated datasets of aligned small 16s 18s ssu and large subunit 23s 28s lsu ribosomal rna rrna sequences for all three domains of life bacteria archaea and eukarya composition visualization alpha diversity and beta diversity analyses were performed with qiime 2 2020 2 0 if applicable taxonomy that has significant abundance among different groups was identified by lefse 21 using default settings other analyses such as heatmaps and pcoa plots were performed with internal scripts 3 results and discussion 3 1 the variation of ph fig 2 shown the ph change in cathode chamber of two mfc systems operated at 4 different olr level of 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day in m mfc the average ph level was 10 4 0 5 9 6 1 3 9 5 0 7 and 9 7 0 4 respectively the ph instability occurred in m mfc which dropped to 7 5 7 8 and 7 6 on days 18 22 and 27 respectively for the ml mfc the average ph level was 10 2 0 4 8 4 0 8 7 6 0 2 and 8 0 3 respectively the ph instability also presented in the ml mfc on days 18 24 and 27 which decreased to 7 5 7 8 and 7 6 respectively the ph in m mfc was maintained at higher values than in ml mfc for the later orls of 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day the higher ph in m mfc due to the reduction reaction of oxygen occurred in the separated cathode chamber according to eqs 1 and 2 22 the ml mfc allows the exchange of liquid in both compartments therefore limit the increasing of ph in cathode 1 o 2 4h 4e 2h 2 o 2 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 the ph difference of the two mfc systems can be explained via the proton reaction and transfer mechanism from anode to cathode in the m mfc there were many cation species other than protons responsible for the transport of positive charge through the membrane 23 this results from the fact that in the input wastewater the concentrations of cations other than protons e g na k nh4 ca2 and mg2 were much higher than the concentration of protons the competition for movement of other cations affected the mfc system when solutes were consumed protons were produced from the anode compartment and consumed in the cathode compartment if the proton was unable to transfer from anode to cathode the ph might decrease at the anode and increased at the cathode while material balance is maintained by the movement of the other cations in the ml mfc protons generated at the anode transferred more easily to the cathode chamber 3 2 open circuit voltage ocv and power density open circuit voltage ocv of two mfc systems via four different olrs during 50 days was monitored the average ocvs were shown in fig 3 in the m mfcs the average ocv at olr of 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day were 521 5 130 9 591 8 33 1 574 8 52 1 and 581 9 90 3 mv respectively for the ml mfcs the average ocvs were 549 8 131 6 653 7 30 2 571 7 31 2 and 415 159 1 mv respectively the value of ocvs for both systems were fluctuated especially in the first olr 3 g cod l day and the last olr 4 5 g cod l day this instability in the voltage can be explained by the microbial activity of the two mfc systems the electrogenic microorganisms in the mfc transfer electrons generated from the reactions occurring inside the anode compartment to the electrode surface when the anode electrode receives electrons the potential drops lower than that of the cathode in the open circuit state electrons moving from the anode to the cathode was limited and accumulated on the surface of the anode electrode causing fluctuation of the measured voltage for the three organic loading rates including 3 3 5 and 4 g cod l day the voltage produced by ml mfc has been higher or similar to the voltage produced by m mfc however when this olr was increased up to 4 5 g cod l day in the step wise manner voltage produced by ml mfc system has been reduced and getting lower value than the voltage produced by m mfc this reduction in the last olr would due to the long time operation of the systems under open environment affected by sunlight maximum power densities pmax of the two systems at different olrs were showed in table 1 the orl of 3 5 g cod l day provided the highest power density for both systems the power densities of ml mfc at all orls were much larger than of m mfc this low power density of m mfc could due to the high internal resistance in the presence of membrane 24 therefore this result showed that the ml mfc was overperformed m mfc for power generation however the obtained values of power density here were lower than the previous publications the power density was highly varied between studies table 2 the lower power density obtained for both m mfc and ml mfc in this study could came from the use of non catalytic cathodes as well as the operation condition under open air however it was agreed with other studies in term of the higher power density for ml mfc compared to m mfc due to the high internal resistance of m mfc 3 3 cod removal efficiency average cod removal efficiency of the m mfc achieved with olr of 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day were 34 7 23 7 76 7 6 7 71 9 0 7 and 67 9 2 8 respectively besides in ml mfc the average cod removal efficiency was 54 3 13 5 73 1 7 73 7 1 6 and 68 1 4 at each step wise increasing of olr fig 4 under the first phase of olr of 3 g cod l day both systems had unstable cod removal efficiency but the average cod removal efficiency of the ml mfcs were higher than of the m mfcs this would be due to the longer lag phase of the microbial community in the m mfc compared to the ml mfc cod removal efficiency of both systems were highest at olr of 3 5 g cod l day as the olr increased to 4 0 and 4 5 g cod l day the cod treatment efficiency decreases slightly the highest cod removal obtained here was lower than previously published studies reaching 80 90 which were run with lower cod concentrations and no effect of sunlight 18 30 there were no clear different in term of cod removal between the two mfc systems in the later phases this would be due to the limit of cod respiration was achieved for the respective setting later section further showed that the long time operation of mfcs under sunlight changed the microbial community caused solidification of cathode and reduced power density these conditions can reduce cod removal efficiency in the later phases the correlation between power density and cod removal efficiency was consistent for all olrs from 3 to 4 5 g cod l the last olr of 4 5 g cod l day provided slightly reduction in the cod removal but significant reduction in the power density for both systems this would be due to the growth of photosynthesis bacteria in both system under open environment the result in later section 3 4 showed that the genus rhodopseudomonas predominates in both mfcs with the rates of appearance in m mfc and ml mfc were 6 and 20 respectively 3 4 diversity of microbial community and composition after 50 days of the experiments anode electrodes in both mfc systems were removed for microbial community analysis the biofilm formation on the anode electrode surface of both systems was analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem fig 5 showed the sem image of the anode electrode carbon cloth surfaces in the m mfc and the ml mfc the images showed the formation and development of microorganisms on the anode electrode surfaces of both systems microbial community formed in the carbon cloth anode electrodes of both mfcs were collected for metagenomic analysis by the new generation sequencing ngs 16s rrna results showed that there was difference microbial community structure between anode electrodes of m mfc and ml mf alpha diversity calculation showed that the microbial community in the ml mfc was more diverse than that of the m mfc this variation may be attributed to the differences in the design of the two mfc systems m mfc and ml mfc shared the same dominant bacterial phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes and synergistetes archaea in ml mfc 1 7 was higher than in m mfc 0 4 table 3 presented a summary of the community distribution of bacteria formed on the anode electrode surfaces at the phylum level in the m mfc bacteria belonging to proteobacteria dominated with the rate of occurrence 29 4 in ml mfc proteobacteria were up to 45 2 bacteria associated with firmicutes represent the second largest community detected at the anode surface accounting for 26 7 and 11 3 of the ml mfc and the m mfc respectively the presence of bacteria belonging to the proteobacteria and firmicutes in the anode compartment of different mfc systems has also been mentioned in previous studies 31 32 the recent identified common genus of bacteria in mfc such as geobacter and shewanella sp belonged to the proteobacteria 33 35 analysis to the genus level showed a very diverse bacterial community identified in the membrane mfc and membrane less mfc table 4 the genus rhodopseudomonas was predominated in both mfcs with the rates of appearance in m mfc and ml mfc were 5 5 and 19 6 respectively genus rhodopseudomonas was the purple photosynthetic bacteria that could be found in both water and soil 36 it converted sunlight into energy and converted atmospheric co2 into biomass the presence of pseudomonas may aid in electrification by self produced mediators to transport electrons outside or between cells 37 in addition pseudomonas was responsible for organic matter degradation and metal resistance the mfc models in this study were placed outside so the lighting conditions were adequate this brought advantages for the genus rhodopseudomonas to develop and dominate from the result of power generation table 1 the maximum power density of ml mfcs was much higher than that of m mfcs this demonstrated that the genus rhodopseudomonas influenced the electricity generation between the two mfc systems furthermore sunlight was directed into the ml mfcs placement more than with m mfc this further clarifies the dominance of rhodopseudomonas in ml mfc previous studies had also shown that mfc performance was affected by the light which could lead to the abundance of non sulfur purple photosynthetic bacteria in the mfcs medium this bacterium had been shown to produce a higher energy density in pure culture compared to mixed culture and to increase energy production along with light intensity genus rhodopseudomonas releases hydrogen when anaerobic illuminated in the presence of a carbon source such as acetate and malate 38 rhodopseudomonas palustris has the potential to be very useful as it can degrade and recycle a number of different aromatic compounds that make up lignin the main component of wood and the second most abundant polymer on earth 39 hence this and similar bacteria can be useful in removing these types of waste from the environment in addition r palustris has potential in clean fuel production by generating h2 40 at the last phase ran with orl of 4 5 g cod l day power density and cod removal were reduced especially power density the solid medium which was the activated carbon filled up each compartment was found solidifying by extracellular polymeric substances epss eps was not quantified in this study however eps was reported causing negative influence of extracellular electron transfer 41 eps from mfc was studied by 42 in which they quantified extracellular polymeric substances from geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms in mfcs this study also found the presence of geoalkalibacter and geobacter genus at low relative frequency in both mfc systems many other bacteria could also excrete eps which can facilitate the hardening of the solid medium species of aeromonas which were reported to be able to reduce ferric iron nitrate and sulfate expressing c type cytochromes when grown under anaerobic conditions in anode of mfc 43 44 were observed in low relative frequency in this study this bacterium could generate electricity in mfc 45 but how its capacity in reducing ferric nitrate and sulfate ions can affect the solid medium in mfc under effect of sunlight need further study 4 conclusions ml mfc showed effective in both wastewater treatment and power generation employ cheap material compared with m mfc this cost and technical effective of ml mfc is particularly important when scaling up the system sunlight showed significant effect in the long time operation solid medium in cathode was observed hardening after long term running which could link with the reduction of system efficiency sunlight can influence the microbial community of both mfc systems therefore the future research should explore more on the ml mfc and the influence of operating conditions such as temperature and light onto the microbial

method 20 the ph was measured daily by ph meter milwaukee instruments mw102 us biofilm formation on the electrode surfaces was analyzed using scanning electron microscope sem s 4800 hi 9039 0006 hitachi japan at the end of the experiments the cells were disassembled a piece of carbon cloth anode electrode of each cell was cut off and fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 4 h at 400 c samples were then washed 3 times with water and dehydrated by soaking successively in ethanol with increasing concentration 30 50 70 80 90 and absolute ethanol for 10 min the samples were then dried attached to the stalk using graphite powder and then coated with gold for analysis the microbial community characteristics of the anode biofilms were determined by dna metagenome the dna of the carbon cloth anode samples were extracted using favorprep genomic dna extraction mini kit favorgen biotech corp different genomic regions v1 v9 belonging to the 16s rrna of bacteria were identified by specific primer sequences the process of creating a library was conducted according to the manufacturer s instructions the libraries were then sequenced using a new generation sequencing technique ngs next generation sequencing with a size of 2 150 pe on the illumina system usa 2 3 1 bioinformatics analysis adapters primers and low quality sequences were removed from the raw reads using cutdapt and trimmomatic amplicon sequence variants asvs were inferred from raw reads using the qiime2 dada2 pipeline chimeric sequences were also removed with the qiime2 dada2 pipeline taxonomy assignment was performed using classify consensus blast from qiime 2 2020 2 0 with the silva database silva provides comprehensive quality checked and regularly updated datasets of aligned small 16s 18s ssu and large subunit 23s 28s lsu ribosomal rna rrna sequences for all three domains of life bacteria archaea and eukarya composition visualization alpha diversity and beta diversity analyses were performed with qiime 2 2020 2 0 if applicable taxonomy that has significant abundance among different groups was identified by lefse 21 using default settings other analyses such as heatmaps and pcoa plots were performed with internal scripts 3 results and discussion 3 1 the variation of ph fig 2 shown the ph change in cathode chamber of two mfc systems operated at 4 different olr level of 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day in m mfc the average ph level was 10 4 0 5 9 6 1 3 9 5 0 7 and 9 7 0 4 respectively the ph instability occurred in m mfc which dropped to 7 5 7 8 and 7 6 on days 18 22 and 27 respectively for the ml mfc the average ph level was 10 2 0 4 8 4 0 8 7 6 0 2 and 8 0 3 respectively the ph instability also presented in the ml mfc on days 18 24 and 27 which decreased to 7 5 7 8 and 7 6 respectively the ph in m mfc was maintained at higher values than in ml mfc for the later orls of 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day the higher ph in m mfc due to the reduction reaction of oxygen occurred in the separated cathode chamber according to eqs 1 and 2 22 the ml mfc allows the exchange of liquid in both compartments therefore limit the increasing of ph in cathode 1 o 2 4h 4e 2h 2 o 2 o 2 2h 2e h 2 o 2 the ph difference of the two mfc systems can be explained via the proton reaction and transfer mechanism from anode to cathode in the m mfc there were many cation species other than protons responsible for the transport of positive charge through the membrane 23 this results from the fact that in the input wastewater the concentrations of cations other than protons e g na k nh4 ca2 and mg2 were much higher than the concentration of protons the competition for movement of other cations affected the mfc system when solutes were consumed protons were produced from the anode compartment and consumed in the cathode compartment if the proton was unable to transfer from anode to cathode the ph might decrease at the anode and increased at the cathode while material balance is maintained by the movement of the other cations in the ml mfc protons generated at the anode transferred more easily to the cathode chamber 3 2 open circuit voltage ocv and power density open circuit voltage ocv of two mfc systems via four different olrs during 50 days was monitored the average ocvs were shown in fig 3 in the m mfcs the average ocv at olr of 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day were 521 5 130 9 591 8 33 1 574 8 52 1 and 581 9 90 3 mv respectively for the ml mfcs the average ocvs were 549 8 131 6 653 7 30 2 571 7 31 2 and 415 159 1 mv respectively the value of ocvs for both systems were fluctuated especially in the first olr 3 g cod l day and the last olr 4 5 g cod l day this instability in the voltage can be explained by the microbial activity of the two mfc systems the electrogenic microorganisms in the mfc transfer electrons generated from the reactions occurring inside the anode compartment to the electrode surface when the anode electrode receives electrons the potential drops lower than that of the cathode in the open circuit state electrons moving from the anode to the cathode was limited and accumulated on the surface of the anode electrode causing fluctuation of the measured voltage for the three organic loading rates including 3 3 5 and 4 g cod l day the voltage produced by ml mfc has been higher or similar to the voltage produced by m mfc however when this olr was increased up to 4 5 g cod l day in the step wise manner voltage produced by ml mfc system has been reduced and getting lower value than the voltage produced by m mfc this reduction in the last olr would due to the long time operation of the systems under open environment affected by sunlight maximum power densities pmax of the two systems at different olrs were showed in table 1 the orl of 3 5 g cod l day provided the highest power density for both systems the power densities of ml mfc at all orls were much larger than of m mfc this low power density of m mfc could due to the high internal resistance in the presence of membrane 24 therefore this result showed that the ml mfc was overperformed m mfc for power generation however the obtained values of power density here were lower than the previous publications the power density was highly varied between studies table 2 the lower power density obtained for both m mfc and ml mfc in this study could came from the use of non catalytic cathodes as well as the operation condition under open air however it was agreed with other studies in term of the higher power density for ml mfc compared to m mfc due to the high internal resistance of m mfc 3 3 cod removal efficiency average cod removal efficiency of the m mfc achieved with olr of 3 3 5 4 and 4 5 g cod l day were 34 7 23 7 76 7 6 7 71 9 0 7 and 67 9 2 8 respectively besides in ml mfc the average cod removal efficiency was 54 3 13 5 73 1 7 73 7 1 6 and 68 1 4 at each step wise increasing of olr fig 4 under the first phase of olr of 3 g cod l day both systems had unstable cod removal efficiency but the average cod removal efficiency of the ml mfcs were higher than of the m mfcs this would be due to the longer lag phase of the microbial community in the m mfc compared to the ml mfc cod removal efficiency of both systems were highest at olr of 3 5 g cod l day as the olr increased to 4 0 and 4 5 g cod l day the cod treatment efficiency decreases slightly the highest cod removal obtained here was lower than previously published studies reaching 80 90 which were run with lower cod concentrations and no effect of sunlight 18 30 there were no clear different in term of cod removal between the two mfc systems in the later phases this would be due to the limit of cod respiration was achieved for the respective setting later section further showed that the long time operation of mfcs under sunlight changed the microbial community caused solidification of cathode and reduced power density these conditions can reduce cod removal efficiency in the later phases the correlation between power density and cod removal efficiency was consistent for all olrs from 3 to 4 5 g cod l the last olr of 4 5 g cod l day provided slightly reduction in the cod removal but significant reduction in the power density for both systems this would be due to the growth of photosynthesis bacteria in both system under open environment the result in later section 3 4 showed that the genus rhodopseudomonas predominates in both mfcs with the rates of appearance in m mfc and ml mfc were 6 and 20 respectively 3 4 diversity of microbial community and composition after 50 days of the experiments anode electrodes in both mfc systems were removed for microbial community analysis the biofilm formation on the anode electrode surface of both systems was analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem fig 5 showed the sem image of the anode electrode carbon cloth surfaces in the m mfc and the ml mfc the images showed the formation and development of microorganisms on the anode electrode surfaces of both systems microbial community formed in the carbon cloth anode electrodes of both mfcs were collected for metagenomic analysis by the new generation sequencing ngs 16s rrna results showed that there was difference microbial community structure between anode electrodes of m mfc and ml mf alpha diversity calculation showed that the microbial community in the ml mfc was more diverse than that of the m mfc this variation may be attributed to the differences in the design of the two mfc systems m mfc and ml mfc shared the same dominant bacterial phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes and synergistetes archaea in ml mfc 1 7 was higher than in m mfc 0 4 table 3 presented a summary of the community distribution of bacteria formed on the anode electrode surfaces at the phylum level in the m mfc bacteria belonging to proteobacteria dominated with the rate of occurrence 29 4 in ml mfc proteobacteria were up to 45 2 bacteria associated with firmicutes represent the second largest community detected at the anode surface accounting for 26 7 and 11 3 of the ml mfc and the m mfc respectively the presence of bacteria belonging to the proteobacteria and firmicutes in the anode compartment of different mfc systems has also been mentioned in previous studies 31 32 the recent identified common genus of bacteria in mfc such as geobacter and shewanella sp belonged to the proteobacteria 33 35 analysis to the genus level showed a very diverse bacterial community identified in the membrane mfc and membrane less mfc table 4 the genus rhodopseudomonas was predominated in both mfcs with the rates of appearance in m mfc and ml mfc were 5 5 and 19 6 respectively genus rhodopseudomonas was the purple photosynthetic bacteria that could be found in both water and soil 36 it converted sunlight into energy and converted atmospheric co2 into biomass the presence of pseudomonas may aid in electrification by self produced mediators to transport electrons outside or between cells 37 in addition pseudomonas was responsible for organic matter degradation and metal resistance the mfc models in this study were placed outside so the lighting conditions were adequate this brought advantages for the genus rhodopseudomonas to develop and dominate from the result of power generation table 1 the maximum power density of ml mfcs was much higher than that of m mfcs this demonstrated that the genus rhodopseudomonas influenced the electricity generation between the two mfc systems furthermore sunlight was directed into the ml mfcs placement more than with m mfc this further clarifies the dominance of rhodopseudomonas in ml mfc previous studies had also shown that mfc performance was affected by the light which could lead to the abundance of non sulfur purple photosynthetic bacteria in the mfcs medium this bacterium had been shown to produce a higher energy density in pure culture compared to mixed culture and to increase energy production along with light intensity genus rhodopseudomonas releases hydrogen when anaerobic illuminated in the presence of a carbon source such as acetate and malate 38 rhodopseudomonas palustris has the potential to be very useful as it can degrade and recycle a number of different aromatic compounds that make up lignin the main component of wood and the second most abundant polymer on earth 39 hence this and similar bacteria can be useful in removing these types of waste from the environment in addition r palustris has potential in clean fuel production by generating h2 40 at the last phase ran with orl of 4 5 g cod l day power density and cod removal were reduced especially power density the solid medium which was the activated carbon filled up each compartment was found solidifying by extracellular polymeric substances epss eps was not quantified in this study however eps was reported causing negative influence of extracellular electron transfer 41 eps from mfc was studied by 42 in which they quantified extracellular polymeric substances from geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms in mfcs this study also found the presence of geoalkalibacter and geobacter genus at low relative frequency in both mfc systems many other bacteria could also excrete eps which can facilitate the hardening of the solid medium species of aeromonas which were reported to be able to reduce ferric iron nitrate and sulfate expressing c type cytochromes when grown under anaerobic conditions in anode of mfc 43 44 were observed in low relative frequency in this study this bacterium could generate electricity in mfc 45 but how its capacity in reducing ferric nitrate and sulfate ions can affect the solid medium in mfc under effect of sunlight need further study 4 conclusions ml mfc showed effective in both wastewater treatment and power generation employ cheap material compared with m mfc this cost and technical effective of ml mfc is particularly important when scaling up the system sunlight showed significant effect in the long time operation solid medium in cathode was observed hardening after long term running which could link with the reduction of system efficiency sunlight can influence the microbial community of both mfc systems therefore the future research should explore more on the ml mfc and the influence of operating conditions such as temperature and light onto the microbial

13471,sustainable and decentralized sanitation is essential for a continental country like brazil to mitigate its untreated sewage liabilities this may be directly related to the constructed wetlands cws since these systems are considered clean technology alternatives for the treatment of wastewaters so the present research investigated the treatment of university campus wastewaters by a hybrid system composed of anaerobic reactors ar vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw floating treatment wetlands ftw horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssfcw effluents were treated in batch mode with a loading time of 1 h a flow after preliminary treatment of 1 6 m3 h 1 to load the system and hydraulic detention time of 3 days for the ar and 7 days for each cw unit cw were planted with 4 different macrophytes hymenachne grumosa vetiveria zizanoides papyrus and lemna minor sp the obtained results showed removal rates of 67 for cod 53 for bod5 94 for total n 90 for doc 98 for turbidity and of 5log for e coli almost all the investigated parameters of the treated wastewaters were in accordance the emission limits established by current brazilian legislation moreover the good performance of the hybrid system brings new reuse possibilities for the treated wastewaters so that they would be adequate to be reused in orchards cereals forages pastures for livestock and other crops through runoff or by punctual irrigation system keywords university campus wastewaters constructed wetlands hybrid treatment system wastewater reuse 1 introduction decentralized treatment for urban wastewaters is not just a demand for so called underdeveloped or developing countries in italy for example studies approached the treatment of household wastewaters in rural areas with integrated systems using constructed wetlands cw to treat wastewaters of 150 500 and up to 3000 inhabitant equivalents 1 low cost local availability standards meeting efficiency and simplified operation are some of the advantages that might lead to a broader application of decentralized treatment systems 2 according to the handbook published by the national water agency 3 one in four brazilians live with open sewage besides 27 of the brazilian population does neither have access to sewage treatment and collection nor to a septic tank the 2018 annual report diagnosis of water and sewage services 4 revealed that only 46 3 of the wastewater produced in brazil is treated thus the use of decentralized wastewater treatment units where the population equivalents are up to 5000 people can be useful as a strategic outlet for more than 20 of the brazilian cities especially in the state of rio grande do sul south brazil where around 46 have less than 5000 inhabitants 3 however despite representing an interesting alternative for the treatment of wastewaters in several brazilian cities the use of decentralized systems presents a great deficit in the attendance of the population both in urban and rural areas which tend to be more remote decentralized sewage systems contribute to the reduction of long term treatment costs and favor the sustainable treatment of wastewaters 2 according to subtil et al 5 the costs associated to a decentralized treatment system can be 60 lower than the of centralized treatment units in some cases there may be a need to correct adjust the concentrations of other parameters in addition to cod bod5 tkn and total phosphorus such as inorganic ions priority organic pollutants and color especially if the final destination of the process is the use of this effluent as reuse water sewers with large fractions of industrial wastewater may require specialized treatment depending on the particular constituents of their composition such as heavy metals pesticides sulfur compounds among others 6 7 additionally to the treatment it is increasingly important to seek alternatives that may allow for the reuse of wastewaters considering different purposes in order to minimize water pollution and water scarcity 8 9 so considering the need to combine different methods to treat the environmental liabilities present in effluents and taking into account treatments addressing principles of circular economy constructed wetlands cws may operating especially with mixed configuration systems with superficial and subsurface flow constitute as promising alternatives 1 10 besides the capacity to reduce the eutrophic potential of wastewaters only treated by anaerobic or mixed processes cws allow to associate sanitation with landscaping nutrient and energy recovery as well as the reuse of treated wastewater for different purposes 11 one of the variations among the systems that involve the use of ponds and cws that has been receiving growing attention are the so called floating treatment wetlands ftw the existence of natural floating wetlands occurs in many areas of the world 12 floating constructed wetlands are artificial systems that seek in an efficient way to reproduce the processes occurring in natural systems 13 ftw systems are composed of emergent vegetation contained in floating structures in these devices the roots extend below the water column removing nutrients as the plant grows 14 the performance of ftws depends on the establishment of a dense and extensive root system where physical chemical and biological processes occur 15 the assimilation of the phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients by the tissues of the roots and shoots has a positive correlation with the efficiency of the treatment system 16 18 one aspect to consider in the case of ftws is that the efficiency of nutrient removal depends largely on the plant species used in the system 19 20 almost all configurations of cws can be combined to treat different types of effluents however multi stage systems using vertical and horizontal flows alternately arranged as well as with recirculation are recurrent 21 22 horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws can only provide limited nitrification due to their low oxygen transfer capacity vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws on the other hand provide good conditions for nitrification but denitrification does not really occur in these systems in multi stage systems the advantages of hfcws and vfcws can be combined to complement the processes in each system so the treated wastewaters present reduced organic load are completely nitrified and partially denitrified and therefore possess lower total nitrogen values 21 one of the major disadvantages of the use of cws for the treatment of effluents is the requirement for high land areas to achieve good pollutant removal rates mainly phosphorous and nitrogen 23 thus the search for more compact systems with lower economic costs and with the ability to treat complex effluents ends up indicating for the use of multi stage systems as very promising alternatives nevertheless to the best of our knowledge rarely studies investigate the performance of multi stage cws combining ftw at initial or intermediate stages with other flow configurations therefore the main purpose of the present research was to develop and evaluate the performance of an integrated system combining an anaerobic reactor ar and multi stage cws vfcw decanter ftw horizontal sub surface flow constructed wetlands hssfcw to treat the effluents of a university campus located in southern brazil 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the integrated treatment system was set up at the wastewater treatment plant of the central campus of the university of santa cruz do sul as shown in fig 1 it was composed by the sequential use of four different treatment units ar vfcw decanter ftw hssfcw the university wwtp treats the wastewaters generated on campus excluding the ones generated in teaching laboratories and restaurants according to the environmental coordination of the city hall of the unisc campus the wwtp operates with an average flow rate ranging from 100 to 110 m³ day 1 the treated wastewaters are sent to the municipal collection network being indirectly discharged by the galleries and municipal rain channel in arroio lajeado the arroio lajeado has an average flow of 588 2 m3 day 1 23 whereas the average volume of treated wastewaters is of the order of 220 m³ day 1 with maximum flow values of 10 m3 h 1 especially in the evening period after class 24 the wwtp is located in an area further from the teaching buildings and has a lower level in relation to these which allows the flow of effluents to the station to occur by gravity fig 1 on a real scale it consists of the following treatment steps grating sand separator equalizer tank anaerobic sludge blanket upflow uasb aerated biofilter and decanter 2 2 set up of the integrated system before reaching the multi stage cws the wastewaters passed through pre treatment processes including grating and sanding to remove coarse solids and by a primary treatment in an ar aiming at reducing organic matter so the cws acted as a polishing step in order to remove nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients the ar has 1100 l of useful volume being loaded in batches every seven days and with an ascending speed of 1 m h 1 the effluent from the equalizer tank of the university wwtp was used considering a hydraulic retention time hrt of a maximum of 10 h during loading periods the detention time remained between two and four hours the multi stage cws operated in a sequential way the first one was the vfcw followed by the ftw while the hssfcw was the last unit the hrt of each stage was of 7 days so that the total residence time of the treated wastewaters was of 21 days the treated useful volume was of approximately 150 l the vfcw and hssfcw were designed with a useful volume of 150 l and a surface area of 4 2 m2 the reservoirs of the vfcw and hssfcw systems consisted of rectangular shaped fiberglass water tanks with a volume of 1000 l each and were fed in batch mode both units were fulfilled with around 60 cm substrate 20 cm of pebbles placed at the bottom 20 cm gravel n 2 19 25 mm placed onto the pebbles and at the top 20 cm gravel n 1 5 19 mm the vfcw contained a fork shaped triangular distributor built with 25 mm pvc tubes and was vegetated with hymenachne grumosa cyperus papyrus while the hfsscw was planted with h grumosa cyperus papyrus and vetiveria zizanioides the ftw reservoir sought to simulate the conditions present in a lagoon the unit was designed with a compact decanting system having a useful volume of 100 l and vegetated with four adult seedlings of v zizanioides 30 cm of roots and 40 cm of stems and leaves and duckweed lemna minor sp this decanting system was composed of a 200 liter hdpe drum that was adapted to remove any solids from the vfcw it was inserted in a fiber tank of 1000 l of useful volume from which 800 l were occupied with a 70 cm water column the floating platform system floating system was composed of four overlapping layers of expanded polyethylene with a total of 8 cm thick around 70 of the surface area was vegetated by vetiver seedlings v zizanioides whereas the remainder 30 of the ftw unit s surface was occupied by l minor a mixed structure of metal wood and plastic was built to accommodate the floating system the dimensions of the shelter were approximately 3 5 m high with a width of around 1 2 m and a length of 2 m in the external coating transparent plastic was used similar to the ones used in agricultural greenhouses and white nylon mosquito net the purpose of this structure was to prevent the formation of vectors that are returned in standing water as well as to avoid the influence of rainwater that could cause the overflow of the floating system it was also sought to evaluate the functioning of this structure as a greenhouse fig s2 shows details of the construction of the structure all systems presented controllers at the inlets and outlets so that it was possible driven the water flow in the systems both for the supply and drainage stages the muti stage system also presented two other water tanks fig s3 also made of fiberglass which acted as lung tanks the nominal volume of one of these tanks was 310 l while the other was of 500 l the smaller box was connected to the output of the ftw whereas the larger box could receive effluent from vfcw or hssfcw systems depending on which outlet register has been operated connected to the outlet of the lung tanks a pump was attached whose function was to transfer effluent between the systems 2 3 analytical characterization the experiment was conducted over an 8 month period from june 2019 to january 2020 totaling 32 weeks as already mentioned the experimental system was assembled at the unisc wwtp located in the state of rio grande do sul in the southern region of brazil 29 41 56 00 s 52 26 28 00 o samples were weekly collected and afterwards preserved according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 25 table 1 summarizes the analyzed parameters procedures adopted and references used 2 4 data and statistical analysis the obtained results were subjected to statistical analysis using the software ghaphpad prism 8 0 graphpad inc ca usa cod total n tdc doc dic turbidity dissolved oxygen d o absorbance and conductivity were subjected to one way anova analysis to detect the statistical significance of differences p 0 05 among raw wastewaters and the different units of the hybrid system tukey s multiple comparison test was performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical characterization of the raw wastewaters the effluents generated at the central campus of the university of santa cruz of sul are driven by gravity to the wwtp since they are mainly composed of wastewaters produced in urinals and toilets these effluents were considered as typical urban wastewaters being regarded as black and yellow waters 26 table 1 presents the results of the analytical characterization of the untreated effluents based on it is possible to verify that several analytical parameters of the raw wastewaters are above the maximum discharge limits allowed by brazilian national and international guidelines if considering the organic load it is possible to observe that the cod and bod5 values are 1 14 and 1 18 times respectively higher than the disposal limits established the by the resolution 355 17 27 of the rio grande do sul state council on the environment consema rs the agency that regulates the wastewater disposal in rio grande do sul brazil keeping in view stricter standard references these values for cod and bod5 are 3 and 2 66 times respectively above the maximal discharge limits established by the european guideline for urban wastewater treatment 28 moreover the characterization analysis also showed some refractory behavior of the untreated effluents with a bod5 cod relation of 0 38 according to kajitvichyanukul suntronvipart 29 when the bod5 cod is below to 0 5 the wastewaters may have the presence of chemical substances with low biodegradability that may slacken or delay the biological process the organic matter values found in the present research are similar to the ones found in other studies involving university campus wastewaters 24 26 what also stands out is the high n content of the raw wastewaters imparting strong eutrophying features to them regarding the total n values exceeded more than 5 times the limits allowed by the directive 91 271 eec 28 while the n nh3 values are almost 3 times higher than the maximum values allowed by the consema 355 17 27 resolution the presence of nitrite and nitrate is minimal data not shown therefore in the present work n nh3 became the control of the most specific form of nitrogen as it was the predominant form for remediation and meeting the consema 355 17 27 resolution on the contrary the characterization of the untreated effluents revealed low p values being in compliance with both standards silveira et al 26 also found low p levels 1 68 1 39 mg l in characterization assays of raw wastewaters generated at a university campus likewise ngoma et al 30 verified reduced p concentrations 1 41 0 227 mg l in the untreated effluents of a university campus located in mzuzu malawi albeit there are no limits established by legislations resolutions for the total dissolved carbon tdc values this parameter has been increasingly used by researchers to evaluate the potential negative impacts of the wastewaters in the present study the mean values reached almost 200 mg l with around 69 corresponding to the organic fraction doc and the remaining 31 to the inorganic part dic as can be observed the turbidity total dissolved solids tds and thermotolerant coliforms values are several times above the limits established by brazilian resolution for reuse purposes on the other hand ph and temperature of the raw wastewaters are parameters that are in accordance with the limits determined by brazilian and international guidelines 3 2 performance of the integrated system the vfcw decanter ftw hssfcw configuration was designed to improve the sequential nitrification denitrification process of the vfcw unit since the oxygenation in the decanter ftw stage will allow for the characterization of an oxic medium furthermore the decantation process at the second cws unit decanter ftw will decrease the clogging in the hfcw unit increasing the lifetime of this system so the sequential cws used in our research present an important innovation feature for the integrated system regarding the performance of the integrated system in fig 2 a one can visualize a removal of around 30 265 3 72 3 mg l of cod after the ar whereas at the end of the treatment a mean reduction was of 67 136 7 31 5 mg l was achieved the highest removal efficiencies were attained at the vfcw unit the superior performance of the vfcw unit can be attributed to a higher dissolved oxygen availability to the microbial community since the organic matter degradation is highly dependent on oxygen availability 31 so after the last stage the treated effluents reached cod values in compliance with the emission standards of the brazilian legislation and only slightly higher than the required by the directive 91 271 eec 28 it should be noted that the increases of the cod in the last two units of the multi stage cws in comparison to the vfcw were not significant p 0 05 since results presented high standard deviations the bod5 reductions obtained at the end of the treatment were of around 53 66 6 mg l so that the treated wastewaters meet the legal requirements of the brazilian standards but failed to attend the european guideline nevertheless the integrated system increased the bod5 cod to 0 49 i e improved the biodegradability of the investigated effluents table 2 bod5 values were only monitored before the treatment and after the last multi stage unit since this parameter was only used to evaluate the biodegradability ratio of both effluents raw and treated and compare them with brazilian national and international guidelines the high n removals of the integrated system need to be highlighted after the last treatment unit reductions of 90 8 18 10 45 mg l were registered so that the treated wastewaters fully attended the discharge limits of the directive 91 271 eec 28 fig 2b from the reductions 16 7 were achieved after the ar unit 33 6 at the vfcw 38 9 at the ftw and 0 8 at the hssfcw the removal of n from wastewaters is a complex an involves several processes therefore the use of multi stage cws with different configurations was beneficial to achieve good removal rates since created oxic anoxic conditions favored the nitrification denitrification processes 22 also an adequate cod n relation 3 is necessary to favor the nitrogen removal 32 in the present work the cod n value of the raw wastewaters was of 5 89 i e indicating an adequate carbon source for the degradation of nitrogen the quality of the investigated wastewaters brings the profile of a university generating wastewaters with characteristics very close to the service sectors that is with a higher contribution of yellow waters and therefore with higher values of nitrogen pollutant load 23 24 33 in these studies the n nh3 values of the raw wastewaters produced at the university of santa cruz do sul rs were of 36 8 20 6 mg l 24 and of 68 8 25 7 mg l 23 after the treatment by the uasb unit regarding the total p mean values of 8 6 9 2 mg l 24 were found for the raw wastewaters while after the uasb unit these values decreased to 7 71 2 5 mg l 23 the cod values were 265 9 120 4 mg l 24 for the raw wastewaters whereas after the uasb reactor were reduced to 96 9 14 2 mg l 23 with these characteristics the investigated wastewaters are also close to the research data made by liu 34 also with university campus effluent where the n nh3 values were 35 mg land cod 320 mg l in other words nitrifying denitrifying in a biological filter has a fundamental role in the treatment of effluents furthermore high reductions of the organic and inorganic matter occurred after the treatment with removals of around 89 21 46 10 46 mg l 90 14 31 5 83 mg l and 88 5 7 15 5 32 77 mg l for tdc doc and dic respectively fig 2c e it is interesting to observe the differences in the tdc and doc variations this may be associated with the priority reaction of the decomposition products in the vfcw unit with hco3 ions or promoting precipitation as for the dic values it should be noted here that they occur due to hco3 ions once a ph of 7 4 conditions this predominance these data are important for the separation of calcium and iron salts in the effluents but also as ozone capturing ions attenuating the effect of the oxidizer for disinfection and reduction of color turbidity that is desired in the integrated treatment proposed here the obtained results for turbidity d o and real color fig 2f h show important environmental benefits for water reuse especially considering the reductions of turbidity and oxygenation of the system by the decanter ftw unit concerning turbidity mean reductions of 98 2 97 1 46 mg l fig 2f would enable the reuse of the treated wastewaters in classes 1 and 2 of the brazilian resolution nbr 13969 97 35 while the measured values of dissolved oxygen increased by more than 6 times from the rw to ftw unit 0 48 3 01 high real color removal efficiencies 78 occurred most likely due to precipitation effects and consequent filtration sedimentation of particulate matter soluble material in real color presented a lower reduction which could be associated with the degradation of dyes fulvic and humic acids in the ar unit and perhaps to a partial adsorption in the root support of cws and ftw 6 the effects of increasing ph table 2 and reduced conductivity fig 2i are expected to tend towards oxidation especially if they occur in an alkaline ph medium where co2 can be generated after the full treatment by the integrated system conductivity was reduced by 57 the tds values depending on the degradations and mineralization of the process show trends of variations similar to the conductivity values similar behaviors were observed by lancheros et al 36 after the last treatment unit hssfcw the effluents presented a mean tds reduction of 54 5 in comparison to the raw wastewaters finally the high disinfection potential of the hybrid system also keeps attention as can be observed in table 2 the thermotolerant coliforms of the effluents were reduced by five orders after the treatment in general the main removal mechanisms of involve physical chemical and biological processes 25 after the analytical characterization of treated and untreated effluents the macrophytes were cut at a height of approximately 20 cm from the base in the vfcw and hssfcw units in both phenology of the system only showed a growth of 885 6 g of wet mass for h grumosa over a period of three months and twenty days with a growth rate of 295 2 g of biomass per m2 per month this value is about ten times lower than the biomass generation rate obtained by silveira 37 in studies carried out with vfcw system values for the other macrophytes were not accounted due to the restrictive development in six months of operation other important data for the development of the hybrid system are related to the conditions of relative temperature solar radiation flow humidity and co2 emissions especially for the ftw system with shelter proposed for this work figs s4 s7 respectively aspects that should be highlighted are the growth of co2 levels above 500 ppm sporadically measured with portable meter maintenance of temperature values above 15 c in most of the monitored days even in winter and average values of relative humidity also satisfactory for the growth of floating macrophytes guedes alonso et al 38 evaluated the performance of the sequential use of waste stabilization ponds and cws the authors obtained somewhat higher cod 473 96 mg l and bod5 292 121 mg l values of raw wastewaters than the observed in our study whereas the average reductions of both parameters were of 71 for cod and 92 for bod5 guedes alonso 38 also verified high turbidity 83 and fecal coliforms 99 9 reductions nevertheless as drawbacks the investigated system only removed small fractions of total n 26 and n nh4 12 and of p 9 5 the authors ascribed the low removal of the nitrogenated content to the very limited water oxygenation since the macrophytes had almost completely covered the pond avoiding development of microalgae in the pond and of consequent photosynthesis silveira et al 26 investigated the treatment of effluents produced at a university combining microalgae ma and vfcw with an hrt of 17 days the obtained results attained by the ma vfcw system showed very high n nh3 removals 98 while the cod 43 and bod5 46 reductions were lower than the obtained in our research similar turbidity reductions 97 as the ones found here were also obtained by silveira et al 26 finally the authors observed reductions of five orders of the e coli and thermotolerant coliforms ngoma et al 30 assessed the efficiency of a decentralized wastewater treatment plant at mzuzu university malawi by a waste stabilization pond system composed of a facultative pond and 3 maturation ponds and with a total hrt of 111daysbefore the disposal in the luwinga stream the authors reported a very satisfactory performance of the integrated system with almost all the evaluated parameters of the treated wastewaters in compliance with malawy and epa guidelines after the treatment ngoma et al 30 verified reductions of 78 6 and 95 for cod and bod5 respectively the authors attributed the cod reductions to the removal of organic matter through sedimentation and decomposition processes that are likely to occur in waste stabilization ponds lastly they also observed significant increases of do because of reduction of organic matter load bod as well as algal oxygen production and transfer of oxygen from air through the ponds surface colares et al 39 investigated the treatment of university campus wastewaters using ar hybrid cws ozonation the residence time of the wastewaters treated by the integrated system lasted in total 28 days the hybrid cw consisted of sequential ftw hssfcw vfcw the obtained results indicated high removal rates of organic matter 81 6 for cod and 84 4 for bod5 of nitrogenated load 91 for total n and 94 5 for n nh3 of tc 86 9 of toc 78 9 and of turbidity 99 1 despite the presence of the ozonation unit colares et al 39 ascribed the good performance of the hybrid system mainly to the ar and to the hybrid cws so that the ozonation unit acted only as a final polishing step improving the color and microbiological load removals the research carried out by he et al 40 evaluated the performance of hybrid cws in the treatment of effluents produced at university dorms the hybrid system was composed of an integrated vfcw sequential down flow and an up flow and a hssfcw with hrt s of 1 and 2 5 days respectively the authors observed cod average reductions of 59 as for our study the highest fraction was removed in the vfcw stage concerning n load the system under discussion attained removals of 57 7 for total n and of 85 7 for n nh4 the total n reductions in the vfcw were slightly higher than the ones achieved in the hssfcw whereas for n nh4 the removals were much higher in the hssfcw when compared to the vfcw a study performed by papaevangelou et al 41 investigated the effects of operational and design parameters on the performance of three horizontal subsurface flow cws in the treatment of university campus wastewaters hrts varied between 6 and 20 days concerning organic matter authors verified cod removals ranging from 73 to 84 4 and of bod5 from 79 2 81 3 mean reductions of tkn varied between 40 1 and 74 9 while n nh4 content was decreased between 32 7 and 78 4 lastly despite good removal rates of total coliforms 82 1 87 8 papaevangelou et al 42 verified that none of the three investigated wetlands was able to fulfill the maximum discharge limits established by current legislation requiring further disinfection stage although the results of the present research were compared by the ones obtained in other studies it must be considered that the performance of the systems is directly influenced by several operational and design parameters among which the flow of the cws the load rates the type of vegetation the hrt as well as temperature and seasonal variations 40 3 3 reuse potential of the treated wastewaters the consema resolution 355 2017 27 and the abnt 13969 97 standard 35 table 2 indicate the needs and potentials of the wastewaters treated by proposed treatment system the needs establish the control of the load factors for the ar multi stage cws especially regarding temporization the batch system loses with the real comparison of a residence or set of families in flows of up to 2 m3 d 1 of wastewaters generated in sets of properties that represent units of decentralized systems this will provide a closer approximation of the commitments with the consema resolution 355 2017 27 as for reuse the commitments to abnt 13969 35 still indicate the best condition of the treated effluent for class iv despite the values presented being more acceptable in the parameter of escherichia coli as a microbiological reference only not officially accepted with the standard for the class iii the operational control of the decentralized system makes the control frequency with maximum requirement variable since class ii allows direct contact with users and class iii must have at least daily control of microorganisms adding if possible operational indicators such as apparent color and turbidity thus the recommended reuse would be in class iv for orchards cereals forages pastures for cattle and other crops either through runoff or by a point irrigation system fecal coliform less than 5000 mpn 100 ml and dissolved oxygen above 2 0 mg l are the requirements applications must be stopped at least 10 days before harvest when considering international guidelines for water reuse additional treatment would be necessary to meet the legal requirements for example the guidelines for water reuse epa 600 r 12 618 42 indicate the need to reduce the final bod5 values by 85 when reuse in food crops is desired 10 mg l or by 55 in processed food crops on non food crops 30 mg l moreover the presence of fecal coliforms must be indetectable for reuse in food crops on the other hand the microbiological load reductions achieved in the present study would enable the reuse of the treated wastewaters in processed food crops and in non food crops the final turbidity values were only slightly above the established by the epa 600 r 12 618 2 ntu 42 for reuse in food crops while ph values are in accordance with all the mentioned agriculture reuses the regulation eu 2020 741 of the european parliament and of the council of 25 may 2020 43 on minimum requirements for water reuse establishes values for the use reclaimed water in agriculture irrigation considering four categories from a stricter requirements to d lower requirements keeping in view this standard the results obtained by our integrated system revealed that the bod5 results must be reduced by 93 to achieve the requirements recommend in the category a food crops consumed raw where the edible part is in direct contact with reclaimed water and root crops consumed raw while the results obtained in our study showed a mean reduction of 53 2 on the other hand microbiological load is only slightly above the established by the resolution while the turbidity and ph values are below the limits the categories b food crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water processed food crops and non food crops including crops used to feed milk or meat producing animals c food crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water processed food crops and non food crops including crops used to feed milk or meat producing animals and d industrial energy and seeded crops consider bod5 values established by the directive 91 271 eec 28 so the values obtained in our study should be reduced by 62 to be in accordance with these three reuse categories the resolution eu 2020 741 43 makes no reference to turbidity limits for categories b c and d nevertheless the reductions of microbiological load attained by the investigated system fully attend all the requirements of the above mentioned categories 4 conclusions the present research investigated the treatment of effluents generated at the central campus of the university of santa cruz do sul by a hybrid system considering its adequation to brazilian national and international guidelines as well as reuse possibilities the performance of the integrated system presented good removal efficiencies with almost all the investigated parameters in accordance the emission limits established by current legislation the configuration of ar multi stage cws is possible to be applied with adequacy of the load factors for the ar as well as its operation regime with frequent sludge disposal the sludge can be destined for composting since previously treated with lime for the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms the environmental benefits of the ftw unit are significant for the intermediate concentration of dissolved oxygen in addition to providing a functioning system that can serve a residence with up to two people generating around 150 l of effluent per day the construction of the ftw greenhouse unit improves the performance of the system in terms of controlling vectors such as mosquitoes and other invasive species that can damage macrophytes or spread diseases the structure collaborates with the maintenance of an average temperature range above 15 c during the year and with internal co2 values above 500 ppm both the effect of oxygen depletion dissolved in effluents and eutrophicants are reduced by more than 70 with final effluent framed for reuse in discharges as class 3 in accordance with nbr 13969 97 the positioning of the integrated system in a location with a higher incidence of solar radiation preferably in the open field can be indicated as suggestion for future works finally if stricter international guidelines are considered additional treatment with for example uv radiation could be considered to achieve reuse requirements declaration of competing interest the authors

13471,sustainable and decentralized sanitation is essential for a continental country like brazil to mitigate its untreated sewage liabilities this may be directly related to the constructed wetlands cws since these systems are considered clean technology alternatives for the treatment of wastewaters so the present research investigated the treatment of university campus wastewaters by a hybrid system composed of anaerobic reactors ar vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw floating treatment wetlands ftw horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hssfcw effluents were treated in batch mode with a loading time of 1 h a flow after preliminary treatment of 1 6 m3 h 1 to load the system and hydraulic detention time of 3 days for the ar and 7 days for each cw unit cw were planted with 4 different macrophytes hymenachne grumosa vetiveria zizanoides papyrus and lemna minor sp the obtained results showed removal rates of 67 for cod 53 for bod5 94 for total n 90 for doc 98 for turbidity and of 5log for e coli almost all the investigated parameters of the treated wastewaters were in accordance the emission limits established by current brazilian legislation moreover the good performance of the hybrid system brings new reuse possibilities for the treated wastewaters so that they would be adequate to be reused in orchards cereals forages pastures for livestock and other crops through runoff or by punctual irrigation system keywords university campus wastewaters constructed wetlands hybrid treatment system wastewater reuse 1 introduction decentralized treatment for urban wastewaters is not just a demand for so called underdeveloped or developing countries in italy for example studies approached the treatment of household wastewaters in rural areas with integrated systems using constructed wetlands cw to treat wastewaters of 150 500 and up to 3000 inhabitant equivalents 1 low cost local availability standards meeting efficiency and simplified operation are some of the advantages that might lead to a broader application of decentralized treatment systems 2 according to the handbook published by the national water agency 3 one in four brazilians live with open sewage besides 27 of the brazilian population does neither have access to sewage treatment and collection nor to a septic tank the 2018 annual report diagnosis of water and sewage services 4 revealed that only 46 3 of the wastewater produced in brazil is treated thus the use of decentralized wastewater treatment units where the population equivalents are up to 5000 people can be useful as a strategic outlet for more than 20 of the brazilian cities especially in the state of rio grande do sul south brazil where around 46 have less than 5000 inhabitants 3 however despite representing an interesting alternative for the treatment of wastewaters in several brazilian cities the use of decentralized systems presents a great deficit in the attendance of the population both in urban and rural areas which tend to be more remote decentralized sewage systems contribute to the reduction of long term treatment costs and favor the sustainable treatment of wastewaters 2 according to subtil et al 5 the costs associated to a decentralized treatment system can be 60 lower than the of centralized treatment units in some cases there may be a need to correct adjust the concentrations of other parameters in addition to cod bod5 tkn and total phosphorus such as inorganic ions priority organic pollutants and color especially if the final destination of the process is the use of this effluent as reuse water sewers with large fractions of industrial wastewater may require specialized treatment depending on the particular constituents of their composition such as heavy metals pesticides sulfur compounds among others 6 7 additionally to the treatment it is increasingly important to seek alternatives that may allow for the reuse of wastewaters considering different purposes in order to minimize water pollution and water scarcity 8 9 so considering the need to combine different methods to treat the environmental liabilities present in effluents and taking into account treatments addressing principles of circular economy constructed wetlands cws may operating especially with mixed configuration systems with superficial and subsurface flow constitute as promising alternatives 1 10 besides the capacity to reduce the eutrophic potential of wastewaters only treated by anaerobic or mixed processes cws allow to associate sanitation with landscaping nutrient and energy recovery as well as the reuse of treated wastewater for different purposes 11 one of the variations among the systems that involve the use of ponds and cws that has been receiving growing attention are the so called floating treatment wetlands ftw the existence of natural floating wetlands occurs in many areas of the world 12 floating constructed wetlands are artificial systems that seek in an efficient way to reproduce the processes occurring in natural systems 13 ftw systems are composed of emergent vegetation contained in floating structures in these devices the roots extend below the water column removing nutrients as the plant grows 14 the performance of ftws depends on the establishment of a dense and extensive root system where physical chemical and biological processes occur 15 the assimilation of the phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients by the tissues of the roots and shoots has a positive correlation with the efficiency of the treatment system 16 18 one aspect to consider in the case of ftws is that the efficiency of nutrient removal depends largely on the plant species used in the system 19 20 almost all configurations of cws can be combined to treat different types of effluents however multi stage systems using vertical and horizontal flows alternately arranged as well as with recirculation are recurrent 21 22 horizontal flow constructed wetlands hfcws can only provide limited nitrification due to their low oxygen transfer capacity vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws on the other hand provide good conditions for nitrification but denitrification does not really occur in these systems in multi stage systems the advantages of hfcws and vfcws can be combined to complement the processes in each system so the treated wastewaters present reduced organic load are completely nitrified and partially denitrified and therefore possess lower total nitrogen values 21 one of the major disadvantages of the use of cws for the treatment of effluents is the requirement for high land areas to achieve good pollutant removal rates mainly phosphorous and nitrogen 23 thus the search for more compact systems with lower economic costs and with the ability to treat complex effluents ends up indicating for the use of multi stage systems as very promising alternatives nevertheless to the best of our knowledge rarely studies investigate the performance of multi stage cws combining ftw at initial or intermediate stages with other flow configurations therefore the main purpose of the present research was to develop and evaluate the performance of an integrated system combining an anaerobic reactor ar and multi stage cws vfcw decanter ftw horizontal sub surface flow constructed wetlands hssfcw to treat the effluents of a university campus located in southern brazil 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the integrated treatment system was set up at the wastewater treatment plant of the central campus of the university of santa cruz do sul as shown in fig 1 it was composed by the sequential use of four different treatment units ar vfcw decanter ftw hssfcw the university wwtp treats the wastewaters generated on campus excluding the ones generated in teaching laboratories and restaurants according to the environmental coordination of the city hall of the unisc campus the wwtp operates with an average flow rate ranging from 100 to 110 m³ day 1 the treated wastewaters are sent to the municipal collection network being indirectly discharged by the galleries and municipal rain channel in arroio lajeado the arroio lajeado has an average flow of 588 2 m3 day 1 23 whereas the average volume of treated wastewaters is of the order of 220 m³ day 1 with maximum flow values of 10 m3 h 1 especially in the evening period after class 24 the wwtp is located in an area further from the teaching buildings and has a lower level in relation to these which allows the flow of effluents to the station to occur by gravity fig 1 on a real scale it consists of the following treatment steps grating sand separator equalizer tank anaerobic sludge blanket upflow uasb aerated biofilter and decanter 2 2 set up of the integrated system before reaching the multi stage cws the wastewaters passed through pre treatment processes including grating and sanding to remove coarse solids and by a primary treatment in an ar aiming at reducing organic matter so the cws acted as a polishing step in order to remove nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients the ar has 1100 l of useful volume being loaded in batches every seven days and with an ascending speed of 1 m h 1 the effluent from the equalizer tank of the university wwtp was used considering a hydraulic retention time hrt of a maximum of 10 h during loading periods the detention time remained between two and four hours the multi stage cws operated in a sequential way the first one was the vfcw followed by the ftw while the hssfcw was the last unit the hrt of each stage was of 7 days so that the total residence time of the treated wastewaters was of 21 days the treated useful volume was of approximately 150 l the vfcw and hssfcw were designed with a useful volume of 150 l and a surface area of 4 2 m2 the reservoirs of the vfcw and hssfcw systems consisted of rectangular shaped fiberglass water tanks with a volume of 1000 l each and were fed in batch mode both units were fulfilled with around 60 cm substrate 20 cm of pebbles placed at the bottom 20 cm gravel n 2 19 25 mm placed onto the pebbles and at the top 20 cm gravel n 1 5 19 mm the vfcw contained a fork shaped triangular distributor built with 25 mm pvc tubes and was vegetated with hymenachne grumosa cyperus papyrus while the hfsscw was planted with h grumosa cyperus papyrus and vetiveria zizanioides the ftw reservoir sought to simulate the conditions present in a lagoon the unit was designed with a compact decanting system having a useful volume of 100 l and vegetated with four adult seedlings of v zizanioides 30 cm of roots and 40 cm of stems and leaves and duckweed lemna minor sp this decanting system was composed of a 200 liter hdpe drum that was adapted to remove any solids from the vfcw it was inserted in a fiber tank of 1000 l of useful volume from which 800 l were occupied with a 70 cm water column the floating platform system floating system was composed of four overlapping layers of expanded polyethylene with a total of 8 cm thick around 70 of the surface area was vegetated by vetiver seedlings v zizanioides whereas the remainder 30 of the ftw unit s surface was occupied by l minor a mixed structure of metal wood and plastic was built to accommodate the floating system the dimensions of the shelter were approximately 3 5 m high with a width of around 1 2 m and a length of 2 m in the external coating transparent plastic was used similar to the ones used in agricultural greenhouses and white nylon mosquito net the purpose of this structure was to prevent the formation of vectors that are returned in standing water as well as to avoid the influence of rainwater that could cause the overflow of the floating system it was also sought to evaluate the functioning of this structure as a greenhouse fig s2 shows details of the construction of the structure all systems presented controllers at the inlets and outlets so that it was possible driven the water flow in the systems both for the supply and drainage stages the muti stage system also presented two other water tanks fig s3 also made of fiberglass which acted as lung tanks the nominal volume of one of these tanks was 310 l while the other was of 500 l the smaller box was connected to the output of the ftw whereas the larger box could receive effluent from vfcw or hssfcw systems depending on which outlet register has been operated connected to the outlet of the lung tanks a pump was attached whose function was to transfer effluent between the systems 2 3 analytical characterization the experiment was conducted over an 8 month period from june 2019 to january 2020 totaling 32 weeks as already mentioned the experimental system was assembled at the unisc wwtp located in the state of rio grande do sul in the southern region of brazil 29 41 56 00 s 52 26 28 00 o samples were weekly collected and afterwards preserved according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 25 table 1 summarizes the analyzed parameters procedures adopted and references used 2 4 data and statistical analysis the obtained results were subjected to statistical analysis using the software ghaphpad prism 8 0 graphpad inc ca usa cod total n tdc doc dic turbidity dissolved oxygen d o absorbance and conductivity were subjected to one way anova analysis to detect the statistical significance of differences p 0 05 among raw wastewaters and the different units of the hybrid system tukey s multiple comparison test was performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical characterization of the raw wastewaters the effluents generated at the central campus of the university of santa cruz of sul are driven by gravity to the wwtp since they are mainly composed of wastewaters produced in urinals and toilets these effluents were considered as typical urban wastewaters being regarded as black and yellow waters 26 table 1 presents the results of the analytical characterization of the untreated effluents based on it is possible to verify that several analytical parameters of the raw wastewaters are above the maximum discharge limits allowed by brazilian national and international guidelines if considering the organic load it is possible to observe that the cod and bod5 values are 1 14 and 1 18 times respectively higher than the disposal limits established the by the resolution 355 17 27 of the rio grande do sul state council on the environment consema rs the agency that regulates the wastewater disposal in rio grande do sul brazil keeping in view stricter standard references these values for cod and bod5 are 3 and 2 66 times respectively above the maximal discharge limits established by the european guideline for urban wastewater treatment 28 moreover the characterization analysis also showed some refractory behavior of the untreated effluents with a bod5 cod relation of 0 38 according to kajitvichyanukul suntronvipart 29 when the bod5 cod is below to 0 5 the wastewaters may have the presence of chemical substances with low biodegradability that may slacken or delay the biological process the organic matter values found in the present research are similar to the ones found in other studies involving university campus wastewaters 24 26 what also stands out is the high n content of the raw wastewaters imparting strong eutrophying features to them regarding the total n values exceeded more than 5 times the limits allowed by the directive 91 271 eec 28 while the n nh3 values are almost 3 times higher than the maximum values allowed by the consema 355 17 27 resolution the presence of nitrite and nitrate is minimal data not shown therefore in the present work n nh3 became the control of the most specific form of nitrogen as it was the predominant form for remediation and meeting the consema 355 17 27 resolution on the contrary the characterization of the untreated effluents revealed low p values being in compliance with both standards silveira et al 26 also found low p levels 1 68 1 39 mg l in characterization assays of raw wastewaters generated at a university campus likewise ngoma et al 30 verified reduced p concentrations 1 41 0 227 mg l in the untreated effluents of a university campus located in mzuzu malawi albeit there are no limits established by legislations resolutions for the total dissolved carbon tdc values this parameter has been increasingly used by researchers to evaluate the potential negative impacts of the wastewaters in the present study the mean values reached almost 200 mg l with around 69 corresponding to the organic fraction doc and the remaining 31 to the inorganic part dic as can be observed the turbidity total dissolved solids tds and thermotolerant coliforms values are several times above the limits established by brazilian resolution for reuse purposes on the other hand ph and temperature of the raw wastewaters are parameters that are in accordance with the limits determined by brazilian and international guidelines 3 2 performance of the integrated system the vfcw decanter ftw hssfcw configuration was designed to improve the sequential nitrification denitrification process of the vfcw unit since the oxygenation in the decanter ftw stage will allow for the characterization of an oxic medium furthermore the decantation process at the second cws unit decanter ftw will decrease the clogging in the hfcw unit increasing the lifetime of this system so the sequential cws used in our research present an important innovation feature for the integrated system regarding the performance of the integrated system in fig 2 a one can visualize a removal of around 30 265 3 72 3 mg l of cod after the ar whereas at the end of the treatment a mean reduction was of 67 136 7 31 5 mg l was achieved the highest removal efficiencies were attained at the vfcw unit the superior performance of the vfcw unit can be attributed to a higher dissolved oxygen availability to the microbial community since the organic matter degradation is highly dependent on oxygen availability 31 so after the last stage the treated effluents reached cod values in compliance with the emission standards of the brazilian legislation and only slightly higher than the required by the directive 91 271 eec 28 it should be noted that the increases of the cod in the last two units of the multi stage cws in comparison to the vfcw were not significant p 0 05 since results presented high standard deviations the bod5 reductions obtained at the end of the treatment were of around 53 66 6 mg l so that the treated wastewaters meet the legal requirements of the brazilian standards but failed to attend the european guideline nevertheless the integrated system increased the bod5 cod to 0 49 i e improved the biodegradability of the investigated effluents table 2 bod5 values were only monitored before the treatment and after the last multi stage unit since this parameter was only used to evaluate the biodegradability ratio of both effluents raw and treated and compare them with brazilian national and international guidelines the high n removals of the integrated system need to be highlighted after the last treatment unit reductions of 90 8 18 10 45 mg l were registered so that the treated wastewaters fully attended the discharge limits of the directive 91 271 eec 28 fig 2b from the reductions 16 7 were achieved after the ar unit 33 6 at the vfcw 38 9 at the ftw and 0 8 at the hssfcw the removal of n from wastewaters is a complex an involves several processes therefore the use of multi stage cws with different configurations was beneficial to achieve good removal rates since created oxic anoxic conditions favored the nitrification denitrification processes 22 also an adequate cod n relation 3 is necessary to favor the nitrogen removal 32 in the present work the cod n value of the raw wastewaters was of 5 89 i e indicating an adequate carbon source for the degradation of nitrogen the quality of the investigated wastewaters brings the profile of a university generating wastewaters with characteristics very close to the service sectors that is with a higher contribution of yellow waters and therefore with higher values of nitrogen pollutant load 23 24 33 in these studies the n nh3 values of the raw wastewaters produced at the university of santa cruz do sul rs were of 36 8 20 6 mg l 24 and of 68 8 25 7 mg l 23 after the treatment by the uasb unit regarding the total p mean values of 8 6 9 2 mg l 24 were found for the raw wastewaters while after the uasb unit these values decreased to 7 71 2 5 mg l 23 the cod values were 265 9 120 4 mg l 24 for the raw wastewaters whereas after the uasb reactor were reduced to 96 9 14 2 mg l 23 with these characteristics the investigated wastewaters are also close to the research data made by liu 34 also with university campus effluent where the n nh3 values were 35 mg land cod 320 mg l in other words nitrifying denitrifying in a biological filter has a fundamental role in the treatment of effluents furthermore high reductions of the organic and inorganic matter occurred after the treatment with removals of around 89 21 46 10 46 mg l 90 14 31 5 83 mg l and 88 5 7 15 5 32 77 mg l for tdc doc and dic respectively fig 2c e it is interesting to observe the differences in the tdc and doc variations this may be associated with the priority reaction of the decomposition products in the vfcw unit with hco3 ions or promoting precipitation as for the dic values it should be noted here that they occur due to hco3 ions once a ph of 7 4 conditions this predominance these data are important for the separation of calcium and iron salts in the effluents but also as ozone capturing ions attenuating the effect of the oxidizer for disinfection and reduction of color turbidity that is desired in the integrated treatment proposed here the obtained results for turbidity d o and real color fig 2f h show important environmental benefits for water reuse especially considering the reductions of turbidity and oxygenation of the system by the decanter ftw unit concerning turbidity mean reductions of 98 2 97 1 46 mg l fig 2f would enable the reuse of the treated wastewaters in classes 1 and 2 of the brazilian resolution nbr 13969 97 35 while the measured values of dissolved oxygen increased by more than 6 times from the rw to ftw unit 0 48 3 01 high real color removal efficiencies 78 occurred most likely due to precipitation effects and consequent filtration sedimentation of particulate matter soluble material in real color presented a lower reduction which could be associated with the degradation of dyes fulvic and humic acids in the ar unit and perhaps to a partial adsorption in the root support of cws and ftw 6 the effects of increasing ph table 2 and reduced conductivity fig 2i are expected to tend towards oxidation especially if they occur in an alkaline ph medium where co2 can be generated after the full treatment by the integrated system conductivity was reduced by 57 the tds values depending on the degradations and mineralization of the process show trends of variations similar to the conductivity values similar behaviors were observed by lancheros et al 36 after the last treatment unit hssfcw the effluents presented a mean tds reduction of 54 5 in comparison to the raw wastewaters finally the high disinfection potential of the hybrid system also keeps attention as can be observed in table 2 the thermotolerant coliforms of the effluents were reduced by five orders after the treatment in general the main removal mechanisms of involve physical chemical and biological processes 25 after the analytical characterization of treated and untreated effluents the macrophytes were cut at a height of approximately 20 cm from the base in the vfcw and hssfcw units in both phenology of the system only showed a growth of 885 6 g of wet mass for h grumosa over a period of three months and twenty days with a growth rate of 295 2 g of biomass per m2 per month this value is about ten times lower than the biomass generation rate obtained by silveira 37 in studies carried out with vfcw system values for the other macrophytes were not accounted due to the restrictive development in six months of operation other important data for the development of the hybrid system are related to the conditions of relative temperature solar radiation flow humidity and co2 emissions especially for the ftw system with shelter proposed for this work figs s4 s7 respectively aspects that should be highlighted are the growth of co2 levels above 500 ppm sporadically measured with portable meter maintenance of temperature values above 15 c in most of the monitored days even in winter and average values of relative humidity also satisfactory for the growth of floating macrophytes guedes alonso et al 38 evaluated the performance of the sequential use of waste stabilization ponds and cws the authors obtained somewhat higher cod 473 96 mg l and bod5 292 121 mg l values of raw wastewaters than the observed in our study whereas the average reductions of both parameters were of 71 for cod and 92 for bod5 guedes alonso 38 also verified high turbidity 83 and fecal coliforms 99 9 reductions nevertheless as drawbacks the investigated system only removed small fractions of total n 26 and n nh4 12 and of p 9 5 the authors ascribed the low removal of the nitrogenated content to the very limited water oxygenation since the macrophytes had almost completely covered the pond avoiding development of microalgae in the pond and of consequent photosynthesis silveira et al 26 investigated the treatment of effluents produced at a university combining microalgae ma and vfcw with an hrt of 17 days the obtained results attained by the ma vfcw system showed very high n nh3 removals 98 while the cod 43 and bod5 46 reductions were lower than the obtained in our research similar turbidity reductions 97 as the ones found here were also obtained by silveira et al 26 finally the authors observed reductions of five orders of the e coli and thermotolerant coliforms ngoma et al 30 assessed the efficiency of a decentralized wastewater treatment plant at mzuzu university malawi by a waste stabilization pond system composed of a facultative pond and 3 maturation ponds and with a total hrt of 111daysbefore the disposal in the luwinga stream the authors reported a very satisfactory performance of the integrated system with almost all the evaluated parameters of the treated wastewaters in compliance with malawy and epa guidelines after the treatment ngoma et al 30 verified reductions of 78 6 and 95 for cod and bod5 respectively the authors attributed the cod reductions to the removal of organic matter through sedimentation and decomposition processes that are likely to occur in waste stabilization ponds lastly they also observed significant increases of do because of reduction of organic matter load bod as well as algal oxygen production and transfer of oxygen from air through the ponds surface colares et al 39 investigated the treatment of university campus wastewaters using ar hybrid cws ozonation the residence time of the wastewaters treated by the integrated system lasted in total 28 days the hybrid cw consisted of sequential ftw hssfcw vfcw the obtained results indicated high removal rates of organic matter 81 6 for cod and 84 4 for bod5 of nitrogenated load 91 for total n and 94 5 for n nh3 of tc 86 9 of toc 78 9 and of turbidity 99 1 despite the presence of the ozonation unit colares et al 39 ascribed the good performance of the hybrid system mainly to the ar and to the hybrid cws so that the ozonation unit acted only as a final polishing step improving the color and microbiological load removals the research carried out by he et al 40 evaluated the performance of hybrid cws in the treatment of effluents produced at university dorms the hybrid system was composed of an integrated vfcw sequential down flow and an up flow and a hssfcw with hrt s of 1 and 2 5 days respectively the authors observed cod average reductions of 59 as for our study the highest fraction was removed in the vfcw stage concerning n load the system under discussion attained removals of 57 7 for total n and of 85 7 for n nh4 the total n reductions in the vfcw were slightly higher than the ones achieved in the hssfcw whereas for n nh4 the removals were much higher in the hssfcw when compared to the vfcw a study performed by papaevangelou et al 41 investigated the effects of operational and design parameters on the performance of three horizontal subsurface flow cws in the treatment of university campus wastewaters hrts varied between 6 and 20 days concerning organic matter authors verified cod removals ranging from 73 to 84 4 and of bod5 from 79 2 81 3 mean reductions of tkn varied between 40 1 and 74 9 while n nh4 content was decreased between 32 7 and 78 4 lastly despite good removal rates of total coliforms 82 1 87 8 papaevangelou et al 42 verified that none of the three investigated wetlands was able to fulfill the maximum discharge limits established by current legislation requiring further disinfection stage although the results of the present research were compared by the ones obtained in other studies it must be considered that the performance of the systems is directly influenced by several operational and design parameters among which the flow of the cws the load rates the type of vegetation the hrt as well as temperature and seasonal variations 40 3 3 reuse potential of the treated wastewaters the consema resolution 355 2017 27 and the abnt 13969 97 standard 35 table 2 indicate the needs and potentials of the wastewaters treated by proposed treatment system the needs establish the control of the load factors for the ar multi stage cws especially regarding temporization the batch system loses with the real comparison of a residence or set of families in flows of up to 2 m3 d 1 of wastewaters generated in sets of properties that represent units of decentralized systems this will provide a closer approximation of the commitments with the consema resolution 355 2017 27 as for reuse the commitments to abnt 13969 35 still indicate the best condition of the treated effluent for class iv despite the values presented being more acceptable in the parameter of escherichia coli as a microbiological reference only not officially accepted with the standard for the class iii the operational control of the decentralized system makes the control frequency with maximum requirement variable since class ii allows direct contact with users and class iii must have at least daily control of microorganisms adding if possible operational indicators such as apparent color and turbidity thus the recommended reuse would be in class iv for orchards cereals forages pastures for cattle and other crops either through runoff or by a point irrigation system fecal coliform less than 5000 mpn 100 ml and dissolved oxygen above 2 0 mg l are the requirements applications must be stopped at least 10 days before harvest when considering international guidelines for water reuse additional treatment would be necessary to meet the legal requirements for example the guidelines for water reuse epa 600 r 12 618 42 indicate the need to reduce the final bod5 values by 85 when reuse in food crops is desired 10 mg l or by 55 in processed food crops on non food crops 30 mg l moreover the presence of fecal coliforms must be indetectable for reuse in food crops on the other hand the microbiological load reductions achieved in the present study would enable the reuse of the treated wastewaters in processed food crops and in non food crops the final turbidity values were only slightly above the established by the epa 600 r 12 618 2 ntu 42 for reuse in food crops while ph values are in accordance with all the mentioned agriculture reuses the regulation eu 2020 741 of the european parliament and of the council of 25 may 2020 43 on minimum requirements for water reuse establishes values for the use reclaimed water in agriculture irrigation considering four categories from a stricter requirements to d lower requirements keeping in view this standard the results obtained by our integrated system revealed that the bod5 results must be reduced by 93 to achieve the requirements recommend in the category a food crops consumed raw where the edible part is in direct contact with reclaimed water and root crops consumed raw while the results obtained in our study showed a mean reduction of 53 2 on the other hand microbiological load is only slightly above the established by the resolution while the turbidity and ph values are below the limits the categories b food crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water processed food crops and non food crops including crops used to feed milk or meat producing animals c food crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water processed food crops and non food crops including crops used to feed milk or meat producing animals and d industrial energy and seeded crops consider bod5 values established by the directive 91 271 eec 28 so the values obtained in our study should be reduced by 62 to be in accordance with these three reuse categories the resolution eu 2020 741 43 makes no reference to turbidity limits for categories b c and d nevertheless the reductions of microbiological load attained by the investigated system fully attend all the requirements of the above mentioned categories 4 conclusions the present research investigated the treatment of effluents generated at the central campus of the university of santa cruz do sul by a hybrid system considering its adequation to brazilian national and international guidelines as well as reuse possibilities the performance of the integrated system presented good removal efficiencies with almost all the investigated parameters in accordance the emission limits established by current legislation the configuration of ar multi stage cws is possible to be applied with adequacy of the load factors for the ar as well as its operation regime with frequent sludge disposal the sludge can be destined for composting since previously treated with lime for the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms the environmental benefits of the ftw unit are significant for the intermediate concentration of dissolved oxygen in addition to providing a functioning system that can serve a residence with up to two people generating around 150 l of effluent per day the construction of the ftw greenhouse unit improves the performance of the system in terms of controlling vectors such as mosquitoes and other invasive species that can damage macrophytes or spread diseases the structure collaborates with the maintenance of an average temperature range above 15 c during the year and with internal co2 values above 500 ppm both the effect of oxygen depletion dissolved in effluents and eutrophicants are reduced by more than 70 with final effluent framed for reuse in discharges as class 3 in accordance with nbr 13969 97 the positioning of the integrated system in a location with a higher incidence of solar radiation preferably in the open field can be indicated as suggestion for future works finally if stricter international guidelines are considered additional treatment with for example uv radiation could be considered to achieve reuse requirements declaration of competing interest the authors

13472,pure oxygen aeration activated sludge processes exhibit a better pollutant removal performance than the activated sludge systems with air aeration the role of microbial community structure on system performance remains unclear in activated sludge system with pure oxygen aeration two activated sludge reactors with pure oxygen and air aeration were used to treat petrochemical wastewater treatment under different food to microorganism f m ratio conditions the pure oxygen aeration reactor was more tolerant against unsteady f m ratio conditions and had better aromatics removal performance than the air aeration reactor the results of microbial community structure showed that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in both reactors although the richness and diversity of bacterial community under pure oxygen aeration was lower than that under air aeration the chemoheterotrophic bacteria related to the stability of organic removal performance in the pure oxygen aeration reactor were more abundant than those in the air aeration reactor the genera hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter responsible for aromatic compounds degradation were also enriched in the pure oxygen aeration reactor keywords pure oxygen aeration food to microorganism ratio petrochemical wastewater bacterial community organic matter removal 1 introduction petrochemical wastewater is an industrial effluent of petrochemical materials manufacturing 1 although the discharge of petrochemical wastewater in china is decreasing in recent years a discharge amount of 300 million tons per annual is achieved the organic contaminants in petrochemical effluent usually contain phenols alkanes esters aromatic acids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2 some of these compounds exhibit toxic and persistent characteristics and are harmful to human and aquatic organisms if they are discharged to the environment to treat the petrochemical wastewater efficiently scholars have developed and explored various methods such as biological treatment advanced oxidation processes and adsorption 2 advanced oxidation processes and adsorption are widely used in pretreatment and advanced treatment of industrial wastewater 3 some shortcomings such as incomplete organic removal and high cost limit the utilization of these technologies biological treatment especially activated sludge processes combined with anaerobic treatment is widely applied in petrochemical wastewater treatment because of its excellent removal performance and cost saving advantages however the effluent of anaerobic system during petrochemical wastewater treatment exhibits high concentration of organic matter consequently dissolved oxygen do concentration becomes a limitation of activated sludge processes to solve this problem the activated sludge processes with pure oxygen aeration are applied in high concentration industrial wastewater treatment 4 5 however the use of pure oxygen aeration remains difficult in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment because of the high cost of pure oxygen source as an industrial waste gas pure oxygen can be obtained from petrochemical manufacture processes and used for petrochemical wastewater treatment thus pure oxygen aeration activated sludge systems are more appropriate for petrochemical wastewater treatment than municipal or other industrial wastewater treatment activated sludge processes under pure oxygen aeration exhibit better organic removal performance than that under air aeration 6 8 32 these processes are related to the bacterial community composition of the activated sludge the roles of bacterial community structure in the activated sludge processes with air aeration for petrochemical wastewater treatment are widely investigated similar with the bacterial community structure of municipal wastewater treatment plant the genera firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria are generally considered the dominant phyla in petrochemical wastewater treatment processes 9 10 specifically some of the species in these phyla are reported as specific petrochemical contaminant degraders acinetobacter sp and aeromonas sp are used to bioaugment activated sludge for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degradation 11 pseudomonas sp bacillus sp cloacibacterium sp and sphingopyxis sp in activated sludge play important roles in the reduction of aromatic compounds of petrochemical wastewater 12 the bacterial community composition of pure oxygen aeration activated sludge system is significantly different from that of the activated sludge system with air aeration 6 the richness and diversity of microbial community during pure oxygen aeration is lower than that during air aeration 8 however the high removal efficiency of specific pollutants was observed in pure oxygen aeration activated sludge 8 the role of microbes on organic removal in pure oxygen aeration activated sludge remains not well understood various operating parameters have effects on the organic removal performance of activated sludge processes the frequent variations in the influent flow rate and concentration during petrochemical wastewater treatment usually cause the variations in the food to microorganism f m ratio and the unsteady f m ratio condition causes the significant changes in pollutants removal performance effluent suspended solids and sludge settlability 13 the variations of f m ratio also cause microbial community changes in biological systems the toxic effect on microorganisms is constantly observed during petrochemical wastewater treatment due to the increase in f m ratio which causes the decrease of organic removal thus revealing the role of microbes on system performance with pure oxygen aeration under different f m conditions is necessary in activated sludge processes for petrochemical wastewater treatment this study has collected anaerobic filter effluent from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant two aerobic reactors are operated in parallel under pure oxygen and air aeration conditions the performance of organic matter removal of the reactors is investigated at different f m ratios the bacterial community structure changes are also explored in both reactors this study aims to elucidate the role of microbial community structure on the performance of organic matter removal of activated sludge under pure oxygen aeration 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of feeding wastewater the anaerobic filter effluent of petrochemical wastewater was obtained from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant in tianjin china and used as the experimental feeding wastewater the obtained feeding wastewater had the following characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod of 850 2250 mg l 5 days biological oxygen demand of 200 600 mg l total nitrogen tn of 25 4 38 1 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n of 18 2 27 1 mg l total phosphorus tp of 0 8 1 3 mg l and ph of 6 8 8 5 additional nutrients i e nh4cl and kh2po4 were introduced to the feeding wastewater to maintain the ratio of c i e biodegradable carbon n p 100 5 1 the organic compounds in the feeding wastewater are shown in table s1 2 2 reactor operation seeding sludge and sampling two identical reactors with a working volume of 2 5 l were applied in the experiments fig s1 an oxygen cylinder was used as the pure oxygen source in the oxygen aeration reactor while air was pumped to the air aeration reactor in the experiments different f m ratios were controlled by three hydraulic retention times hrts activated sludge was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of the petrochemical wastewater treatment plant and cultured by the feeding wastewater for 30 days before the experiment the operation of the reactors in the experiments is shown in table s2 the influent and effluent samples for cod analysis were collected from both reactors the sludge samples approximately 200 mg were collected with replication and mixed from the reactors in each stage stage 1 and stored at 20 c for further high throughput sequencing analysis 2 3 dna extraction high throughput sequencing and data analysis the sludge samples were sent to novogene beijing china for high throughput sequencing the dna of sludge samples was extracted as following procedures 14 the sludge samples were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 15 min and fixed by ethanol the dna was extracted via fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s manuals the dna quality was assessed and dna concentrations were quantified the v4 region of 16s rrna gene was amplified with the forward primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and the reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the purification quantification and pooling of amplicons were performed at an equimolar ratio the amplicons were sequenced through the illumina miseq sequencing platform the qiime pipeline was used to deduplex and trim the data the changes in bacterial community composition were shown according to the relative abundance at phylum and class level a genus level heatmap based on the relative abundance and linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse were generated in the data analysis platform of novogene the functional prediction was obtained via the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax database the significance of microbial function difference between the pure oxygen and air aeration reactors was also generated in the data analysis platform of novogene 2 4 statistical analyses spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between pertinent parameters and relative abundance of bacteria the coefficients r of spearman correlation was between 1 and 1 the positive correlation negative correlation and noncorrelation could be indicated when r 0 r 0 and r 0 respectively 2 5 analytical methods the parameter of cod was determined by following the standard method 15 a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 puxi china was applied to analyze the uv vis spectroscopy parameter of uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 other parameters such as do tn nh4 n and tp were also investigated the particle size of activated sludge was determined by laser particle size analyzer ms2000 malvern uk the organic matter changes in both reactors with pure oxygen and air aeration were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms analysis the samples of influent and effluent were obtained in triplicate from both reactors in each stage and mixed for pretreatment the procedures of pretreatment and analysis were introduced in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic removal performance of both reactors at different f m ratios the cod removal performance of pure oxygen and air aeration activated sludge systems in different stages are shown in fig 1a and b the influent cod concentrations of both reactors varied between 850 mg l and 2400 mg l the effluent cod concentration varied insignificantly in stages 1 and 2 with cod removal efficiency at 65 69 whereas that in both reactors increased significantly in stage 3 with cod removal efficiency at 40 and 34 under pure oxygen and air aerations respectively thus the cod removal efficiencies of both reactors decreased with the increase in f m ratio the organic removal efficiency of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was higher than that of the air aeration reactor in stage 3 the feeding wastewater mainly contained anaerobic treatment effluent of purified terephthalic acid wastewater aromatic acids and their products of anaerobic degradation were dominant hence the changes in uv254 were used to investigate the changes in aromatic compounds in both reactors fig 1c in general the uv254 values of effluent from both reactors increased with the increase in f m ratio indicating that the removal performance of aromatic compounds was influenced by the variations in f m ratio the values of uv254 in the effluents of pure oxygen aeration reactor were lower than those in the effluents of air aeration reactor the organic removal performances in both reactors were also investigated via gc ms analysis table 1 most of the compounds which were related to intermediate products of anaerobic treatment could not be identified according to mass spectral library database by contrast organic acids aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons found in wastewater samples could be identified with high frequency and content table 1 the organic acids in effluents were not detected the removal efficiency of aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons decreased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio it indicated that aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons were the main refractory compounds in petrochemical wastewater the do concentrations in both reactors under different f m ratios are shown in table s3 when hrt was set to 35 20 and 15 h the do concentrations in the pure oxygen reactor were under saturation condition whereas those in the air aeration reactor were 4 71 1 61 and 1 60 mg l respectively according to the results shown in fig 1 the decline in cod removal efficiency of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was due to the increase in f m ratio do was not a limitation because the do concentration was maintained high concentration under pure oxygen aeration similarly in the air aeration reactor the decline in cod removal performance was due to the increase in f m ratio because the cod removal efficiencies of the air and pure oxygen aeration reactors were similar at low f m conditions hrt 35 h and 20 h regardless of the low do concentration the results illustrated that degradation of the anaerobic effluent in the petrochemical wastewater treatment plant required sufficient contact time with the activated sludge and low f m ratio 16 the increase of f m ratio caused an increasing toxic effect on activated sludge and a shortening sludge retention time srt 17 18 in this study these changes can affect the organic removal performance of both the reactors according to the results in fig 1a a sharp decline in cod removal performance of both the reactors in stage 3 was probably related to the toxic effect on activated sludge with increasing f m ratio it is because that the toxic effect exceeded the tolerance capacity of activated sludge in stage 3 compared with the air aeration reactor the organic removal efficiency of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was more tolerant against the variation in f m ratio the high enzyme activity and organic removal performance may result in high tolerance capacity of activated sludge in pure oxygen aeration reactor in this study 6 8 32 the removal performances of aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons were different between the reactors with pure oxygen and air aeration the long chain hydrocarbons in the reactor with air aeration were easier to remove than those in the pure oxygen aeration reactor at low f m condition stage 1 however the removal efficiency of aromatics in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was higher than that in the air aeration reactor it demonstrates that different aeration source could influence the aromatic compounds removal based on do concentration oxygen played an important role on the structure changes of aromatic compounds in activated sludge processes the most important parameters on the oxygen transfer efficiency in activated sludge systems mainly depended on the total suspended solid concentration and flocs size 19 a similar mlss in both the reactors was obtained however the flocs size in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was smaller than that in the air aeration reactor fig s2 moreover the do concentration in the pure oxygen system was significantly higher than that in the air aeration reactor this result caused the high impetus in oxygen transfer with pure oxygen aeration 4 the oxygen may be readily available for the cells in the pure oxygen aeration reactor thus the aromatic compounds in the pure oxygen aeration reactor were easier to remove than those in the air aeration reactor the differences between the reactors compound removal characteristics were also probably related to their varied microbial community structures under pure oxygen and air aeration 3 2 taxonomic changes under different f m conditions 3 2 1 taxonomic changes at phylum and class level the taxonomic changes in both reactors were investigated under different f m conditions the bacterial communities at phylum level of both reactors are shown in fig 2a a total of 10 major phyla were identified in both reactors proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were considered the dominant phyla at different f m ratios in both reactors these major phyla were also found in petrochemical wastewater treatment system in a previous study 20 proteobacteria involved various bacteria existing under aerobic anaerobic and facultative conditions which were known as degraders of considerable compounds 21 in the seeding sludge sample 42 05 of bacteria were affiliated with proteobacteria in stage 1 the abundance of proteobacteria accounted for 56 58 and 66 63 in the reactors with pure oxygen and air aerations respectively the abundance of proteobacteria decreased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio similarly cod removal efficiency decreased in both reactors these phenomena implied that the species in proteobacteria played an important role in organic removal during petrochemical wastewater biological treatment the toxic effect caused the decay of these species the change in proteobacteria in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was significantly different from that in the air aeration reactor during experiment period from stage 1 to stage 3 the abundance of proteobacteria in the air aeration reactor decreased significantly in stage 2 however proteobacteria in the pure oxygen aeration reactor significantly decreased in stage 3 the difference between the two reactors occurred due to varying do concentrations some of species in proteobacteria favored high do concentration conditions the pure oxygen aeration could maintain the abundance of these species bacteroidetes was related to fermentation or the processes of macromolecules decomposition 22 this study showed that the abundance of bacteroidetes in both reactors increased with the increase in f m ratio thus the fermentation or the processes of macromolecules decomposition became important processes in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio this change was related to abundant biodegradable organics in the petrochemical wastewater with increasing f m ratio 9 chloroflexi firmicutes acidobacteria and actinobacteria were not considered dominant phyla in both systems however these phyla could play an important role in the removal of specific contaminants as a common phylum in activated sludge and anaerobic digestion system chloroflexi was not only related to the degradation of carbohydrates and other cellular components 10 but also associated with pharmaceutically active compounds removal 23 some species in acidobacteria and actinobacteria were related to hydrocarbon degradation and found in petrochemical wastewater treatment plant and oil contaminated area 10 24 the decrease in the abundance of these phyla with the increase in f m ratio in this study could be related to the toxic effect of petrochemical wastewater and these changes might have adverse effect on specific compound removal by contrast firmicutes which were related to the hydrolysis of the refractory compounds in petrochemical wastewater 10 increased with the increase in f m ratio because of its utilization toxic compounds 9 the changes in bacterial community at the class level with different f m ratios are shown in fig 2b betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria flavobacteriia and sphingobacteriia were considered the dominant classes in both reactors betaproteobacteria involved the species of aromatic compounds degradation 25 compared with 26 30 of betaproteobacteria in abundance of the seeding sludge sample the relative abundances of betaproteobacteria in pure oxygen and air aeration reactors in stage 1 were 40 00 and 41 25 respectively the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria and the cod removal efficiency in both reactors decreased with the increase in f m ratio thus betaproteobacteria involved the major microbes for organics degradation these species in betaproteobacteria were sensitive to toxicity of influent wastewater the changing pattern of betaproteobacteria in pure oxygen aeration reactor was different from that in air aeration reactor because of do concentration the abundance of betaproteobacteria in pure oxygen aeration reactor decreased significantly in stage 3 while that in air aeration reactor dramatically decreased in stage 2 thus the species in betaproteobacteria favored high do concentration conditions and their high levels of abundance could be maintained via pure oxygen aeration by contrast the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria flavobacteriia and sphingobacteriia increased in both reactors the species in these classes often exhibited degradation capacity of refractory compounds such as aromatics and hydrocarbons 23 26 28 flavobacteria were also related to the increase in extracellular polymeric substances eps production against the toxicity condition 29 this study showed that the increase of these classes could be related to their tolerant capacity against the toxic condition at high f m ratio 3 2 2 taxonomic changes at genus level the bacterial community changes in both reactors at genus level are shown in fig 3 the dominant genera in both reactors were flavobacterium in phylum bacteroidetes and rhizobium and hydrogenophaga in phylum proteobacteria the species in flavobacterium were reported as degrader for aerobic hydrocarbon degradation 30 this genus was also found to be dominant in full scale petrochemical wastewater treatment plant 31 the abundance of flavobacterium increased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio flavobacterium showed tolerance potential against toxicity of feeding wastewater specifically this genus promoted eps production to prevent the toxic effect of petrochemical wastewater 7 32 33 the abundance of flavobacterium in pure oxygen aeration reactor was always higher than that in air aeration reactor thus the species in flavobacterium for hydrocarbon degradation were considered aerobic or facultative species this result was in line with a previous study 30 in sum high levels of flavobacterium abundance could be maintained via pure oxygen aeration rhizobium involved some species for aromatic hydrocarbons degradation 34 the abundance of rhizobium in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was lower than that in the air aeration reactor the abundance of this genus increased and decreased in pure oxygen and air aeration reactors respectively with the increase in f m ratio these results implied that the changes in the abundance of rhizobium were mainly depended on do concentration condition rather than on f m ratio specifically the species in rhizobium favored medium do concentration condition extremely high i e do concentration condition in stage 1 of pure oxygen aeration reactor or extremely low i e do concentration condition in stages 2 and 3 of air aeration reactor do conditions were not suitable for the species in rhizobium according to these results high levels of abundance of the species in rhizobium could be maintained via pure oxygen aeration with high f m ratio hydrogenophaga was also found to be related to hydrocarbon degradation 35 the abundance of hydrogenophaga decreased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio this result was related to the toxic effect in the feeding wastewater the abundance of hydrogenophaga in the reactor with pure oxygen aeration was higher than that in the air aeration reactor thus hydrogenophaga mainly involved aerobic species in this study 3 3 role of microbial communities on organic removal in pure oxygen and air aeration reactors 3 3 1 functional prediction of microbial communities to reveal the role of microbial communities on organic removal in both reactors the functional profiles of bacterial communities in both reactors were predicted using the faprotax database fig 4 the compounds in petrochemical wastewater of this study were mainly contained fatty acids hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds the functional capabilities related to these compounds degradation were discussed the functional capabilities of aerobic chemoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy were the most abundant in both reactors both of them were associated with the degradation for biodegradable compounds such as fatty acids these functional capabilities were enriched in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio on the contrary the organic removal efficiency in both reactors decreased from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 1a indicating that the functional capabilities for refractory compounds removal played more critical roles in system performance under high f m ratio condition in comparison with the functional capabilities of aerobic chemoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy the functional capability for aromatic degradation was considered for refractory compounds degradation according to the results shown in fig 4 the functional capability had relatively low abundance in both reactors however the change patterns of the functional capability exhibited a decrease trend with the increase in f m ratio similarly with the patterns of cod aromatics removal fig 1a and c it demonstrates that these bacteria related to the functional capability had an important role in organic removal of both reactors the variation of srt and competition between chemoheterotrophic and functional bacteria probably resulted in the abundance decrease of functional bacteria when the f m increased compared with the two reactors the abundance of functional capability for aromatic compounds degradation was higher in the pure oxygen aeration reactor it demonstrated that the bacteria for aromatics degradation were preferentially enriched in the pure oxygen aeration reactor because of high do concentration thus the pure oxygen aeration reactor exhibited a better aromatics removal performance than the air aeration reactor 3 3 2 role of functional microorganisms on specific organics removal in both reactors given the functional microorganisms associated with system parameters and performance was necessary to demonstrate the role of microbial communities on organic removal in both reactors the relation between bacterial variation and the parameters of systems was analyzed using spearman correlation as shown in table 2 the influent cod f m ratio and do contributed to the changes in bacterial community structure of both reactors the influent cod was positively correlated to the abundance of dysgonomonas in class bacteroidetes phylum bacteroidetes the f m ratio showed positive correlation with a variety of bacteria such as the microbes in genera novosphingobium gluconacetobacter flavobacterium sediminibacterium and dysgonomonas these genera were enriched in both reactors and related to biodegradable compounds removal with the increase in f m ratio because of their toxic resistance 36 39 the functional genera associated with aromatics removal were shown in table 2 the removal performance of aromatic compounds was represented by the removal efficiency of uv254 uv254 re as shown in table 2 the parameter of uv254 re exhibited positive correlation with hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter in the phylum proteobacteria demonstrating that the species in genera hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter were related to aromatics degradation the changes of these genera were similar to the change patterns of cod and aromatics removal with the increase in f m ratio it indicates that these genera played an important role in organic removal performance in both reactors furthermore the abundance of hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was different from that in the air aeration reactor hydrogenophaga was positively correlated to do concentration the abundance of acinetobacter in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was also higher than that in the air aeration reactor fig 3 these results indicated that the species in genera hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter favored high do concentration conditions and represented that the pure oxygen aeration reactor showed better aromatic compound removal performance than the air aeration reactor 3 3 3 role of microbial communities on organic removal performance under unsteady f m ratio conditions the richness and diversity of microbial communities provided an insight into the differences of microbial communities between pure oxygen and air aeration reactors the average values of richness and diversity estimators of the bacterial sequences in stages 1 2 and 3 are presented in table 3 on average a total of 869 and 976 operational taxonomic units otus at 3 distance were obtained in the pure oxygen and air aeration reactors respectively chao1 is the richness estimator of bacterial sequences and represents additional richness with high value shannon and simpson are the diversity estimators of bacterial sequences and the high numbers represent an increasingly diverse community in table 3 the values of chao1 shannon and simpson of the pure oxygen aeration reactor were lower than the estimators of the air aeration reactor thus the richness and diversity of the bacterial community of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was lower than those of the air aeration reactor this result was related to the high do concentration in the pure oxygen aeration reactor and in line with a previous study 8 the similarities and differences of microbial communities in both reactors were further investigated by lefse when the linear discriminant analysis threshold was set at 2 5 in fig 5a the circles represent the classification trees from the levels of genus to phylum the differences of taxa in the groups of pure oxygen aeration reactor and air aeration reactor are denoted by corresponding colors a total of 29 microbial clades showed statistically significant difference only 10 clades exhibited relative abundance advantages in the pure oxygen aeration reactor compared with the advantages of 19 clades in the air aeration reactor demonstrating that the richness of the microbial community in the group of air aeration reactor was higher than that in the group of pure oxygen aeration reactor in previous studies the high richness and diversity of microbial community in biological system was considered to be tolerant to the variation of toxic and refractory compounds in the influent 40 41 however in this study the pure oxygen aeration reactor with lower richness and diversity of species showed more tolerant to the variation of toxic and refractory compounds concentration compared with the air aeration reactor it might be related to the functional differences of microbes in activated sludge with pure oxygen and air aeration the differences of microbial function prediction in the pure oxygen and air aeration reactors were investigated the microbial functional capabilities with significant differences p 0 05 between the groups were shown in fig 5b compared with the group of air aeration reactor the functional capabilities with higher abundance in the group of pure oxygen aeration reactor were mainly related to chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy these functional capabilities related to organic removal were also dominated in both the reactors these results indicate that the pure oxygen aeration reactor exhibited a better capability for organic removal on the contrary the functional capabilities with statistically significant difference in the group of air aeration reactor were related to methylotrophy methanotrophy phototrophy and photoheterotrophy these functional capabilities were not the major capabilities for organic removal due to their low abundance according to the results shown in fig 5a the biomarkers with statistic difference of taxa were mainly consisted of the microbes in low abundance and might play no critical roles in organic removal although the richness and diversity of microbes in the pure aeration reactor were lower than these in the air aeration reactor the functional capabilities for organic removal was in higher abundance hence the pure oxygen aeration reactor was more tolerant against unsteady f m ratio conditions than the air aeration reactor although the pure oxygen aeration reactor showed tolerant capacity against f m variation the biological population seemed to need one or two days to adapt to the f m increase for the actual petrochemical wastewater the buffer tanks cannot control the influent variation because the influent flow may increase suddenly and maintain for a long time an efficient anaerobic treatment is helpful to maintain organic removal performance of aerobic system 4 conclusions to treat the anaerobic filter effluent of a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant efficiently two continuous flow reactors i e pure oxygen and air aeration were used under different f m conditions although the organic removal efficiencies of both reactors decreased with the increase in f m ratio the pure oxygen aeration reactor showed better system stability and aromatics removal performance than the air aeration reactor pure oxygen aeration promoted the abundance of the chemoheterotrophy and aromatics degradation bacteria which were either aerobic or facultative the

13472,pure oxygen aeration activated sludge processes exhibit a better pollutant removal performance than the activated sludge systems with air aeration the role of microbial community structure on system performance remains unclear in activated sludge system with pure oxygen aeration two activated sludge reactors with pure oxygen and air aeration were used to treat petrochemical wastewater treatment under different food to microorganism f m ratio conditions the pure oxygen aeration reactor was more tolerant against unsteady f m ratio conditions and had better aromatics removal performance than the air aeration reactor the results of microbial community structure showed that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in both reactors although the richness and diversity of bacterial community under pure oxygen aeration was lower than that under air aeration the chemoheterotrophic bacteria related to the stability of organic removal performance in the pure oxygen aeration reactor were more abundant than those in the air aeration reactor the genera hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter responsible for aromatic compounds degradation were also enriched in the pure oxygen aeration reactor keywords pure oxygen aeration food to microorganism ratio petrochemical wastewater bacterial community organic matter removal 1 introduction petrochemical wastewater is an industrial effluent of petrochemical materials manufacturing 1 although the discharge of petrochemical wastewater in china is decreasing in recent years a discharge amount of 300 million tons per annual is achieved the organic contaminants in petrochemical effluent usually contain phenols alkanes esters aromatic acids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2 some of these compounds exhibit toxic and persistent characteristics and are harmful to human and aquatic organisms if they are discharged to the environment to treat the petrochemical wastewater efficiently scholars have developed and explored various methods such as biological treatment advanced oxidation processes and adsorption 2 advanced oxidation processes and adsorption are widely used in pretreatment and advanced treatment of industrial wastewater 3 some shortcomings such as incomplete organic removal and high cost limit the utilization of these technologies biological treatment especially activated sludge processes combined with anaerobic treatment is widely applied in petrochemical wastewater treatment because of its excellent removal performance and cost saving advantages however the effluent of anaerobic system during petrochemical wastewater treatment exhibits high concentration of organic matter consequently dissolved oxygen do concentration becomes a limitation of activated sludge processes to solve this problem the activated sludge processes with pure oxygen aeration are applied in high concentration industrial wastewater treatment 4 5 however the use of pure oxygen aeration remains difficult in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment because of the high cost of pure oxygen source as an industrial waste gas pure oxygen can be obtained from petrochemical manufacture processes and used for petrochemical wastewater treatment thus pure oxygen aeration activated sludge systems are more appropriate for petrochemical wastewater treatment than municipal or other industrial wastewater treatment activated sludge processes under pure oxygen aeration exhibit better organic removal performance than that under air aeration 6 8 32 these processes are related to the bacterial community composition of the activated sludge the roles of bacterial community structure in the activated sludge processes with air aeration for petrochemical wastewater treatment are widely investigated similar with the bacterial community structure of municipal wastewater treatment plant the genera firmicutes proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria are generally considered the dominant phyla in petrochemical wastewater treatment processes 9 10 specifically some of the species in these phyla are reported as specific petrochemical contaminant degraders acinetobacter sp and aeromonas sp are used to bioaugment activated sludge for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degradation 11 pseudomonas sp bacillus sp cloacibacterium sp and sphingopyxis sp in activated sludge play important roles in the reduction of aromatic compounds of petrochemical wastewater 12 the bacterial community composition of pure oxygen aeration activated sludge system is significantly different from that of the activated sludge system with air aeration 6 the richness and diversity of microbial community during pure oxygen aeration is lower than that during air aeration 8 however the high removal efficiency of specific pollutants was observed in pure oxygen aeration activated sludge 8 the role of microbes on organic removal in pure oxygen aeration activated sludge remains not well understood various operating parameters have effects on the organic removal performance of activated sludge processes the frequent variations in the influent flow rate and concentration during petrochemical wastewater treatment usually cause the variations in the food to microorganism f m ratio and the unsteady f m ratio condition causes the significant changes in pollutants removal performance effluent suspended solids and sludge settlability 13 the variations of f m ratio also cause microbial community changes in biological systems the toxic effect on microorganisms is constantly observed during petrochemical wastewater treatment due to the increase in f m ratio which causes the decrease of organic removal thus revealing the role of microbes on system performance with pure oxygen aeration under different f m conditions is necessary in activated sludge processes for petrochemical wastewater treatment this study has collected anaerobic filter effluent from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant two aerobic reactors are operated in parallel under pure oxygen and air aeration conditions the performance of organic matter removal of the reactors is investigated at different f m ratios the bacterial community structure changes are also explored in both reactors this study aims to elucidate the role of microbial community structure on the performance of organic matter removal of activated sludge under pure oxygen aeration 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of feeding wastewater the anaerobic filter effluent of petrochemical wastewater was obtained from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant in tianjin china and used as the experimental feeding wastewater the obtained feeding wastewater had the following characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod of 850 2250 mg l 5 days biological oxygen demand of 200 600 mg l total nitrogen tn of 25 4 38 1 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n of 18 2 27 1 mg l total phosphorus tp of 0 8 1 3 mg l and ph of 6 8 8 5 additional nutrients i e nh4cl and kh2po4 were introduced to the feeding wastewater to maintain the ratio of c i e biodegradable carbon n p 100 5 1 the organic compounds in the feeding wastewater are shown in table s1 2 2 reactor operation seeding sludge and sampling two identical reactors with a working volume of 2 5 l were applied in the experiments fig s1 an oxygen cylinder was used as the pure oxygen source in the oxygen aeration reactor while air was pumped to the air aeration reactor in the experiments different f m ratios were controlled by three hydraulic retention times hrts activated sludge was obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of the petrochemical wastewater treatment plant and cultured by the feeding wastewater for 30 days before the experiment the operation of the reactors in the experiments is shown in table s2 the influent and effluent samples for cod analysis were collected from both reactors the sludge samples approximately 200 mg were collected with replication and mixed from the reactors in each stage stage 1 and stored at 20 c for further high throughput sequencing analysis 2 3 dna extraction high throughput sequencing and data analysis the sludge samples were sent to novogene beijing china for high throughput sequencing the dna of sludge samples was extracted as following procedures 14 the sludge samples were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 15 min and fixed by ethanol the dna was extracted via fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s manuals the dna quality was assessed and dna concentrations were quantified the v4 region of 16s rrna gene was amplified with the forward primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and the reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the purification quantification and pooling of amplicons were performed at an equimolar ratio the amplicons were sequenced through the illumina miseq sequencing platform the qiime pipeline was used to deduplex and trim the data the changes in bacterial community composition were shown according to the relative abundance at phylum and class level a genus level heatmap based on the relative abundance and linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse were generated in the data analysis platform of novogene the functional prediction was obtained via the functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax database the significance of microbial function difference between the pure oxygen and air aeration reactors was also generated in the data analysis platform of novogene 2 4 statistical analyses spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between pertinent parameters and relative abundance of bacteria the coefficients r of spearman correlation was between 1 and 1 the positive correlation negative correlation and noncorrelation could be indicated when r 0 r 0 and r 0 respectively 2 5 analytical methods the parameter of cod was determined by following the standard method 15 a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 puxi china was applied to analyze the uv vis spectroscopy parameter of uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 other parameters such as do tn nh4 n and tp were also investigated the particle size of activated sludge was determined by laser particle size analyzer ms2000 malvern uk the organic matter changes in both reactors with pure oxygen and air aeration were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms analysis the samples of influent and effluent were obtained in triplicate from both reactors in each stage and mixed for pretreatment the procedures of pretreatment and analysis were introduced in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic removal performance of both reactors at different f m ratios the cod removal performance of pure oxygen and air aeration activated sludge systems in different stages are shown in fig 1a and b the influent cod concentrations of both reactors varied between 850 mg l and 2400 mg l the effluent cod concentration varied insignificantly in stages 1 and 2 with cod removal efficiency at 65 69 whereas that in both reactors increased significantly in stage 3 with cod removal efficiency at 40 and 34 under pure oxygen and air aerations respectively thus the cod removal efficiencies of both reactors decreased with the increase in f m ratio the organic removal efficiency of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was higher than that of the air aeration reactor in stage 3 the feeding wastewater mainly contained anaerobic treatment effluent of purified terephthalic acid wastewater aromatic acids and their products of anaerobic degradation were dominant hence the changes in uv254 were used to investigate the changes in aromatic compounds in both reactors fig 1c in general the uv254 values of effluent from both reactors increased with the increase in f m ratio indicating that the removal performance of aromatic compounds was influenced by the variations in f m ratio the values of uv254 in the effluents of pure oxygen aeration reactor were lower than those in the effluents of air aeration reactor the organic removal performances in both reactors were also investigated via gc ms analysis table 1 most of the compounds which were related to intermediate products of anaerobic treatment could not be identified according to mass spectral library database by contrast organic acids aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons found in wastewater samples could be identified with high frequency and content table 1 the organic acids in effluents were not detected the removal efficiency of aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons decreased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio it indicated that aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons were the main refractory compounds in petrochemical wastewater the do concentrations in both reactors under different f m ratios are shown in table s3 when hrt was set to 35 20 and 15 h the do concentrations in the pure oxygen reactor were under saturation condition whereas those in the air aeration reactor were 4 71 1 61 and 1 60 mg l respectively according to the results shown in fig 1 the decline in cod removal efficiency of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was due to the increase in f m ratio do was not a limitation because the do concentration was maintained high concentration under pure oxygen aeration similarly in the air aeration reactor the decline in cod removal performance was due to the increase in f m ratio because the cod removal efficiencies of the air and pure oxygen aeration reactors were similar at low f m conditions hrt 35 h and 20 h regardless of the low do concentration the results illustrated that degradation of the anaerobic effluent in the petrochemical wastewater treatment plant required sufficient contact time with the activated sludge and low f m ratio 16 the increase of f m ratio caused an increasing toxic effect on activated sludge and a shortening sludge retention time srt 17 18 in this study these changes can affect the organic removal performance of both the reactors according to the results in fig 1a a sharp decline in cod removal performance of both the reactors in stage 3 was probably related to the toxic effect on activated sludge with increasing f m ratio it is because that the toxic effect exceeded the tolerance capacity of activated sludge in stage 3 compared with the air aeration reactor the organic removal efficiency of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was more tolerant against the variation in f m ratio the high enzyme activity and organic removal performance may result in high tolerance capacity of activated sludge in pure oxygen aeration reactor in this study 6 8 32 the removal performances of aromatics and long chain hydrocarbons were different between the reactors with pure oxygen and air aeration the long chain hydrocarbons in the reactor with air aeration were easier to remove than those in the pure oxygen aeration reactor at low f m condition stage 1 however the removal efficiency of aromatics in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was higher than that in the air aeration reactor it demonstrates that different aeration source could influence the aromatic compounds removal based on do concentration oxygen played an important role on the structure changes of aromatic compounds in activated sludge processes the most important parameters on the oxygen transfer efficiency in activated sludge systems mainly depended on the total suspended solid concentration and flocs size 19 a similar mlss in both the reactors was obtained however the flocs size in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was smaller than that in the air aeration reactor fig s2 moreover the do concentration in the pure oxygen system was significantly higher than that in the air aeration reactor this result caused the high impetus in oxygen transfer with pure oxygen aeration 4 the oxygen may be readily available for the cells in the pure oxygen aeration reactor thus the aromatic compounds in the pure oxygen aeration reactor were easier to remove than those in the air aeration reactor the differences between the reactors compound removal characteristics were also probably related to their varied microbial community structures under pure oxygen and air aeration 3 2 taxonomic changes under different f m conditions 3 2 1 taxonomic changes at phylum and class level the taxonomic changes in both reactors were investigated under different f m conditions the bacterial communities at phylum level of both reactors are shown in fig 2a a total of 10 major phyla were identified in both reactors proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were considered the dominant phyla at different f m ratios in both reactors these major phyla were also found in petrochemical wastewater treatment system in a previous study 20 proteobacteria involved various bacteria existing under aerobic anaerobic and facultative conditions which were known as degraders of considerable compounds 21 in the seeding sludge sample 42 05 of bacteria were affiliated with proteobacteria in stage 1 the abundance of proteobacteria accounted for 56 58 and 66 63 in the reactors with pure oxygen and air aerations respectively the abundance of proteobacteria decreased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio similarly cod removal efficiency decreased in both reactors these phenomena implied that the species in proteobacteria played an important role in organic removal during petrochemical wastewater biological treatment the toxic effect caused the decay of these species the change in proteobacteria in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was significantly different from that in the air aeration reactor during experiment period from stage 1 to stage 3 the abundance of proteobacteria in the air aeration reactor decreased significantly in stage 2 however proteobacteria in the pure oxygen aeration reactor significantly decreased in stage 3 the difference between the two reactors occurred due to varying do concentrations some of species in proteobacteria favored high do concentration conditions the pure oxygen aeration could maintain the abundance of these species bacteroidetes was related to fermentation or the processes of macromolecules decomposition 22 this study showed that the abundance of bacteroidetes in both reactors increased with the increase in f m ratio thus the fermentation or the processes of macromolecules decomposition became important processes in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio this change was related to abundant biodegradable organics in the petrochemical wastewater with increasing f m ratio 9 chloroflexi firmicutes acidobacteria and actinobacteria were not considered dominant phyla in both systems however these phyla could play an important role in the removal of specific contaminants as a common phylum in activated sludge and anaerobic digestion system chloroflexi was not only related to the degradation of carbohydrates and other cellular components 10 but also associated with pharmaceutically active compounds removal 23 some species in acidobacteria and actinobacteria were related to hydrocarbon degradation and found in petrochemical wastewater treatment plant and oil contaminated area 10 24 the decrease in the abundance of these phyla with the increase in f m ratio in this study could be related to the toxic effect of petrochemical wastewater and these changes might have adverse effect on specific compound removal by contrast firmicutes which were related to the hydrolysis of the refractory compounds in petrochemical wastewater 10 increased with the increase in f m ratio because of its utilization toxic compounds 9 the changes in bacterial community at the class level with different f m ratios are shown in fig 2b betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria flavobacteriia and sphingobacteriia were considered the dominant classes in both reactors betaproteobacteria involved the species of aromatic compounds degradation 25 compared with 26 30 of betaproteobacteria in abundance of the seeding sludge sample the relative abundances of betaproteobacteria in pure oxygen and air aeration reactors in stage 1 were 40 00 and 41 25 respectively the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria and the cod removal efficiency in both reactors decreased with the increase in f m ratio thus betaproteobacteria involved the major microbes for organics degradation these species in betaproteobacteria were sensitive to toxicity of influent wastewater the changing pattern of betaproteobacteria in pure oxygen aeration reactor was different from that in air aeration reactor because of do concentration the abundance of betaproteobacteria in pure oxygen aeration reactor decreased significantly in stage 3 while that in air aeration reactor dramatically decreased in stage 2 thus the species in betaproteobacteria favored high do concentration conditions and their high levels of abundance could be maintained via pure oxygen aeration by contrast the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria flavobacteriia and sphingobacteriia increased in both reactors the species in these classes often exhibited degradation capacity of refractory compounds such as aromatics and hydrocarbons 23 26 28 flavobacteria were also related to the increase in extracellular polymeric substances eps production against the toxicity condition 29 this study showed that the increase of these classes could be related to their tolerant capacity against the toxic condition at high f m ratio 3 2 2 taxonomic changes at genus level the bacterial community changes in both reactors at genus level are shown in fig 3 the dominant genera in both reactors were flavobacterium in phylum bacteroidetes and rhizobium and hydrogenophaga in phylum proteobacteria the species in flavobacterium were reported as degrader for aerobic hydrocarbon degradation 30 this genus was also found to be dominant in full scale petrochemical wastewater treatment plant 31 the abundance of flavobacterium increased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio flavobacterium showed tolerance potential against toxicity of feeding wastewater specifically this genus promoted eps production to prevent the toxic effect of petrochemical wastewater 7 32 33 the abundance of flavobacterium in pure oxygen aeration reactor was always higher than that in air aeration reactor thus the species in flavobacterium for hydrocarbon degradation were considered aerobic or facultative species this result was in line with a previous study 30 in sum high levels of flavobacterium abundance could be maintained via pure oxygen aeration rhizobium involved some species for aromatic hydrocarbons degradation 34 the abundance of rhizobium in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was lower than that in the air aeration reactor the abundance of this genus increased and decreased in pure oxygen and air aeration reactors respectively with the increase in f m ratio these results implied that the changes in the abundance of rhizobium were mainly depended on do concentration condition rather than on f m ratio specifically the species in rhizobium favored medium do concentration condition extremely high i e do concentration condition in stage 1 of pure oxygen aeration reactor or extremely low i e do concentration condition in stages 2 and 3 of air aeration reactor do conditions were not suitable for the species in rhizobium according to these results high levels of abundance of the species in rhizobium could be maintained via pure oxygen aeration with high f m ratio hydrogenophaga was also found to be related to hydrocarbon degradation 35 the abundance of hydrogenophaga decreased in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio this result was related to the toxic effect in the feeding wastewater the abundance of hydrogenophaga in the reactor with pure oxygen aeration was higher than that in the air aeration reactor thus hydrogenophaga mainly involved aerobic species in this study 3 3 role of microbial communities on organic removal in pure oxygen and air aeration reactors 3 3 1 functional prediction of microbial communities to reveal the role of microbial communities on organic removal in both reactors the functional profiles of bacterial communities in both reactors were predicted using the faprotax database fig 4 the compounds in petrochemical wastewater of this study were mainly contained fatty acids hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds the functional capabilities related to these compounds degradation were discussed the functional capabilities of aerobic chemoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy were the most abundant in both reactors both of them were associated with the degradation for biodegradable compounds such as fatty acids these functional capabilities were enriched in both reactors with the increase in f m ratio on the contrary the organic removal efficiency in both reactors decreased from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 1a indicating that the functional capabilities for refractory compounds removal played more critical roles in system performance under high f m ratio condition in comparison with the functional capabilities of aerobic chemoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy the functional capability for aromatic degradation was considered for refractory compounds degradation according to the results shown in fig 4 the functional capability had relatively low abundance in both reactors however the change patterns of the functional capability exhibited a decrease trend with the increase in f m ratio similarly with the patterns of cod aromatics removal fig 1a and c it demonstrates that these bacteria related to the functional capability had an important role in organic removal of both reactors the variation of srt and competition between chemoheterotrophic and functional bacteria probably resulted in the abundance decrease of functional bacteria when the f m increased compared with the two reactors the abundance of functional capability for aromatic compounds degradation was higher in the pure oxygen aeration reactor it demonstrated that the bacteria for aromatics degradation were preferentially enriched in the pure oxygen aeration reactor because of high do concentration thus the pure oxygen aeration reactor exhibited a better aromatics removal performance than the air aeration reactor 3 3 2 role of functional microorganisms on specific organics removal in both reactors given the functional microorganisms associated with system parameters and performance was necessary to demonstrate the role of microbial communities on organic removal in both reactors the relation between bacterial variation and the parameters of systems was analyzed using spearman correlation as shown in table 2 the influent cod f m ratio and do contributed to the changes in bacterial community structure of both reactors the influent cod was positively correlated to the abundance of dysgonomonas in class bacteroidetes phylum bacteroidetes the f m ratio showed positive correlation with a variety of bacteria such as the microbes in genera novosphingobium gluconacetobacter flavobacterium sediminibacterium and dysgonomonas these genera were enriched in both reactors and related to biodegradable compounds removal with the increase in f m ratio because of their toxic resistance 36 39 the functional genera associated with aromatics removal were shown in table 2 the removal performance of aromatic compounds was represented by the removal efficiency of uv254 uv254 re as shown in table 2 the parameter of uv254 re exhibited positive correlation with hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter in the phylum proteobacteria demonstrating that the species in genera hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter were related to aromatics degradation the changes of these genera were similar to the change patterns of cod and aromatics removal with the increase in f m ratio it indicates that these genera played an important role in organic removal performance in both reactors furthermore the abundance of hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was different from that in the air aeration reactor hydrogenophaga was positively correlated to do concentration the abundance of acinetobacter in the pure oxygen aeration reactor was also higher than that in the air aeration reactor fig 3 these results indicated that the species in genera hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter favored high do concentration conditions and represented that the pure oxygen aeration reactor showed better aromatic compound removal performance than the air aeration reactor 3 3 3 role of microbial communities on organic removal performance under unsteady f m ratio conditions the richness and diversity of microbial communities provided an insight into the differences of microbial communities between pure oxygen and air aeration reactors the average values of richness and diversity estimators of the bacterial sequences in stages 1 2 and 3 are presented in table 3 on average a total of 869 and 976 operational taxonomic units otus at 3 distance were obtained in the pure oxygen and air aeration reactors respectively chao1 is the richness estimator of bacterial sequences and represents additional richness with high value shannon and simpson are the diversity estimators of bacterial sequences and the high numbers represent an increasingly diverse community in table 3 the values of chao1 shannon and simpson of the pure oxygen aeration reactor were lower than the estimators of the air aeration reactor thus the richness and diversity of the bacterial community of the pure oxygen aeration reactor was lower than those of the air aeration reactor this result was related to the high do concentration in the pure oxygen aeration reactor and in line with a previous study 8 the similarities and differences of microbial communities in both reactors were further investigated by lefse when the linear discriminant analysis threshold was set at 2 5 in fig 5a the circles represent the classification trees from the levels of genus to phylum the differences of taxa in the groups of pure oxygen aeration reactor and air aeration reactor are denoted by corresponding colors a total of 29 microbial clades showed statistically significant difference only 10 clades exhibited relative abundance advantages in the pure oxygen aeration reactor compared with the advantages of 19 clades in the air aeration reactor demonstrating that the richness of the microbial community in the group of air aeration reactor was higher than that in the group of pure oxygen aeration reactor in previous studies the high richness and diversity of microbial community in biological system was considered to be tolerant to the variation of toxic and refractory compounds in the influent 40 41 however in this study the pure oxygen aeration reactor with lower richness and diversity of species showed more tolerant to the variation of toxic and refractory compounds concentration compared with the air aeration reactor it might be related to the functional differences of microbes in activated sludge with pure oxygen and air aeration the differences of microbial function prediction in the pure oxygen and air aeration reactors were investigated the microbial functional capabilities with significant differences p 0 05 between the groups were shown in fig 5b compared with the group of air aeration reactor the functional capabilities with higher abundance in the group of pure oxygen aeration reactor were mainly related to chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy these functional capabilities related to organic removal were also dominated in both the reactors these results indicate that the pure oxygen aeration reactor exhibited a better capability for organic removal on the contrary the functional capabilities with statistically significant difference in the group of air aeration reactor were related to methylotrophy methanotrophy phototrophy and photoheterotrophy these functional capabilities were not the major capabilities for organic removal due to their low abundance according to the results shown in fig 5a the biomarkers with statistic difference of taxa were mainly consisted of the microbes in low abundance and might play no critical roles in organic removal although the richness and diversity of microbes in the pure aeration reactor were lower than these in the air aeration reactor the functional capabilities for organic removal was in higher abundance hence the pure oxygen aeration reactor was more tolerant against unsteady f m ratio conditions than the air aeration reactor although the pure oxygen aeration reactor showed tolerant capacity against f m variation the biological population seemed to need one or two days to adapt to the f m increase for the actual petrochemical wastewater the buffer tanks cannot control the influent variation because the influent flow may increase suddenly and maintain for a long time an efficient anaerobic treatment is helpful to maintain organic removal performance of aerobic system 4 conclusions to treat the anaerobic filter effluent of a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant efficiently two continuous flow reactors i e pure oxygen and air aeration were used under different f m conditions although the organic removal efficiencies of both reactors decreased with the increase in f m ratio the pure oxygen aeration reactor showed better system stability and aromatics removal

13473,the reverse osmosis system is one of the most advanced membrane based water treatment technologies that can convert a variety of wastewater into drinking and industrial water however it has major drawbacks including the production of a large amount of reject stream that contains concentrated nutrients microalgae are well known for their rapid growth and ability to consume excessive nutrients very efficiently under a variety of wastewater conditions in this study a locally isolated microalga chlorella sorokiniana knua071 was cultivated in reverse osmosis concentrate roc obtained from a municipal wastewater reclamation facility that contained high levels of nutrients ion and metal elements the aim was to investigate the potential of this microalga to be used in roc treatments and the related applications of its biomass results showed that the c sorokiniana knua071 could successfully remove 91 9 of total nitrogen tn 97 of total phosphorus 98 of mn 100 of al 64 of zn 62 of co and 50 of ni within 8 days yielding a biomass productivity of 0 9 g dry weight l 1 this study also compared the results obtained from the desmodesmus sp knua024 which was used in the treatment of primary settled wastewater ps in our previously research and was found to remove only 53 5 of tn in 8 days c sorokiniana knua071 biomass cultivated in the roc had 13 3 of lipid content while its biomass grown in the ps had 28 2 of lipid content the lipid contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 grown in the roc and ps were 29 3 and 27 1 respectively our findings suggest that microalgal cultivation could be employed as an effective strategy to remove nutrients and metals from roc and at the same time produce biofuel from the lipids accumulated in the algal biomass keywords reverse osmosis concentrate wastewater treatment microalgae biodiesel soil amendment 1 introduction wastewater treatment systems have contributed to ensuring public health and environmental protection since the late 19th century 1 3 however due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization occurring worldwide the volume and variety of water pollutants have shown a multifold increase over the past few decades studies reported that over 80 of all wastewater is discharged without proper treatment because of the excessive pace of demographic and economic growth worldwide 4 7 as a result water supply has become increasingly inadequate to meet agricultural domestic and industrial needs in many areas of the world 8 9 it was also estimated that more than five billion people could be subjected to hardship related to water shortage by 2050 due to climate change including increased water demand and contaminated water supplies 10 therefore water recycling and purification systems have gradually become one of the most important water treatment technologies and strategies in many regions facing water scarcity such as southeast asia and southern australia as well as the middle east and north africa 11 domestic greywater collected from the sewage discharge of bathtubs showers sinks and washing machines can be recycled to reduce household water requirements and the volume of effluents produced 12 industrial wastewater can also be treated recycled and reused through reverse osmosis ro techniques which involve a separation process that removes salt and or dissolved solids from a solution 13 14 this technology can be also used for seawater and brackish water desalination to produce both industrial and drinking water moreover it was proven efficient in treating a wide range of effluents derived from different industrial sources 13 the global market for ro technology is currently growing and is predicted to reach 11 0 billion usd by 2021 15 as it is constantly being improved and is becoming increasingly widespread in water treatment plants worldwide 16 however in spite of all these advantages ro treatments have substantial drawbacks as industrial wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc contains high concentrations of nutrients and potentially harmful organic compounds 17 since the reject streams of ro systems contain almost all the pollutants that present in the feed water at elevated concentrations 13 therefore there are growing concerns over the current methods that allow the discharge of untreated roc into the environment and that can pose a wide range of risks to ecosystems and human health in the long term 18 in order to remove roc numerous treatments biological or based on different processes such as adsorption 19 21 advanced oxidation processes aop i e ozonation and ozone based advanced oxidation 22 23 fenton oxidation 24 25 photocatalysis 26 28 uv h2o2 29 32 and electrochemical oxidation 33 36 and forward osmosis fo 37 39 have been extensively developed and utilized 15 17 recently biological treatments using bacteria fungi and microalgae have attracted increasing attention as possible alternatives to the conventional methods due to their promising potential 40 43 in particular microalgae based treatment technology is now an important emerging field targeting the removal of high concentrations of nitrogen n phosphorus p and organic contaminants 18 as microalgae are capable of growing rapidly in roc media and removing the nutrients more efficiently than other roc treatment methods can 44 46 in addition the algal biomass recovered from roc processes can be utilized as biofuel as microalgae can generate a large amount of carbon based fatty acids from carbon dioxide via photosynthesis 47 50 the object of this research was to investigate the efficiency of the locally isolated microalgal strains chlorella sorokiniana knua071 and desmodesmus sp knua024 in removing nutrients ions and metals from roc as well as from primary settled wastewater ps collected from municipal wastewater reclamation facilities algal growth and biomass productivity were monitored and the harvested biomass was then characterized for potential applications as biofuel 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater collection and characterization approximately 15 l of roc was collected from the pohang municipal wastewater treatment facility pohang

and growth conditions two microalgal strains in the early stationary phase desmodesmus sp knua024 which showed an excellent nutrient removal ability in primary sewage wastewater in our previous study 51 and chlorella sorokiniana knua071 which was isolated from the sincheon wastewater treatment plant and showed outstanding growth rates in the roc screening test data not shown were used in this experiment in order to determine whether the nutrient uptake and utilization by the two strains were limited only to roc or could be also applied to general wastewater treatments both ps and roc were included in this study in addition a bg 11 medium was also used as a positive control for algal cultivation in the preliminary test as the low tp concentration detected in the roc samples suppressed microalgal growth additional phosphorus stock solution was added to the roc in all experiments adjusting the final concentration to 4 5 mg l 1 the final tn tp ratio was adjusted to 13 which in within the range of the optimal tn tp ratios between 10 and 20 52 all experiments were performed at 25 c under a light dark cycle of 16 8 h 114 μmol m 2 s 1 of light intensity and using an orbital shaker at

ps and roc are shown in table 1 both wastewater samples had neutral ph values 7 06 for ps and 7 47 for roc respectively the tn concentration of roc was twice as high as that of ps but it contained less tp also roc had higher contents of every ion and metal elements compared to contents observed in ps and in particular sodium and chloride which affect wastewater salinity were considerably higher in roc than in ps minerals that were essential for microalgal growth and reproduction such as mg ca na cl zn mn and co were also higher in roc toxic heavy metals such as cd pb ti and sn were not detected in either roc or ps 3 2 measurement of growth rate and biomass productivity overall c sorokiniana knua071 showed a better growth pattern in roc than in ps and bg 11 fig 1 a b and it also showed a faster growth rate than desmodesmus sp knua024 in roc samples od and cell count number were highest 8 1 107 cells ml 1 od680 4 6 in strain knua071 c71 and lowest 0 3 107 cells ml 1 od680 1 2 in strain knua024 c24 respectively the specific growth rates are shown in table 2 microalgal cells were harvested after eight days of cultivation and chlorophylls total carotenoid contents and dry cell weight were measured in order to determine physicochemical properties and biomass productivity levels fig 1c d strain knua071 grown in the roc c71 showed the highest chlorophyll a and b contents while strain knua024 grown in the roc c24 showed the lowest these results were in agreement with the above mentioned experimental data od cell count number and μ as illustrated in fig 1c the chl a chl b and carotenoids contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 cultivated in the roc c24 were lower than those in the ps p24 contrarily the chl a and chl b contents of c sorokiniana knua071 in the roc c71 were higher than those of the ps grown knua071 p71 while the carotenoid content of knua071 in the roc c71 was slightly lower than that of the ps p71 as shown in fig 1d strains knua024 in bg 11 b24 and knua071 in roc c71 showed the two highest ranking biomass dry weight values respectively while strain knua071 grown in ps c71 3 3 measurement of nutrient removal efficiency decreased tn and tp concentrations were observed in all experiments fig 2 in roc c sorokiniana knua071 showed the highest nutrient removal efficiencies 91 9 of tn and 97 0 of tp whereas desmodesmus sp knua024 removed 53 5 and 96 9 of tn and tp respectively in contrast desmodesmus sp knua024 showed slightly higher removal efficiencies 89 4 of tn and 95 1 of tp than those shown by c sorokiniana knua071 80 8 of tn and 94 4 of tp when cultured in ps 3 4 ion and metal removal efficiency after cultivating both microalgal strains it was possible to observe that some ion and metal concentrations tended to decrease as shown in table 3 in ps desmodesmus sp knua024 removed 100 of mn 100 of zn 53 of rb and 23 of ni while c sorokiniana knau071 uptook 100 of mn 100 of zn 37 of ni and 31 of co in roc desmodesmus sp knua024 efficiently removed 100 of mn 100 of al 73 of zn 60 of co and 46 of ni while for c sorokiniana knua071 removal values were 98 of mn 100 of al 64 of zn 62 of co and 50 of ni however ba content was almost ten times higher in p24 and twice as high in p71 compared to the initial concentration before cultivation in addition a slight increase in the cl and na contents of both ps and roc was detected in all experiments 3 5 biochemical composition of microalgal biomass the predominant biochemical components of microalgal biomass varied based on strains and types of wastewater used for cultivation table 4 p24 had similar carbohydrate 30 4 and lipid 29 3 contents among all strain cultivations p71 showed the highest total carbohydrate contents 41 6 the lipid content of c24 27 1 was more than double that of protein 11 5 and c71 presented almost equal carbohydrate 23 0 and protein 23 1 contents 3 6 proximate and ultimate analysis the proximate analysis profiles differed depending on the type of wastewater used and not on the microalgal strain both strains showed typical ratios of moisture content mc volatile matter vm and fixed carbon fc ash in ps while decreased vm and considerably increased fc ash values were observed in roc the highest volatile matter was detected in p71 measuring 93 8 and the highest fixed carbon and ash contents were detected in c71 with a value of 26 6 in addition the highest cv was observed in p24 reaching 22 3 mj kg 1 table 5 3 7 analysis of the fatty acid methyl ester contents analysis of the fatty acid contents of the microalgal biomass showed palmitic c16 0 oleic c18 1 and α linolenic c18 3 acids as the predominant components fig 3 c16 0 was the most abundant fatty acid in three microalgal biomasses p24 p71 and c71 except for c24 in which the most abundant acid was c18 3 fatty acid composition differed based on microalgal strains rather than wastewater type c16 3 and c18 4 were only found in desmodesmus sp knua024 p24 and c24 3 8 biodiesel quality assessment based on the fatty acid composition of each microalgal biomass the theoretical biofuel properties including sv iv cn du cfpp os kinematic viscosity υ and density ρ were estimated using the astm and en standards for biodiesel table 6 the values of several parameters such as cfpp os kinematic viscosity and density were considered suitable for biodiesel production while iv and cn values were outside the standards ranges iv 120 cn 47 for astm 3751 and cn 51 for en 14214 4 discussion the tp concentration of roc sourced from the pohang wastewater reclamation facility was only 0 87 mg l 1 which was considered too low to cultivate microalgae sustainably in order to eliminate possible limitations caused by phosphorus deficiency in the culture experiments additional phosphorus was supplied to the roc until a final concentration of 4 5 mg l 1 was obtained the tn tp ratio of the roc was adjusted to 13 since it is generally considered that the optimal tn tp ratios for microalgae culture range from 10 to 20 52 after preliminary screening tests c sorokiniana knua071 was selected as the candidate strain for roc treatment while desmodesmus sp knua024 was chosen because it had already been verified as an elite strain for primary settled wastewater treatment in our previous study 51 to investigate if the wastewater treatment capability of the newly isolated strain knua071 could only be limited to roc ps was included in this cultivation study so that a direct comparison between treatments could be made after cultivating both microalgal strains in ps and roc it was possible to observe that c sorokiniana knua071 showed better growth parameters specifically od cell count numbers chlorophyll and carotenoid contents compared to desmodesmus sp knua024 the rapid growth rate of the genus chlorella is a well known and advantageous trait and roc treatments using chlorella spp had already been attempted in recent studies 18 44 46 c sorokiniana knua071 showed higher od and cell density values during cultivation in roc than in bg 11 which is normally considered as an optimum culture medium but the biomass productivity of the two cultures was similar on the other hand the growth parameters of the c sorokiniana knua071 cultivation in ps were not as high as those of the corresponding roc cultivation it appears that this is a species or probably strain specific trait that confers tolerance and preference to high salt concentration in particular several chlorella spp have been reported that they are able to endure at high nacl concentrations up to 5 g l 1 nacl 65 up to 20 g l 1 nacl 66 67 and even up to 30 g l 1 nacl 68 69 it has been shown that chlorella and scenedesmus spp accumulated lipid 70 71 and carbohydrate under salt stress conditions 72 however both lipid and carbohydrate contents of c sorokiniana knua071 cultured in the roc were significantly lower than those in the ps this suggests the current nacl concentration 2 7 g l 1 in the roc is not a stress inducing condition that can trigger lipid and carbohydrate accumulation in c sorokiniana knua071 in addition it has also been demonstrated that the chl a chl b and carotenoid contents declined greatly under salt stress conditions in chlorella 69 and scenedesmus 72 however the chl a and chl b contents of c sorokiniana knua071 in the roc were higher than those in the ps it was also reported that ratio of chl a b or carotenoids total chl significantly increased with the increasement of the salinity which is an indirect indication of salinity induced oxidative stress and reduced photosystem ii activity 72 high ratios of chl a b or carotenoids total chl also suggest reduction in the antenna size that may protect algal cells from oxidative damage again the chl a b and carotenoids chl a b of c sorokiniana knua071 grown in the roc were lower than those in the ps as shown in table s2 therefore we came up with the conclusion that c sorokiniana knua071 is a halotolerant microalgal isolate and the nacl concentration of 2 7 g l 1 in the roc does not have a negative effect on this microalga this suggests a clear possibility of using c sorokiniana knua071 for microalgal roc treatments in contrast the growth patterns of desmodesmus sp knua024 were practically opposite to those of strain knua071 desmodesmus sp knua024 grew similarly in all three different media ps roc and bg 11 throughout the cultivation periods our results showed that c sorokiniana knua071 was able to remove 91 9 of tn and 97 0 of tp within eight days mohseni et al 18 demonstrated that c vulgaris and nannochloropsis salina could remove 50 of tn and 80 of tp in their semi continuous roc treatment wang et al 44 also showed that 89 of tn and 92 of tp were successfully removed from roc in their 20 day batch experiment using the chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp strains furthermore maeng et al 73 showed that algal treatment of synthetic roc using scenedesmus quadricauda resulted in the removal of 19 of tn and 95 of tp in a 3 day batch test therefore it can be concluded that the c sorokiniana knua071 strain could be an excellent candidate for microalgae based roc treatments it is expected that under optimal conditions cultivation periods of strain knua071 could be shortened in our previous study 51 desmodesmus sp knua024 showed better tn and tp removal rates in ps than other local candidate strains however this strain showed a poor tn removal capability in roc compared to c sorokiniana knua071 which proved highly efficient instead this poor performance may be explained by the possible presence of other limiting factors such as concentrated sodium and chloride affecting the growth of desmodesmus sp knua024 in roc while these elevated concentrations of na and cl did not have major effects on the growth of c sorokiniana knua071 the chl a chl b and carotenoid contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 in the roc were significantly lower than those in the ps this indicates the preference of desmodesmus sp knua024 to the ps over the roc that contains high concentrations of na and cl the two microalgal strains were able to remove large amounts of mn ni and zn from roc also co was efficiently eliminated during roc cultivation experiments with both strains our results indicate that microalgal cultivation could also be applied to remove various metal species in particular toxic heavy metals such as co cr and rb since many microalgae including chlorella were shown to fix metals from wastewater through various mechanisms such as physical adsorption chelation chemisorption ion exchange precipitation and crystallization 74 75 even though an unexpected ba increase was observed in ps samples after cultivation a significant amount of ba was removed from roc by culturing both strains cl and na concentrations in both ps and roc remained almost the same in all experiments suggesting that the elevated levels of these ions had little or no effect on the growth and productivity of microalgae in wastewater microalgae especially species belonging to the genus chlorella are usually rich in protein which is a well known property of many eukaryotic microalgae 76 however in our study the algal biomass protein contents were relatively low in all experiments even though the n p ratios of the ps 17 and roc 13 fell into the range for optimal growth conditions of microalgae 10 20 52 these ratios may not be the ideal conditions for high protein production for the tested microalgae strains it was demonstrated that the protein contents of microalgae at the n p ratios of 20 to 30 were higher than other n p ratios 77 therefore it is assumed that higher protein contents in microalgae could be achieved by adding less phosphorus to the roc nevertheless it should also be noted that the level of phosphorus in the roc should not be below the growth limiting concentrations lipid contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 cultivated in the ps and roc were 29 3 and 27 1 respectively while lipid contents of c sorokiniana knua071 grown in the ps and roc were 28 2 and 13 3 there was a little change in lipid production in desmodesmus sp knua024 in the ps and roc while the lipid content of c sorokiniana knua071 was more than doubled when cultivated in the ps than in the roc it was reported that high lipid accumulation can be induced by high n p ratios in certain microalgal species and high n p ratios indicate a p limiting condition 77 since it is generally assumed that phytoplankton are under n limited condition at n p 16 and they are under p limited conditions at n p 16 based on the redfield ratio 78 the ps is close to a p replete condition and the roc is an n replete conditions respectively in accordance with our results with c sorokiniana knua071 chlorella sp accumulated a high content of lipids under high n p ratios p limitations compared to the lower n p ratios n limitations 79 however it is also presumed that lipid accumulation in desmodesmus sp knua024 was not affected greatly by high n p ratios from our results therefore this trait could be species specific on the other hand both strains exhibited a significant increase in carbohydrate content under the p starvation condition ps compared to n starvation condition roc it was shown that carbohydrate content of c vulgaris was increased to 55 under p limiting condition 80 81 further cultivation studies are needed to reveal and understand the effect of different n p ratios on biochemical compositions of these strains including further taxonomic identification of desmodesmus sp knua024 to species level in the proximate analysis by tga the microalgal biomass harvested from ps had a relatively low mc and high volatile matter indicating its combustion efficiency and preservation of nutritional integrity 82 however the roc grown microalgal biomass possessed considerably higher fixed carbon ash contents than those seen in the ps grown biomass these could be attributed to a high concentration of ion and metal elements present in the roc consequently when comparing roc and ps cultivations the roc grown algal biomass also presented lower carbon contents it seems that relatively low volatile matter contents in the roc grown biomass may deteriorate the quality of the subsequently obtained microalgal biofuels as vm is a very important parameter affecting combustion processes 83 nevertheless high ash contents were observed in the roc grown biomass in all experiments and these can be used as an effective soil amendment material as ashes contain abundant essential micronutrients it should be noted that pretreatment with ammonium formate is required when measuring dry weight of microalgae cultured in saline and hypersaline media in order to eliminate possible overestimation 84 however the salinities measured as nacl content of the roc and ps were 0 046 m nacl and 0 002 m nacl respectively and these values were not within the range of 0 05 0 2 m nacl 84 therefore possible overestimation that may have been caused by skipping the ammonium formate washing in this study could be neglectable the most abundant fatty acids detected in the microalgal biomass of both strains in ps and roc cultivations were c16 0 c18 1 and c18 3 also pufas were major fatty acids present in the biomass across all experiments accounting for over 40 of the total these c16 to 18 fatty acids are the major fatty acid components in chlorella spp 79 85 86 and desmodesmus sp 51 the abundance of c16 c18 fatty acids is commonly observed in most green microalgae chlorophyta 87 however c16 3 and c18 4 were only found in desmodesmus sp knua024 p24 and c24 also c sorokiniana knua071 had a similar fame composition in different wastewater conditions it was reported that genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis photosynthesis oxidative phosphorylation and tyrosine metabolism in chlorella were significantly down regulated under salt stress condition due to salt osmotic and toxic ionic stress 69 it was also demonstrated that the unsaturation of membrane fatty acids was responsible for regulating the membrane fluidity and permeability under a variety of saline conditions 88 89 hence the decrease in the unsaturated fatty acids could enhance membrane rigidity so that cellular integrity could be maintained this process could avoid an excessive flux of na and cl ions into cells and help to endure high salinity 89 however as shown in fig 3 no significant unsaturated fatty acid reduction in the roc grown c sorokiniana knua071 was observed in this study hence it is concluded that fame results depended on algal strains and not on type of wastewater which was not the case for proximate and ultimate analyses although several parameters included in the microalgal fame results complied with the astm 6751 and en14214 standards for biodiesel e g cfpp os υ and ρ none of the biomasses in this study met the cn value standards cn 47 for astm 3751 and cn 51 for en 14214 63 due to the high pufa contents 90 cn refers the ignition properties of a diesel 91 and provides information about ignition delay 92 however the additional experiment conducted to determine the optimum nitrogen to phosphorus ratio for c sorokiniana knua071 in roc ascertained that the cn value was proportional to higher nitrogen to phosphorus ratios in particular ratios of 7 1 12 1 and 17 1 were employed in the additional experiments and the latter resulted in a cn value of 47 1 which was satisfactory as astm d6751 standard cn 47 table s1 during the eight days of cultivation similar growth patterns and tn and tp removal rates were observed in all the tested ratios fig s1 these results may imply that a small amount of additional phosphorus supply to wastewater media could improve the biodiesel properties derived from the microalgal biomass this study investigated the capability of indigenous microalgal strains isolated from local reclamation facilities to efficiently remove excessive nutrients and metals from roc c sorokiniana knua071 showed a higher growth rate and nutrient removal efficiency than strain desmodesmus sp knua024 this strain was also verified in terms of its capability to not only biologically treat roc but also to remove pollutants in ps with growth and nutrient removal rates similar to those observed in desmodesmus sp knua024 in ps cultivations there are many microalgal strains that can thrive and efficiently remove nutrients 51 but only a limited number of microalgae can survive and reproduce in roc data not shown due to the presence of concentrated chemicals that may inhibit microalgal growth the rapid adaptation of c sorokiniana knua071 to the medium was the most important factor and noteworthy characteristic observed during the roc treatment in the present study even though the proximate and ultimate analysis results depended on the type of wastewater it seems that fatty acid profiles showed different traits based on strain type in addition the high ash contents detected in c sorokiniana knua071 represent an advantage for the use of algal biomass as a potential soil amendment agent since ashes contain abundant essential minerals needed by plants and crops overall the results of our study provide important information for the development of microalgae based

13473,the reverse osmosis system is one of the most advanced membrane based water treatment technologies that can convert a variety of wastewater into drinking and industrial water however it has major drawbacks including the production of a large amount of reject stream that contains concentrated nutrients microalgae are well known for their rapid growth and ability to consume excessive nutrients very efficiently under a variety of wastewater conditions in this study a locally isolated microalga chlorella sorokiniana knua071 was cultivated in reverse osmosis concentrate roc obtained from a municipal wastewater reclamation facility that contained high levels of nutrients ion and metal elements the aim was to investigate the potential of this microalga to be used in roc treatments and the related applications of its biomass results showed that the c sorokiniana knua071 could successfully remove 91 9 of total nitrogen tn 97 of total phosphorus 98 of mn 100 of al 64 of zn 62 of co and 50 of ni within 8 days yielding a biomass productivity of 0 9 g dry weight l 1 this study also compared the results obtained from the desmodesmus sp knua024 which was used in the treatment of primary settled wastewater ps in our previously research and was found to remove only 53 5 of tn in 8 days c sorokiniana knua071 biomass cultivated in the roc had 13 3 of lipid content while its biomass grown in the ps had 28 2 of lipid content the lipid contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 grown in the roc and ps were 29 3 and 27 1 respectively our findings suggest that microalgal cultivation could be employed as an effective strategy to remove nutrients and metals from roc and at the same time produce biofuel from the lipids accumulated in the algal biomass keywords reverse osmosis concentrate wastewater treatment microalgae biodiesel soil amendment 1 introduction wastewater treatment systems have contributed to ensuring public health and environmental protection since the late 19th century 1 3 however due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization occurring worldwide the volume and variety of water pollutants have shown a multifold increase over the past few decades studies reported that over 80 of all wastewater is discharged without proper treatment because of the excessive pace of demographic and economic growth worldwide 4 7 as a result water supply has become increasingly inadequate to meet agricultural domestic and industrial needs in many areas of the world 8 9 it was also estimated that more than five billion people could be subjected to hardship related to water shortage by 2050 due to climate change including increased water demand and contaminated water supplies 10 therefore water recycling and purification systems have gradually become one of the most important water treatment technologies and strategies in many regions facing water scarcity such as southeast asia and southern australia as well as the middle east and north africa 11 domestic greywater collected from the sewage discharge of bathtubs showers sinks and washing machines can be recycled to reduce household water requirements and the volume of effluents produced 12 industrial wastewater can also be treated recycled and reused through reverse osmosis ro techniques which involve a separation process that removes salt and or dissolved solids from a solution 13 14 this technology can be also used for seawater and brackish water desalination to produce both industrial and drinking water moreover it was proven efficient in treating a wide range of effluents derived from different industrial sources 13 the global market for ro technology is currently growing and is predicted to reach 11 0 billion usd by 2021 15 as it is constantly being improved and is becoming increasingly widespread in water treatment plants worldwide 16 however in spite of all these advantages ro treatments have substantial drawbacks as industrial wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc contains high concentrations of nutrients and potentially harmful organic compounds 17 since the reject streams of ro systems contain almost all the pollutants that present in the feed water at elevated concentrations 13 therefore there are growing concerns over the current methods that allow the discharge of untreated roc into the environment and that can pose a wide range of risks to ecosystems and human health in the long term 18 in order to remove roc numerous treatments biological or based on different processes such as adsorption 19 21 advanced oxidation processes aop i e ozonation and ozone based advanced oxidation 22 23 fenton oxidation 24 25 photocatalysis 26 28 uv h2o2 29 32 and electrochemical oxidation 33 36 and forward osmosis fo 37 39 have been extensively developed and utilized 15 17 recently biological treatments using bacteria fungi and microalgae have attracted increasing attention as possible alternatives to the conventional methods due to their promising potential 40 43 in particular microalgae based treatment technology is now an important emerging field targeting the removal of high concentrations of nitrogen n phosphorus p and organic contaminants 18 as microalgae are capable of growing rapidly in roc media and removing the nutrients more efficiently than other roc treatment methods can 44 46 in addition the algal biomass recovered from roc processes can be utilized as biofuel as microalgae can generate a large amount of carbon based fatty acids from carbon dioxide via photosynthesis 47 50 the object of this research was to investigate the efficiency of the locally isolated microalgal strains chlorella sorokiniana knua071 and desmodesmus sp knua024 in removing nutrients ions and metals from roc as well as from primary settled wastewater ps collected from municipal wastewater reclamation facilities algal growth and biomass productivity were monitored and the harvested biomass was then characterized for potential applications as biofuel 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater collection and characterization approximately 15 l of roc was collected from the pohang municipal wastewater treatment facility pohang

and growth conditions two microalgal strains in the early stationary phase desmodesmus sp knua024 which showed an excellent nutrient removal ability in primary sewage wastewater in our previous study 51 and chlorella sorokiniana knua071 which was isolated from the sincheon wastewater treatment plant and showed outstanding growth rates in the roc screening test data not shown were used in this experiment in order to determine whether the nutrient uptake and utilization by the two strains were limited only to roc or could be also applied to general wastewater treatments both ps and roc were included in this study in addition a bg 11 medium was also used as a positive control for algal cultivation in the preliminary test as the low tp concentration detected in the roc samples suppressed microalgal growth additional phosphorus stock solution was added to the roc in all experiments adjusting the final concentration to 4 5 mg l 1 the final tn tp ratio was adjusted to 13 which in within the range of the optimal tn tp ratios between 10 and 20 52 all experiments were performed at 25 c under a light dark cycle of 16 8 h 114 μmol m 2 s 1 of light intensity and using an orbital shaker at

ps and roc are shown in table 1 both wastewater samples had neutral ph values 7 06 for ps and 7 47 for roc respectively the tn concentration of roc was twice as high as that of ps but it contained less tp also roc had higher contents of every ion and metal elements compared to contents observed in ps and in particular sodium and chloride which affect wastewater salinity were considerably higher in roc than in ps minerals that were essential for microalgal growth and reproduction such as mg ca na cl zn mn and co were also higher in roc toxic heavy metals such as cd pb ti and sn were not detected in either roc or ps 3 2 measurement of growth rate and biomass productivity overall c sorokiniana knua071 showed a better growth pattern in roc than in ps and bg 11 fig 1 a b and it also showed a faster growth rate than desmodesmus sp knua024 in roc samples od and cell count number were highest 8 1 107 cells ml 1 od680 4 6 in strain knua071 c71 and lowest 0 3 107 cells ml 1 od680 1 2 in strain knua024 c24 respectively the specific growth rates are shown in table 2 microalgal cells were harvested after eight days of cultivation and chlorophylls total carotenoid contents and dry cell weight were measured in order to determine physicochemical properties and biomass productivity levels fig 1c d strain knua071 grown in the roc c71 showed the highest chlorophyll a and b contents while strain knua024 grown in the roc c24 showed the lowest these results were in agreement with the above mentioned experimental data od cell count number and μ as illustrated in fig 1c the chl a chl b and carotenoids contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 cultivated in the roc c24 were lower than those in the ps p24 contrarily the chl a and chl b contents of c sorokiniana knua071 in the roc c71 were higher than those of the ps grown knua071 p71 while the carotenoid content of knua071 in the roc c71 was slightly lower than that of the ps p71 as shown in fig 1d strains knua024 in bg 11 b24 and knua071 in roc c71 showed the two highest ranking biomass dry weight values respectively while strain knua071 grown in ps c71 3 3 measurement of nutrient removal efficiency decreased tn and tp concentrations were observed in all experiments fig 2 in roc c sorokiniana knua071 showed the highest nutrient removal efficiencies 91 9 of tn and 97 0 of tp whereas desmodesmus sp knua024 removed 53 5 and 96 9 of tn and tp respectively in contrast desmodesmus sp knua024 showed slightly higher removal efficiencies 89 4 of tn and 95 1 of tp than those shown by c sorokiniana knua071 80 8 of tn and 94 4 of tp when cultured in ps 3 4 ion and metal removal efficiency after cultivating both microalgal strains it was possible to observe that some ion and metal concentrations tended to decrease as shown in table 3 in ps desmodesmus sp knua024 removed 100 of mn 100 of zn 53 of rb and 23 of ni while c sorokiniana knau071 uptook 100 of mn 100 of zn 37 of ni and 31 of co in roc desmodesmus sp knua024 efficiently removed 100 of mn 100 of al 73 of zn 60 of co and 46 of ni while for c sorokiniana knua071 removal values were 98 of mn 100 of al 64 of zn 62 of co and 50 of ni however ba content was almost ten times higher in p24 and twice as high in p71 compared to the initial concentration before cultivation in addition a slight increase in the cl and na contents of both ps and roc was detected in all experiments 3 5 biochemical composition of microalgal biomass the predominant biochemical components of microalgal biomass varied based on strains and types of wastewater used for cultivation table 4 p24 had similar carbohydrate 30 4 and lipid 29 3 contents among all strain cultivations p71 showed the highest total carbohydrate contents 41 6 the lipid content of c24 27 1 was more than double that of protein 11 5 and c71 presented almost equal carbohydrate 23 0 and protein 23 1 contents 3 6 proximate and ultimate analysis the proximate analysis profiles differed depending on the type of wastewater used and not on the microalgal strain both strains showed typical ratios of moisture content mc volatile matter vm and fixed carbon fc ash in ps while decreased vm and considerably increased fc ash values were observed in roc the highest volatile matter was detected in p71 measuring 93 8 and the highest fixed carbon and ash contents were detected in c71 with a value of 26 6 in addition the highest cv was observed in p24 reaching 22 3 mj kg 1 table 5 3 7 analysis of the fatty acid methyl ester contents analysis of the fatty acid contents of the microalgal biomass showed palmitic c16 0 oleic c18 1 and α linolenic c18 3 acids as the predominant components fig 3 c16 0 was the most abundant fatty acid in three microalgal biomasses p24 p71 and c71 except for c24 in which the most abundant acid was c18 3 fatty acid composition differed based on microalgal strains rather than wastewater type c16 3 and c18 4 were only found in desmodesmus sp knua024 p24 and c24 3 8 biodiesel quality assessment based on the fatty acid composition of each microalgal biomass the theoretical biofuel properties including sv iv cn du cfpp os kinematic viscosity υ and density ρ were estimated using the astm and en standards for biodiesel table 6 the values of several parameters such as cfpp os kinematic viscosity and density were considered suitable for biodiesel production while iv and cn values were outside the standards ranges iv 120 cn 47 for astm 3751 and cn 51 for en 14214 4 discussion the tp concentration of roc sourced from the pohang wastewater reclamation facility was only 0 87 mg l 1 which was considered too low to cultivate microalgae sustainably in order to eliminate possible limitations caused by phosphorus deficiency in the culture experiments additional phosphorus was supplied to the roc until a final concentration of 4 5 mg l 1 was obtained the tn tp ratio of the roc was adjusted to 13 since it is generally considered that the optimal tn tp ratios for microalgae culture range from 10 to 20 52 after preliminary screening tests c sorokiniana knua071 was selected as the candidate strain for roc treatment while desmodesmus sp knua024 was chosen because it had already been verified as an elite strain for primary settled wastewater treatment in our previous study 51 to investigate if the wastewater treatment capability of the newly isolated strain knua071 could only be limited to roc ps was included in this cultivation study so that a direct comparison between treatments could be made after cultivating both microalgal strains in ps and roc it was possible to observe that c sorokiniana knua071 showed better growth parameters specifically od cell count numbers chlorophyll and carotenoid contents compared to desmodesmus sp knua024 the rapid growth rate of the genus chlorella is a well known and advantageous trait and roc treatments using chlorella spp had already been attempted in recent studies 18 44 46 c sorokiniana knua071 showed higher od and cell density values during cultivation in roc than in bg 11 which is normally considered as an optimum culture medium but the biomass productivity of the two cultures was similar on the other hand the growth parameters of the c sorokiniana knua071 cultivation in ps were not as high as those of the corresponding roc cultivation it appears that this is a species or probably strain specific trait that confers tolerance and preference to high salt concentration in particular several chlorella spp have been reported that they are able to endure at high nacl concentrations up to 5 g l 1 nacl 65 up to 20 g l 1 nacl 66 67 and even up to 30 g l 1 nacl 68 69 it has been shown that chlorella and scenedesmus spp accumulated lipid 70 71 and carbohydrate under salt stress conditions 72 however both lipid and carbohydrate contents of c sorokiniana knua071 cultured in the roc were significantly lower than those in the ps this suggests the current nacl concentration 2 7 g l 1 in the roc is not a stress inducing condition that can trigger lipid and carbohydrate accumulation in c sorokiniana knua071 in addition it has also been demonstrated that the chl a chl b and carotenoid contents declined greatly under salt stress conditions in chlorella 69 and scenedesmus 72 however the chl a and chl b contents of c sorokiniana knua071 in the roc were higher than those in the ps it was also reported that ratio of chl a b or carotenoids total chl significantly increased with the increasement of the salinity which is an indirect indication of salinity induced oxidative stress and reduced photosystem ii activity 72 high ratios of chl a b or carotenoids total chl also suggest reduction in the antenna size that may protect algal cells from oxidative damage again the chl a b and carotenoids chl a b of c sorokiniana knua071 grown in the roc were lower than those in the ps as shown in table s2 therefore we came up with the conclusion that c sorokiniana knua071 is a halotolerant microalgal isolate and the nacl concentration of 2 7 g l 1 in the roc does not have a negative effect on this microalga this suggests a clear possibility of using c sorokiniana knua071 for microalgal roc treatments in contrast the growth patterns of desmodesmus sp knua024 were practically opposite to those of strain knua071 desmodesmus sp knua024 grew similarly in all three different media ps roc and bg 11 throughout the cultivation periods our results showed that c sorokiniana knua071 was able to remove 91 9 of tn and 97 0 of tp within eight days mohseni et al 18 demonstrated that c vulgaris and nannochloropsis salina could remove 50 of tn and 80 of tp in their semi continuous roc treatment wang et al 44 also showed that 89 of tn and 92 of tp were successfully removed from roc in their 20 day batch experiment using the chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp strains furthermore maeng et al 73 showed that algal treatment of synthetic roc using scenedesmus quadricauda resulted in the removal of 19 of tn and 95 of tp in a 3 day batch test therefore it can be concluded that the c sorokiniana knua071 strain could be an excellent candidate for microalgae based roc treatments it is expected that under optimal conditions cultivation periods of strain knua071 could be shortened in our previous study 51 desmodesmus sp knua024 showed better tn and tp removal rates in ps than other local candidate strains however this strain showed a poor tn removal capability in roc compared to c sorokiniana knua071 which proved highly efficient instead this poor performance may be explained by the possible presence of other limiting factors such as concentrated sodium and chloride affecting the growth of desmodesmus sp knua024 in roc while these elevated concentrations of na and cl did not have major effects on the growth of c sorokiniana knua071 the chl a chl b and carotenoid contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 in the roc were significantly lower than those in the ps this indicates the preference of desmodesmus sp knua024 to the ps over the roc that contains high concentrations of na and cl the two microalgal strains were able to remove large amounts of mn ni and zn from roc also co was efficiently eliminated during roc cultivation experiments with both strains our results indicate that microalgal cultivation could also be applied to remove various metal species in particular toxic heavy metals such as co cr and rb since many microalgae including chlorella were shown to fix metals from wastewater through various mechanisms such as physical adsorption chelation chemisorption ion exchange precipitation and crystallization 74 75 even though an unexpected ba increase was observed in ps samples after cultivation a significant amount of ba was removed from roc by culturing both strains cl and na concentrations in both ps and roc remained almost the same in all experiments suggesting that the elevated levels of these ions had little or no effect on the growth and productivity of microalgae in wastewater microalgae especially species belonging to the genus chlorella are usually rich in protein which is a well known property of many eukaryotic microalgae 76 however in our study the algal biomass protein contents were relatively low in all experiments even though the n p ratios of the ps 17 and roc 13 fell into the range for optimal growth conditions of microalgae 10 20 52 these ratios may not be the ideal conditions for high protein production for the tested microalgae strains it was demonstrated that the protein contents of microalgae at the n p ratios of 20 to 30 were higher than other n p ratios 77 therefore it is assumed that higher protein contents in microalgae could be achieved by adding less phosphorus to the roc nevertheless it should also be noted that the level of phosphorus in the roc should not be below the growth limiting concentrations lipid contents of desmodesmus sp knua024 cultivated in the ps and roc were 29 3 and 27 1 respectively while lipid contents of c sorokiniana knua071 grown in the ps and roc were 28 2 and 13 3 there was a little change in lipid production in desmodesmus sp knua024 in the ps and roc while the lipid content of c sorokiniana knua071 was more than doubled when cultivated in the ps than in the roc it was reported that high lipid accumulation can be induced by high n p ratios in certain microalgal species and high n p ratios indicate a p limiting condition 77 since it is generally assumed that phytoplankton are under n limited condition at n p 16 and they are under p limited conditions at n p 16 based on the redfield ratio 78 the ps is close to a p replete condition and the roc is an n replete conditions respectively in accordance with our results with c sorokiniana knua071 chlorella sp accumulated a high content of lipids under high n p ratios p limitations compared to the lower n p ratios n limitations 79 however it is also presumed that lipid accumulation in desmodesmus sp knua024 was not affected greatly by high n p ratios from our results therefore this trait could be species specific on the other hand both strains exhibited a significant increase in carbohydrate content under the p starvation condition ps compared to n starvation condition roc it was shown that carbohydrate content of c vulgaris was increased to 55 under p limiting condition 80 81 further cultivation studies are needed to reveal and understand the effect of different n p ratios on biochemical compositions of these strains including further taxonomic identification of desmodesmus sp knua024 to species level in the proximate analysis by tga the microalgal biomass harvested from ps had a relatively low mc and high volatile matter indicating its combustion efficiency and preservation of nutritional integrity 82 however the roc grown microalgal biomass possessed considerably higher fixed carbon ash contents than those seen in the ps grown biomass these could be attributed to a high concentration of ion and metal elements present in the roc consequently when comparing roc and ps cultivations the roc grown algal biomass also presented lower carbon contents it seems that relatively low volatile matter contents in the roc grown biomass may deteriorate the quality of the subsequently obtained microalgal biofuels as vm is a very important parameter affecting combustion processes 83 nevertheless high ash contents were observed in the roc grown biomass in all experiments and these can be used as an effective soil amendment material as ashes contain abundant essential micronutrients it should be noted that pretreatment with ammonium formate is required when measuring dry weight of microalgae cultured in saline and hypersaline media in order to eliminate possible overestimation 84 however the salinities measured as nacl content of the roc and ps were 0 046 m nacl and 0 002 m nacl respectively and these values were not within the range of 0 05 0 2 m nacl 84 therefore possible overestimation that may have been caused by skipping the ammonium formate washing in this study could be neglectable the most abundant fatty acids detected in the microalgal biomass of both strains in ps and roc cultivations were c16 0 c18 1 and c18 3 also pufas were major fatty acids present in the biomass across all experiments accounting for over 40 of the total these c16 to 18 fatty acids are the major fatty acid components in chlorella spp 79 85 86 and desmodesmus sp 51 the abundance of c16 c18 fatty acids is commonly observed in most green microalgae chlorophyta 87 however c16 3 and c18 4 were only found in desmodesmus sp knua024 p24 and c24 also c sorokiniana knua071 had a similar fame composition in different wastewater conditions it was reported that genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis photosynthesis oxidative phosphorylation and tyrosine metabolism in chlorella were significantly down regulated under salt stress condition due to salt osmotic and toxic ionic stress 69 it was also demonstrated that the unsaturation of membrane fatty acids was responsible for regulating the membrane fluidity and permeability under a variety of saline conditions 88 89 hence the decrease in the unsaturated fatty acids could enhance membrane rigidity so that cellular integrity could be maintained this process could avoid an excessive flux of na and cl ions into cells and help to endure high salinity 89 however as shown in fig 3 no significant unsaturated fatty acid reduction in the roc grown c sorokiniana knua071 was observed in this study hence it is concluded that fame results depended on algal strains and not on type of wastewater which was not the case for proximate and ultimate analyses although several parameters included in the microalgal fame results complied with the astm 6751 and en14214 standards for biodiesel e g cfpp os υ and ρ none of the biomasses in this study met the cn value standards cn 47 for astm 3751 and cn 51 for en 14214 63 due to the high pufa contents 90 cn refers the ignition properties of a diesel 91 and provides information about ignition delay 92 however the additional experiment conducted to determine the optimum nitrogen to phosphorus ratio for c sorokiniana knua071 in roc ascertained that the cn value was proportional to higher nitrogen to phosphorus ratios in particular ratios of 7 1 12 1 and 17 1 were employed in the additional experiments and the latter resulted in a cn value of 47 1 which was satisfactory as astm d6751 standard cn 47 table s1 during the eight days of cultivation similar growth patterns and tn and tp removal rates were observed in all the tested ratios fig s1 these results may imply that a small amount of additional phosphorus supply to wastewater media could improve the biodiesel properties derived from the microalgal biomass this study investigated the capability of indigenous microalgal strains isolated from local reclamation facilities to efficiently remove excessive nutrients and metals from roc c sorokiniana knua071 showed a higher growth rate and nutrient removal efficiency than strain desmodesmus sp knua024 this strain was also verified in terms of its capability to not only biologically treat roc but also to remove pollutants in ps with growth and nutrient removal rates similar to those observed in desmodesmus sp knua024 in ps cultivations there are many microalgal strains that can thrive and efficiently remove nutrients 51 but only a limited number of microalgae can survive and reproduce in roc data not shown due to the presence of concentrated chemicals that may inhibit microalgal growth the rapid adaptation of c sorokiniana knua071 to the medium was the most important factor and noteworthy characteristic observed during the roc treatment in the present study even though the proximate and ultimate analysis results depended on the type of wastewater it seems that fatty acid profiles showed different traits based on strain type in addition the high ash contents detected in c sorokiniana knua071 represent an advantage for the use of algal biomass as a potential soil amendment agent since ashes contain abundant essential minerals needed by plants and crops overall the results of our study provide important information for the development of microalgae based roc treatments and utilization of the resulting biomass microalgae are a promising alternative to be used for post biological treatments in an integrated process comprising fo pre coagulation and aop providing the additional benefits of lower energy consumption and costs 15 as microalgae based treatment technology grows and its efficiency increases future investigations of microalgal biomass are

and then dried in air at room temperature 25 c finally the fabricated fiber membrane precursors were calcined in muffle furnace ksl 1700 hf kejing china for 2 h at 600 c to remove residual water and organic polymers the precursor fibers were then sintered up to final dwelling temperatures in the range of 800 1100 c for 3 h to get the spinel ceramic membranes 2 3 membrane characterization the

water permeability of spinel membrane was measured through a dead end filtration apparatus at an operating pressure of 0 2 bar before the experiments each sample was ultrasonically cleaned with ethanol for at least 5 min three measurements were carried out to obtain average values 2 4 performance evaluation the separation performance for o w emulsions and real oily wastewaters were measured

conversion mechanism for spinel membrane formation probing the formation mechanism of cual2o4 spinel phase is crucial for membrane fabrication via high temperature reaction between cuo and bauxite mineral using xrd technique its formation evolution can be divided into three distinct stages i e rapid formation complete conversion and minor decomposition fig 1 the first stage spinel rapid formation took place between 800 c and 970 c where phase content of cual2o4 pdf 33 0448 fig 1a rapidly increased from 0 wt to 76 wt fig 1b while those of cuo from 21 wt to 2 wt and al2o3 from 72 wt to 1 6 wt were simultaneously decreased this can be also confirmed by increased intensity of two major reflections at 2θ 36 87 311 and 31 29 220 of cual2o4 phase the nucleation of spinel crystals originated from the solid interface between cuo and alumina mullite derived from bauxite mineral where cu and al ions steadily diffused into spinel lattice to keep continuous crystal growth fig 2 it is noted that mullite was consumed from 39 wt to 20 4 wt at 940 970 c fig 1b and that the formation of spinel significantly increased due to the facilitated mass transfer and phase reaction induced by amorphous liquid phase sio2 27 the second stage with a completed conversion occurred at 970 1060 c with increasing sintering temperature to 1000 c an almost complete conversion of cual2o4 spinel was achieved 92 wt fig 1b without the presence of other phases the as formed cual2o4 spinel has excellent acidic stability leaching concentration as low as 126 mg l which is much better than original cuo 1321 5 mg l fig s4b even in acidic aqueous environment ph 2 9 this conclusion can be also supported by its excellent microstructural stability sem images fig s4a of cual2o4 particles before and after leaching processes the characteristics indicated that bauxite was a promising and cost effective candidate for the formation of cual2o4 via thermal conversion method the third stage minor decomposition occurred at a temperature of 1060 1100 c above 1060 c the minor decomposition of cual2o4 spinel occurred via a conversion from cual2o4 89 4 wt to cualo2 pdf 77 2493 2 5 wt and cuo 8 1 wt fig 1b in the solid interface cu and al ions diffused between cual2o4 and al2o3 to convert cualo2 and cuo eventually this is different from the reported results that cuo generated from cual2o4 would be decomposed to cu2o and o2 20 this might be explained by the high porosity and sufficient o2 atmosphere of the fabrication process of spinel hollow fiber membrane a deep understanding can be gained for the phase reaction mechanism between cuo and bauxite mineral through a schematic diagram where 970 1060 c was considered as the stage for spinel complete formation fig 2 3 2 surface properties and structure of spinel membrane besides spinel phase content tailoring pore structure is crucial for ceramic membranes with separation function the spinel membranes were prepared with 90 vol ethanol and 10 vol water mixture as external coagulant at a fixed solid state loading of 60 wt bore fluid flow rate of 20 ml min air gap distance of 20 cm and n2 pressure of 0 03 mpa respectively then membrane properties were optimized at different sintering temperatures such as morphology and mechanical strength figs s5 and s6 the optimized cual2o4 membrane sintered at 970 c featured a long finger like macro voids layer 67 5 and sponge like layer 32 5 with outer inner diameter and thickness as 1 40 1 00 mm and 0 20 mm fig 3a at 970 c the porosities of outer inner and fractured surface sponge like region were 22 54 23 33 and 21 05 respectively which all decreased with increasing temperatures fig 3b this is attributed to the conversion of bauxite and cuo into molten mullite and cual2o4 at higher temperature with increasing temperature lower than 970 c the sintering induced coalescence of fine particles into coarse ones resulted in an increase of pore size porosity n2 permeance and water permeability above 970 c with further increasing temperature enhanced bulk densification with pore shrinkage led to their rapid decreases the average pore size and n2 permeance were determined to be 0 625 μm and 2272 09 65 84 m3 m2 h bar fig 3c and d while water permeability was 8525 15 1979 l m2 h bar at 970 c fig 3e moreover in spite of being sintered at a much lower temperature of 970 c compared to 1200 1800 c that is typically used for current ceramic membranes the spinel membrane still had high packing density 3568 m2 m3 and sufficient mechanical strength 31 77 3 74 mpa figs 3f and s6 compared to conventional ceramic membranes the spinel membranes are more cost competitive table s3 due to the use of low cost raw materials and lower sintering temperature with a relatively high packing density fig 3f therefore the spinel membranes sintered at 970 c were selected in the following studies considering its low conversion temperature high spinel phase content sufficient mechanical strength and gas water permeability since understanding the surface property of ceramic membranes is important for oily wastewater treatment structure characterizations were performed such as fe sem images afm ftir and xps interestingly a superhydrophilic wca 1 0 0 4 porous structure was formed for cual2o4 spinel membrane which is more hydrophilic than nial2o4 membrane fig 4a 23 roughness of cual2o4 spinel membrane was 178 nm fig 4b the ftir spectra further confirmed the variation of the key functional groups of cual2o4 spinel membrane during the phase conversion process 800 c 1000 c and 1100 c fig 4c from 800 to 1000 c a significant decrease in peak intensity of al o 465 cm 1 can be further ascribed to the spinel conversion reaction between al2o3 and cuo meanwhile an increased peak intensity of si o si 1094 cm 1 can be attributed to the formation of amorphous silicon derived from the reaction between mullite and cuo the wide peaks ranging from 3654 to 3239 cm 1 and at 1633 cm 1 correspond to the bending and stretching vibration of adsorbed water molecules 31 the bands at 920 cm 1 and 1190 cm 1 were assigned to the vibrations of cu oh and al oh bonds respectively copper and aluminum hydroxyl groups were able to act as proton acceptors in the interactions with water molecules to form hydrogen bonds 32 endowing good hydrophilicity and consequently anti fouling properties of spinel ceramic membranes for o w emulsions separation fig 4c xps survey spectrum shows the presence of cu o si c and al fig 4d from xps results fig s7 the cu 2p3 2 peaks at 932 9 934 7 ev and 940 945 ev were attributed to the presence of cu2 of cual2o4 spinel lattice 33 while the peak al 2p at 73 9 ev this proves that cu2 were completely chemically incorporated into the cual2o4 spinel lattice to realize heavy metal stability during the o w separation 3 3 separation performance for o w emulsions 3 3 1 effect of o w emulsion types in this study the separation performance and fouling behavior of spinel membranes were first studied with different o w emulsion types including soybean oil pump oil and engine oil fig 5 the spinel membranes could perform well for the treatment of light oils soybean oil and pump oil with an oil concentration of 500 mg l featuring high oil rejection soybean oil 93 3 94 3 pump oil 98 4 99 1 stabilized water permeate flux soybean oil 169 185 l m2 h bar pump oil 127 136 l m2 h bar fig 5a in contrast for treatment of heavy oil engine oil in spite of comparable oil rejection 95 9 96 6 lower permeate flux 88 96 l m2 h bar fig 5a was obtained with severer membrane fouling fig 5e for the three types of o w emulsions permeate flux declined dramatically in the initial stages 20 min because oil droplets were rapidly accumulated on the membrane surface and blocked inside membrane pores the water flux decline ratio fdr and flux recovery ratio frr of spinel membranes were further assessed to analyze separation performance fouling behavior and regeneration ability fig 5b compared with engine oil frr 70 78 fdr 60 73 the treatment performance for soybean oil exhibited the higher frr 93 100 and lower fdr 49 52 fig 5b this may be attributed to the lower viscosity of soybean oils 21 6 mpa s table s4 which can be also supported by mitigated fouling fig 5c therefore the spinel membranes exhibited enhanced permeate flux with mitigated membrane fouling especially for light oils i e soybean oil 3 3 2 effect of ph values since inorganic ceramic membranes can offer outstanding chemical acid base resistance 34 separation performance and fouling behavior of spinel membranes were studied for emulsions in harsh environments with wide ph values ph 4 12 in this study the ph values of emulsions had significant impacts on membrane performance especially flux and fouling behavior at acidic conditions ph 4 the permeate flux decreased dramatically at both initial and steady stages fig 6a this phenomenon was attributed to an electrostatic attraction mechanism between spinel membranes positively charged and oil droplets negatively charged resulting in severe membrane fouling fig 6b quantification of electrostatic interaction energy u owm el was performed as a function of the distance between oil droplets and membrane surface fig 6c by using the derjaguin s technique 35 the surface charges varied with ph values which in most cases are negatively charged only except for ph 4 fig 6b with increasing ph value ph 6 12 fig 6c electrostatic repulsion interaction between negatively charged membrane and oil droplets played an important role in mitigating membrane fouling fig 6e and f resulting in enhanced initial and steady permeate flux fig 6a this phenomenon is of great significance for practical separation application of real oily emulsion wastewaters that are strong alkaline in certain industries application of spinel membrane for purifying alkaline oily wastewaters would be expected to show not only good structural robustness but lower fouling with promising performance in addition after 4 cycle operation the concentrations of leached copper ions in the permeate were also measured by icp oes which are both lower than the criterion values drinking water quality who at ph 8 and 12 fig s8 confirming the excellent stability and risk free application of such spinel membranes even in strongly alkaline conditions 3 3 3 separation performance for real oily wastewater different from synthetic oily emulsions treatment of real oily wastewaters is a challenge due to its complicated components in most cases in our study real oily wastewaters average oil droplet size 469 nm zeta potential 3 93 mv exhibited high alkalinity ph 12 3 and high oil concentration 4341 mg l table s5 and fig s9 under optimum operating conditions the spinel membranes exhibited steady permeate flux 37 47 l m2 h bar and high frr 92 8 93 8 during 4 cycle operation fig 7a after a simple backwashing procedure initial permeate flux can be restored almost completely indicating a promising reusable and recycling ability moreover an integrated non destructive membrane surface also showed the excellent structural robustness fig 7b and c in addition an oil rejection 94 36 was achieved with a significant decrease in oil concentration in spite of promising application potential for harsh real oily wastewaters systematical investigation will be performed to further optimize treatment performance 4 conclusion in this study a waste to resource protocol was proposed for rational design of spinel membranes simultaneously coupling copper bearing waste recycling and oily wastewater treatment spinel ceramic hollow fiber membranes were prepared from bauxite and cuo simulated copper bearing sludge via the phase inversion and sintering method for such membranes spinel phase was steadily formed via solid state reactions between cuo and al2o3 major or mullite minor at 970 1060 c but slightly decomposed above this temperature windows after optimization at different spinning and sintering parameters the membranes exhibited excellent structure and surface properties such as superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity suitable porosity and pore size sufficient permeability and mechanical strength enhanced flux with mitigated oil fouling was achieved especially for light oils even for heavy oils i e engine oil permeate flux 180 200 l m2 h bar was enhanced with mitigated fouling at alkaline condition efficient separation was achieved for not only synthetic oily emulsion but real wastewater this work confirms the feasibility of recycling hazardous metal bearing sludges into low cost ceramic membranes for economic oily wastewater treatment applications

ethanol for at least 5 min three measurements were carried out to obtain average values 2 4 performance evaluation the separation performance for o w emulsions and real oily wastewaters were measured by a cross flow filtration system fig s3 the o w emulsions 500 mg l were synthesized by adding 500 mg oil and 100 mg sds into 1 l deionized water followed by ultrasonication for 40 min and magnetic stirring for 24 h the separation performance of spinel membrane was studied with different o w emulsion types including light oils e g soybean oil vacuum pump oil 100 and heavy oil e g 10 w 40 sn engine oil the permeates were collected at regular intervals of 10 min at a constant trans membrane pressure 0 5 bar for a total period of 400 min 4 cycles at room temperature 25 c to investigate the regeneration ability of spinel membranes after each separation cycle the membranes were back washed through 0 1 wt naoh solution for 5 min then with deionized water for 20 30 min the permeate flux j l m2 h and oil rejection r can be calculated according to the following equations 1 j δm a ρ δt 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where m a and t are the mass of the permeate g the effective membrane area m2 and the operating time h respectively and ρ is the water density 0 9970 kg l 25 c c f mg l and c p mg l represent oil concentrations of the feed and permeate respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 conversion mechanism for spinel membrane formation probing the formation mechanism of cual2o4 spinel phase is crucial for membrane fabrication via high temperature reaction between cuo and bauxite mineral using xrd technique its formation evolution can be divided into three distinct stages i e rapid formation complete conversion and minor decomposition fig 1 the first stage spinel rapid formation took place between 800 c and 970 c where phase content of cual2o4 pdf 33 0448 fig 1a rapidly increased from 0 wt to 76 wt fig 1b while those of cuo from 21 wt to 2 wt and al2o3 from 72 wt to 1 6 wt were simultaneously decreased this can be also confirmed by increased intensity of two major reflections at 2θ 36 87 311 and 31 29 220 of cual2o4 phase the nucleation of spinel crystals originated from the solid interface between cuo and alumina mullite derived from bauxite mineral where cu and al ions steadily diffused into spinel lattice to keep continuous crystal growth fig 2 it is noted that mullite was consumed from 39 wt to 20 4 wt at 940 970 c fig 1b and that the formation of spinel significantly increased due to the facilitated mass transfer and phase reaction induced by amorphous liquid phase sio2 27 the second stage with a completed conversion occurred at 970 1060 c with increasing sintering temperature to 1000 c an almost complete conversion of cual2o4 spinel was achieved 92 wt fig 1b without the presence of other phases the as formed cual2o4 spinel has excellent acidic stability leaching concentration as low as 126 mg l which is much better than original cuo 1321 5 mg l fig s4b even in acidic aqueous environment ph 2 9 this conclusion can be also supported by its excellent microstructural stability sem images fig s4a of cual2o4 particles before and after leaching processes the characteristics indicated that bauxite was a promising and cost effective candidate for the formation of cual2o4 via thermal conversion method the third stage minor decomposition occurred at a temperature of 1060 1100 c above 1060 c the minor decomposition of cual2o4 spinel occurred via a conversion from cual2o4 89 4 wt to cualo2 pdf 77 2493 2 5 wt and cuo 8 1 wt fig 1b in the solid interface cu and al ions diffused between cual2o4 and al2o3 to convert cualo2 and cuo eventually this is different from the reported results that cuo generated from cual2o4 would be decomposed to cu2o and o2 20 this might be explained by the high porosity and sufficient o2 atmosphere of the fabrication process of spinel hollow fiber membrane a deep understanding can be gained for the phase reaction mechanism between cuo and bauxite mineral through a schematic diagram where 970 1060 c was considered as the stage for spinel complete formation fig 2 3 2 surface properties and structure of spinel membrane besides spinel phase content tailoring pore structure is crucial for ceramic membranes with separation function the spinel membranes were prepared with 90 vol ethanol and 10 vol water mixture as external coagulant at a fixed solid state loading of 60 wt bore fluid flow rate of 20 ml min air gap distance of 20 cm and n2 pressure of 0 03 mpa respectively then membrane properties were optimized at different sintering temperatures such as morphology and mechanical strength figs s5 and s6 the optimized cual2o4 membrane sintered at 970 c featured a long finger like macro voids layer 67 5 and sponge like layer 32 5 with outer inner diameter and thickness as 1 40 1 00 mm and 0 20 mm fig 3a at 970 c the porosities of outer inner and fractured surface sponge like region were 22 54 23 33 and 21 05 respectively which all decreased with increasing temperatures fig 3b this is attributed to the conversion of bauxite and cuo into molten mullite and cual2o4 at higher temperature with increasing temperature lower than 970 c the sintering induced coalescence of fine particles into coarse ones resulted in an increase of pore size porosity n2 permeance and water permeability above 970 c with further increasing temperature enhanced bulk densification with pore shrinkage led to their rapid decreases the average pore size and n2 permeance were determined to be 0 625 μm and 2272 09 65 84 m3 m2 h bar fig 3c and d while water permeability was 8525 15 1979 l m2 h bar at 970 c fig 3e moreover in spite of being sintered at a much lower temperature of 970 c compared to 1200 1800 c that is typically used for current ceramic membranes the spinel membrane still had high packing density 3568 m2 m3 and sufficient mechanical strength 31 77 3 74 mpa figs 3f and s6 compared to conventional ceramic membranes the spinel membranes are more cost competitive table s3 due to the use of low cost raw materials and lower sintering temperature with a relatively high packing density fig 3f therefore the spinel membranes sintered at 970 c were selected in the following studies considering its low conversion temperature high spinel phase content sufficient mechanical strength and gas water permeability since understanding the surface property of ceramic membranes is important for oily wastewater treatment structure characterizations were performed such as fe sem images afm ftir and xps interestingly a superhydrophilic wca 1 0 0 4 porous structure was formed for cual2o4 spinel membrane which is more hydrophilic than nial2o4 membrane fig 4a 23 roughness of cual2o4 spinel membrane was 178 nm fig 4b the ftir spectra further confirmed the variation of the key functional groups of cual2o4 spinel membrane during the phase conversion process 800 c 1000 c and 1100 c fig 4c from 800 to 1000 c a significant decrease in peak intensity of al o 465 cm 1 can be further ascribed to the spinel conversion reaction between al2o3 and cuo meanwhile an increased peak intensity of si o si 1094 cm 1 can be attributed to the formation of amorphous silicon derived from the reaction between mullite and cuo the wide peaks ranging from 3654 to 3239 cm 1 and at 1633 cm 1 correspond to the bending and stretching vibration of adsorbed water molecules 31 the bands at 920 cm 1 and 1190 cm 1 were assigned to the vibrations of cu oh and al oh bonds respectively copper and aluminum hydroxyl groups were able to act as proton acceptors in the interactions with water molecules to form hydrogen bonds 32 endowing good hydrophilicity and consequently anti fouling properties of spinel ceramic membranes for o w emulsions separation fig 4c xps survey spectrum shows the presence of cu o si c and al fig 4d from xps results fig s7 the cu 2p3 2 peaks at 932 9 934 7 ev and 940 945 ev were attributed to the presence of cu2 of cual2o4 spinel lattice 33 while the peak al 2p at 73 9 ev this proves that cu2 were completely chemically incorporated into the cual2o4 spinel lattice to realize heavy metal stability during the o w separation 3 3 separation performance for o w emulsions 3 3 1 effect of o w emulsion types in this study the separation performance and fouling behavior of spinel membranes were first studied with different o w emulsion types including soybean oil pump oil and engine oil fig 5 the spinel membranes could perform well for the treatment of light oils soybean oil and pump oil with an oil concentration of 500 mg l featuring high oil rejection soybean oil 93 3 94 3 pump oil 98 4 99 1 stabilized water permeate flux soybean oil 169 185 l m2 h bar pump oil 127 136 l m2 h bar fig 5a in contrast for treatment of heavy oil engine oil in spite of comparable oil rejection 95 9 96 6 lower permeate flux 88 96 l m2 h bar fig 5a was obtained with severer membrane fouling fig 5e for the three types of o w emulsions permeate flux declined dramatically in the initial stages 20 min because oil droplets were rapidly accumulated on the membrane surface and blocked inside membrane pores the water flux decline ratio fdr and flux recovery ratio frr of spinel membranes were further assessed to analyze separation performance fouling behavior and regeneration ability fig 5b compared with engine oil frr 70 78 fdr 60 73 the treatment performance for soybean oil exhibited the higher frr 93 100 and lower fdr 49 52 fig 5b this may be attributed to the lower viscosity of soybean oils 21 6 mpa s table s4 which can be also supported by mitigated fouling fig 5c therefore the spinel membranes exhibited enhanced permeate flux with mitigated membrane fouling especially for light oils i e soybean oil 3 3 2 effect of ph values since inorganic ceramic membranes can offer outstanding chemical acid base resistance 34 separation performance and fouling behavior of spinel membranes were studied for emulsions in harsh environments with wide ph values ph 4 12 in this study the ph values of emulsions had significant impacts on membrane performance especially flux and fouling behavior at acidic conditions ph 4 the permeate flux decreased dramatically at both initial and steady stages fig 6a this phenomenon was attributed to an electrostatic attraction mechanism between spinel membranes positively charged and oil droplets negatively charged resulting in severe membrane fouling fig 6b quantification of electrostatic interaction energy u owm el was performed as a function of the distance between oil droplets and membrane surface fig 6c by using the derjaguin s technique 35 the surface charges varied with ph values which in most cases are negatively charged only except for ph 4 fig 6b with increasing ph value ph 6 12 fig 6c electrostatic repulsion interaction between negatively charged membrane and oil droplets played an important role in mitigating membrane fouling fig 6e and f resulting in enhanced initial and steady permeate flux fig 6a this phenomenon is of great significance for practical separation application of real oily emulsion wastewaters that are strong alkaline in certain industries application of spinel membrane for purifying alkaline oily wastewaters would be expected to show not only good structural robustness but lower fouling with promising performance in addition after 4 cycle operation the concentrations of leached copper ions in the permeate were also measured by icp oes which are both lower than the criterion values drinking water quality who at ph 8 and 12 fig s8 confirming the excellent stability and risk free application of such spinel membranes even in strongly alkaline conditions 3 3 3 separation performance for real oily wastewater different from synthetic oily emulsions treatment of real oily wastewaters is a challenge due to its complicated components in most cases in our study real oily wastewaters average oil droplet size 469 nm zeta potential 3 93 mv exhibited high alkalinity ph 12 3 and high oil concentration 4341 mg l table s5 and fig s9 under optimum operating conditions the spinel membranes exhibited steady permeate flux 37 47 l m2 h bar and high frr 92 8 93 8 during 4 cycle operation fig 7a after a simple backwashing procedure initial permeate flux can be restored almost completely indicating a promising reusable and recycling ability moreover an integrated non destructive membrane surface also showed the excellent structural robustness fig 7b and c in addition an oil rejection 94 36 was achieved with a significant decrease in oil concentration in spite of promising application potential for harsh real oily wastewaters systematical investigation will be performed to further optimize treatment performance 4 conclusion in this study a waste to resource protocol was proposed for rational design of spinel membranes simultaneously coupling copper bearing waste recycling and oily wastewater treatment spinel ceramic hollow fiber membranes were prepared from bauxite and cuo simulated copper bearing sludge via the phase inversion and sintering method for such membranes spinel phase was steadily formed via solid state reactions between cuo and al2o3 major or mullite minor at 970 1060 c but slightly decomposed above this temperature windows after optimization at different spinning and sintering parameters the membranes exhibited excellent structure and surface properties such as superhydrophilicity underwater superoleophobicity suitable porosity and pore size sufficient permeability and mechanical strength enhanced flux with mitigated oil fouling was achieved especially for light oils even for heavy oils i e engine oil permeate flux 180 200 l m2 h bar was enhanced with mitigated fouling at alkaline condition efficient separation was achieved for not only synthetic oily emulsion but real wastewater this work confirms the feasibility of recycling hazardous metal bearing sludges into low cost ceramic membranes for economic oily wastewater treatment applications
