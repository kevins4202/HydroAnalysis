3740,perceptual catchment models are a key first step towards hydrologic synthesis and provide the process foundation of predictive models however their development is usually limited to the headwater catchment scale where field work can be done here we develop a perceptual model approach for a regional scale catchment we use a systematic top down approach based on an expert driven interpretation of the streamflow responses of nested subcatchments this approach complements the traditional bottom up perceptual model development based on fieldwork observations which is impractical at the regional scale due to measurement limitations as an example to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its feasibility we use the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment with 26 gauged subcatchments our perceptual model of the moselle catchment presents a description of dominant processes that we consider a posteriori reasonable but not a priori obvious where precipitation much more than evaporation or groundwater exchange controls the spatial variability of average streamflow lithology influences the partitioning between baseflow and quickflow and topography and land use control hydrograph lag times a striking feature of our analysis is the rather minor role that vegetation and soil appear to play in streamflow spatial variability at the scale of our inquiry we use our perceptual model to build a distributed yet parsimonious hydrological model in part 2 of this paper series although the perceptual model is specific for the moselle we hope that the perceptual model approach used here can be helpful to others working in large catchments in different hydroclimates where other factors will dominate keywords perceptual model dominant processes streamflow signatures regional scale top down approach expert knowledge 1 introduction perceptual models in catchment hydrology are qualitative representations of hydrological systems intended to illustrate their main components behavior and interaction e g beven 2012 gupta et al 2012 critically perceptual models are a key first step towards hydrologic synthesis and provide the process foundation of predictive models beven 2012 while perceptual model development is recognized increasingly for its central importance e g wagener et al 2020 and several illustrations of perceptual models have been made based on expert knowledge e g beven and chappell 2021 few methods have been discussed to bring data to the perceptual model development exercise for large watersheds perceptual models have been constructed mainly at the hillslope or headwater catchment scale 10 km2 e g mcglynn et al 2002 wrede et al 2015 where field measurements can inform process perception and form the basis for the dialog between experimentalist and modeler seibert and mcdonnell 2002 but how to develop perceptual models beyond the headwater catchment scale where field based sampling and measurement are impractical the extreme scale dependency of runoff processes means that perceptual models developed at the field scale on hillslopes and headwater catchments are generally not representative at the meso 100 1 000 km2 or regional scale 10 000 km2 sivapalan 2003 meaning just as headwater catchments are not a linear superposition of soil cores mcdonnell et al 2021 the meso or regional scale catchment a is not a linear superposition of headwater catchments thus characterizing the dominant processes at the regional scale does not imply an account of the heterogeneity and complexity observed at the hillslope scale sivapalan 2003 regional scale perceptual models could have usefulness beyond the development of tailored conceptual model structures in particular they could help identifying regularities and laws at the regional scale e g dooge 1986 wagener et al 2007 including regions of hydrological similarity that exert primary controls on hydrological dynamics e g loritz et al 2018 ehret et al 2020 or scaling relationships associated to processes aggregation e g leopold and maddock 1953 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 such insights could contribute regional knowledge that can be exploited in catchment classification studies e g gnann et al 2021 or inform regularization relationships and constraints for improving model realism and parsimony e g pokhrel et al 2008 gharari et al 2014 despite their potential scope however the development of regional scale perceptual models has seldom been transparent and lacks clear guidance dedicated studies that illustrate such development are few e g winter 2001 savenije 2010 gnann et al 2021 certainly expert knowledge plays a role this is a function of personal and subjective experience beven and chappell 2021 but also linked to this is intuition theoretical background and transfer of knowledge from other catchments here we add and explore the interpretation of in situ data and how it can combine with other forms of expert knowledge to inform perceptual model development at the regional scale while the traditional perceptual model development based on local fieldwork observations can be regarded as bottom up sivapalan et al 2003 our approach based on the interpretation of catchment responses is more top down in particular we base our process understanding on the interpretation on the spatial variability of streamflow signatures within a nested catchment we acknowledge that the interpretation of the spatial variability of hydrological signatures has been the objective of many studies focused on catchment classification e g wagener et al 2007 sivakumar et al 2015 however these studies have typically adopted a large sample approach which resulted in prioritizing the impact of climate at the expense of landscape e g beck et al 2015 addor et al 2018 and have relied on general purpose statistical or machine learning approaches e g peñas et al 2014 sivakumar et al 2015 which were generally difficult to interpret our reliance on a nested catchment setup and on expert knowledge is intended to increase process understanding at the regional scale such as to clarify the interplay between climate and landscape in controlling streamflow responses anticipating which signatures best characterize streamflow variability in any nested catchment and which dominant processes affect them is not a priori obvious first uniqueness of place in terms of catchment properties or measurements limits our ability to create generalizable hypotheses beven 2000 for example oudin et al 2010 showed that seemingly similar catchments can respond drastically different which required digging beyond commonly used metrics of catchment similarity secondly classification and regionalization studies have shown that the signatures that best characterize streamflow variability may differ from one region to the other depending on the underlying dominant processes e g blöschl et al 2013 gupta et al 2013 thirdly even the same signatures can respond to different process controls in different environments for example gnann et al 2021 showed that the spatial variability of baseflow signatures could be associated with soil and sediment texture in regions covered by glacial deposits in north united states compared to soil stratigraphy in the appalachian mountains in north carolina sinkhole density in the ozarks and the maturity of the landscape represented by geological age in the oregon cascades this variability of process controls then motivated different perceptual models in these distinct areas thus we suspect that these process controls at the regional scale are equivocal for many other signatures here we demonstrate a systematic approach for perceptual model development at the regional scale using the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment in europe as a case study we use 26 stream gauging stations with 26 years of streamflow records climatic variables and landscape properties maps unlike other systems of its size in europe the moselle has relatively low population density with 150 inhabitants per square kilometer www fgg rhein de an absence of major lakes and exceptionally good data availability leveraging these attributes and to show a proof of concept with a simple regional scale catchment our objectives are 1 to develop a hydrological synthesis for the moselle catchment in the form of a distributed perceptual model of regional scale streamflow generating processes 2 to outline the key steps of this process as a proof of concept for how to consider regional scale perceptual model development elsewhere using widely available data 3 to characterize expert knowledge and illustrate how it can be contributed both by experimentalists and modelers in the various stages of perceptual model development the paper is organized into six sections section 2 presents the study area and the data section 3 presents the methodology including the selection of streamflow signatures the climatic and landscape indices and the approaches to identify the influence factors on the selected streamflow signatures section 4 analyzes the factors influencing the selected streamflow signatures and outlines the moselle perceptual model section 5 contains a discussion about the broader implications of the proposed approach including a synthesis of how expert knowledge was used in the perceptual model development process section 6 concludes the paper providing a synthetic summary of how the objectives of the study have been addressed as an application example of the developed perceptual model fenicia et al 2022 hereafter referred to as fmm2022 illustrates the development and selection of a distributed yet parsimonious conceptual model 2 study area and data 2 1 the moselle catchment the study area is shown in fig 1 we focus on the catchment with outlet in cochem 50 km upstream of the confluence with the rhine drainage distance with a contributing area of 27 100 km2 fig 1a elevations range between 60 and 1424 m a s l with 96 of the catchment area lying below 600 m fig 1b land cover is dominated by forest 38 followed by crop 30 pasture 20 developed areas 8 defined here as urban sub urban industrial and other artificial landuses and wetland 4 fig 1c in terms of geology the moselle catchment extends over four main structural units two geological basins the paris basin in the center west and the sarre nahe bergland permian basin in the east consisting of mainly sedimentary rocks and two geological massifs the vosges massif in the south culminating at 1424 m a s l and the rhenish massif in the north reaching an altitude of 816 m a s l consisting mainly of metamorphic rocks the lithology of the catchment is varied given the extent of the area see later fig 7a soil texture shows contrasting characteristics across the catchment with coarse material in the mountainous southern part of the catchment fine materials in the central part and medium to medium fine materials in the north fig 1d we consider 26 subcatchments based on a selection of stream gauging stations fig 1a table 1 reports both the total and incremental area of the subcatchments that is their entire contributing area and the incremental area from the next upstream subcatchment hence corresponding to the colored regions in fig 1a the hydrometeorology of the subcatchments is shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows their hydrographs whose similarities and differences are analyzed in detail in section 3 2 fig 2b represents the subcatchments in budyko space budyko 1974 which highlights the variability in the hydrometeorological conditions in the area with dryness index i d the ratio between average potential evaporation and average precipitation ranging between 0 5 and 1 2 and evaporative index i e the ratio between average actual evaporation calculated as the difference between average precipitation and streamflow and average precipitation varying between 0 3 and 0 7 the subcatchments show significant correlation in the budyko space with a spearman correlation r s 0 79 and a corresponding p value p s well below the conventional significance threshold of 5 2 2 data sources the data used in this study are classified into three categories streamflow climate precipitation and temperature and landscape maps of elevation land cover lithology and soil texture streamflow streamflow data q mm h normalized by the catchment area is considered at 26 stations fig 1a for the period 01 09 1989 31 08 2015 where we have assumed the 1st of september to be the start of the hydrological year the german data are obtained from the german federal institute of hydrology bfg the luxembourgish data are obtained from the administration de la gestion de l eau the french data are obtained from eaufrance downloaded at hydro eaufrance fr all streamflow time series are available at hourly resolution climate precipitation p mm d and temperature t c c data are obtained from the e obs gridded dataset version 14 0 downloaded at www ecad eu haylock et al 2008 this dataset has daily temporal resolution and a regular 0 25 0 25 degrees grid spatial resolution about 20 30 km at the catchment s latitude it is based on an interpolation of ground station data note that for precipitation the daily average of a given day is computed between 6 00 utc of that day and 6 00 utc of the following day haylock et al 2008 the same interval is therefore used in computing daily streamflow since the precipitation stations used by the e obs data set have much lower density in the french part of the catchment than in the german part as also apparent in fig 1 of haylock et al 2008 the precipitation in the subcatchments with the majority of their areas in france nietaltdorf hauconcourt malzeville metz rosseldange toul custines epinal luneville nomeny boncourt wittring is recalculated using ground station data obtained from météo france interpolated with the thiessen polygon method temperature data are used to derive potential evaporation e pot time series using the 1985 hargreaves equation hargreaves and allen 2003 for the calculation of the climatic indices described in section 3 3 as well as those represented in fig 2b the climatic data concomitant with the availability of streamflow data in each subcatchment is used landscape landscape data include maps of elevation soil lithology and land cover elevation the digital elevation model is obtained from usgs hydrosheds resolution 78 4 m catchment elevation is shown in fig 1b land cover the maps is generated using the corine land cover european database clc12 version 18 5 downloaded at land copernicus eu four land cover classes are considered crop forest pasture developed areas urban industrial etc and wetland fig 1c lithology the maps are obtained from different sources depending on the country for france we use the bd lisa database version 1 niveau 2 ordre 1 scale 1 250 000 downloaded at https bdlisa eaufrance fr for germany we use the geologische übersichtskarte der bundesrepublik deutschland gük200 downloaded at www bgr bund de scale 1 200 000 for luxembourg the lithology map is obtained by the administration de la gestion de l eau scale of 1 250 000 for belgium we use the ihme1500 database version 11 downloaded at www bgr bund de scale 1 1 500 000 the ihme data has a much coarser resolution than the other maps however only 3 of the catchment belongs to belgium see above the lithology maps are combined which resulted in a total of 31 lithology classes shown later in fig 7a soil soil properties are obtained from the european soil database version 2 0 the distribution of soil texture attribute text into fine medium fine medium and coarse attributes is shown in fig 1d these data are used for the calculation of the metrics defined in the following section 3 methodology our approach to develop a perceptual model characterizing streamflow regional variability consists of the following basic steps 1 determine a set of streamflow signatures that characterize key traits of streamflow spatial variability 2 specify the methods that are most appropriate interpret the spatial variability of each individual streamflow signature 3 identify the landscape or climatic attributes that cause the variability of each individual streamflow signature 4 synthesize the interpretation of each individual streamflow signature in the form of a distributed perceptual model which elucidates the dominant processes affecting the spatial variability of streamflow the intended characteristics of the perceptual model are schematically represented in fig 3 in particular the perceptual model is expected to include the following information 1 the definition of a key set of streamflow signatures that characterize streamflow spatial variability at internal subcatchments 2 the identification of the main landscape or climate controls on the spatial variability of each streamflow signature such identification should then lead to an understanding of the climate or landscape variability that matters at that scale which is used to define regions of hydrological similarity 3 the characterization of the dominant processes in each region of hydrological similarity which is derived by interpreting the processes that underlie the variability of individual streamflow signatures 4 the connectivity between processes associated to distinct regions hence how distinct landscape sections connect to each other to generate the overall catchment response and 5 the relationships between spatially variable processes such as how a certain process e g baseflow runoff or channel routing varies in magnitude depending on landscape properties the various elements of the perceptual model may be associated to varying degrees of confidence which the development process would help in characterizing in this section we describe the definition of streamflow signatures section 3 1 their potential process controls based on previous literature section 3 2 and the definition of landscape and climatic indices used in subsequent analyses section 3 3 3 1 selection of streamflow signatures our definition of streamflow signatures starts with a visual inspection of the 26 hydrographs designed to single out hydrograph similarities and differences fig 4 exemplifies the key results of this analysis 1 streamflow magnitude can vary significantly between subcatchments for example fig 4a shows the hydrographs at epinal and luneville two neighboring subcatchments in the south of the moselle catchment the streamflow at epinal appears to be systematically larger than the streamflow at luneville 2 there are noticeable differences in baseflow versus quickflow proportions between hydrographs for example fig 4b shows the difference between the hydrographs at niedaltdorf on the river nied and reinheim on the river biel the two subcatchments are located in the center east of the moselle catchment and they are closely spaced the outlets are 50 km apart it is noticeable that niedaltdorf has larger baseflow and lower peakflow than reinheim 3 the time it takes for hydrograph to rise in response to a rainfall event was found to vary significantly between subcatchments for example niedaltdorf and nomeny appear to have similar baseflow characteristics but niedaltdorf appears to have a flashier response than nomeny fig 4c also these two subcatchments are closely spaced they have a border in common and the subcatchment with slower response nomeny is the smallest of the two 929 vs 1332 km2 4 hydrographs at consecutive gauges on the river network if the areas of the corresponding subcatchments are not significantly different can be very similar for example fig 4d shows the case of cochem the catchment outlet and trier 50 km upstream in linear distance although the two hydrographs are similar they clearly show an offset with the downstream hydrograph lagging behind 5 the hydrographs also present similarities in particular they all appear share a similar seasonal behavior with higher flows during winter and lower flows during summer as apparent for example in fig 2 these visual perceptions have motivated the selection of the following streamflow signatures which are more specifically defined in appendix a 1 streamflow average q mm yr which is simply the long term average of streamflow observation 2 baseflow index q bfi which indicates the proportion of baseflow over total flow 3 time to peak q ttp h designed to reflect the average duration of the rising limbs of the hydrograph 4 relative lag q lag h which quantifies the time shift between two hydrographs 5 half streamflow date q hsd d defined as number of days on which half of the yearly streamflow has passed starting from the beginning of the hydrological year i e 1st of september see section 2 2 and intended to capture streamflow seasonality for further analyses it is important to keep streamflow signatures that are relative independent and show sufficient variability fig 5 shows that these conditions apply for the first three signatures confirming the visual impressions that they reflect distinctive traits of streamflow variability in particular the spearman correlation values r s are relatively low and the p values p s are relatively large indicating limited correlation significance the relative lag signature is only applicable to pair of subcatchments and therefore is not directly comparable with the other signatures the half streamflow date showed very little variability it varied between 23 jan to 9 feb for all subcatchments which confirmed the visual impression that hydrographs have similar seasonal behaviour and motivated its exclusion in successive analyses it is worth pointing out that the first three signatures listed above broadly correspond to the hydrograph characteristics that the three components of the kling gupta efficiency kge aim to optimize gupta et al 2009 in particular the kge aims at matching the overall volume of flow spread of flow and timing of the hydrograph which are characteristics that can be associated to the first three signatures listed above 3 2 approaches to identify process controls on selected streamflow signatures after having identified a set of key streamflow signatures we ask the following two sets of questions 1 what are their potential process controls and more specifically are these controls already a priori obvious and 2 which methods are most appropriate to identify them can available hydrological experience help define tailored and interpretable methods for analyzing individual streamflow signatures as opposed to general purpose statistical or machine learning approaches in order to answer these questions we synthesize previous studies that have analyzed our selection of streamflow signatures 3 2 1 streamflow average explaining the spatial variability of streamflow average is part of the more general problem of exploring the geographical variability of the long term water budget e g budyko 1974 dooge 1992 milly 1994 the long term water budget can be expressed as 1 q p e act g where the overbar is used to indicate the long term averages and q p e act and g represent streamflow precipitation actual total evaporation and groundwater outflow respectively from eq 1 it is clear that the spatial variability in q is due to the combination of p e act and g however in which proportion these three terms contribute to this variability and if one of them eventually dominates on the other is not a priori clear moreover while p can be measured the other two terms need to be somehow estimated the long term evaporation e act has been related to various climatic and landscape factors perhaps the simplest way of representing these dependencies is by relating e act to the average potential evaporation e pot by a simple stress factor e g peng et al 2019 the more popular budyko model budyko 1974 relates e act to e pot and p there are several approximately equivalent formulations of the budyko model e g daly et al 2019 including the one parameter turc mezentsev formula turc 1954 mezentsev 1955 widely used in many applications e g bouaziz et al 2018 andréassian and sari 2019 2 e act p 1 1 p e pot b 1 b where b is a model parameter such simple formulation has been shown to leave various degrees of unexplained variability depending on the applications which has been attributed to various unaccounted climate or landscape characteristics in different studies including the characteristics of vegetation seasonality soil properties and topographic controls e g as reviewed in greve et al 2016 groundwater flow which is the other main unknown in eq 1 can be an important component of the long term water balance for example schaller and fan 2009 made an extensive investigation on 1555 catchments in the united states and found that groundwater imports and exports can be significant primarily driven by climate with arid basins more affected basins size with larger basins being more self contained and bedrock permeability with high bedrock permeability leading to larger groundwater import or exports in the meuse catchment neighbouring the moselle catchment bouaziz et al 2018 found that several subcatchments are affected by significant groundwater flow which was attributed to the effect of lithology the possible significance of groundwater flow has motivated its inclusion even in very simple conceptual models le moine et al 2007 based on the description above our approach to identify the process controls on the streamflow average signature in the moselle catchment is as follow we will use eq 1 as the framework to explain the variability of the regional water budget in the moselle catchment our investigation will start with regressing q with p which is measured we will then include e act estimated using simple e g a simple stress factor to more complex e g eq 2 formulations and proceed by accounting for g which could be identified leveraging the nested catchment setup which implies that the water lost at some subcatchments needs to be gained at some neighbouring subcatchments bouaziz et al 2018 in line with the top down approach there will be no need to investigate further once a reasonable fit to the observed q is obtained in summary eq 1 provides the framework to explore the spatial variability of q but to what extent it is possible to explain this variability and in which proportion p e act and g contribute to it is not a priori obvious we will thus examine available data to establish a plausible explanation for the spatial variability of streamflow average 3 2 2 baseflow index several studies have indicated bedrock as the most important control on the variability of the baseflow index bfi e g lacey and grayson 1998 longobardi and villani 2008 bloomfield et al 2009 this finding has an intuitive explanation as groundwater is stored in the rocks especially if they are highly fractured and this contributes to baseflow lacey and grayson 1998 however different bedrock features can describe the relation of bedrock to baseflow characteristics in different places for example in the alzette catchment in luxembourg the variability of baseflow index was correlated to lithology types pfister et al 2017 whereas in the oregon cascades it was explained by the maturity of the landscape rather than the lithology type tague and grant 2004 besides bedrock properties a plethora of additional landscape or climate controls was found responsible for the regional variability of baseflow index in different studies e g price 2011 using 8600 catchments in united states santhi et al 2008 found that relief maximum minus minimum elevation in the catchment was the most strongly correlated variable to bfi with lower relief leading to higher baseflow using 3394 catchments worldwide beck et al 2013 found that the bfi was best related to the mean and seasonality of potential evaporation mean annual air temperature and mean snow water equivalent depth they also observed that their results seemed to contradict the perception of a relationship between slope or lithology and bfi using 103 catchments in europe schneider et al 2007 found that soil type could be used to predict baseflow index although the goodness of fit decreased in the southern areas using 67 catchment in belgium zomlot et al 2015 found that baseflow index was mostly affected by vegetation cover using 12 catchments in tanzania mwakalila et al 2002 found that baseflow index was positively correlated with the ratio of precipitation on potential evaporation based on the review above the following approach is adopted to explain the variability of bfi in the moselle we will start from regressing bfi to easily accessible metrics of catchment similarity including topography soil and land use if results will not be satisfactory we well sort the variability of lithology classes into a restricted number of relative bedrock permeability classes based on expert judgment and regress these properties to baseflow index this attempt is motivated by the finding that lithology was found to be an important control on streamflow variability in the alzette mesoscale catchment in luxembourg which is part of the moselle hellebrand et al 2007 pfister et al 2017 it is however unclear whether these findings will hold true at the much larger regional scale in summary the variability of bfi depends in principle on multiple controls to the point that it may be even hazardous to rely on the intuition that they can be related to bedrock properties our approach will therefore be relatively inclusive in terms of potential controls and potentially require a careful assessment of bedrock hydrological properties 3 2 3 time to peak the time span of the rising limb of the hydrograph has been indicated by various terms including time to peak time of concentration lag time catchment response time with various sometimes overlapping definitions some considering the time difference between rainfall and runoff events and other considering hydrograph properties alone e g gericke and smithers 2014 beven 2020 in spite of their different definitions such timing signatures are strongly correlated to each other as they share the same intention of characterizing the duration of a hydrograph pulse response e g see fig 2 in gericke and smithers 2014 in this section we use time to peak to collectively refer to such metrics numerous previous studies have related time to peak to various observable catchment properties the most widely used models used multiplicative relationships between topography related properties suggesting that the time to peak increases with basin size and decreases with basin slope e g taylor and schwarz 1952 gericke and smithers 2014 beven 2020 the characteristics of the hypsometric curve an integrated measure of catchment topography have also been successfully related to time to peak as an alternative to other topography related measures harlin 1984 luo and harlin 2003 rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 developed a theoretical relationship between time to peak and the horton number in the attempt to overcome the conceptual limitations of the so many and not very illuminating regressions we keep using in the field such theoretical relation however has not found high predictive value as noted for example by howard 1990 who found that horton s numbers collectively account for only 5 per cent of the explained variance in the estimating equations his results instead confirmed that terms related to catchment size and average channel gradients provided the greatest predictive power some studies showed that underground flow pathways and the porous media related to them soil and lithology can have a significant impact on time to peak dunne 1978 showed that hydrographs generated by infiltration excess overland flow had times to peak 40 times shorter than hydrographs generated by subsurface stormflow gaál et al 2012 used 396 austrian catchments and showed that karst catchments as well as catchments dominated by schist phyllite had much more delayed responses compared to other catchments with marl and clay lithology in a study on 3 experimental catchments with different lithology wrede et al 2015 showed that the catchment on schist had a time to peak in the order days whereas the other two catchments on clay and sandstone responded near coincidently with the rainfall based on the review above we will adopt the following approach to investigate time to peak variability in the moselle catchment we will look for a multiplicative relationship between landscape attributes the relevant dependent variables in the regression models will be determined through stepwise regression e g berger and entekhabi 2001 a common method that involves progressively adding variables based on how well they improve the fit this approach has the advantage that the order in which variables are added provides information on their influence however it may not be able to capture complex relationships between data beyond the one envisaged in summary similarly to the previous streamflow signatures it would be difficult to a priori guess which landscape or climatic properties would influence the spatial variability of the time to peak in the moselle catchment as this signature was described primarily using multiplicative relationships in previous work we will adopt this framework to look for suitable fitting relationships 3 2 4 relative lag the delay demonstrated by flow as it travels downstream along a river reach is a relatively well understood phenomenon in river hydraulics the lag between hydrographs at successive points along a channel can be modeled by the so called saint venant equations which are based on the conservation of mass and momentum in channels and are well described in many hydrology and hydraulics textbooks e g henderson 1966 this route however is both data demanding as it requires channel geometry and roughness information and potentially computationally intensive depending on the simplifications one is prepared to accept it is therefore impractical for applications such as the use of the perceptual model to inform a conceptual model particularly for an initial stage where the main building blocks of the conceptual model are yet unrefined and their definition in successive model development stages may require computationally intensive calibrations and comparisons of multiple model variants these arguments raise the question whether there are there simpler even if not as accurate approaches for modeling such delay the answer may come from geomorphology and in particular from the scaling laws that connect hydraulic and geomorphological properties of natural rivers e g leopold and maddock 1953 rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 leopold and maddock 1953 empirically observed that in a downstream direction average streamflow velocity v increases following a power law relationship 3 v q α where q is the average streamflow not normalized by the catchment area empirical investigations returned a value of α 0 1 this relatively low value indicates that the velocity tends to remain constant or increase slightly in the downstream direction considering that at a first approximation q increases linearly with the catchment area a e g rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 q a and that following a kinematic wave approximation celerity c hence the flood wave propagation speed is proportional to velocity v c e g henderson 1966 based on eq 3 one can assume c a α and therefore 4 q lag q a q b l ab a ab α where l ab is the flow distance between two locations a and b and a ab is the average of the catchment areas at the two locations this relationship accounts for the fact that the celerity increases and therefore the lag reduces for larger catchments which have on average larger flow our proposed approach is therefore as follows we will identify successive gauges for which the intermediate contributing area is proportionally small and calculate the hydrograph lag we will regress the lags calculated for different pairs of subcatchments using eq 4 in summary in contrast to the other three streamflow signatures the relative lag between hydrographs can be estimated using well established river hydraulics methods a priori unclear however is to what degree simplified approaches such as relying on eq 4 have predictive value 3 3 selection of climatic and landscape indices our selection of climatic and landscape indices is listed in table 2 in terms of climatic indices we restricted our selection to average precipitation and potential evaporation where the average was extended to the streamflow data availability period for each subcatchment see fig 3 in fmm2022 we did not consider snow related indices e g sawicz et al 2011 razavi and coulibaly 2013 as only a small fraction of precipitation is falling as snow below 5 in each subcatchment as well as indices reflecting the phase offset between precipitation and evaporation e g berghuijs et al 2014 as catchments are in the same climatic region and as already observed section 3 1 hydrographs have similar seasonal behaviour the landscape indices are extracted using the four maps described in section 2 2 topography land use lithology and soil texture as we use several landscape indices to minimize confusion we represent them with the notation l x y where l stands for landscape index y indicates the underlying map top lnd lit and stx respectively and x indicates the specific attribute see table 2 for the complete list our selection of landscape indices is justified as follows in terms of topography indices such as l area top l elavg top l elrel top and measures of slope are among the most commonly used in studies examining the spatial variability of streamflow signatures see ali et al 2012 for a review indices such as l drden top l dstd top and l dstg top are typical in catchment geomorphology rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 and are also used in some classification studies see ali et al 2012 for a review the indices l wet top l hil top l plt top are the fractions of topographical wetland hillslope and plateau introduced by gharari et al 2011 where wetland is the landscape with height above nearest drainage lower than a specified threshold here 10 m and the rest of the landscape is partitioned into hillslope and plateau if the slope is higher or lower than a specified threshold here 11 according to gharari et al 2011 fractions of land cover types as the ones defined here table 2 are used in many studies e g zhang et al 2004 yadav et al 2007 oudin et al 2008 razavi and coulibaly 2013 kuentz et al 2017 land cover was also expressed by alternative metrics such as the leaf area index e g sawicz et al 2011 addor et al 2017 or metrics oriented to reflect the vegetation biomass e g jencso and mcglynn 2011 which here we did not consider lithology is often represented directly through the fraction occupied by the lithological formations e g bloomfield et al 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 fenicia et al 2016 kuentz et al 2017 as these formations can be many it is useful to group them into more general classes e g yadav et al 2007 hellebrand et al 2008 dal molin et al 2020 the formulation of suitable lithology indices is explored in section 4 1 2 we used soil texture for characterizing soil data table 2 as common to many studies e g addor et al 2017 kuentz et al 2017 alternative soil characteristics proved useful for hydrological purposes such as the hydrology of soil types classification system developed for the united kingdom boorman et al 1995 and used in several studies e g schneider et al 2007 yadav et al 2007 ali et al 2012 but such data is generally not available in other regions although not necessarily exhaustive compared to previous studies on streamflow signature variability our selection of landscape indices is rather inclusive for example it has not been uncommon to base the interpretation of streamflow spatial variability on topography information alone see ali et al 2012 for a review moreover such indices are based on widely available information and therefore have broad applicability 4 result and interpretations the following sections present the identification of the process controls on the 4 identified streamflow signatures section 4 1 and their synthesis into a regional scale perceptual model of the moselle catchment section 4 2 appendix b includes a correlation analysis between all landscape indices climatic indices and streamflow signatures which provides a broad overview of various dependencies and complements the targeted analyses presented in section 4 1 in order to capture potentially nonlinear dependencies we used the spearman correlation r s for which a significance p value threshold p s 5 is typically assumed 4 1 identification of process controls on streamflow signatures 4 1 1 explaining variability in streamflow average as described in section 3 2 1 eq 1 provides the framework to explore the variability of the long term water budget our approach to identify the main influence factors on the variability in q proceeded by accounting for p e act and g until a sufficient fit to the observed q was achieved the models here proposed were tested with least squared regression and assessed in terms of nash and sutcliffe efficiency f ns we started with a very simple model where q is related to p and the other terms are combined into a single constant b 5 q p b this model already provided an exceptionally good performance with f ns 0 91 this relatively high performance indicated that the margin of improvement was small as described in section 3 2 1 an obvious attempt to evolve eq 5 was to better characterize the evaporation term by including its potential controls as discussed in section 3 2 1 potential evaporation is a first order control on actual evaporation and a simple way to account for its effect is as follows 6 q p b e pot where b in this case represents the proportionality between potential e pot and actual evaporation this model resulted into f ns 0 87 and therefore did not improve the fit compared to eq 5 finally we considered the budyko model of eq 2 which as discussed in section 3 2 1 is an established approach to represent the long term catchment water balance 7 q p p 1 p e pot b 1 b where b was treated as a calibration parameter this model returned f ns 0 90 which is intermediate between the two previous models fig 6 a shows the excellent correlation between q and p spearman correlation r s 0 92 and corresponding p value p s close to zero indicating high significance which suggested p as the dominant control on q and automatically downplayed other potential controls fig 6b shows the poor correlation between actual difference between observed precipitation and streamflow long term averages and potential evaporation which explains why accounting for e pot in equations and did not improve the fit the relatively good fit obtained with the models above suggested a small influence of g hence concerning the long term water balance it appeared reasonable to assume that the subcatchments are watertight 4 1 2 influence factors on the baseflow index signature the correlation between q bfi and climatic indices or landscape indices based on topography land use and soil was generally low spearman correlation r s 0 55 we therefore embarked into the task of sorting the variability of lithology into relative permeability classes section 3 2 2 in particular we defined three permeability classes of low medium and high permeability represented with the symbols l l lit l m lit and l h lit respectively table 2 using expert judgment as outlined below we reclassified each of the lithology classes in one of these three permeability classes table 3 lists the lithological classes sorted by the area they occupy in the moselle catchment the first 15 formations already occupy 95 of the catchment with reference to these formations the following rationale was used for their classification formations such as marl schist dolomite rock and crystalline basement were considered as low permeability as formed by fine particles or hard rock formations such as sandstone alluvium sand gravel and conglomerate were considered as high permeability as notably capable of storing and transmitting water limestone was considered as medium permeability as intermediate between sandstone and marl mixed formations were considered as medium permeability if the permeable formation was mentioned first e g sandstone and marl and low permeability if the impermeable formation was mentioned first e g marl and sandstone the original lithology map and the final bedrock permeability map are shown in fig 7 fig 8 a shows that there was a strong and highly significant correlation r s 0 84 p s close to zero between baseflow index q bfi and the fraction of bedrock with high permeability l h lit such relationship was close to linear as the pearson correlation was also high r p 0 87 and could therefore be expressed as follows 8 q bfi a l h lit where is the proportionality sign this relationship lent itself to an obvious interpretation as high bedrock permeability favors groundwater flow which produces baseflow an obvious attempt to improve eq 8 was therefore to consider also medium permeability bedrock into the equation as this also may contribute to baseflow although to a lesser extent hence we considered the following equation 9 q bfi a l h lit b l m lit optimizing the coefficients to minimize least squares resulted in some improvement r s 0 89 r p 0 90 and an optimized parameter b 0 30 fig 8b 4 1 3 influence factors on the time to peak signature the pairwise correlation analysis in table a1 showed that q ttp did not correlate strongly with any of the selected indices we therefore explored multiplicative relationships between landscape attributes using stepwise regression as anticipated in section 3 2 3 the q ttp measured at metz was an apparent outlier since it had a value of 86 5 h and was 4 7 standard deviations away from the mean of the other subcatchments therefore we removed it from the subsequent analysis table 4 reports the best three empirical relations for the time to peak signature q ttp obtained with one to four variables table 4 first column shows that when going from one to four variables the spearman correlation r s increased from 0 58 to 0 85 the p values were well below the significance threshold already for the single variable correlations and approached zero when multiple variables were considered besides the fit to the data an important consideration in order to identify a plausible relationship was its interpretability a relationship that appeared to fulfill such prerequisites was represented by the best performing equation r s 0 78 using three landscape indices 10 q ttp a l dstg top l dev lnd l sl 05 top suggesting that that the time to peak increased with increasing distance with decreasing slope and fraction of developed land use the dependency on the first two variables was reflected in many time to peak models as reviewed in section 3 2 3 and the inverse dependency on developed land was intuitive as urbanization causes faster drainage it is also reassuring that the variables in eq 10 appeared recurrently also in the lower dimensional relationships shown in table 4 4 1 4 influence factors on the hydrographs relative lag signature based on the analysis described in section 3 2 4 we started by assuming that the lag between hydrographs at two points along the river network a and b q lag increases proportionally with the flow distance between a and b l ab 11 q lag q a q b l ab based on the assumption that celerity should increase slightly downstream as indicated by eq 3 equation was compared with the following expression 12 q lag q a q b l ab a ab α where a ab is the average of the subcatchment areas at a and b and the exponent α was fixed at 0 1 as suggested by previous studies section 3 2 4 this relationship accounted for the fact that the celerity increases and therefore the lag reduces for larger catchments which have on average larger flow these two relationships are compared in fig 9 the markers are color coded according to the ratio between area of the downstream and upstream subcatchments with darker color indicating higher ratio darker dots should represent pairs where lateral inflow in between stations is smaller and therefore be more representative the spearman correlation coefficient r s for eqs 11 and 12 were 0 49 and 0 54 whereas the corresponding p values were 18 and 14 the pearson linear correlations r p were higher at 0 74 and 0 79 respectively showing that the variability of q lag was to a certain extent captured by the two models and eq 12 was an improvement compared to eq 11 although considerable uncertainty remained these results indicated that eq 12 provides a first order approximation of q lag which spares from the use of much more complex flow routing models when a coarse level characterization of catchment behaviour is needed such as in the development of parsimonious and computationally efficient conceptual models 4 2 a perceptual model of the moselle catchment fig 10 presents our perceptual model of the moselle catchment which synthesizes our understanding of the spatial variability of streamflow in the moselle subcatchments and its underlying process controls according to the perceptual model objectives represented in fig 3 the main traits of streamflow regional variability were distilled into four streamflow signatures namely the streamflow average q the baseflow index q bfi the time to peak q ttp and the relative lag between hydrographs at successive stations q lag these streamflow signatures appeared to respond to distinct process controls differences in the amount of streamflow observed at different subcatchments were related to the spatial variability of precipitation section 4 1 1 hence our perceptual model considered spatially distributed precipitation at the subcatchment resolution variability in baseflow vs quickflow partitioning was mainly attributed to the influence of lithology section 4 1 2 our process interpretation was that lithology affects bedrock permeability in particular with increasing permeability deep percolation and groundwater flow are progressively more dominant as a result our perceptual model partitioned the landscape in distinct bedrock permeability classes low medium and high associated to runoff generating processes that determine distinct hydrograph reactions fast both fast and slow and slow respectively the time to peak could be related to topography and land use section 4 1 3 in particular time to peak was found to increase with basin size and to decrease with basin slope and with a larger area of developed e g urban land the relation with basin size and slope was consistent with most time to peak models section 3 2 3 we motivated the relationship to developed land by considering that urbanization often results into improved drainage which causes a faster catchment response in our perceptual model the process controls on the time to peak were schematically represented through subcatchment specific lags marked in blue in fig 10 the hydrograph lag due to channel routing could be approximated using a simple relationship as increasing with the length of a river stretch and decreasing with the average flow section 4 1 4 this relationship which is based on a geomorphologic scaling law section 3 2 4 can be adopted as a first approximation instead of more complex although potentially more accurate routing models in our perceptual model these routing effects were schematically represented using channel reach specific lags marked in red in fig 10 regional groundwater flow did not appear to be a dominant process section 4 1 1 hence our perceptual model purposely omitted this process and approximated the subcatchments as watertight vegetation potential evaporation and soil did not appear to affect the variability of any of the selected streamflow signatures section 4 1 1 and appendix b our perceptual model therefore did not distinguish between vegetation and soil types we argue that this perceptual model was not a priori obvious in different places streamflow spatial variability was best characterized by different streamflow signatures which responded to distinct process controls gupta et al 2013 for example the thur catchment in switzerland showed strong differences in seasonality between subcatchment response dal molin et al 2020 whereas all subcatchments in the moselle had a similar seasonal behavior the neighboring meuse catchment showed significant groundwater exchanges between some subcatchments bouaziz et al 2018 whereas in our setup groundwater exchanges were considered negligible moreover as reviewed in section 3 2 even the same streamflow signature can respond to distinct process controls in different places for example here we attributed baseflow variability to the permeability of lithology whereas tague and grant 2004 showed that baseflow index was controlled by landscape maturity rather than bedrock type in the oregon cascades and responded to distinct controls in other areas in united states which motivated alternative perceptual models in these distinct areas gnann et al 2021 however our moselle perceptual model was a posteriori reasonable the identified process controls that affected each individual streamflow signature were within the range of plausible controls based on prior knowledge as reviewed in section 3 2 they therefore appeared justifiable from a process based perspective our perceptual model did not distinguish between soil and vegetation types which can sound surprising given that for example vegetation and soil are some key ingredients of many distributed models such as swat arnold et al 1998 larsim demuth and rademacher 2016 and prevah viviroli et al 2009 our analysis suggested that the considered streamflow data do not contain sufficient information to disentangle the distinct behavior of different soil or vegetation types however this conclusion may also have resulted from some limitations in our analysis such as the loss of information that is unavoidable when compressing time series into streamflow signatures or maps into landscape indices 5 discussion perceptual models can be the basis of several applications and can eventually advance our current thinking of hydrological processes in different places wagener et al 2020 their development however has seldom been transparent and lacks clear guidance particularly at the regional scale this study illustrated a path to the development of a distributed perceptual model at the regional catchment scale based on an interpretation of the subcatchment responses in a nested catchment this approach complements the traditional perceptual model development based on fieldwork observations which is difficult to pursue beyond the headwater scale due to the disparity between measurements and processes scale beven 2001a our approach can be classified as top down in the sense that it seeks a process description by fingering down into the smaller scale processes from above sivapalan et al 2003 the main advantages of this approach are that it produces a process description directly at the scale of interest and that perceptual model decisions are supported by the available data sivapalan et al 2003 a specific challenge of this approach is represented by the limits of splitting beven 1996 hence by extent to which it is possible to disaggregate catchment response into individual process controls we showed that leveraging a nested catchment setup it is possible to disentangle the individual controls on specific subcatchment response signatures and inform a distributed perceptual model although our perceptual model is specific to the moselle the proposed perceptual model development approach is general and its feasibility encourages its adoption to build regional scale perceptual models elsewhere the nested catchment setup stands between the individual catchment and the large catchment sample study favoring an intermediate balance between depth and breadth gupta et al 2014 hence between process understanding and amenability to generalization while recognizing the need to go beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual catchments mcdonnell et al 2007 the nested catchment setup acknowledges the importance of region specific knowledge which is often the key to interpret the unexplained variability of large sample studies gnann et al 2021 a key advantage of the nested catchment setup is that it enables control on the water exchanges between subcatchments this control allows studying aspects such as routing processes or groundwater exchanges which are more difficult to examine when considering catchments in isolation for example as noted by beven 2001b the continuity equation is the most fundamental law in hydrology but as a hypothesis it would appear that we cannot currently verify it at the catchment scale as there is still no way of checking whether the catchment is indeed watertight while this statement holds true when studying catchments in isolation the nested catchment setup facilitates such checks as groundwater exports at some subcatchments would need to be compensated by groundwater import at some neighbouring subcatchments bouaziz et al 2018 our proposed approach to perceptual model development critically relied on the role of the hydrological expert this role was increasingly challenged in modern model development approaches such as in distributed modeling where field data collection is motivated mostly by model parameterization burt and mcdonnell 2015 and machine learning techniques which challenge the assumption that the world needs our theories and expertise nearing et al 2021 in our approach expert knowledge was essential in the key stages of the perceptual modeling process and in particular in i interpreting catchment response time series and help defining meaningful signatures of catchment response without expert judgment one can easily miss important traits of catchment response for example the time to peak signatures which were considered important in this study were not considered in even comprehensive collection of streamflow signatures e g yadav et al 2007 addor et al 2017 ii grouping spatially resolved data into classes that are potentially useful for hydrology readily available catchment indicators may not contain the ones that are more hydrologically meaningful oudin et al 2010 in our case for example the key to explain the variability of baseflow index relied on an expert driven reclassification of 31 lithology classes into three permeability classes an analogous endeavor to reclassify data into hydrologically relevant information is represented by the hydrology of soil types host classification developed for uk boorman et al 1995 where soils are classified based on their influence on hydrological processes iii distinguishing cause effect relationships from mere correlations several landscape and climate properties may co vary which makes unpicking the right controls on signatures spatial variability non trivial resorting to generic statistical or machine learning approaches can exacerbate this problem as these methods are structurally complex and difficult to interpret instead resorting to hydrological knowledge can guide towards meaningful process interpretations both by offering prior knowledge of plausible cause and effect relationships and by helping to refine such relationships through process based methods in our study the interpretation of distinct signatures relied on individual methods which resorted to hydrological common knowledge for example as shown in table a1 average streamflow correlated well not only with average precipitation r s 0 92 but also with average elevation or the proportion of forest r s 0 80 the continuity equation helped to select precipitation as the right cause of streamflow average variability however without a hydrological framework unpicking the right control may have not been as obvious particularly in a possible scenario where precipitation had resulted in a lower correlation than other variables because of poor data quality iv synthesizing results in the form of a perceptual model this is a process of iteration abstraction and synthesis which seeks a plausible description of the overall system behavior that explains a set of individual pieces of evidence such synthesis process is the essence of the formulation of the perceptual model which pieces together all the individual data interpretation analyses into a coherent interpretation of catchment behavior in this process the role of the hydrological expert is the key to strengthen the plausibility of a process based explanation it is important to recognize that a perceptual model is subject to its own uncertainties in particular there are sources of uncertainty affecting the calculation of climate indices landscape indices and streamflow signatures westerberg and mcmillan 2015 for example we noted that occasionally the lithology maps presented clear discontinuities both at the border between countries or at the separation between adjacent maps in the same country we also noted that occasionally it was not possible to assess whether streamflow time series were measured in summer or winter time which could have induced a bias when calculating lag time signatures errors in the rating curve could add a bias to the assessment of streamflow averages the streamflow filtering approach and its parameterization can affect the calculation of baseflow index however these decisions are not expected to affect significantly the relative catchment ranking which was the primary objective of such baseflow index analyses there are also uncertainties in the interpretation of the variability of streamflow signatures such interpretations often require expert decisions which are not always obvious because of such sources of uncertainty the perceptual model should be regarded as a hypothesis of catchment behavior therefore amenable to criticism and revision the hydrological expertise outlined above can be contributed by hydrologists with various backgrounds for example both the experimentalist and the modeler can contribute to the key stages of the perceptual modeling process outlined above showing that the dialogue between experimentalist and modeler seibert and mcdonnell 2002 can take place also beyond the headwater scale the difference is that while at the headwater scale such dialog can follow a bottom up approach from the small scale measurements to the headwater scale processes at the regional scale because of measurements limitations it needs to follow an opposite top down approach from the streamflow responses back to the processes that have generated them as perceptual models are often the basis for conceptual models the approach outlined here can provide a platform for a stronger engagement of the experimentalist in the distributed model development process in other words engagement on model structural development rather than only data collection for model parameterization burt and mcdonnell 2015 in fmm2022 we illustrate how the proposed perceptual model can provide useful indications on what to account for and what to ignore in the development of a conceptual distributed model 6 conclusions this paper has presented a top down approach for building a perceptual model of streamflow variability at the regional scale based on the interpretation of subcatchments responses we used the moselle catchment with 26 gauged subcatchments and based our perceptual model on the interpretation of streamflow regional variability our approach critically relied on expert knowledge which can be contributed both by the experimentalist and the modeler and goes beyond previous dialog between experimentalist and modeler that until now has focused largely at hillslope and headwater catchment scales this expert knowledge was especially helpful for reading streamflow time series and synthesize them in a set of streamflow signatures for distinguishing cause effect relationships from mere data correlations and for ultimately synthesizing results in the form of a perceptual model the resulting perceptual model was a posteriori reasonable as it could be justified by process understanding but not a priori obvious given the many possible causes that can potentially affect the streamflow regional variability within a nested catchment in summary our moselle perceptual model established that streamflow regional variability could be captured by 4 streamflow signatures the streamflow average the baseflow index the time to peak and the relative lag between hydrographs these streamflow signatures were affected by distinct climatic or landscape characteristics and responded to different process which could be considered dominant in the current context the spatial variability of precipitation affected significantly the differences in the amount of streamflow observed at different subcatchments which was attributed to processes associated to the long term water balance lithology and in particular its relative permeability had a strong influence on the baseflow vs quickflow partitioning topography and land use appeared to affect primarily the time to peak and the hydrograph relative lag due to processes related to flow routing and drainage river routing was responsible for the lag between hydrograph at successive downstream stations the identification of all of these controls on the spatial variability of streamflow signatures downplayed other potential controls in particular regional groundwater flow extending beyond the subcatchment boundaries did not appear to be significant moreover vegetation and soil did not appear to play a major role in explaining streamflow signatures spatial variability although the perceptual model is specific to the particular moselle context we think that the general approach for developing this perceptual model is applicable to other nested catchments in particular the proposed guidelines on how to exploit expert knowledge or even frame an experimentalist modeler dialog at the regional scale and their employment to use the given data to interpret dominant catchment processes may serve as a basis to build perceptual models elsewhere and with different conditions of data availability finally perceptual models are generally versatile in that they can underlie many applications therefore their development deserves dedicated attention in fmm2022 we illustrate how the proposed perceptual model can be used to inform the development of a distributed yet parsimonious hydrological model this application however does not preclude the use of the perceptual model shown here for other purposes nor its revision or refinement in future studies credit authorship contribution statement fabrizio fenicia conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft jeffrey j

us to the french data sources appendix a definition of streamflow signatures streamflow average q mm yr the streamflow average is defined as follows 13 q 1 n t t 1 n t q t where q indicates the streamflow at an individual subcatchment t is the time index n t is the number of observations and the overbar indicates the average over the observation period baseflow index q bfi the baseflow index is defined as 14 q bfi t 1 n t q t b t 1 n t q t where q t b is the baseflow at a given time a popular filter for calculating the baseflow was proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 15 q t b min q t ϑ b q t 1 b 1 ϑ b 2 q t 1 q t as recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 the filter was applied to daily streamflow using three passes forward backward and forward with the filtering parameter ϑ b set to 0 925 time to peak q ttp h in order to characterize the time to peak we considered the time occurring from the beginning of the rising limb to the peak discharge using hourly resolution streamflow data in order to get a representative value for the entire time series the following procedure was used we extracted the rising limbs of the hydrographs we eliminated all rising limbs where the total rise is lower than a specified threshold ϑ q which was set at the difference between the 95 and 5 quantiles of the streamflow we calculated the time length of the remaining rising limbs t 1 n r where n r represents the number of rising limbs we used the 50 quantile of t 1 n r 16 q ttp q 50 t 1 n r relative lag q lag h in order to estimate the lag between hydrographs at successive stations indicated with q a and q b we proceeded as follows we determined pair of stations by considering for each station the corresponding successive downstream station in the river network we excluded pairs for which the ratio between the area of the upstream subcatchment and the area of the downstream subcatchment is lower than a threshold ϑ a which was set to 0 3 this threshold avoids excessively large contributing area in between stations we calculated the pearson cross correlation r n l n l between the downstream hydrograph q b and the lagged upstream hydrograph q a allowing for lags n l of up to 20 h we considered the lag i l that results in the maximum pearson cross correlation 17 q lag i l such that max r n l n l r i l we further excluded pairs of stations for which i l was negative half

high correlation with l h lit r s 0 84 the correlation with other metrics was much lower and 3 q ttp had the lowest correlation with the selected metrics r s 0 55 in terms of climatic indices and

was negatively correlated with l elavg top r s 0 82 climatic indices and streamflow signatures were not internally correlated but several landscape features co varied relatively high correlation was found not only for indices based on the same underlying maps but also for indices based on different maps for example there was a strong correlation between l crp lnd and l wet top r s 0 87 and between l for lnd and l hil top r s 0 84 
3740,perceptual catchment models are a key first step towards hydrologic synthesis and provide the process foundation of predictive models however their development is usually limited to the headwater catchment scale where field work can be done here we develop a perceptual model approach for a regional scale catchment we use a systematic top down approach based on an expert driven interpretation of the streamflow responses of nested subcatchments this approach complements the traditional bottom up perceptual model development based on fieldwork observations which is impractical at the regional scale due to measurement limitations as an example to illustrate our approach and demonstrate its feasibility we use the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment with 26 gauged subcatchments our perceptual model of the moselle catchment presents a description of dominant processes that we consider a posteriori reasonable but not a priori obvious where precipitation much more than evaporation or groundwater exchange controls the spatial variability of average streamflow lithology influences the partitioning between baseflow and quickflow and topography and land use control hydrograph lag times a striking feature of our analysis is the rather minor role that vegetation and soil appear to play in streamflow spatial variability at the scale of our inquiry we use our perceptual model to build a distributed yet parsimonious hydrological model in part 2 of this paper series although the perceptual model is specific for the moselle we hope that the perceptual model approach used here can be helpful to others working in large catchments in different hydroclimates where other factors will dominate keywords perceptual model dominant processes streamflow signatures regional scale top down approach expert knowledge 1 introduction perceptual models in catchment hydrology are qualitative representations of hydrological systems intended to illustrate their main components behavior and

perceptual model development is recognized increasingly for its central importance e g wagener et al 2020 and several illustrations of perceptual models have been made based on expert knowledge e g beven and chappell 2021 few methods have been discussed to bring data to the perceptual model development exercise for large watersheds perceptual models have been constructed mainly at the hillslope or headwater catchment scale 10 km2 e g mcglynn et al 2002 wrede et al 2015 where field measurements can inform process perception and form the basis for the dialog between experimentalist and modeler seibert and mcdonnell 2002 but how to develop perceptual models beyond the headwater catchment scale where field based sampling and measurement are impractical the extreme scale dependency of runoff processes means that perceptual models developed at the field scale on hillslopes and headwater catchments are generally not representative at the meso 100 1 000 km2 or regional scale 10 000 km2 sivapalan 2003 meaning just as headwater catchments are not a linear superposition of soil cores mcdonnell et al 2021 the meso or regional scale catchment a is not a linear superposition of headwater catchments thus characterizing the dominant processes at the regional scale does not imply an account of the heterogeneity and complexity observed at the hillslope scale sivapalan 2003 regional scale

certainly expert knowledge plays a role this is a function of personal and subjective experience beven and chappell 2021 but also linked to this is intuition theoretical background and transfer of knowledge from other catchments here we add and explore the interpretation of in situ data and how it can combine with other forms of expert knowledge to inform perceptual model development at the regional scale while the traditional perceptual model development based on local fieldwork observations can be regarded as bottom up sivapalan et al 2003 our approach based on the interpretation of catchment responses is more top down in particular we base our process understanding on the interpretation on the spatial variability of streamflow signatures within a nested catchment we acknowledge that the interpretation of the spatial variability of hydrological signatures has been the objective of many studies focused on catchment classification e g wagener et al 2007 sivakumar et al 2015 however these studies have typically adopted a large sample approach which resulted in prioritizing the impact of climate at the expense of landscape e g beck et al 2015 addor et al 2018 and have relied on general purpose statistical or machine learning approaches e g peñas et al 2014 sivakumar et al 2015 which were generally difficult to interpret our reliance on a nested catchment setup and on expert knowledge is intended to increase process understanding at the regional scale such as to clarify the interplay between climate and landscape in controlling streamflow responses anticipating which signatures best characterize streamflow variability in any nested catchment and which dominant processes affect them is not a priori obvious first uniqueness of place in terms of catchment properties or measurements limits our ability to create generalizable hypotheses beven 2000 for example oudin et al 2010 showed that seemingly similar catchments can respond drastically different which required digging beyond commonly used metrics of catchment similarity secondly classification and regionalization studies have shown that the signatures that best characterize streamflow variability may differ from one region to the other depending on the underlying dominant processes e g blöschl et al 2013 gupta et al 2013 thirdly even the same signatures can respond to different process controls in different environments for example gnann et al 2021 showed that the spatial variability of baseflow signatures could be associated with soil and sediment texture in regions covered by glacial deposits in north united states compared to soil stratigraphy in the appalachian mountains in north carolina sinkhole density in the ozarks and the maturity of the landscape represented by geological age in the oregon cascades this variability of process controls then motivated different perceptual models in these distinct areas thus we suspect that these process controls at the regional scale are equivocal for many other signatures here we demonstrate a systematic approach for perceptual model development at the regional scale using the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment in europe as a case study we use 26 stream gauging stations with 26 years of streamflow records climatic variables and landscape properties maps unlike other systems of its size in europe the moselle has relatively low population density with 150 inhabitants per square kilometer www fgg rhein de an absence of major lakes and exceptionally good data availability leveraging these attributes and to show a proof of concept with a simple regional scale catchment our objectives are 1 to develop a hydrological synthesis for the moselle catchment in the form of a distributed perceptual model of regional

catchment with outlet in cochem 50 km upstream of the confluence with the rhine drainage distance with a contributing area of 27 100 km2 fig 1a elevations range between 60 and 1424 m a s l with 96 of the catchment area lying below 600 m fig 1b land cover is dominated by forest 38 followed by crop 30 pasture 20 developed areas 8 defined here as urban sub urban industrial and other artificial landuses and wetland 4 fig 1c in terms of geology the moselle catchment extends over four main structural units two geological basins the paris basin in the center west and the sarre nahe bergland permian basin in the east consisting of mainly sedimentary rocks and two geological massifs the vosges massif in the south culminating at 1424 m a s l and the rhenish massif in the north reaching an altitude of 816 m a s l consisting mainly of metamorphic rocks the lithology of the catchment is varied given the extent of the area see later fig 7a soil texture shows contrasting characteristics across the catchment with coarse material in the mountainous southern part of the catchment fine materials in the central part and medium to medium fine materials in the north fig 1d we consider 26 subcatchments based on a selection of stream gauging stations fig 1a table 1 reports both the total and incremental area of the subcatchments that is their entire contributing area and the incremental area from the next upstream subcatchment hence corresponding to the colored regions in fig 1a the hydrometeorology of the subcatchments is shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows their hydrographs whose similarities and differences are analyzed in detail in section 3 2 fig 2b represents the subcatchments in budyko space budyko 1974 which highlights the variability in the hydrometeorological conditions in the area with dryness index i d the ratio between average potential evaporation and average precipitation ranging between 0 5 and 1 2 and evaporative index i e the ratio between average actual evaporation calculated as the difference between average precipitation and streamflow and average precipitation varying between 0 3 and 0 7 the subcatchments show significant correlation in the budyko space with a spearman correlation r s 0 79 and a corresponding p value p s well below the conventional significance threshold of 5 2 2 data sources the data used in this study are classified into three categories streamflow climate precipitation and temperature and landscape maps of elevation land cover lithology and soil texture streamflow streamflow data q mm h normalized by the catchment area is considered at 26 stations fig 1a for the period 01 09 1989 31 08 2015 where we have assumed the 1st of september to be the start of the hydrological year the german data are obtained from the german federal institute of hydrology bfg the luxembourgish data are obtained from the administration de la gestion de l eau the french data are obtained from eaufrance downloaded at hydro eaufrance fr all streamflow time series are available at hourly resolution climate precipitation p mm d and temperature t c c data are obtained from the e obs gridded dataset version 14 0 downloaded at www ecad eu haylock et al 2008 this dataset has daily temporal resolution and a regular 0 25 0 25 degrees grid spatial resolution about 20 30 km at the catchment s latitude it is based on an interpolation of ground station data note that for precipitation the daily average of a given day is computed between 6 00 utc of that day and 6 00 utc of the following day haylock et al 2008 the same interval is therefore used in computing daily streamflow since the precipitation stations used by the e obs data set have much lower density in the french part of the catchment than in the german part as also apparent in fig 1 of haylock et al 2008 the precipitation in the subcatchments with the majority of their areas in france nietaltdorf hauconcourt malzeville metz rosseldange toul custines

potential evaporation e pot time series using the 1985 hargreaves equation hargreaves and allen 2003 for the calculation of the climatic indices described in section 3 3 as well as those represented in fig 2b the climatic data concomitant with the availability of streamflow data in each subcatchment is used landscape landscape data include maps of elevation soil lithology and land cover elevation the digital elevation model is obtained from usgs hydrosheds resolution 78 4 m catchment elevation is shown in fig 1b land cover the maps is generated using the corine land cover european database clc12 version 18 5 downloaded at land copernicus eu four land cover classes are considered crop forest pasture developed areas urban industrial etc and wetland fig 1c lithology the maps are obtained from different sources depending on the country for france we use the bd lisa database version 1 niveau 2 ordre 1 scale 1 250 000 downloaded at https bdlisa eaufrance fr for germany we use the geologische übersichtskarte der bundesrepublik deutschland gük200 downloaded at www bgr bund de scale 1 200 000 for luxembourg the lithology map is obtained by the administration de la gestion de l eau scale of 1 250 000 for belgium we use the ihme1500 database version 11 downloaded at www bgr bund de scale 1 1 500 000 the ihme data has a much coarser resolution than the other maps however only 3 of the catchment belongs to belgium see above the lithology maps are combined which resulted in a total of 31 lithology classes shown later in fig 7a soil soil properties are obtained from the european soil database version 2 0 the distribution of soil texture attribute text into fine medium fine medium and coarse attributes is shown in fig 1d these data are used for the calculation of the metrics defined in the following section 3 methodology our approach to develop a perceptual model characterizing streamflow regional variability consists of the following basic steps 1 determine a set of streamflow signatures that characterize key traits of streamflow spatial variability 2 specify the methods that are most appropriate interpret the spatial variability of each individual streamflow signature 3 identify the landscape or climatic attributes that cause the variability of each individual streamflow signature 4 synthesize the interpretation of each individual streamflow signature in the form of a distributed perceptual model which elucidates the dominant processes affecting the spatial variability of streamflow the intended characteristics of the perceptual model are schematically represented in fig 3 in particular the perceptual model is expected to include the following information 1 the definition of a key set of streamflow signatures that characterize streamflow spatial variability at internal subcatchments 2 the identification of the main landscape or climate controls on the spatial variability of each streamflow signature such identification should then lead to an understanding of the climate or landscape variability that matters at that scale which is used to define regions of hydrological similarity 3 the characterization of the dominant processes in each region of hydrological similarity which is derived by interpreting the processes that underlie the variability of individual streamflow signatures 4 the connectivity between processes associated to distinct regions hence how distinct landscape sections connect to each other to generate the overall catchment response and 5 the relationships between spatially variable processes such as how a certain process e g baseflow runoff or channel routing varies in magnitude depending on landscape properties the various elements of the perceptual model may be associated to varying degrees of confidence which the development process would help in characterizing in this section we describe the definition of streamflow signatures section 3 1 their potential process controls based on previous literature section 3 2 and the definition of landscape and climatic indices used in subsequent analyses section 3 3 3 1 selection of streamflow signatures our definition of streamflow signatures starts with a visual inspection of the 26 hydrographs designed to single out hydrograph similarities and differences fig 4 exemplifies the key results of this analysis 1 streamflow magnitude can vary significantly between subcatchments for example fig 4a shows the hydrographs at epinal and luneville two neighboring subcatchments in the south of the moselle catchment the streamflow at epinal appears to be systematically larger than the streamflow at luneville 2 there are noticeable differences in baseflow versus quickflow proportions between hydrographs for example fig 4b shows the difference between the hydrographs at niedaltdorf on the river nied and reinheim on the river biel the two subcatchments are located in the center east of the moselle catchment and they are closely spaced the outlets are 50 km apart it is noticeable that niedaltdorf has larger baseflow and lower peakflow than reinheim 3 the time it takes for hydrograph to rise in response to a rainfall event was found to vary significantly between subcatchments for example niedaltdorf and nomeny appear to have similar baseflow characteristics but niedaltdorf appears to have a flashier response than nomeny fig 4c also these two subcatchments are closely spaced they have a border in common and the subcatchment with slower response nomeny is the smallest of the two 929 vs 1332 km2 4 hydrographs at consecutive gauges on the river network if the areas of the corresponding subcatchments are not significantly different can be very similar for example fig 4d shows the case of cochem the catchment outlet and trier 50 km upstream in linear distance although the two hydrographs are similar they clearly show an offset with the downstream hydrograph lagging behind 5 the hydrographs also present similarities in particular they all appear share a similar seasonal behavior with higher flows during winter and lower flows during summer as apparent for example in fig 2 these visual perceptions have motivated the selection of the following streamflow signatures which are more specifically defined in appendix a 1 streamflow average q mm yr which is simply the long term average of streamflow observation 2 baseflow index q bfi which indicates the proportion of baseflow over total flow 3 time to peak q ttp h designed to reflect the average duration of the rising limbs of the hydrograph 4 relative lag q lag h which quantifies the time shift between two hydrographs 5 half streamflow date q hsd d defined as number of days on which half of the yearly streamflow has passed starting from the beginning of the hydrological year i e 1st of september see section 2 2 and intended to capture streamflow seasonality for further analyses it is important to keep streamflow signatures that are relative independent and show sufficient variability fig 5 shows that these conditions apply for the first three signatures confirming the visual impressions that they reflect distinctive traits of streamflow variability in particular the spearman correlation values r s are relatively low and the p values p s are relatively large indicating limited correlation significance the relative lag signature is only applicable to pair of subcatchments and therefore is not directly comparable with the other signatures the half streamflow date showed very little variability it varied between 23 jan to 9 feb for all subcatchments which confirmed the visual impression that hydrographs have similar seasonal behaviour and motivated its exclusion in successive analyses it is worth pointing out that the first three signatures listed above broadly correspond to the hydrograph characteristics that the three components of the kling gupta efficiency kge aim to optimize gupta et al 2009 in particular the kge aims at matching the overall volume of flow spread of flow and timing of the hydrograph which are characteristics that can be associated to the first three signatures listed above 3 2 approaches to identify process controls on selected streamflow signatures after having identified a set of key streamflow signatures we ask the following two sets of questions 1 what are their potential process controls and more specifically are these controls already a priori obvious and 2 which methods are most appropriate to identify them can available hydrological experience help define tailored and interpretable methods for analyzing individual streamflow signatures as opposed to general purpose statistical or machine learning approaches in order to answer these questions we synthesize previous studies that have analyzed our selection of streamflow signatures 3 2 1 streamflow average explaining the spatial variability of streamflow average is part of the more general problem of exploring the geographical variability of the long term water budget e g budyko 1974 dooge 1992 milly 1994 the long term water budget can be expressed as 1 q p e act g where the overbar is used to indicate the long term averages and q p e act and g represent streamflow precipitation actual total evaporation and groundwater outflow respectively from eq 1 it is clear that the spatial variability in q is due to the combination of p e act and g however in which proportion these three terms contribute to this variability and if one of them eventually dominates on the other is not a priori clear moreover while p can be measured the other two terms need to be somehow estimated the long term evaporation e act has been related to various climatic and landscape factors perhaps the simplest way of representing these dependencies is by relating e act to the average potential evaporation e pot by a simple stress factor e g peng et al 2019 the more popular budyko model budyko 1974 relates e act to e pot and p there are several approximately equivalent formulations of the budyko model e g daly et al 2019 including the one parameter turc mezentsev formula turc 1954 mezentsev 1955 widely used in many applications e g bouaziz et al 2018 andréassian and sari 2019 2 e act p 1 1 p e pot b 1 b where b is a model parameter such simple formulation has been shown to leave various degrees of unexplained variability depending on the applications which has been attributed to various unaccounted climate or landscape characteristics in different studies including the characteristics of vegetation seasonality soil properties and topographic controls e g as reviewed in greve et al 2016 groundwater flow which is the other main unknown in eq 1 can be an important component of the long term water balance for example schaller and fan 2009 made an extensive investigation on 1555 catchments in the united states and found that groundwater imports and exports can be significant primarily driven by climate with arid basins more affected basins size with larger basins being more self contained and bedrock permeability with high bedrock permeability leading to larger groundwater import or exports in the meuse catchment neighbouring the moselle catchment bouaziz et al 2018 found that several subcatchments are affected by significant groundwater flow which was attributed to the effect of lithology the possible significance of groundwater flow has motivated its inclusion even in very simple conceptual models le moine et al 2007 based on the description above our approach to identify the process controls on the streamflow average signature in the moselle catchment is as follow we will use eq 1 as the framework to explain the variability of the regional water budget in the moselle catchment our investigation will start with regressing q with p which is measured we will then include e act estimated using simple e g a simple stress factor to more complex e g eq 2 formulations and proceed by accounting for g which could be identified leveraging the nested catchment setup which implies that the water lost at some subcatchments needs to be gained at some neighbouring subcatchments bouaziz et al 2018 in line with the top down approach there will be no need to investigate further once a reasonable fit to the observed q is obtained in summary eq 1 provides the framework to explore the spatial variability of q but to what extent it is possible to explain this variability and in which proportion p e act and g contribute to it is not a priori obvious we will thus examine available data to establish a plausible explanation for the spatial variability of streamflow average 3 2 2 baseflow index several studies have indicated bedrock as the most important control on the variability of the baseflow index bfi e g lacey and grayson 1998 longobardi and villani 2008 bloomfield et al 2009 this finding has an intuitive explanation as groundwater is stored in the rocks especially if they are highly fractured and this contributes to baseflow lacey and grayson 1998 however different bedrock features can describe the relation of bedrock to baseflow characteristics in different places for example in the alzette catchment in luxembourg the variability of baseflow index was correlated to lithology types pfister et al 2017 whereas in the oregon cascades it was explained by the maturity of the landscape rather than the lithology type tague and grant 2004 besides bedrock properties a plethora of additional landscape or climate controls was found responsible for the regional variability of baseflow index in different studies e g price 2011 using 8600 catchments in united states santhi et al 2008 found that relief maximum minus minimum elevation in the catchment was the most strongly correlated variable to bfi with lower relief leading to higher baseflow using 3394 catchments worldwide beck et al 2013 found that the bfi was best related to the mean and seasonality of potential evaporation mean annual air temperature and mean snow water equivalent depth they also observed that their results seemed to contradict the perception of a relationship between slope or lithology and bfi using 103 catchments in europe schneider et al 2007 found that soil type could be used to predict baseflow index although the goodness of fit decreased in the southern areas using 67 catchment in belgium zomlot et al 2015 found that baseflow index was mostly affected by vegetation cover using 12 catchments in tanzania mwakalila et al 2002 found that baseflow index was positively correlated with the ratio of precipitation on potential evaporation based on the review above the following approach is adopted to explain the variability of bfi in the moselle we will start from regressing bfi to easily accessible metrics of catchment similarity including topography soil and land use if results will not be satisfactory we well sort the variability of lithology classes into a restricted number of relative bedrock permeability classes based on expert judgment and regress these properties to baseflow index this attempt is motivated by the finding that lithology was found to be an important control on streamflow variability in the alzette mesoscale catchment in luxembourg which is part of the moselle hellebrand et al 2007 pfister et al 2017 it is however unclear whether these findings will hold true at the much larger regional scale in summary the variability of bfi depends in principle on multiple controls to the point that it may be even hazardous to rely on the intuition that they can be related to bedrock properties our approach will therefore be relatively inclusive in terms of potential controls and potentially require a careful assessment of bedrock hydrological properties 3 2 3 time to peak the time span of the rising limb of the hydrograph has been indicated by various terms including time to peak time of concentration lag time catchment response time with various sometimes overlapping definitions some considering the time difference between rainfall and runoff events and other considering hydrograph properties alone e g gericke and smithers 2014 beven 2020 in spite of their different definitions such timing signatures are strongly correlated to each other as they share the same intention of characterizing the duration of a hydrograph pulse response e g see fig 2 in gericke and smithers 2014 in this section we use time to peak to collectively refer to such metrics numerous previous studies have related time to peak to various observable catchment properties the most widely used models used multiplicative relationships between topography related properties suggesting that the time to peak increases with basin size and decreases with basin slope e g taylor and schwarz 1952 gericke and smithers 2014 beven 2020 the characteristics of the hypsometric curve an integrated measure of catchment topography have also been successfully related to time to peak as an alternative to other topography related measures harlin 1984 luo and harlin 2003 rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 developed a theoretical relationship between time to peak and the horton number in the attempt to overcome the conceptual limitations of the so many and not very illuminating regressions we keep using in the field such theoretical relation however has not found high predictive value as noted for example by howard 1990 who found that horton s numbers collectively account for only 5 per cent of the explained variance in the estimating equations his results instead confirmed that terms related to catchment size and average channel gradients provided the greatest predictive power some studies showed that underground flow pathways and the porous media related to them soil and lithology can have a significant impact on time to peak dunne 1978 showed that hydrographs generated by infiltration excess overland flow had times to peak 40 times shorter than hydrographs generated by subsurface stormflow gaál et al 2012 used 396 austrian catchments and showed that karst catchments as well as catchments dominated by schist phyllite had much more delayed responses compared to other catchments with marl and clay lithology in a study on 3 experimental catchments with different lithology wrede et al 2015 showed that the catchment on schist had a time to peak in the order days whereas the other two catchments on clay and sandstone responded near coincidently with the rainfall based on the review above we will adopt the following approach to investigate time to peak variability in the moselle catchment we will look for a multiplicative relationship between landscape attributes the relevant dependent variables in the regression models will be determined through stepwise regression e g berger and entekhabi 2001 a common method that involves progressively adding variables based on how well they improve the fit this approach has the advantage that the order in which variables are added provides information on their influence however it may not be able to capture complex relationships between data beyond the one envisaged in summary similarly to the previous streamflow signatures it would be difficult to a priori guess which landscape or climatic properties would influence the spatial variability of the time to peak in the moselle catchment as this signature was described primarily using multiplicative relationships in previous work we will adopt this framework to look for suitable fitting relationships 3 2 4 relative lag the delay demonstrated by flow as it travels downstream along a river reach is a relatively well understood phenomenon in river hydraulics the lag between hydrographs at successive points along a channel can be modeled by the so called saint venant equations which are based on the conservation of mass and momentum in channels and are well described in many hydrology and hydraulics textbooks e g henderson 1966 this route however is both data demanding as it requires channel geometry and roughness information and potentially computationally intensive depending on the simplifications one is prepared to accept it is therefore impractical for applications such as the use of the perceptual model to inform a conceptual model particularly for an initial stage where the main building blocks of the conceptual model are yet unrefined and their definition in successive model development stages may require computationally intensive calibrations and comparisons of multiple model variants these arguments raise the question whether there are there simpler even if not as accurate approaches for modeling such delay the answer may come from geomorphology and in particular from the scaling laws that connect hydraulic and geomorphological properties of natural rivers e g leopold and maddock 1953 rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 leopold and maddock 1953 empirically observed that in a downstream direction average streamflow velocity v increases following a power law relationship 3 v q α where q is the average streamflow not normalized by the catchment area empirical investigations returned a value of α 0 1 this relatively low value indicates that the velocity tends to remain constant or increase slightly in the downstream direction considering that at a first approximation q increases linearly with the catchment area a e g rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 q a and that following a kinematic wave approximation celerity c hence the flood wave propagation speed is proportional to velocity v c e g henderson 1966 based on eq 3 one can assume c a α and therefore 4 q lag q a q b l ab a ab α where l ab is the flow distance between two locations a and b and a ab is the average of the catchment areas at the two locations this relationship accounts for the fact that the celerity increases and therefore the lag reduces for larger catchments which have on average larger flow our proposed approach is therefore as follows we will identify successive gauges for which the intermediate contributing area is proportionally small and calculate the hydrograph lag we will regress the lags calculated for different pairs of subcatchments using eq 4 in summary in contrast to the other three streamflow signatures the relative lag between hydrographs can be estimated using well established river hydraulics methods a priori unclear however is to what degree simplified approaches such as relying on eq 4 have predictive value 3 3 selection of climatic and landscape indices our selection of climatic and landscape indices is listed in table 2 in terms of climatic indices we restricted our selection to average precipitation and potential evaporation where the average was extended to the streamflow data availability period for each subcatchment see fig 3 in fmm2022 we did not consider snow related indices e g sawicz et al 2011 razavi and coulibaly 2013 as only a small fraction of precipitation is falling as snow below 5 in each subcatchment as well as indices reflecting the phase offset between precipitation and evaporation e g berghuijs et al 2014 as catchments are in the same climatic region and as already observed section 3 1 hydrographs have similar seasonal behaviour the landscape indices are extracted using the four maps described in section 2 2 topography land use lithology and soil texture as we use several landscape indices to minimize confusion we represent them with the notation l x y where l stands for landscape index y indicates the underlying map top lnd lit and stx respectively and x indicates the specific attribute see table 2 for the complete list our selection of landscape indices is justified as follows in terms of topography indices such as l area top l elavg top l elrel top and measures of slope are among the most commonly used in studies examining the spatial variability of streamflow signatures see ali et al 2012 for a review indices such as l drden top l dstd top and l dstg top are typical in catchment geomorphology rodríguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 and are also used in some classification studies see ali et al 2012 for a review the indices l wet top l hil top l plt top are the fractions of topographical wetland hillslope and plateau introduced by gharari et al 2011 where wetland is the landscape with height above nearest drainage lower than a specified threshold here 10 m and the rest of the landscape is partitioned into hillslope and plateau if the slope is higher or lower than a specified threshold here 11 according to gharari et al 2011 fractions of land cover types as the ones defined here table 2 are used in many studies e g zhang et al 2004 yadav et al 2007 oudin et al 2008 razavi and coulibaly 2013 kuentz et al 2017 land cover was also expressed by alternative metrics such as the leaf area index e g sawicz et al 2011 addor et al 2017 or metrics oriented to reflect the vegetation biomass e g jencso and mcglynn 2011 which here we did not consider lithology is often represented directly through the fraction occupied by the lithological formations e g bloomfield et al 2009 jencso and mcglynn 2011 fenicia et al 2016 kuentz et al 2017 as these formations can be many it is useful to group them into more general classes e g yadav et al 2007 hellebrand et al 2008 dal molin et al 2020 the formulation of suitable lithology indices is explored in section 4 1 2 we used soil texture for characterizing soil data table 2 as common to many studies e g addor et al 2017 kuentz et al 2017 alternative soil characteristics proved useful for hydrological purposes such as the hydrology of soil types classification system developed for the united kingdom boorman et al 1995 and used in several studies e g schneider et al 2007 yadav et al 2007 ali et al 2012 but such data is generally not available in other regions although not necessarily exhaustive compared to previous studies on streamflow signature variability our selection of landscape indices is rather inclusive for example it has not been uncommon to base the interpretation of streamflow spatial variability on topography information alone see ali et al 2012 for a review moreover such indices are based on widely available information and therefore have broad applicability 4 result and interpretations the following sections present the identification of the process controls on the 4 identified streamflow signatures section 4 1 and their synthesis into a regional scale perceptual model of the moselle catchment section 4 2 appendix b includes a correlation analysis between all landscape indices climatic indices and streamflow signatures which provides a broad overview of various dependencies and complements the targeted analyses presented in section 4 1 in order to capture potentially nonlinear dependencies we used the spearman correlation r s for which a significance p value threshold p s 5 is typically assumed 4 1 identification of process controls on streamflow signatures 4 1 1 explaining variability in streamflow average as described in section 3 2 1 eq 1 provides the framework to explore the variability of the long term water budget our approach to identify the main influence factors on the variability in q proceeded by accounting for p e act and g until a sufficient fit to the observed q was achieved the models here proposed were tested with least squared regression and assessed in terms of nash and sutcliffe efficiency f ns we started with a very simple model where q is related to p and the other terms are combined into a single constant b 5 q p b this model already provided an exceptionally good performance with f ns 0 91 this relatively high performance indicated that the margin of improvement was small as described in section 3 2 1 an obvious attempt to evolve eq 5 was to better characterize the evaporation term by including its potential controls as discussed in section 3 2 1 potential evaporation is a first order control on actual evaporation and a simple way to account for its effect is as follows 6 q p b e pot where b in this case represents the proportionality between potential e pot and actual evaporation this model resulted into f ns 0 87 and therefore did not improve the fit compared to eq 5 finally we considered the budyko model of eq 2 which as discussed in section 3 2 1 is an established approach to represent the long term catchment water balance 7 q p p 1 p e pot b 1 b where b was treated as a calibration parameter this model returned f ns 0 90 which is intermediate between the two previous models fig 6 a shows the excellent correlation between q and p spearman correlation r s 0 92 and corresponding p value p s close to zero indicating high significance which suggested p as the dominant control on q and automatically downplayed other potential controls fig 6b shows the poor correlation between actual difference between observed precipitation and streamflow long term averages and potential evaporation which explains why accounting for e pot in equations and did not improve the fit the relatively good fit obtained with the models above suggested a small influence of g hence concerning the long term water balance it appeared reasonable to assume that the subcatchments are watertight 4 1 2 influence factors on the baseflow index signature the correlation between q bfi and climatic indices or landscape indices based on topography land use and soil was generally low spearman correlation r s 0 55 we therefore embarked into the task of sorting the variability of lithology into relative permeability classes section 3 2 2 in particular we defined three permeability classes of low medium and high permeability represented with the symbols l l lit l m lit and l h lit respectively table 2 using expert judgment as outlined below we reclassified each of the lithology classes in one of these three permeability classes table 3 lists the lithological classes sorted by the area they occupy in the moselle catchment the first 15 formations already occupy 95 of the catchment with reference to these formations the following rationale was used for their classification formations such as marl schist dolomite rock and crystalline basement were considered as low permeability as formed by fine particles or hard rock formations such as sandstone alluvium sand gravel and conglomerate were considered as high permeability as notably capable of storing and transmitting water limestone was considered as medium permeability as intermediate between sandstone and marl mixed formations were considered as medium permeability if the permeable formation was mentioned first e g sandstone and marl and low permeability if the impermeable formation was mentioned first e g marl and sandstone the original lithology map and the final bedrock permeability map are shown in fig 7 fig 8 a shows that there was a strong and highly significant correlation r s 0 84 p s close to zero between baseflow index q bfi and the fraction of bedrock with high permeability l h lit such relationship was close to linear as the pearson correlation was also high r p 0 87 and could therefore be expressed as follows 8 q bfi a l h lit where is the proportionality sign this relationship lent itself to an obvious interpretation as high bedrock permeability favors groundwater flow which produces baseflow an obvious attempt to improve eq 8 was therefore to consider also medium permeability bedrock into the equation as this also may contribute to baseflow although to a lesser extent hence we considered the following equation 9 q bfi a l h lit b l m lit optimizing the coefficients to minimize least squares resulted in some improvement r s 0 89 r p 0 90 and an optimized parameter b 0 30 fig 8b 4 1 3 influence factors on the time to peak signature the pairwise correlation analysis in table a1 showed that q ttp did not correlate strongly with any of the selected indices we therefore explored multiplicative relationships between landscape attributes using stepwise regression as anticipated in section 3 2 3 the q ttp measured at metz was an apparent outlier since it had a value of 86 5 h and was 4 7 standard deviations away from the mean of the other subcatchments therefore we removed it from the subsequent analysis table 4 reports the best three empirical relations for the time to peak signature q ttp obtained with one to four variables table 4 first column shows that when going from one to four variables the spearman correlation r s increased from 0 58 to 0 85 the p values were well below the significance threshold already for the single variable correlations and approached zero when multiple variables were considered besides the fit to the data an important consideration in order to identify a plausible relationship was its interpretability a relationship that appeared to fulfill such prerequisites was represented by the best performing equation r s 0 78 using three landscape indices 10 q ttp a l dstg top l dev lnd l sl 05 top suggesting that that the time to peak increased with increasing distance with decreasing slope and fraction of developed land use the dependency on the first two variables was reflected in many time to peak models as reviewed in section 3 2 3 and the inverse dependency on developed land was intuitive as urbanization causes faster drainage it is also reassuring that the variables in eq 10 appeared recurrently also in the lower dimensional relationships shown in table 4 4 1 4 influence factors on the hydrographs relative lag signature based on the analysis described in section 3 2 4 we started by assuming that the lag between hydrographs at two points along the river network a and b q lag increases proportionally with the flow distance between a and b l ab 11 q lag q a q b l ab based on the assumption that celerity should increase slightly downstream as indicated by eq 3 equation was compared with the following expression 12 q lag q a q b l ab a ab α where a ab is the average of the subcatchment areas at a and b and the exponent α was fixed at 0 1 as suggested by previous studies section 3 2 4 this relationship accounted for the fact that the celerity increases and therefore the lag reduces for larger catchments which have on average larger flow these two relationships are compared in fig 9 the markers are color coded according to the ratio between area of the downstream and upstream subcatchments with darker color indicating higher ratio darker dots should represent pairs where lateral inflow in between stations is smaller and therefore be more representative the spearman correlation coefficient r s for eqs 11 and 12 were 0 49 and 0 54 whereas the corresponding p values were 18 and 14 the pearson linear correlations r p were higher at 0 74 and 0 79 respectively showing that the variability of q lag was to a certain extent captured by the two models and eq 12 was an improvement compared to eq 11 although considerable uncertainty remained these results indicated that eq 12 provides a first order approximation of q lag which spares from the use of much more complex flow routing models when a coarse level characterization of catchment behaviour is needed such as in the development of parsimonious and computationally efficient conceptual models 4 2 a perceptual model of the moselle catchment fig 10 presents our perceptual model of the moselle catchment which synthesizes our understanding of the spatial variability of streamflow in the moselle subcatchments and its underlying process controls according to the perceptual model objectives represented in fig 3 the main traits of streamflow regional variability were distilled into four streamflow signatures namely the streamflow average q the baseflow index q bfi the time to peak q ttp and the relative lag between hydrographs at successive stations q lag these streamflow signatures appeared to respond to distinct process controls differences in the amount of streamflow observed at different subcatchments were related to the spatial variability of precipitation section 4 1 1 hence our perceptual model considered spatially distributed precipitation at the subcatchment resolution variability in baseflow vs quickflow partitioning was mainly attributed to the influence of lithology section 4 1 2 our process interpretation was that lithology affects bedrock permeability in particular with increasing permeability deep percolation and groundwater flow are progressively more dominant as a result our perceptual model partitioned the landscape in distinct bedrock permeability classes low medium and high associated to runoff generating processes that determine distinct hydrograph reactions fast both fast and slow and slow respectively the time to peak could be related to topography and land use section 4 1 3 in particular time to peak was found to increase with basin size and to decrease with basin slope and with a larger area of developed e g urban land the relation with basin size and slope was consistent with most time to peak models section 3 2 3 we motivated the relationship to developed land by considering that urbanization often results into improved drainage which causes a faster catchment response in our perceptual model the process controls on the time to peak were schematically represented through subcatchment specific lags marked in blue in fig 10 the hydrograph lag due to channel routing could be approximated using a simple relationship as increasing with the length of a river stretch and decreasing with the average flow section 4 1 4 this relationship which is based on a geomorphologic scaling law section 3 2 4 can be adopted as a first approximation instead of more complex although potentially more accurate routing models in our perceptual model these routing effects were schematically represented using channel reach specific lags marked in red in fig 10 regional groundwater flow did not appear to be a dominant process section 4 1 1 hence our perceptual model purposely omitted this process and approximated the subcatchments as watertight vegetation potential evaporation and soil did not appear to affect the variability of any of the selected streamflow signatures section 4 1 1 and appendix b our perceptual model therefore did not distinguish between vegetation and soil types we argue that this perceptual model was not a priori obvious in different places streamflow spatial variability was best characterized by different streamflow signatures which responded to distinct process controls gupta et al 2013 for example the thur catchment in switzerland showed strong differences in seasonality between subcatchment response dal molin et al 2020 whereas all subcatchments in the moselle had a similar seasonal behavior the neighboring meuse catchment showed significant groundwater exchanges between some subcatchments bouaziz et al 2018 whereas in our setup groundwater exchanges were considered negligible moreover as reviewed in section 3 2 even the same streamflow signature can respond to distinct process controls in different places for example here we attributed baseflow variability to the permeability of lithology whereas tague and grant 2004 showed that baseflow index was controlled by landscape maturity rather than bedrock type in the oregon cascades and responded to distinct controls in other areas in united states which motivated alternative perceptual models in these distinct areas gnann et al 2021 however our moselle perceptual model was a posteriori reasonable the identified process controls that affected each individual streamflow signature were within the range of plausible controls based on prior knowledge as reviewed in section 3 2 they therefore appeared justifiable from a process based perspective our perceptual model did not distinguish between soil and vegetation types which can sound surprising given that for example vegetation and soil are some key ingredients of many distributed models such as swat arnold et al 1998 larsim demuth and rademacher 2016 and prevah viviroli et al 2009 our analysis suggested that the considered streamflow data do not contain sufficient information to disentangle the distinct behavior of different soil or vegetation types however this conclusion may also have resulted from some limitations in our analysis such as the loss of information that is unavoidable when compressing time series into streamflow signatures or maps into landscape indices 5 discussion perceptual models can be the basis of several applications and can eventually advance our current thinking of hydrological processes in different places wagener et al 2020 their development however has seldom been transparent and lacks clear guidance particularly at the regional scale this study illustrated a path to the development of a distributed perceptual model at the regional catchment scale based on an interpretation of the subcatchment responses in a nested catchment this approach complements the traditional perceptual model development based on fieldwork observations which is difficult to pursue beyond the headwater scale due to the disparity between measurements and processes scale beven 2001a our approach can be classified as top down in the sense that it seeks a process description by fingering down into the smaller scale processes from above sivapalan et al 2003 the main advantages of this approach are that it produces a process description directly at the scale of interest and that perceptual model decisions are supported by the available data sivapalan et al 2003 a specific challenge of this approach is represented by the limits of splitting beven 1996 hence by extent to which it is possible to disaggregate catchment response into individual process controls we showed that leveraging a nested catchment setup it is possible to disentangle the individual controls on specific subcatchment response signatures and inform a distributed perceptual model although our perceptual model is specific to the moselle the proposed perceptual model development approach is general and its feasibility encourages its adoption to build regional scale perceptual models elsewhere the nested catchment setup stands between the individual catchment and the large catchment sample study favoring an intermediate balance between depth and breadth gupta et al 2014 hence between process understanding and amenability to generalization while recognizing the need to go beyond the idiosyncrasies of individual catchments mcdonnell et al 2007 the nested catchment setup acknowledges the importance of region specific knowledge which is often the key to interpret the unexplained variability of large sample studies gnann et al 2021 a key advantage of the nested catchment setup is that it enables control on the water exchanges between subcatchments this control allows studying aspects such as routing processes or groundwater exchanges which are more difficult to examine when considering catchments in isolation for example as noted by beven 2001b the continuity equation is the most fundamental law in hydrology but as a hypothesis it would appear that we cannot currently verify it at the catchment scale as there is still no way of checking whether the catchment is indeed watertight while this statement holds true when studying catchments in isolation the nested catchment setup facilitates such checks as groundwater exports at some subcatchments would need to be compensated by groundwater import at some neighbouring subcatchments bouaziz et al 2018 our proposed approach to perceptual model development critically relied on the role of the hydrological expert this role was increasingly challenged in modern model development approaches such as in distributed modeling where field data collection is motivated mostly by model parameterization burt and mcdonnell 2015 and machine learning techniques which challenge the assumption that the world needs our theories and expertise nearing et al 2021 in our approach expert knowledge was essential in the key stages of the perceptual modeling process and in particular in i interpreting catchment response time series and help defining meaningful signatures of catchment response without expert judgment one can easily miss important traits of catchment response for example the time to peak signatures which were considered important in this study were not considered in even comprehensive collection of streamflow signatures e g yadav et al 2007 addor et al 2017 ii grouping spatially resolved data into classes that are potentially useful for hydrology readily available catchment indicators may not contain the ones that are more hydrologically meaningful oudin et al 2010 in our case for example the key to explain the variability of baseflow index relied on an expert driven reclassification of 31 lithology classes into three permeability classes an analogous endeavor to reclassify data into hydrologically relevant information is represented by the hydrology of soil types host classification developed for uk boorman et al 1995 where soils are classified based on their influence on hydrological processes iii distinguishing cause effect relationships from mere correlations several landscape and climate properties may co vary which makes unpicking the right controls on signatures spatial variability non trivial resorting to generic statistical or machine learning approaches can exacerbate this problem as these methods are structurally complex and difficult to interpret instead resorting to hydrological knowledge can guide towards meaningful process interpretations both by offering prior knowledge of plausible cause and effect relationships and by helping to refine such relationships through process based methods in our study the interpretation of distinct signatures relied on individual methods which resorted to hydrological common knowledge for example as shown in table a1 average streamflow correlated well not only with average precipitation r s 0 92 but also with average elevation or the proportion of forest r s 0 80 the continuity equation helped to select precipitation as the right cause of streamflow average variability however without a hydrological framework unpicking the right control may have not been as obvious particularly in a possible scenario where precipitation had resulted in a lower correlation than other variables because of poor data quality iv synthesizing results in the form of a perceptual model this is a process of iteration abstraction and synthesis which seeks a plausible description of the overall system behavior that explains a set of individual pieces of evidence such synthesis process is the essence of the formulation of the perceptual model which pieces together all the individual data interpretation analyses into a coherent interpretation of catchment behavior in this process the role of the hydrological expert is the key to strengthen the plausibility of a process based explanation it is important to recognize that a perceptual model is subject to its own uncertainties in particular there are sources of uncertainty affecting the calculation of climate indices landscape indices and streamflow signatures westerberg and mcmillan 2015 for example we noted that occasionally the lithology maps presented clear discontinuities both at the border between countries or at the separation between adjacent maps in the same country we also noted that occasionally it was not possible to assess whether streamflow time series were measured in summer or winter time which could have induced a bias when calculating lag time signatures errors in the rating curve could add a bias to the assessment of streamflow averages the streamflow filtering approach and its parameterization can affect the calculation of baseflow index however these decisions are not expected to affect significantly the relative catchment ranking which was the primary objective of such baseflow index analyses there are also uncertainties in the interpretation of the variability of streamflow signatures such interpretations often require expert decisions which are not always obvious because of such sources of uncertainty the perceptual model should be regarded as a hypothesis of catchment behavior therefore amenable to criticism and revision the hydrological expertise outlined above can be contributed by hydrologists with various backgrounds for example both the experimentalist and the modeler can contribute to the key stages of the perceptual modeling process outlined above showing that the dialogue between experimentalist and modeler seibert and mcdonnell 2002 can take place also beyond the headwater scale the difference is that while at the headwater scale such dialog can follow a bottom up approach from the small scale measurements to the headwater scale processes at the regional scale because of measurements limitations it needs to follow an opposite top down approach from the streamflow responses back to the processes that have generated them as perceptual models are often the basis for conceptual models the approach outlined here can provide a platform for a stronger engagement of the experimentalist in the distributed model development process in other words engagement on model structural development rather than only data collection for model parameterization burt and mcdonnell 2015 in fmm2022 we illustrate how the proposed perceptual model can provide useful indications on what to account for and what to ignore in the development of a conceptual distributed model 6 conclusions this paper has presented a top down approach for building a perceptual model of streamflow variability at the regional scale based on the interpretation of subcatchments responses we used the moselle catchment with 26 gauged subcatchments and based our perceptual model on the interpretation of streamflow regional variability our approach critically relied on expert knowledge which can be contributed both by the experimentalist and the modeler and goes beyond previous dialog between experimentalist and modeler that until now has focused largely at hillslope and headwater catchment scales this expert knowledge was especially helpful for reading streamflow time series and synthesize them in a set of streamflow signatures for distinguishing cause effect relationships from mere data correlations and for ultimately synthesizing results in the form of a perceptual model the resulting perceptual model was a posteriori reasonable as it could be justified by process understanding but not a priori obvious given the many possible causes that can potentially affect the streamflow regional variability within a nested catchment in summary our moselle perceptual model established that streamflow regional variability could be captured by 4 streamflow signatures the streamflow average the baseflow index the time to peak and the relative lag between hydrographs these streamflow signatures were affected by distinct climatic or landscape characteristics and responded to different process which could be considered dominant in the current context the spatial variability of precipitation affected significantly the differences in the amount of streamflow observed at different subcatchments which was attributed to processes associated to the long term water balance lithology and in particular its relative permeability had a strong influence on the baseflow vs quickflow partitioning topography and land use appeared to affect primarily the time to peak and the hydrograph relative lag due to processes related to flow routing and drainage river routing was responsible for the lag between hydrograph at successive downstream stations the identification of all of these controls on the spatial variability of streamflow signatures downplayed other potential controls in particular regional groundwater flow extending beyond the subcatchment boundaries did not appear to be significant moreover vegetation and soil did not appear to play a major role in explaining streamflow signatures spatial variability although the perceptual model is specific to the particular moselle context we think that the general approach for developing this perceptual model is applicable to other nested catchments in particular the proposed guidelines on how to exploit expert knowledge or even frame an experimentalist modeler dialog at the regional scale and their employment to use the given data to interpret dominant catchment processes may serve as a basis to build perceptual models elsewhere and with different conditions of data availability finally perceptual models are generally versatile in that they can underlie many applications therefore their development deserves dedicated attention in fmm2022 we illustrate how the proposed perceptual model can be used to inform the development of a distributed yet parsimonious hydrological model this application however does not preclude the use of the perceptual model shown here for other purposes nor its revision or refinement in future studies credit authorship contribution statement fabrizio fenicia conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft jeffrey j

925 time to peak q ttp h in order to characterize the time to peak we considered the time occurring from the beginning of the rising limb to the peak discharge using hourly resolution streamflow data in order to get a representative value for the entire time series the following procedure was used we extracted the rising limbs of the hydrographs we eliminated all rising limbs where the total rise is lower than a specified threshold ϑ q which was set at the difference between the 95 and 5 quantiles of the streamflow we calculated the time length of the remaining rising limbs t 1 n r where n r represents the number of rising limbs we used the 50 quantile of t 1 n r 16 q ttp q 50 t 1 n r relative lag q lag h in order to estimate the lag between hydrographs at successive stations indicated with q a and q b we proceeded as follows we determined pair of stations by considering for each station the corresponding successive downstream station in the river network we excluded pairs for which the ratio between the area of the upstream subcatchment and the area of the downstream subcatchment is lower than a threshold ϑ a which was set to 0 3 this threshold avoids excessively large contributing area in between stations we calculated the pearson cross correlation r n l n l between the downstream hydrograph q b and the lagged upstream hydrograph q a allowing for lags n l of up to

was negatively correlated with l elavg top r s 0 82 climatic indices and streamflow signatures were not internally correlated but several landscape features co varied relatively high correlation was

between l for lnd and l hil top r s 0 84 
3741,regional scale distributed conceptual models are typically developed with a bottom up approach which is process inclusive but prone to over parameterization here we demonstrate a proof of concept top down approach for distributed conceptual model development intended to emphasize dominant streamflow generating processes and to fulfill the principle of model parsimony a key challenge in applying the top down approach to distributed model development is devising a model comparison experiment that is both informative and limited to a few model alternatives here we show how such model comparisons can be informed by a perceptual model of key processes that control streamflow response variability at the regional scale we demonstrate our approach for the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment using the perceptual model developed in part 1 of this two part paper we develop 5 distributed model structures for simulating daily streamflow at 26 subcatchments and validate them on subcatchments that are not used during the calibration process our model comparisons illustrate how the spatial distribution of precipitation lithology and topography affect the simulation of key signatures of streamflow response variability in the moselle catchment providing a basis to justify model decisions our analyses show how a minimally parameterized distributed model with 12 calibration parameters matches signatures of streamflow average r 0 96 baseflow index r 0 86 and hydrograph lag time correct at 22 out of 26 subcatchments our proposed top down approach contributes to improving distributed model development strategies and can be used to develop parsimonious process based regional models elsewhere keywords regional scale top down distributed model superflex hypothesis testing 1 introduction distributed hydrological models have been used by hydrologists since the first flood predictions on the durnace river in france by imbeaux 1892 although developed mostly for small catchments e g loague 2010 they are increasingly used at the regional or global scale e g paniconi and putti 2015 adams and pagano 2016 fatichi et al 2016 while field work and process knowledge can help with the selection of an existing model or even structural development of a new distributed model at the small catchment scale such selection or development options are few at regional scales and beyond e g loritz et al 2018 ehret et al 2020 in these large catchments even simple questions and decisions are not straightforward should a model have a coarser spatial resolution to limit its complexity or a finer one to enable a more detailed process representation should a model consider the variability in the properties of soil and lithology and if so how can these data be collected and incorporated parsimoniously into the model structure is topographical data sufficient to drive the model since it captures much of the co evolved relations between geology soils and upslope area and local slope angle should the unsaturated zone processes be described by the richards equation or by a simple bucket model approach should regional groundwater flow that extends beyond sub catchment boundaries be considered or it is irrelevant should a model require calibration and if so how can over parameterization be avoided these are but a few of the questions that confront the distributed catchment modeler today and the answers to these questions are rather ad hoc this exposes the regional scale distributed model to the many criticisms that have been levied against them the danger of over parameterization when available data are not sufficient to constrain model parameters e g beven 1989 gupta et al 1998 incorrect upscaling premises when the process based equations are derived at a scale different from that to which they are applied e g grayson et al 1992 kirchner 2006 unfulfilled spatial extrapolation assumptions when the dominant processes observed at one catchment are assumed to be dominant elsewhere e g mcdonnell et al 2007 savenije 2009 so despite 130 years of work since imbeaux s first distributed catchment model on the durnace we are still wondering how to inform the many decisions that developing a distributed model requires distributed models are typically developed through a bottom up approach which is rather inclusive in terms of processes that may be important in principle but may lead to the incorporation of model elements that contribute little to the overall catchment response fatichi et al 2016 in this study we explore distributed model development through a top down approach hence focusing on a disaggregation of the system responses into their constitutive components sivapalan et al 2003 it can be expected that the top down approach will generally not lead to hyper resolution models wood et al 2011 but rather to so called semi distributed models which occupy an intermediate position in the continuum from lumped to fully distributed models e g boyle et al 2001 semi distributed models seek an appropriate balance between process distribution and aggregation in the attempt to maintain a connection with observable landscape properties while still satisfying the principle of parsimony these models are widely used in research and operation particularly at the regional scale as their ability to represent spatial patterns makes them amenable to process based interpretations and their relatively limited computational requirements enable their use in operational setups in terms of scientific applications such models have proven useful to i characterize the behavior of landscape sections with different macro scale properties and behavior depending for example on topography or geology e g savenije 2010 ehret et al 2020 ii facilitate the application of regularization relationships or parameters and processes constraints based on expert knowledge which reduce over parameterization and increase the realism of spatially distributed simulations e g pokhrel et al 2008 gharari et al 2014 kelleher et al 2017 iii enable multi site validation through the use of internal streamflow measurements e g dal molin et al 2020 or groundwater time series e g raneesh and thampi 2013 and iv enable the comparison with remotely sensed data such as the spatial and temporal patterns of evaporation and total water storage anomalies which can be used as additional criteria to verify process consistency e g mulder et al 2015 hulsman et al 2021 such applications illustrate that semi distributed models are a versatile tool to explore regional scale catchment behavior moreover semi distributed models are a common choice in operational setups adams and pagano 2016 for example the model larsim is used operationally in germany demuth and rademacher 2016 prevah in switzerland viviroli et al 2009 and lisflood in europe smith et al 2016 the top down approach typically relies on model comparisons and has been commonly applied using lumped models providing useful insights on suitable ranges of model complexity needed to model streamflow e g jakeman and hornberger 1993 jothityangkoon et al 2001 or helping to interpret dominant processes in small catchments e g mcmillan et al 2011 fenicia et al 2014 yokoo et al 2017 correspondingly it can be expected that its systematic application to distributed models may provide information about warranted complexity and provide insights on which dominant processes characterize streamflow variability at the regional scale but if lumped models comparisons can easily involve hundreds of variants e g prieto et al spieler et al 2020 distributed models are generally more time consuming to devise and execute and as a result their comparison is often practically limited to a handful of alternatives e g gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 fenicia et al 2016 nijzink et al 2016 kelleher et al 2017 antonetti and zappa 2018 dal molin et al 2020 in face of the larger space of decisions that distributed models entail e g fenicia et al 2016 such model comparisons need to be strategically constructed in order to be informative in this study we address the problem of building a model comparison experiment that informs key decisions in the development of a semi distributed model for streamflow simulation in order to develop a minimal yet informative model comparison experiment we rely on a perceptual model of regional scale processes in a companion paper fenicia and mcdonnell 2022 hereinafter referred to as fm2022 we outlined the approach for building such a perceptual model leveraging data typically available at the regional scale here we illustrate the process of translating that perceptual model into conceptual model decisions and the use of controlled model comparisons to assist the ultimate model selection stringent model evaluation is essential in assessing the relative merits of the models that take part in such comparison experiments e g fenicia and kavetski 2021 in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance here we evaluate all models assessing the goodness of fit of both time series and signatures hence both in the time and in the signature domain e g hrachowitz et al 2014 kelleher et al 2017 kavetski et al 2018 moreover we assess the models ability to make predictions not only in time but also in space hence using subcatchments that are not used for calibration such space time validation is a particularly stringent and revealing model evaluation instrument refsgaard and knudsen 1996 the model development chain proposed here and in fm2022 enables the incorporation of expert knowledge into the model development process which can be contributed both by the experimentalist and by the modeler the dialog between experimentalist and modeler is considered an important instrument to increase model realism seibert and mcdonnell 2002 however such dialog has mainly taken place at the hillslope or headwater catchment scale the development of distributed models particularly at the regional scale has been largely devoid of any dialog between experimentalist and modeler mostly relegating the role of fieldwork to data collection for model parameterization burt and mcdonnell 2015 more generally hydrological models have often been the result of very specific often individual expertise however a participatory rather than expert specific model development process can as we will show facilitate model understanding criticism and revision we call this a bespoke model one that is tailor made for the regional watershed in fm2022 we developed a perceptual model of the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment which explains the spatial variability of streamflow signatures observed at 26 gauged subcatchments briefly this perceptual model established that precipitation much more than evaporation or groundwater exchange controls the spatial variability of average streamflow bedrock permeability influences the partitioning between baseflow and quickflow and topography and land use control hydrograph lag times it also provided an assessment of which other landscape properties did not appear to have significant effect on streamflow variability in this paper we illustrate how this perceptual model can be used for informing a distributed model comparison experiment aimed at determining and justifying a bespoke semi distributed model for the catchment of interest in order to alleviate the model building burden the distributed models are developed within the flexible framework superflex fenicia et al 2011 dal molin et al 2021 here we pursue the following objectives 1 to illustrate the process of translating the moselle perceptual model into a distributed conceptual model and in particular how the perceptual model informs the multiple decisions that distributed models require 2 to use model comparisons in space time validation to test the major hypotheses about the process controls on the selected streamflow signatures posed by the perceptual model and in particular a the effect of precipitation on average streamflow b the effect of lithology on the baseflow index c the effect of topography and land use on lag times 3 to discuss the added value of the distributed conceptual model compared to the underlying perceptual model of regional variability the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methods and in particular the transition from the perceptual model development to the conceptual model the model variants for hypothesis testing and the model calibration and evaluation strategies section 3 describes the model results both in the time and in the key signature domain section 4 discusses the specific results of the model comparisons and the general contribution of the proposed modeling approach section 5 summarizes the key conclusions 2 methods 2 1 from perceptual model of regional variability to distributed conceptual model the main application of the distributed model developed in this study is to simulate streamflow at a number of points along the river network of a given catchment hence at selected internal subcatchments this application can be considered the most typical for a distributed regional catchment model granted that such models can simulate variables other than streamflow e g samaniego et al 2010 hirpa et al 2018 athira and sudheer 2021 in order to build a process based distributed model with limited complexity for the selected application we adhere to some common choices in particular we use semi distributed models hence designed to reproduce flow at a limited number of points along the river network boyle et al 2001 and adopt the concept of on hydrological response units hrus leavesley et al 1983 for distributing landscape properties even restricting our scope to semi distributed hru based models model development requires several additional decisions which can be summarized as follows 1 defining the hrus hence the spatial discretization approach 2 specifying the model structures associated to each hru 3 establishing the connection between such model structures 4 defining parameter constraints to improve model parsimony 5 establishing model evaluation and diagnostic metrics in this study this set of decisions is informed by a perceptual model fig 1 indicates the correspondence between the information that a perceptual model might provide and key decisions that distributed model building requires fm2022 illustrated how a perceptual model of streamflow regional variability can be developed in order to provide information on these specific points the process of translating a perceptual model into a conceptual model is not obvious or univocally defined attempting a direct mapping between perceptual and conceptual model would still involve many ad hoc decisions with the risk that the resulting conceptual model may be too simple or too complex based on the available data therefore rather than directly translating the perceptual model into a conceptual model here we take the approach of exploiting the perceptual model to inform a set of model variants which are aimed to test a selection of the key hypotheses that the perceptual model embodies the intention of this comparison is to gain insights into the effect of model decisions and correspondingly into the dominant processes that characterize regional scale catchment behavior in the study area 2 2 translation of the moselle perceptual model into 5 distributed model variants fm2022 developed a perceptual model for the moselle catchment which interprets the spatial variability in the streamflow response of its 26 subcatchments in synthesis this model established that 1 streamflow spatial variability can be expressed by a set of key signatures characterizing streamflow average baseflow index and hydrograph lag times 2 the spatial variability of these signatures is controlled by distinct climate or landscape properties which need to be explicitly represented in a distributed model in particular precipitation controls the spatial variability of streamflow average lithology influences subsurface processes and eventually the baseflow vs quickflow partitioning and topography and land use control hydrograph lag times and 3 conversely the spatial variability of these signatures does not appear to be affected by other properties which do not need to be spatially resolved in a model representation in particular vegetation and soil do not appear to play a major role in explaining streamflow signatures spatial variability moreover the subcatchments appear to be water tight in the sense that regional groundwater flow extending beyond the subcatchment boundaries does not appear to be significant these insights are here used to build a model comparison experiment that isolates the effect of these key hypotheses the model comparison experiment is in line with a top down approach starting from a relatively simple benchmark model and introducing model modifications aimed at a more spatially explicit characterization of the catchment the set of models includes 5 model variants which are listed in table 1 these models are labeled using the notation m hru i lag j where m stands for model hru i i 1 2 3 to a particular classification in hydrological response units and lag j j 0 1 2 to a specific representation of the flow routing in synthesis the benchmark model is represented by m hru1 lag0 which uses a single hru and no flow routing elements this model has uniform parameters in space therefore it is unable to characterize landscape heterogeneity but has distributed states and therefore it is able to characterize climate variability and can produce distributed simulations this model is progressively evolved leading to m hru1 lag1 which introduces a simple routing approach then to m hru2 lag1 which adds a landscape discretization into 2 hrus then to m hru2 lag2 which introduces a more complex routing approach and finally to the target model m hru3 lag2 which considers 3 hrus in the following we start by describing the most spatially resolved model m hru3 lag2 section 2 2 1 and then introduce the simpler 4 model variants section 2 2 2 for ease of presentation the model description focuses mainly on the concepts relegating to the appendix the mathematical formulations the study area and data have already been described in fm2022 and therefore only the relevant details for the present application are mentioned all models use as forcing data the time series of precipitation potential evaporation and temperature and the streamflow is measured at 26 interior catchment points both the forcing data and the streamflow are considered at daily resolution maps of relevant catchment features as well their classification are the same as in fm2022 the calibration validation approach is described in section 2 3 2 2 2 1 target model 2 2 1 1 model structure this section describes the target model m hru3 lag2 and its relationship to the perceptual model developed in fm2022 which was briefly summarized in section 2 2 above the model schematic is shown in fig 2 and model equations are detailed in the appendix the minimum number of landscape elements that our distributed model requires is determined by the location of the points along the river network where streamflow simulations are needed in the present case this partitioning is based on the location of the 26 gauging stations where streamflow is observed fig 2 for clarity we define total subcatchment the total area drained by given point on the river network and incremental subcatchment the incremental area from an upstream point on the river network hence we divide the catchment into 26 incremental subcatchments the forcing data hence precipitation potential evaporation and temperature are distributed per incremental subcatchment fig 2 this decision is motivated by the perceptual model which indicated that such discretization is sufficient to describe the long term water balance the landscape is further discretized into hrus based on lithology in particular 3 hrus are considered representing the low hrul medium hrum and high hruh bedrock permeability classes the basis for this decision is that the perceptual model indicated that this landscape discretization is necessary to account for the variability of the baseflow index signature next we assign different structures for each hru intended to reflect the associated dominant processes we assume that lumped conceptual model structures considered adequate for precipitation streamflow modeling would be rather inclusive for representing a given hru we therefore start with such a structure and simplify it in order to account only for the processes that are perceived to be dominant in each hru as an inclusive model structure we consider a 3 elements structure composed by three reservoirs ur unsaturated zone reservoir intended to control the partitioning between precipitation and runoff fr fast reacting reservoir which represent the quickflow generating processes and sr slow reacting reservoir intended to represent the baseflow generating processes an analog three elements structure was indicated by jakeman and hornberger 1993 as the most commonly identified configuration for streamflow simulation see also young 2003 we then particularize this structure in order to describe hru specific dominant processes in particular the perceptual model suggests that as bedrock permeability goes from low to high the subsurface processes progressively shift from shallow to deep therefore triggering different hydrograph responses we here assume that low bedrock permeability predominantly triggers a fast hydrograph response and we therefore only consider the fr reservoir and we omit the sr reservoir medium bedrock permeability triggers both a fast and a slow response and we therefore keep both the fr and sr reservoirs high bedrock permeability predominantly triggers a slow hydrograph response and we therefore keep the sr reservoir and omit the fr reservoir although snow related processes do not have a major influence on streamflow generation they are nonetheless occasionally present see fm2022 and therefore we account for them for this reason each hru model also includes a snow reservoir wr based on the degree day method which accounts for snow accumulation and melting this specific choice is also maintained for the other model variants streamflow generated within each incremental subcatchment is obtained by first adding together the outflows from the individual hru models and then by propagating the resulting flow through a lag function intended to represent the incremental subcatchment routing cl lag functions marked in blue color in fig 2 streamflow at each total subcatchment needs to account also for the streamflow from upstream subcatchments incoming streamflow from each upstream subcatchment is first offset through a lag function intended to represent the river routing rl through the incremental subcatchment lag functions marked in red color in fig 2 and then added to the incremental subcatchment streamflow regional groundwater flow between subcatchments as suggested by the perceptual model is not considered and the hrus act in parallel the total number of landscape elements that need to be separately modeled is obtained by summing the number of hrus present in each incremental subcatchment as hrus in different subcatchments need to be modeled separately given that they receive different forcings there are 26 subcatchments and 3 hrus however not all subcatchments contain all hrus resulting in a total of 75 landscape elements table 1 2 2 1 2 parameters constraints the perceptual model can be further exploited to constrain the parameter space by providing parameters regularization relationships e g pokhrel et al 2008 these constraints are described hereafter and are also indicated in fig 2 hru model structure parameters we assume that some parameters associated to distinct hru model structures are related to each other in particular the perceptual model suggests a similar behavior between hrus in terms of partitioning precipitation between evaporation and runoff which suggests that the parameters of the ur element can be kept common between hru models fig 2 also the parameters of the snow reservoir wr are considered as spatially uniform subcatchment routing parameters we assume that the parameters associated to the incremental subcatchment routing cl are a function of selected landscape properties and two global calibration parameters based on the analysis on time to peak variability in the perceptual model we assume that the time parameter shaping the lag function in each incremental subcatchment increases with geometric distance and decreases with the fraction of developed land use and the 5 quantile of the slope see appendix river routing parameters we assume that the parameters associated to the river routing from upstream total subcatchments rl are a function of landscape properties and a global calibration parameter based on the analysis on the relative lag in the perceptual model we assume that the time parameter shaping the lag function associated to river routing increases with the drainage distance and decreases with the upstream contributing area see appendix such parameter relationships strongly reduce the number of calibration parameters of the distributed model specifically the model m hru3 lag2 has 12 calibration parameters table 1 and appendix which are hereafter summarized following the notation of indicating in the superscript the model element to which the parameter is associated the degree day snow parameter k wr which is common to all spatial elements 3 parameters characterizing the ur element c e ur s max ur β ur which are also common to all spatial elements 1 parameter specific for the high permeability hruh k sr hru h characterizing the release rate of the sr element 3 parameters for the medium permeability hrum d hru m k fr hru m k sr hru m representing the split between fr and sr and the release rate of the 2 reservoirs 1 parameter for the low permeability hrul k fr hru l characterizing the release rate of fr 2 parameters a 1 cl a 2 cl that scale the cl lag functions and 1 parameter a rl that scales the rl lag functions see appendix 2 2 2 model variants for hypothesis testing the target model described above embeds several hypotheses about system characteristics that need to be represented in order to capture distributed streamflow responses although these hypotheses are motivated by the perceptual model the translation from perceptual to conceptual model is not obvious in order to provide a stronger basis to justify these hypotheses and ensure that they are supported by the data 4 additional model structures are introduced these model structures follow a path from simple to complex in the spirit of a top down approach starting from a benchmark model intended to represent a null hypothesis about process controls on streamflow responses and which is progressively evolved in order to lead to the target model described above the 4 model structures are described below and summarized in table 1 m hru1 lag0 uses of a single hru and no lag functions specifically this model has subcatchment parameters that are uniform in space hence it is unable to account for the heterogeneity in landscape attributes this model is still distributed as it has distributed states per incremental subcatchment hence it is able to account for the spatial heterogeneity of climate the lag functions characterizing the routing within the incremental subcatchments and from upstream subcatchments are also omitted hence this model is unable to account for the associated lagging and dampening effects as hru structure the full 3 reservoirs structures is used previously used for hrum in m hru3 lag2 this model has 7 calibration parameters associated to the individual hru model structure the degree day snow parameter k wr 3 parameters associated to ur c e ur s max ur β ur the split parameter d the parameters associated to fr k fr and sr k sr this model has 26 landscape elements which are determined solely by the number of subcatchments table 1 m hru1 lag1 introduces flow routing elements compared to the target model m hru3 lag2 the routing is represented by the same lag functions but the regularization relationships of these lag functions use less parameters and less landscape attributes in particular both the subcatchment routing elements cl and the river routing elements rl are scaled only according to drainage distance each of them using a single calibration parameter see appendix the use of drainage distance alone can be considered one of the simplest approaches to parameterize routing effects as used for example by lerat et al 2012 this model has 9 calibration parameters which are the same as for m hru1 lag0 with the addition of a parameter for cl a cl and a parameter for rl a rl and 26 landscape elements table 1 m hru2 lag1 introduces a partitioning of the landscape into 2 hrus compared to m hru3 lag2 this model maintains the high permeability hruh and combines the other hrus into a medium low bedrock permeability hruml both hrus use the same 3 reservoirs structure used in m hru1 lag0 and m hru1 lag1 hence this model does not tailor the model structures to the specific hrus like m hru3 lag2 similarly to m hru3 lag2 the parameters of the ur reservoir are kept uniform in space whereas the split parameter and the parameters associated to fr and sr are distributed this model has 12 parameters which are the degree day snow parameter k wr 3 parameters associated to ur c e ur s max ur β ur which are common to both hrus 3 parameters for the high permeability hruh d hru h k fr hru h k sr hru h characterizing the split the fr and the sr reservoir respectively the corresponding 3 parameters specific for the medium low permeability hruml d hru ml k fr hru ml k sr hru ml a parameter for cl a cl and a parameter for rl a rl as each of the 26 subcatchments contain both hrus this model uses 52 landscape elements table 1 m hru2 lag2 introduces a more complex parameterization of the routing elements in particular this model uses the same regularization relationships for the lag functions as m hru3 lag2 thus involving more landscape attributes and one additional parameter associated to the rl lag functions a 1 cl a 2 cl this model has 13 parameters one parameter more than m hru2 lag1 due to the additional parameters associated to the cl lag functions like m hru2 lag1 this model has 52 landscape elements table 1 the last step of this chain is represented by the target model m hru3 lag2 already described in section 2 2 1 which differs from m hru2 lag2 for the addition of an hru and for the tailoring of the hru model structures according to the perceived dominant process we note that m hru3 lag2 has 1 parameter less than m hru2 lag2 in spite of the higher spatial resolution due to the tailoring of the model structures to the hru dominant processes based on the premises of the perceptual model that informs the conceptual model decisions the 5 model structures are associated to specific hypotheses about their relative merits these hypotheses are as follows 1 m hru1 lag0 in spite of its simplicity should be able to capture the long term water balance 2 m hru1 lag1 should enable the characterization of streamflow lag times 3 m hru2 lag1 should enable the characterization of baseflow variability 4 m hru2 lag2 should further improve the characterization of streamflow lag times 5 m hru3 lag2 should further improve the characterization of baseflow variability hence the differences between the 5 model variants have an anticipated effect on an individual signature and not on others correspondingly the model comparison is expected to highlight influence factors on the selected streamflow signatures as well as their relative independence 2 3 model evaluation this section describes the model evaluation approach section 2 3 1 specifies the objective function used for model calibration section 2 3 2 describes the calibration and space time validation approach section 2 3 3 illustrates the assessment of model performance both in the time and in the signature domain although a specific uncertainty analysis is not carried out the model comparison provides a basis for a relative assessment of model uncertainties which we consider sufficient for our purpose in terms of parameters uncertainty we rely on the assumption typical of the top down approach that additional complexity is justified by the data if it corresponds to an improvement in model simulations sivapalan et al 2003 we also interpret significant differences between calibration and space time validation performance as an indication of overfitting in terms of uncertainties associated to model simulation we rely on the consideration that an improvement in the selected likelihood function section 2 3 2 corresponds to tighter uncertainty bands the model comparison severs multiple related purposes and in particular 1 to clarify the effect of model decisions which is obtained by comparing the performance of pairs of models that differ in a controlled way 2 to guide the ultimate model selection which is approached by assessing whether the progression of models leads to an improvement in the model evaluation metrics and 3 to evaluate the hypotheses of the perceptual model as the model variants correspond to specific hypotheses of how dominant processes affect streamflow regional variability 2 3 1 likelihood function for model calibration semi distributed models for streamflow simulation have been calibrated using different strategies e g wallner et al 2012 the simplest strategy is the single site approach which consists in calibrating the models using data at an individual gauge similarly to what is commonly done with lumped models e g gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 this approach has the limitation that an individual time series may not contain sufficient information for the parameter identification of a distributed model such as to disentangle the behavior of different hrus hence it may lead to poor parameter identifiability an alternative calibration strategy is the sequential approach which consists in calibrating the model from upstream to downstream in a sequential manner e g ajami et al 2004 feyen et al 2008 lerat et al 2012 de lavenne et al 2019 this approach while easy to apply has the disadvantage that it leads to many parameter sets one set for each subcatchment hence it makes the model on the one hand highly parameterized and on the other hand highly dependent on calibration and therefore difficult to regionalize finally the multi site approach consists in calibrating the model simultaneously at a number of stations e g zhang et al 2010 fenicia et al 2016 dal molin et al 2020 this approach overcomes the limitations of the previous approaches and is adopted in the present study in order to enable model calibration it is necessary to construct an objective function which quantifies the goodness of fit of model predictions this objective function is here derived from a bayesian inference approach where we assumed non informative flat priors for model parameters and we assumed that the residuals errors of transformed streamflow are statistically independent and can be approximated by a zero mean gaussian distribution 1 q i t obs λ q i t sim λ n 0 σ where i indicates the subcatchment and varies from 1 to the number of selected subcatchments n c t indicates the time index and varies from 1 to the number of data points n t i in the subcatchment i q sim and q obs are simulated and observed streamflow respectively n 0 σ is the gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation σ and the power λ is fixed at 0 5 implying a square root transformation as recommended by mcinerney et al 2017 maximising the posterior parameter distributions under the assumption of equation corresponds to maximising the nash sutcliffe efficiency of the square root of the streamflow 2 f ns 1 i 1 n c t 1 n t i q i t sim q i t obs 2 i 1 n c t 1 n t i q i t obs a v e q 1 n c 1 n t obs 2 where ave indicates the average which is extended to the streamflow of all subcatchments 2 3 2 calibration and space time validation strategy the model evaluation strategy is motivated by testing the quality of model simulations in space time validation meaning using a time period and a set of subcatchments that the model does not see during calibration e g fenicia et al 2016 dal molin et al 2020 using the words of klemeš 1986 this validation may be called a proxy basins split sample test for this purpose the available data is organized as follows the time period is partitioned into two 13 year periods period 1 going from 1 09 1989 to 31 08 2002 and period 2 going from 1 09 2002 to 31 08 2015 the subcatchments are partitioned into two groups of 13 subcatchments each group a and group b the partition is made by sorting subcatchments by total area and placing every second subcatchment in each group the organization of the data in two periods and two groups of subcatchments is presented in fig 3 which also shows the data availability for each subcatchment represented by the corresponding gauge name missing data are treated by considering in the objective function eq 2 only time indices where data is available fig 1 and table 1 in fm2022 shows the spatial location of the subcatchments and list their areal extension the model evaluation strategy proceeds as follows 1 we calibrate the models on one group of subcatchments over a given time period and validate it on the other group of subcatchments over the other time period hence we perform space time validation with reference to fig 3 once a quadrant is chosen for calibration moving horizontally on another quadrant means performing time validation moving vertically means performing space validation and moving diagonally means performing space time validation for example if a model is calibrated on period 1 group a then period 2 group a represents time validation period 1 group b represents space validation and period 2 group b represents space time validation 2 this process is repeated for all four combinations of calibration periods and subcatchment groups 3 the streamflow time series from the four space time validation scenarios are then concatenated thus forming a single set of predicted streamflow time series spanning the entire observation period at each subcatchment an analogous set of concatenated time series of calibrated streamflow is also constructed the results focus on comparing model performance in calibration the least challenging scenario and space time validation the most challenging scenario as the two scenarios use the same underlying data when moving from calibration to space time validation at least in terms of the calibration objective function model performance can only degrade the degree of this degradation may give an indication on whether any of the models is prone to overfitting the data 2 3 3 performance metrics of streamflow simulations model performance is analyzed both in the time domain and in the signature domain for model evaluation in the time domain we use the f ns metric already defined in equation 2 as it corresponds to the objective function used for model calibration for model evaluation in the signature domain the following three streamflow signatures evaluation metrics are used which are based on the analysis of streamflow spatial variability performed in fm2022 streamflow average correlation the streamflow average at a given subcatchment is defined by 3 q k 1 n t k t 1 n t k q k t where q is the streamflow k 1 n c is the subcatchment index with n c representing the number of subcatchments t is the time index n t k is the number of observations at the subcatchment k and the overbar indicates the average over the observation period to assess model ability to simulate this signature we consider the pearson correlation r between observed and simulated streamflow average at the 26 subcatchments 4 f qavg r q obs q sim we choose the correlation to quantify the alignment between the observed and predictive values rather than the agreement of the absolute values and we assess visually the agreement along the diagonal we opt for using pearson rather than spearman correlation as used in fm2022 as the agreement between observed and simulated quantities should ideally be linear baseflow index correlation the baseflow index is defined as 5 q bfi k t 1 n t k q k t b t 1 n t k q k t where q k t b is calculated with the filter proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 using the same settings as in fm2022 to assess model ability to simulate this signature we consider the correlation r between observed and simulated baseflow index at the 26 subcatchments 6 f qbfi r q bfi obs q bfi sim also here we chose the correlation to quantify the alignment between the observed and predictive values rather than the agreement of the absolute values hydrograph relative lag in order to estimate the lag between observed and simulated hydrographs we proceeded as follows we calculate the pearson cross correlations r k n l n l between the observed and simulated hydrographs at each subcatchment k shifting the observed hydrograph for lags n l of up to 20 d with respect to the simulated hydrograph we consider the lag i l k that results in the maximum pearson cross correlation 7 q lag k i l k such that max r k n l n l r k i l the relative lag q lag k should be zero if the lag is correctly simulated by the model a positive relative lag would mean that the simulated hydrograph overestimates the lag we then simply sum the absolute values of the hydrograph relative lag for all the subcatchments 8 f qlag k 1 n c q lag k which is an integer equal or larger than zero with lower values indicating better performance i e a value of zero indicates that the lag is correctly simulated at all subcatchments 3 results 3 1 model performance in the time domain fig 4 shows box plots representing the variability of f ns in the subcatchments under the calibration and space time validation scenarios the following results can be observed 1 in calibration the averages for the 26 subcatchments of the f ns for the models m hru1 lag0 m hru1 lag1 m hru2 lag1 m hru2 lag2 and m hru3 lag2 were 0 80 0 83 0 85 0 85 0 86 respectively hence there was a general increase in performance when increasing the number of hrus of the more complex models the corresponding standard deviations of the f ns values were 6 4 10 2 6 5 10 2 5 3 10 2 5 0 10 2 and 4 5 10 2 showing a decreasing tendency which indicated a more stable model performance across subcatchments for the more complex models 2 in space time validation the ranking was generally preserved however with lower average and larger spread for all models in particular the f ns average values were 0 76 0 76 0 79 0 80 0 81 and 0 82 while the corresponding standard deviations were 8 1 10 2 8 1 10 2 6 2 10 2 6 8 10 2 and 5 5 10 2 3 the increments in performance between the models in terms of f ns appeared minor for example the difference between the average f ns values of the two hru model m hru2 lag2 and the 3 hrus model m hru3 lag2 was just 0 01 4 the best performing model hence m hru3 lag2 in space time validation had f ns values comprised between 0 64 at luneville one of the smaller subcatchments and 0 91 at cochem the catchment outlet hence overall the analysis in terms of f ns indicated that the modeling progression led to an improvement of performance as hypothesized in section 2 2 2 however based on this analysis alone the differences in model performance did not appear very significant fig 5 shows the f ns values for each individual subcatchment and model variant in space time validation thereby complementing the earlier assessment based on aggregated results differences in f ns values between models were clearly catchment dependent as a general tendency subcatchments characterized by poorer performances when using the simpler model variants e g boncourt luneville reinheim and fremersdorf were the ones that experienced most of the improvement while subcatchments that already presented a relatively high performance were relatively stable hence the model improvements generally had an effect on fixing the outliers rather than producing a uniform improvement for all subcatchments this effect explains why on average the improvement in f ns values was rather minor in order to better assess model differences and understand the associated causes it is important to analyze the streamflow signatures which provide the basis of a diagnostic approach to model evaluation as shown in the subsequent section 3 2 model performance in the signature domain in terms of streamflow signatures we start by reporting the models ability to simulate q obs and q bfi obs we explicitly report the simulations of models m hru1 lag0 m hru2 lag1 and m hru3 lag2 in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 respectively hence the initial model of the chain and the subsequent models that showed the highest improvement in at least one of the signatures this comparison is summarized in the following results 1 all 5 models demonstrated a similar and very good ability to reproduce q obs with f qavg 0 95 both in calibration and in space time validation and a good agreement along the diagonal line this result implies that the differences in the structures of the 5 models did not have an effect on this signature and that m hru1 lag0 the simplest model based on a single hru already contained the ability to simulate this signature 2 the models differed significantly in their ability to reproduce q bfi obs in particular m hru1 lag0 and m hru1 lag1 were unable to simulate differences between subcatchments f qbfi 0 in both cases m hru2 lag1 and m hru2 lag2 provided a better match f qbfi 0 52 and 0 48 respectively in space time validation and m hru3 lag2 significantly improved the fit f qbfi 0 86 in space time validation and a good agreement along the diagonal 3 the performance of the models was lower in space time validation than in calibration however it decreased only slightly in particular the performance of the models in terms of q obs remained more or less unchanged whereas the models ability to reproduce q bfi obs experienced a minor deterioration fig 9 illustrates the ability of the 5 models to correctly simulate hydrographs lags in space time validation each column of a given panel shows the correlation between observed and simulated streamflow for different lags t lag of the simulated streamflow the red cross indicates the lag for which the correlation was maximized the cross should be at t lag 0 if the lag is correctly simulated if the red cross is at t lag 1 it means that the simulated streamflow dynamics are anticipated of one time step in this case one day compared to the observed ones it can be observed that m hru1 lag0 which has no lag functions failed to correctly simulate the lag at 19 out of 26 subcatchments where the lag was always anticipated of one day compared to the observations leading to f qlag 19 in space time validation m hru1 lag1 and m hru2 lag1 which use the simple parameterization of the lag function led to a sensible improvement failing to correctly simulate the lag at 6 of the subcatchments with a lag of 1 and leading to f qlag 6 m hru2 lag2 and m hru3 lag2 which adopt the more complex parameterization of the lag functions further improved the representation of the lags with f qlag 4 it can be noted that models that share the same parameterization of the lag function were consistent both in the number of failures which was exactly the same and in the subcatchments where this failure appear which was similar the calibration performance was consistent with the performance in space time validation with f qlag values of 16 6 6 1 and 2 respectively for the 5 models overall the signatures analysis shows that model modifications had a targeted effect on an individual signature without affecting significantly the others in particular the distribution of the forcings data had an effect on capturing the long term streamflow average the distribution of the landscape in hrus had an effect on simulating the baseflow index and the routing model and successive improvements predominantly affected the hydrograph lags by comparing the results in the signature domain from those in the time domain it is apparent that the streamflow signatures provided a complementary perspective on the relative merits of the three models in particular they helped identify similarities and differences in model simulations which were not immediately apparent with a metric of time series agreement such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 agreement of conceptual model results with perceptual model hypotheses the distributed perceptual model developed in fm2022 has been employed to set up a conceptual model comparison experiment with the purpose of clarifying the effect of model decisions guiding model selection and testing key hypotheses of how dominant processes affect streamflow regional variability five model variants were compared based on the expectation that they would behave differently in their ability to simulate a selection of streamflow signatures namely the streamflow average the baseflow index and the hydrograph lag our results indicated that 1 the benchmark model m hru1 lag0 that accounted for the spatial variability of the forcings but did not account for the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape captured the streamflow average signatures as good as more complex models r 0 95 in space time validation this result indicates that climate rather than landscape affected streamflow average 2 m hru1 lag1 introduced routing elements simply parameterized based on drainage distance this modification greatly improved the simulation of hydrograph lags leading from 19 to 6 subcatchments where the lag was wrongly simulated this result suggests that such drainage distance acts as a primary control on hydrograph lags 3 m hru2 lag1 introduced a partitioning of the landscape into 2 hrus based on relative bedrock permeability inferred from lithology such a partitioning enabled a characterization of the baseflow index signature from r 0 to r 0 52 in space time validation this improvement suggests that lithology acts as a primary control on baseflow 4 m hru2 lag2 introduced a more complex parameterization of the routing elements using additional topography and land use indicators which further improved the characterization of lag times lags reducing from 6 to 4 subcatchments where the lag was wrongly simulated this outcome indicates the role of additional topographic and land use controls on lag times 5 m hru3 lag2 further discretized the landscape into 3 hrus based on a finer resolution of relative bedrock permeability and tailored the model structure to the perceived dominant processes in each hru this model improved the characterization of the baseflow index from r 0 48 to r 0 86 in space time validation which confirms the control of lithology on baseflow in summary the model comparison experiment confirms the key hypotheses of the perceptual model indicating that 1 incorporating into the model structure information about spatial variability of precipitation bedrock permeability topography and land use was essential to capture the signatures of streamflow average baseflow index and hydrograph lag model structures that omitted this information had lower ability to reproduce these signatures 2 the selected streamflow signatures responded to individual processes controls as the model modifications that affected the processes associated to given signature affected minimally the other signatures notably the simulation of the streamflow average was essentially the same for all model variants it is interesting to note that the difference in simulation abilities of the 5 models was much more evident in the signatures domain than in the time domain in terms of average nash sutcliffe efficiency f ns the ranking of performance in the time domain was consistent with the one in the signature domain meaning that higher f ns corresponded to better match of the streamflow signatures however the average f ns of the 5 models varied within a very narrow range 0 80 to 0 86 in calibration and 0 76 to 0 82 in space time validation whereas the models ability to match signatures went from very poor near zero baseflow index correlations or lag wrong at the vast majority of the catchments to relatively good see above small differences in average f ns are explained when considering that differences in f ns values between models were clearly subcatchment dependent hence model improvements generally had an effect on improving the performance of bad performing subcatchments rather than producing a uniform improvement for all subcatchments improving the f ns on a few subcatchments had a low impact on the overall average hence one of the lessons learned from this model comparison was the importance of considering multiple model evaluation criteria and in particular hydrological signatures using signatures for model diagnostics has previously been encouraged in the hydrological literature e g sivapalan 2006 hrachowitz et al 2014 but has rarely been taken up operationally our findings are a clear example of how a model evaluation metric such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency would be a poor indicator to detect differences in the models used which are instead clear and significant in the signatures domain although the model comparison experiment supported the hypotheses noted by the perceptual model the magnitude of model improvements may not always appear consistent with the results of the analyses that underpinned the development of the perceptual model in particular in going from 2 to 3 hrus the model improvement was relatively large from pearson r 0 48 of m hru2 lag2 to r 0 86 of m hru3 lag2 in space time validation compared to the improvement of using 2 to 3 hrus when fitting the baseflow index in fm2022 from pearson r 0 87 to r 0 90 we explain this apparent inconsistency by noting that the models were calibrated to streamflow and not to the streamflow signatures which were used for independent evaluation it might therefore be that the simpler model was too simple in some other respects which created a tradeoff in its ability to accommodate different objectives the more complex model might reduce this tradeoff and enable the model components to better comply with their intended function in terms of modeling hydrograph lags we saw a big improvement when introducing such lag elements to a model that did not consider them when going from m hru1 lag0 to m hru1 lag1 the subcatchments where the lag was wrongly simulated dropped from 19 to 6 in space time validation but we saw a small improvement when introducing a more complex lag parameterization the drop was from 6 to 4 the models use two instruments to simulate such lags being the routing that occurs within the incremental subcatchments which is associated to the analysis on time to peak in fm2022 and the routing that occurs along the river stretches from upstream subcatchments which is associated to the analysis on relative lags in fm2022 the analysis on relative lags of fm2022 did not show a large improvement in going from a simpler used in m hru i lag1 to a more complex formulation used in m hru i lag2 but the time to peak analysis of fm2022 showed a large improvement when going from a simpler to a more complex formulation as shown in table 4 in fm2022 the spearman correlation went from 0 56 for the simpler formulation using only drainage distance to 0 78 for the more complex formulation using 3 landscape attributes which might have raised the expectation that the model improvement associated to a more complex parameterization of the lag functions was larger this apparent disparity of results is explained considering that first the current model application used daily data whereas the analysis of the lags in fm2022 used hourly data and for many subcatchments both the time to peak and the relative lags assessed in fm2022 were sub daily see figs 5 and 9 in fm2022 second here the assessment of hydrograph lags was based on the overall timing agreement of observed and simulated time series which combines all lags introduced by all model elements hence all model reservoirs and lag functions collectively one might ask at this stage what the value of the conceptual model comparison experiment was beyond simply a confirmation of perceptual model hypothesis first a conceptual model can be predictive e g it can predict streamflow time series in other time periods or different catchments whereas a perceptual model is generally qualitative second the conceptual model developed in this paper is an integrative model that has the ability to explain the combined relevant aspects of streamflow spatial variability the individual regressions that were the basis of the perceptual models are a more fragmented representation of catchment behavior each of them designed to mimic an individual aspect of streamflow spatial variability the model m hru3 lag2 is the best performing model and therefore the model of choice however it should not be interpreted as the end of the modeling process but rather as a basis for further explorations there are many possible refinements that can be tested and potentially incorporated depending on the intended model objectives these could include a more complex river routing module or a more spatially refined representation of catchment properties our work has followed the top down philosophy of keeping the model as simple as possible for the task at hand pursuing the same philosophy further model refinements should be tested based on what they add in terms of predictive abilities as well as requirements for the intended model use in this spirit a more complex processes representation should be warranted by an improved explanatory power otherwise it would be unjustified by the data e g grayson et al 1992 4 2 sources of uncertainty uncertainties in hydrological modeling arise from several sources namely structure parameters and observations and propagate as uncertainties in model simulations e g liu and gupta 2007 there are several formal approaches that can be used to quantify such uncertainties beven and binley 1992 kavetski et al 2006 montanari and di baldassarre 2013 including recent approaches that enable the identification of individual model mechanisms in a bayesian framework prieto et al 2021 such formal assessment was not conducted in this study as considered beyond scope however an argumentative assessment of these uncertainties can be provided on the basis of our analyses in terms of model parameters a general argument of the top down approach is that additional complexity is justified by an improvement in model simulations sivapalan et al 2003 as the progression through the 5 models resulted in an improvement in model simulations the model modifications all appear to be supported by the available data and therefore are not expected to result into over parameterization moreover the performance of all models both in the time and in the signature domain degraded only little in space time validation which is also an indication that all models did not appear to over fit the data in terms of uncertainties in model simulations given the correspondence between the objective function and a likelihood function associated to a streamflow error model section 2 3 1 an improvement in such objective function would also result in smaller uncertainties hence the progression through the 5 models would gradually reduce the hydrograph uncertainty bands in terms of model structure the proposed controlled model comparison approach exposes model decisions to evaluation results confirm and reinforce the hypotheses of the perceptual model which as mentioned in fm2022 is also subjected to uncertainty associated to the issue of uncertainty is issue of model transferability hence the extent to which the model can provide predictions outside calibration an ideal objective of hydrological model building is to achieve model transferability in space time and across scales our model development and evaluation approach suggests that the target model has such ability albeit within a prescribed range in particular our space time validation approach indicates that the model is able to extrapolate to different subcatchments within the same region and different time periods than used in calibration with minimal loss in performance moreover the model bridges scales that vary within about two orders of magnitude in the 100 to the 10 000 km2 range hence from the smallest subcatchments to the total catchment area see table 1 in fm2022 however extrapolations beyond the prescribed range such as outside the study area or beyond the range of scales here considered such as in headwater catchments would not be granted and would require further analyses such analyses may be for example represented by repeating our model development approach to some of the smaller subcatchments with corresponding nested gauging stations or to other catchments in a different location 4 3 what do we learn moving to progressively larger scales increasing scales reveal different influence factors on catchment response and associated dominant processes this effect could be attributed the fact that with increasing size smaller scale variability tends to average out and larger scale variability becomes progressively more visible and starts to play a role for example lithology or climatology is more uniform at the headwater scale and becomes more heterogeneous at the regional scale which makes their effects progressively more noticeable other properties may follow an opposite trend for example the fractions of different land uses may be variable at small scales and tend to stabilize when upscaling to the regional scale the effect of lithology on streamflow generation in particular is difficult to analyze when studying an individual catchment where lithology is uniform in a previous study on three headwater catchments in luxembourg fenicia et al 2014 the role of lithology on streamflow response became more visible though catchment comparisons although difficult to isolate as these catchments differed in many other aspects including land use area or topography it became more obvious and discernible when considering a nested catchment setup as in fenicia et al 2016 and in the current study it is interesting to note that although the two latter applications differed in scale by an order of magnitude the signature of lithology continued to be discernible and highly influential on streamflow generation the current application also revealed the effects of variable climatology and the routing of the river network which were considered progressively less important at smaller scales in a different area the thur catchment in switzerland we confirmed the importance of lithology in affecting streamflow regional variability but we also observed strong differences in streamflow seasonality dal molin et al 2020 which we did not observe in the current application other studies have shown the importance of regional groundwater flow which here was considered negligible e g muñoz et al 2016 bouaziz et al 2018 hence catchment responses vary depending places and scales which may affect individual modeling choices other studies on distributed model comparisons have stressed the importance of topography and its effects on quickflow vs baseflow partitioning evaporation and lag times e g gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 our results confirm that topography affected lag times which was incorporated in the parameterization of the lag functions however we could not confirm an effect on evaporation or baseflow a direct comparison of our work with these studies is complicated by the fact that these studies have not considered lithology as a possible control on streamflow variability an important question when attempting to map process space to model space is at which scale such connection should take place many distributed models are based on the premise that physical properties of the basic processes can only be retained at small spatial scales martina et al 2011 for example mhm uses a parameter regionalization approach using data at the smallest possible scale samaniego et al 2010 on the other hand lumped model regionalization e g oudin et al 2008 and catchment classification approaches addor et al 2018 typically seek that connection using aggregated measures of landscape properties hence directly at the scale of a catchment our results support the concept of regions of hydrological similarity or hrus and the idea that a relatively small number of hrus enables a sufficient connection between processes and their model representation within a given region such premise is the basis of many semi distributed models e g savenije 2010 dal molin et al 2020 hence it appears that the connection from process space to model space is in principle possible at multiple scales depending on the scale of the processes that one is interested in representing and provided that appropriate indicators of landscape properties are used that are representative of the processes at that scale as shown in fm2022 and elsewhere e g oudin et al 2010 gnann et al 2021 devising such meaningful landscape indicators is nontrivial and requires careful analysis 4 4 calibration parameters in distributed regional scale models key takeaways in terms of the appropriate number of model calibration parameters for regional scale streamflow simulation our results suggest that this number does not appear to scale up with the catchment size or with the number of subcatchments the best performing model m hru3 lag2 had 12 calibration parameters earlier work in the attert catchment showed that a model with 11 calibration parameters was sufficient to reproduce relevant signatures of streamflow variability at 10 subcatchments fenicia et al 2016 this number of parameters was higher than for a typical lumped streamflow simulation model e g jakeman and hornberger 1993 concluded that the permissible model complexity contains around half a dozen parameters but not orders of magnitude higher e g fenicia et al 2014 found that simulating a complex double peaked hydrograph response in a headwater catchments in luxembourg required 11 parameters such relatively limited complexity for a semi distributed model may appear counterintuitive at first our explanation of this result is twofold first a semi distributed model can be considered as many lumped models operating in parallel but not all of the parameters that characterize these lumped models need to be spatially variable many of such parameters can share the same values or their spatial variability can be prescribed by some parameter regularization relationship that depends on a few global parameters in m hru3 lag2 only the groundwater parameters were kept independent but other parameters where either kept uniform e g the snow or soil related parameters or linked through some regularization relationship e g the routing parameters second hru model structures can be tailored to the dominant processes of individual hrus resulting in being simpler than a typical lumped model for example 2 of the 3 hrus of m hru3 lag2 were characterized just by two buckets as intended to model discharge with specific dynamics fast or slow the number of calibration parameters that results from our model application appears low compared to other studies for example pokhrel et al 2008 needed to estimate 858 parameters of the grid based sacsma model which were reduced to 33 overall parameters using parameter regionalization relationships foglia et al 2009 had 35 calibration parameters in their distributed version of topkapi samaniego et al 2010 related model parameters to observable characteristics and obtained 62 calibration parameters for the distributed mhm model the disparity between our work and these other studies may be explained by the fact that we tailored our bespoke model to a specific catchment and scale which enabled several simplifications a general purpose model as the ones in the studies mentioned above need to consider whatever process may be important in principle even if such processes may not be dominant in a given application understanding what to account for and what to ignore when developing a distributed model is an important question this paper and fm2022 proposed a new way to approach this question instead of starting by feeding a distributed model with data our expert driven approach looks at data first and only then starts the modeling process such informed analysis of the data helps resolve many hydrological modeling questions before the model structure is determined helping bring experimentalist insights into the initiation of the conceptual model construction process and execution of the model calibration approach although the ultimate model is specific to a given region and therefore not transferable to other places where other processes may dominate the model development approach is indeed exportable to other areas more generally we suggest a shift from the quest for a general model which may be an unattainable ideal given differences in model applications to the quest for general model development approaches which can systematically identify a suitable model for a given application our work shows that this can be possible at the regional scale and that expert knowledge supported by an experimentalist modeler dialog can facilitate this process 5 conclusions this study illustrated the development of a semi distributed conceptual model for streamflow simulation at 26 subcatchments within the moselle catchment this bespoke model was informed by a perceptual model for the same catchment developed in fm2022 the perceptual model used 5 model variants of increasing complexity designed to test specific model hypotheses we evaluated the 5 models in a space time validation hence using a set of subcatchments and a time period not used for calibration from a methodological perspective this study showed how the many decisions required for the development of a distributed model can be informed by a perceptual model in particular we showed how the understanding of landscape controls on streamflow spatial variability and how these vary spatially can be translated into model decisions via hrus model structural components and model parameter constraints our comparisons of the 5 model variants clarified the effect of individual model decisions on streamflow simulations and informed the ultimate model selection in particular this model comparison was able to i identify a distributed model in particular m hru3 lag2 that matched key streamflow signatures in space time validation namely streamflow average r 0 96 baseflow index r 0 86 and hydrograph lag time correct at 22 out of 26 subcatchments and ii justify model decisions such as the distribution of precipitation per subcatchment a landscape discretization based on bedrock permeability the particularization of hru model structures based on lithology driven dominant processes and a parameterization of lag functions based on topography and land use derived indices with 12 calibration parameters of which 5 are hru specific and the others global or uniform in all hrus our final conceptual model structure represented a parsimonious representation of streamflow generating processes in the moselle catchment we found that the added value of the conceptual model compared to the perceptual model alone was that it helped provide a unique catchment description that explained several traits of the spatial variability of subcatchment response while we acknowledge that our conceptual model is developed for an individual regional scale catchment and its scope is therefore limited to the context for which it was developed nevertheless the model development approach followed in this study is one that could be put into practice elsewhere we believe this approach could contribute to better understanding regional scale catchment variability and eventually bespoke model development approaches that go beyond the current focus on generalizable models credit authorship

equations of the 5 distributed models are summarized in the tables a1 a5 table a1 summarizes the water balance equations in particular m hru1 lag0 and m hru1 lag1 are both based on a single hru which is represented by a 3 reservoirs structure composed by the reservoirs ur unsaturated fr fast and sr slow ur splits the inflow p ur between a portion that is stored and eventually evaporates as e ur and a portion that eventually produces runoff q ur q ur is then partitioned between p fr and p sr which enter fr and sr respectively the outflows of fr and sr q fr and q sr are summed together and form the outflow of the individual hru q hru m hru2 lag1 and m hru2 lag2 both have 2 hrus high permeability hruh and medium low permeability hruml both hrus are described by the same 3 reservoirs structure described above m hru3 lag2 has 3 hrus high medium and low permeability hruh hrum and hrul respectively the hruh model structure excludes the fr reservoir the hrum model structure has both fr and sr while the hrul model structure excludes the sr reservoir table a2 describes the models constitutive functions with functions symbols defined in table a3 ur partitions incoming precipitation between a portion that is stored and outflow using a power function defined by a parameter β ur evaporation from ur is proportional to the potential evaporation with a parameter c e ur and approaches zero as the reservoir depletes depending on a smoothing parameter m ur the 3 reservoir structure partitions of the outflow from ur between the inflows to fr and sr depending on the parameter d fr is parameterized as a nonlinear reservoir which depends on a parameter k fr and a power α fr fixed at 2 hence a quadratic reservoir sr is a linear reservoir which depends on the parameter k sr the 2 reservoirs structures used for hruh and hrul in m hru3 lag2 parameterize both sr and fr as quadratic reservoirs table a4 describes the snow reservoir precipitation p is partitioned between a portion

fixed at 2 degrees celsius and on the degree day parameter k wr the temperature thresholds as well as the effective melting rate are smoothed using the method in kavetski and kuczera 2007 the inflow to ur is given by the sum of rainfall and snowmelt for the routing elements a triangular lag function similarly to the hbv model lindström et al 1997 is used this function is described in table a5 and depends on the time base parameter t l routing elements are not present in m hru1 lag0 the other models include the same number of routing elements and differ for the regularization relationship used to scale the time base parameters t l for the various lag functions m hru1 lag1 and m hru2 lag1 use a simpler parameterization where the scaling of the routing depends on drainage distance alone e g lerat et al 2012 incremental subcatchment routing elements cl we assume that the time parameter representing the routing of the incremental subcatchment i is related to its landscape properties by the following expression 9 t i cl a cl l dstd i top where a cl is a calibration parameter and l dstd top already defined in fm2022 indicates the maximum drainage distance of the incremental subcatchment river routing elements rl we assume that the time parameter of the lag functions representing the routing of the river stretch i which goes from the outlet of the subcatchment i indicated with a to the next downstream outlet indicated with b is related to landscape properties by the following expression 10 t i rl a rl l ab i where a rl is a calibration parameter and the symbol l ab already defined in fm2022 represents the drainage distance between the two outlets a and b m hru2 lag2 and m hru3 lag2 use a more complex parameterization of the regularization relationships motivated by the data analysis in the perceptual model which is described as follows incremental subcatchment routing elements cl we assume that the time parameter representing the routing of the incremental subcatchment i is related to its landscape properties by the following expression 11 t i cl a 1 cl a 2 cl l dstg i top l dev i lnd l sl 05 i top where a 1 cl and a 2 cl are calibration parameters and the symbols l dstg top l dev lnd and l sl 05 top already defined in fm2022 represent respectively the geometric distance the fraction of developed land use and the 5 quantile of the slope this expression corresponds to equation 10 in fm2022 river routing elements rl we assume that the time parameter of the lag functions representing the routing of the river stretch i which goes from the outlet of the subcatchment i indicated with a to the next downstream outlet indicated with b is related to landscape properties by the following expression t i rl a rl l ab i a ab i α where a rl is a calibration parameter and the symbols l ab a ab and α already defined in fm2022 represent respectively the distance along the river network between two points a and b the average area between the total subcatchments at a and b and the exponent constant fixed at 0 1 see fm2022 this expression corresponds to equation 12 in fm2022 the absence of feedbacks between landscape elements greatly simplifies the solution of the system of mass balance differential equations which can be solved step by step using a fixed step implicit approximation fenicia et al 2011 
3741,regional scale distributed conceptual models are typically developed with a bottom up approach which is process inclusive but prone to over parameterization here we demonstrate a proof of concept top down approach for distributed conceptual model development intended to emphasize dominant streamflow generating processes and to fulfill the principle of model parsimony a key challenge in applying the top down approach to distributed model development is devising a model comparison experiment that is both informative and limited to a few model alternatives here we show how such model comparisons can be informed by a perceptual model of key processes that control streamflow response variability at the regional scale we demonstrate our approach for the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment using the perceptual model developed in part 1 of this two part paper we develop 5 distributed model structures for simulating daily streamflow at 26 subcatchments and validate them on subcatchments that are not used during the calibration process our model comparisons illustrate how the spatial distribution of precipitation lithology and topography affect the simulation of key signatures of streamflow response variability in the moselle catchment providing a basis to justify model decisions our analyses show how a minimally parameterized distributed model with 12 calibration parameters matches signatures of streamflow average r 0 96 baseflow index r 0 86 and hydrograph lag time correct at 22 out of 26 subcatchments our proposed top down approach contributes to improving distributed model development strategies and can be used to develop parsimonious process based regional models elsewhere keywords regional scale top down distributed model superflex hypothesis testing 1 introduction distributed hydrological models have been used by hydrologists since the first flood predictions on the durnace river in france by imbeaux 1892 although developed mostly for small catchments e g loague 2010 they are increasingly used at the regional or global scale e g paniconi and putti 2015 adams and pagano 2016 fatichi et al 2016 while field work and process knowledge can help with the selection of an existing model or even structural development of a new distributed model at the small catchment scale such selection or development options are few at regional scales and beyond e g loritz et al 2018 ehret et al 2020 in these large catchments even simple questions and decisions are not straightforward should a model have a coarser spatial resolution to limit its complexity or a finer one to enable a more detailed process representation should a model consider the variability in the properties of soil and lithology and if so how can these data be collected and incorporated parsimoniously into the model structure is topographical data sufficient to drive the model since it captures much of the co evolved relations between geology soils and upslope area and local slope angle should the unsaturated zone processes be described by the richards equation or by a simple bucket model approach should regional groundwater flow that extends beyond sub catchment boundaries be considered or it is irrelevant should a model require calibration and if so how can over parameterization be avoided these are but a few of the questions that confront the distributed catchment modeler today and the answers to these questions are rather ad hoc this exposes the regional scale distributed model to the many criticisms that have been levied against them the danger of over parameterization when available data are not sufficient to constrain model parameters e g beven 1989 gupta et al 1998 incorrect upscaling premises when the process based equations are derived at a scale different from that to which they are applied e g grayson et al 1992 kirchner 2006 unfulfilled spatial extrapolation assumptions when the dominant processes observed at one catchment are assumed to be dominant elsewhere e g mcdonnell et al 2007 savenije 2009 so despite 130 years of work since imbeaux s first distributed catchment model on the durnace we are still wondering how to inform the many decisions that developing a distributed model requires distributed models are typically developed through a bottom up approach which is rather inclusive in terms of processes that may be important in principle but may lead to the incorporation of model elements that contribute little to the overall catchment response fatichi et al 2016 in this study we explore distributed model development through a top down approach hence focusing on a disaggregation of the system responses into their constitutive components sivapalan et al 2003 it can be expected that the top down approach will generally not lead to hyper resolution models wood et al 2011 but rather to so called semi distributed models which occupy an intermediate position in the continuum from lumped to fully distributed models e g boyle et al 2001 semi distributed models seek an appropriate balance between process distribution and aggregation in the attempt to maintain a connection with observable landscape properties while still satisfying the principle of parsimony these models are widely used in research and operation particularly at the regional scale as their ability to represent spatial patterns makes them amenable to process based interpretations and their relatively limited computational requirements enable their use in operational setups in terms of scientific applications such models have proven useful to i characterize the behavior of landscape sections with different macro scale properties and behavior depending for example on topography or geology e g savenije 2010 ehret et al 2020 ii facilitate the application of regularization relationships or parameters and processes constraints based on expert knowledge which reduce over parameterization and increase the realism of spatially distributed simulations e g pokhrel et al 2008 gharari et al 2014 kelleher et al 2017 iii enable multi site validation through the use of internal streamflow measurements e g dal molin et al 2020 or groundwater time series e g raneesh and thampi 2013 and iv enable the comparison with remotely sensed data such as the spatial and temporal patterns of evaporation and total water storage anomalies which can be used as additional criteria to verify process consistency e g mulder et al 2015 hulsman et al 2021 such applications illustrate that semi distributed models are a versatile tool to explore regional scale catchment behavior moreover semi distributed models are a common choice in operational setups adams and pagano 2016 for example the model larsim is used operationally in germany demuth and rademacher 2016 prevah in switzerland viviroli et al 2009 and lisflood in europe smith et al 2016 the top down approach typically relies on model comparisons and has been commonly applied using lumped models providing useful insights on suitable ranges of model complexity needed to model streamflow e g jakeman and hornberger 1993 jothityangkoon et al 2001 or helping to interpret dominant processes in small catchments e g mcmillan et al 2011 fenicia et al 2014 yokoo et al 2017 correspondingly it can be expected that its systematic application to distributed models may provide information about warranted complexity and provide insights on which dominant processes characterize streamflow variability at the regional scale but if lumped models comparisons can easily involve hundreds of variants e g prieto et al spieler et al 2020 distributed models are generally more time consuming to devise and execute and as a result their comparison is often practically limited to a handful of alternatives e g gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 fenicia et al 2016 nijzink et al 2016 kelleher et al 2017 antonetti and zappa 2018 dal molin et al 2020 in face of the larger space of decisions that distributed models entail e g fenicia et al 2016 such model comparisons need to be strategically constructed in order to be informative in this study we address the problem of building a model comparison experiment that informs key decisions in the development of a semi distributed model for streamflow simulation in order to develop a minimal yet informative model comparison experiment we rely on a perceptual model of regional scale processes in a companion paper fenicia and mcdonnell 2022 hereinafter referred to as fm2022 we outlined the approach for building such a perceptual model leveraging data typically available at the regional scale here we illustrate the process of translating that perceptual model into conceptual model decisions and the use of controlled model comparisons to assist the ultimate model selection stringent model evaluation is essential in assessing the relative merits of the models that take part in such comparison experiments e g fenicia and kavetski 2021 in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance here we evaluate all models assessing the goodness of fit of both time series and signatures hence both in the time and in the signature domain e g hrachowitz et al 2014 kelleher et al 2017 kavetski et al 2018 moreover we assess the models ability to make predictions not only in time but also in space hence using subcatchments that are not used for calibration such space time validation is a particularly stringent and revealing model evaluation instrument refsgaard and knudsen 1996 the model development chain proposed here and in fm2022 enables the incorporation of expert knowledge into the model development process which can be contributed both by the experimentalist and by the modeler the dialog between experimentalist and modeler is considered an important instrument to increase model realism seibert and mcdonnell 2002 however such dialog has mainly taken place at the hillslope or headwater catchment scale the development of distributed models particularly at the regional scale has been largely devoid of any dialog between experimentalist and modeler mostly relegating the role of fieldwork to data collection for model parameterization burt and mcdonnell 2015 more generally hydrological models have often been the result of very specific often individual expertise however a participatory rather than expert specific model development process can as we will show facilitate model understanding criticism and revision we call this a bespoke model one that is tailor made for the regional watershed in fm2022 we developed a perceptual model of the 27 100 km2 moselle catchment which explains the spatial variability of streamflow signatures observed at 26 gauged subcatchments briefly this perceptual model established that precipitation much more than evaporation or groundwater exchange controls the spatial variability of average streamflow bedrock permeability influences the partitioning between baseflow and quickflow and topography and land use control hydrograph lag times it also provided an assessment of which other landscape properties did not appear to have significant effect on streamflow variability in this paper we illustrate how this perceptual model can be used for informing a distributed model comparison experiment aimed at determining and justifying a bespoke semi distributed model for the catchment of interest in order to alleviate the model building burden the distributed models are developed within the flexible framework superflex fenicia et al 2011 dal molin et al 2021 here we pursue the following objectives 1 to illustrate the process of translating the moselle perceptual model into a distributed conceptual model and in particular how the perceptual model informs the multiple decisions that distributed models require 2 to use model comparisons in space time validation to test the major hypotheses about the process controls on the selected streamflow signatures posed by the perceptual model and in particular a the effect of precipitation on average streamflow b the effect of lithology on the baseflow index c the effect of topography and land use on lag times 3 to discuss the added value of the distributed conceptual model compared to the underlying perceptual model of regional variability the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methods and in particular the transition from the perceptual model development to the conceptual model the model variants for hypothesis testing and the model calibration and evaluation strategies section 3 describes the model results both in the time and in the key signature domain section 4 discusses the specific results of the model comparisons and the general contribution of the proposed modeling approach section 5 summarizes the key conclusions 2 methods 2 1 from perceptual model of regional variability to distributed conceptual model the main application of the distributed model developed in this study is to simulate streamflow at a number of points along the river network of a given catchment hence at selected internal subcatchments this application can be considered the most typical for a distributed regional catchment model granted that such models can simulate variables other than streamflow e g samaniego et al 2010 hirpa et al 2018 athira and sudheer 2021 in order to build a process based distributed model with limited complexity for the selected application we adhere to some common choices in particular we use semi distributed models hence designed to reproduce flow at a limited number of points along the river network boyle et al 2001 and adopt the concept of on hydrological response units hrus leavesley et al 1983 for distributing landscape properties even restricting our scope to semi distributed hru based models model development requires several additional decisions which can be summarized as follows 1 defining the hrus hence the spatial discretization approach 2 specifying the model structures associated to each hru 3 establishing the connection between such model structures 4 defining parameter constraints to improve model parsimony 5 establishing model evaluation and diagnostic metrics in this study this set of decisions is informed by a perceptual model fig 1 indicates the correspondence between the information that a perceptual model might provide and key decisions that distributed model building requires fm2022 illustrated how a perceptual model of streamflow regional variability can be developed in order to provide information on these specific points the process of translating a perceptual model into a conceptual model is not obvious or univocally defined attempting a direct mapping between perceptual and conceptual model would still involve many ad hoc decisions with the risk that the resulting conceptual model may be too simple or too complex based on the available data therefore rather than directly translating the perceptual model into a conceptual model here we take the approach of exploiting the perceptual model to inform a set of model variants which are aimed to test a selection of the key hypotheses that the perceptual model embodies the intention of this comparison is to gain insights into the effect of model decisions and correspondingly into the dominant processes that characterize regional scale catchment behavior in the study area 2 2 translation of the moselle perceptual model into 5 distributed model variants fm2022 developed a perceptual model for the moselle catchment which interprets the spatial variability in the streamflow response of its 26 subcatchments in synthesis this model established that 1 streamflow spatial variability can be expressed by a set of key signatures characterizing streamflow average baseflow index and hydrograph lag times 2 the spatial variability of these signatures is controlled by distinct climate or landscape properties which need to be explicitly represented in a distributed model in particular precipitation controls the spatial variability of streamflow average lithology influences subsurface processes and eventually the baseflow vs quickflow partitioning and topography and land use control hydrograph lag times and 3 conversely the spatial variability of these signatures does not appear to be affected by other properties which do not need to be spatially resolved in a model representation in particular vegetation and soil do not appear to play a major role in explaining streamflow signatures spatial variability moreover the subcatchments appear to be water tight in the sense that regional groundwater flow extending beyond the subcatchment boundaries does not appear to be significant these insights are here used to build a model comparison experiment that isolates the effect of these key hypotheses the model comparison experiment is in line with a top down approach starting from a relatively simple benchmark model and introducing model modifications aimed at a more spatially explicit characterization of the catchment the set of models includes 5 model variants which are listed in table 1 these models are labeled using the notation m hru i lag j where m stands for model hru i i 1 2 3 to a particular classification in hydrological response units and lag j j 0 1 2 to a specific representation of the flow routing in synthesis the benchmark model is represented by m hru1 lag0 which uses a single hru and no flow routing elements this model has uniform parameters in space therefore it is unable to characterize landscape heterogeneity but has distributed states and therefore it is able to characterize climate variability and can produce distributed simulations this model is progressively evolved leading to m hru1 lag1 which introduces a simple routing approach then to m hru2 lag1 which adds a landscape discretization into 2 hrus then to m hru2 lag2 which introduces a more complex routing approach and finally to the target model m hru3 lag2 which considers 3 hrus in the following we start by describing the most spatially resolved model m hru3 lag2 section 2 2 1 and then introduce the simpler 4 model variants section 2 2 2 for ease of presentation the model description focuses mainly on the concepts relegating to the appendix the mathematical formulations the study area and data have already been described in fm2022 and therefore only the relevant details for the present application are mentioned all models use as forcing data the time series of precipitation potential evaporation and temperature and the streamflow is measured at 26 interior catchment points both the forcing data and the streamflow are considered at daily resolution maps of relevant catchment features as well their classification are the same as in fm2022 the calibration validation approach is described in section 2 3 2 2 2 1 target model 2 2 1 1 model structure this section describes the target model m hru3 lag2 and its relationship to the perceptual model developed in fm2022 which was briefly summarized in section 2 2 above the model schematic is shown in fig 2 and model equations are detailed in the appendix the minimum number of landscape elements that our distributed model requires is determined by the location of the points along the river network where streamflow simulations are needed in the present case this partitioning is based on the location of the 26 gauging stations where streamflow is observed fig 2 for clarity we define total subcatchment the total area drained by given point on the river network and incremental subcatchment the incremental area from an upstream point on the river network hence we divide the catchment into 26 incremental subcatchments the forcing data hence precipitation potential evaporation and temperature are distributed per incremental subcatchment fig 2 this decision is motivated by the perceptual model which indicated that such discretization is sufficient to describe the long term water balance the landscape is further discretized into hrus based on lithology in particular 3 hrus are considered representing the low hrul medium hrum and high hruh bedrock permeability classes the basis for this decision is that the perceptual model indicated that this landscape discretization is necessary to account for the variability of the baseflow index signature next we assign different structures for each hru intended to reflect the associated dominant processes we assume that lumped conceptual model structures considered adequate for precipitation streamflow modeling would be rather inclusive for representing a given hru we therefore start with such a structure and simplify it in order to account only for the processes that are perceived to be dominant in each hru as an inclusive model structure we consider a 3 elements structure composed by three reservoirs ur unsaturated zone reservoir intended to control the partitioning between precipitation and runoff fr fast reacting reservoir which represent the quickflow generating processes and sr slow reacting reservoir intended to represent the baseflow generating processes an analog three elements structure was indicated by jakeman and hornberger 1993 as the most commonly identified configuration for streamflow simulation see also young 2003 we then particularize this structure in order to describe hru specific dominant processes in particular the perceptual model suggests that as bedrock permeability goes from low to high the subsurface processes progressively shift from shallow to deep therefore triggering different hydrograph responses we here assume that low bedrock permeability predominantly triggers a fast hydrograph response and we therefore only consider the fr reservoir and we omit the sr reservoir medium bedrock permeability triggers both a fast and a slow response and we therefore keep both the fr and sr reservoirs high bedrock permeability predominantly triggers a slow hydrograph response and we therefore keep the sr reservoir and omit the fr reservoir although snow related processes do not have a major influence on streamflow generation they are nonetheless occasionally present see fm2022 and therefore we account for them for this reason each hru model also includes a snow reservoir wr based on the degree day method which accounts for snow accumulation and melting this specific choice is also maintained for the other model variants streamflow generated within each incremental subcatchment is obtained by first adding together the outflows from the individual hru models and then by propagating the resulting flow through a lag function intended to represent the incremental subcatchment routing cl lag functions marked in blue color in fig 2 streamflow at each total subcatchment needs to account also for the streamflow from upstream subcatchments incoming streamflow from each upstream subcatchment is first offset through a lag function intended to represent the river routing rl through the incremental subcatchment lag functions marked in red color in fig 2 and then added to the incremental subcatchment streamflow regional groundwater flow between subcatchments as suggested by the perceptual model is not considered and the hrus act in parallel the total number of landscape elements that need to be separately modeled is obtained by summing the number of hrus present in each incremental subcatchment as hrus in different subcatchments need to be modeled separately given that they receive different forcings there are 26 subcatchments and 3 hrus however not all subcatchments contain all hrus resulting in a total of 75 landscape elements table 1 2 2 1 2 parameters constraints the perceptual model can be further exploited to constrain the parameter space by providing parameters regularization relationships e g pokhrel et al 2008 these constraints are described hereafter and are also indicated in fig 2 hru model structure parameters we assume that some parameters associated to distinct hru model structures are related to each other in particular the perceptual model suggests a similar behavior between hrus in terms of partitioning precipitation between evaporation and runoff which suggests that the parameters of the ur element can be kept common between hru models fig 2 also the parameters of the snow reservoir wr are considered as spatially uniform subcatchment routing parameters we assume that the parameters associated to the incremental subcatchment routing cl are a function of selected landscape properties and two global calibration parameters based on the analysis on time to peak variability in the perceptual model we assume that the time parameter shaping the lag function in each incremental subcatchment increases with geometric distance and decreases with the fraction of developed land use and the 5 quantile of the slope see appendix river routing parameters we assume that the parameters associated to the river routing from upstream total subcatchments rl are a function of landscape properties and a global calibration parameter based on the analysis on the relative lag in the perceptual model we assume that the time parameter shaping the lag function associated to river routing increases with the drainage distance and decreases with the upstream contributing area see appendix such parameter relationships strongly reduce the number of calibration parameters of the distributed model specifically the model m hru3 lag2 has 12 calibration parameters table 1 and appendix which are hereafter summarized following the notation of indicating in the superscript the model element to which the parameter is associated the degree day snow parameter k wr which is common to all spatial elements 3 parameters characterizing the ur element c e ur s max ur β ur which are also common to all spatial elements 1 parameter specific for the high permeability hruh k sr hru h characterizing the release rate of the sr element 3 parameters for the medium permeability hrum d hru m k fr hru m k sr hru m representing the split between fr and sr and the release rate of the 2 reservoirs 1 parameter for the low permeability hrul k fr hru l characterizing the release rate of fr 2 parameters a 1 cl a 2 cl that scale the cl lag functions and 1 parameter a rl that scales the rl lag functions see appendix 2 2 2 model variants for hypothesis testing the target model described above embeds several hypotheses about system characteristics that need to be represented in order to capture distributed streamflow responses although these hypotheses are motivated by the perceptual model the translation from perceptual to conceptual model is not obvious in order to provide a stronger basis to justify these hypotheses and ensure that they are supported by the data 4 additional model structures are introduced these model structures follow a path from simple to complex in the spirit of a top down approach starting from a benchmark model intended to represent a null hypothesis about process controls on streamflow responses and which is progressively evolved in order to lead to the target model described above the 4 model structures are described below and summarized in table 1 m hru1 lag0 uses of a single hru and no lag functions specifically this model has subcatchment parameters that are uniform in space hence it is unable to account for the heterogeneity in landscape attributes this model is still distributed as it has distributed states per incremental subcatchment hence it is able to account for the spatial heterogeneity of climate the lag functions characterizing the routing within the incremental subcatchments and from upstream subcatchments are also omitted hence this model is unable to account for the associated lagging and dampening effects as hru structure the full 3 reservoirs structures is used previously used for hrum in m hru3 lag2 this model has 7 calibration parameters associated to the individual hru model structure the degree day snow parameter k wr 3 parameters associated to ur c e ur s max ur β ur the split parameter d the parameters associated to fr k fr and sr k sr this model has 26 landscape elements which are determined solely by the number of subcatchments table 1 m hru1 lag1 introduces flow routing elements compared to the target model m hru3 lag2 the routing is represented by the same lag functions but the regularization relationships of these lag functions use less parameters and less landscape attributes in particular both the subcatchment routing elements cl and the river routing elements rl are scaled only according to drainage distance each of them using a single calibration parameter see appendix the use of drainage distance alone can be considered one of the simplest approaches to parameterize routing effects as used for example by lerat et al 2012 this model has 9 calibration parameters which are the same as for m hru1 lag0 with the addition of a parameter for cl a cl and a parameter for rl a rl and 26 landscape elements table 1 m hru2 lag1 introduces a partitioning of the landscape into 2 hrus compared to m hru3 lag2 this model maintains the high permeability hruh and combines the other hrus into a medium low bedrock permeability hruml both hrus use the same 3 reservoirs structure used in m hru1 lag0 and m hru1 lag1 hence this model does not tailor the model structures to the specific hrus like m hru3 lag2 similarly to m hru3 lag2 the parameters of the ur reservoir are kept uniform in space whereas the split parameter and the parameters associated to fr and sr are distributed this model has 12 parameters which are the degree day snow parameter k wr 3 parameters associated to ur c e ur s max ur β ur which are common to both hrus 3 parameters for the high permeability hruh d hru h k fr hru h k sr hru h characterizing the split the fr and the sr reservoir respectively the corresponding 3 parameters specific for the medium low permeability hruml d hru ml k fr hru ml k sr hru ml a parameter for cl a cl and a parameter for rl a rl as each of the 26 subcatchments contain both hrus this model uses 52 landscape elements table 1 m hru2 lag2 introduces a more complex parameterization of the routing elements in particular this model uses the same regularization relationships for the lag functions as m hru3 lag2 thus involving more landscape attributes and one additional parameter associated to the rl lag functions a 1 cl a 2 cl this model has 13 parameters one parameter more than m hru2 lag1 due to the additional parameters associated to the cl lag functions like m hru2 lag1 this model has 52 landscape elements table 1 the last step of this chain is represented by the target model m hru3 lag2 already described in section 2 2 1 which differs from m hru2 lag2 for the addition of an hru and for the tailoring of the hru model structures according to the perceived dominant process we note that m hru3 lag2 has 1 parameter less than m hru2 lag2 in spite of the higher spatial resolution due to the tailoring of the model structures to the hru dominant processes based on the premises of the perceptual model that informs the conceptual model decisions the 5 model structures are associated to specific hypotheses about their relative merits these hypotheses are as follows 1 m hru1 lag0 in spite of its simplicity should be able to capture the long term water balance 2 m hru1 lag1 should enable the characterization of streamflow lag times 3 m hru2 lag1 should enable the characterization of baseflow variability 4 m hru2 lag2 should further improve the characterization of streamflow lag times 5 m hru3 lag2 should further improve the characterization of baseflow variability hence the differences between the 5 model variants have an anticipated effect on an individual signature and not on others correspondingly the model comparison is expected to highlight influence factors on the selected streamflow signatures as well as their relative independence 2 3 model evaluation this section describes the model evaluation approach section 2 3 1 specifies the objective function used for model calibration section 2 3 2 describes the calibration and space time validation approach section 2 3 3 illustrates the assessment of model performance both in the time and in the signature domain although a specific uncertainty analysis is not carried out the model comparison provides a basis for a relative assessment of model uncertainties which we consider sufficient for our purpose in terms of parameters uncertainty we rely on the assumption typical of the top down approach that additional complexity is justified by the data if it corresponds to an improvement in model simulations sivapalan et al 2003 we also interpret significant differences between calibration and space time validation performance as an indication of overfitting in terms of uncertainties associated to model simulation we rely on the consideration that an improvement in the selected likelihood function section 2 3 2 corresponds to tighter uncertainty bands the model comparison severs multiple related purposes and in particular 1 to clarify the effect of model decisions which is obtained by comparing the performance of pairs of models that differ in a controlled way 2 to guide the ultimate model selection which is approached by assessing whether the progression of models leads to an improvement in the model evaluation metrics and 3 to evaluate the hypotheses of the perceptual model as the model variants correspond to specific hypotheses of how dominant processes affect streamflow regional variability 2 3 1 likelihood function for model calibration semi distributed models for streamflow simulation have been calibrated using different strategies e g wallner et al 2012 the simplest strategy is the single site approach which consists in calibrating the models using data at an individual gauge similarly to what is commonly done with lumped models e g gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 this approach has the limitation that an individual time series may not contain sufficient information for the parameter identification of a distributed model such as to disentangle the behavior of different hrus hence it may lead to poor parameter identifiability an alternative calibration strategy is the sequential approach which consists in calibrating the model from upstream to downstream in a sequential manner e g ajami et al 2004 feyen et al 2008 lerat et al 2012 de lavenne et al 2019 this approach while easy to apply has the disadvantage that it leads to many parameter sets one set for each subcatchment hence it makes the model on the one hand highly parameterized and on the other hand highly dependent on calibration and therefore difficult to regionalize finally the multi site approach consists in calibrating the model simultaneously at a number of stations e g zhang et al 2010 fenicia et al 2016 dal molin et al 2020 this approach overcomes the limitations of the previous approaches and is adopted in the present study in order to enable model calibration it is necessary to construct an objective function which quantifies the goodness of fit of model predictions this objective function is here derived from a bayesian inference approach where we assumed non informative flat priors for model parameters and we assumed that the residuals errors of transformed streamflow are statistically independent and can be approximated by a zero mean gaussian distribution 1 q i t obs λ q i t sim λ n 0 σ where i indicates the subcatchment and varies from 1 to the number of selected subcatchments n c t indicates the time index and varies from 1 to the number of data points n t i in the subcatchment i q sim and q obs are simulated and observed streamflow respectively n 0 σ is the gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation σ and the power λ is fixed at 0 5 implying a square root transformation as recommended by mcinerney et al 2017 maximising the posterior parameter distributions under the assumption of equation corresponds to maximising the nash sutcliffe efficiency of the square root of the streamflow 2 f ns 1 i 1 n c t 1 n t i q i t sim q i t obs 2 i 1 n c t 1 n t i q i t obs a v e q 1 n c 1 n t obs 2 where ave indicates the average which is extended to the streamflow of all subcatchments 2 3 2 calibration and space time validation strategy the model evaluation strategy is motivated by testing the quality of model simulations in space time validation meaning using a time period and a set of subcatchments that the model does not see during calibration e g fenicia et al 2016 dal molin et al 2020 using the words of klemeš 1986 this validation may be called a proxy basins split sample test for this purpose the available data is organized as follows the time period is partitioned into two 13 year periods period 1 going from 1 09 1989 to 31 08 2002 and period 2 going from 1 09 2002 to 31 08 2015 the subcatchments are partitioned into two groups of 13 subcatchments each group a and group b the partition is made by sorting subcatchments by total area and placing every second subcatchment in each group the organization of the data in two periods and two groups of subcatchments is presented in fig 3 which also shows the data availability for each subcatchment represented by the corresponding gauge name missing data are treated by considering in the objective function eq 2 only time indices where data is available fig 1 and table 1 in fm2022 shows the spatial location of the subcatchments and list their areal extension the model evaluation strategy proceeds as follows 1 we calibrate the models on one group of subcatchments over a given time period and validate it on the other group of subcatchments over the other time period hence we perform space time validation with reference to fig 3 once a quadrant is chosen for calibration moving horizontally on another quadrant means performing time validation moving vertically means performing space validation and moving diagonally means performing space time validation for example if a model is calibrated on period 1 group a then period 2 group a represents time validation period 1 group b represents space validation and period 2 group b represents space time validation 2 this process is repeated for all four combinations of calibration periods and subcatchment groups 3 the streamflow time series from the four space time validation scenarios are then concatenated thus forming a single set of predicted streamflow time series spanning the entire observation period at each subcatchment an analogous set of concatenated time series of calibrated streamflow is also constructed the results focus on comparing model performance in calibration the least challenging scenario and space time validation the most challenging scenario as the two scenarios use the same underlying data when moving from calibration to space time validation at least in terms of the calibration objective function model performance can only degrade the degree of this degradation may give an indication on whether any of the models is prone to overfitting the data 2 3 3 performance metrics of streamflow simulations model performance is analyzed both in the time domain and in the signature domain for model evaluation in the time domain we use the f ns metric already defined in equation 2 as it corresponds to the objective function used for model calibration for model evaluation in the signature domain the following three streamflow signatures evaluation metrics are used which are based on the analysis of streamflow spatial variability performed in fm2022 streamflow average correlation the streamflow average at a given subcatchment is defined by 3 q k 1 n t k t 1 n t k q k t where q is the streamflow k 1 n c is the subcatchment index with n c representing the number of subcatchments t is the time index n t k is the number of observations at the subcatchment k and the overbar indicates the average over the observation period to assess model ability to simulate this signature we consider the pearson correlation r between observed and simulated streamflow average at the 26 subcatchments 4 f qavg r q obs q sim we choose the correlation to quantify the alignment between the observed and predictive values rather than the agreement of the absolute values and we assess visually the agreement along the diagonal we opt for using pearson rather than spearman correlation as used in fm2022 as the agreement between observed and simulated quantities should ideally be linear baseflow index correlation the baseflow index is defined as 5 q bfi k t 1 n t k q k t b t 1 n t k q k t where q k t b is calculated with the filter proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 using the same settings as in fm2022 to assess model ability to simulate this signature we consider the correlation r between observed and simulated baseflow index at the 26 subcatchments 6 f qbfi r q bfi obs q bfi sim also here we chose the correlation to quantify the alignment between the observed and predictive values rather than the agreement of the absolute values hydrograph relative lag in order to estimate the lag between observed and simulated hydrographs we proceeded as follows we calculate the pearson cross correlations r k n l n l between the observed and simulated hydrographs at each subcatchment k shifting the observed hydrograph for lags n l of up to 20 d with respect to the simulated hydrograph we consider the lag i l k that results in the maximum pearson cross correlation 7 q lag k i l k such that max r k n l n l r k i l the relative lag q lag k should be zero if the lag is correctly simulated by the model a positive relative lag would mean that the simulated hydrograph overestimates the lag we then simply sum the absolute values of the hydrograph relative lag for all the subcatchments 8 f qlag k 1 n c q lag k which is an integer equal or larger than zero with lower values indicating better performance i e a value of zero indicates that the lag is correctly simulated at all subcatchments 3 results 3 1 model performance in the time domain fig 4 shows box plots representing the variability of f ns in the subcatchments under the calibration and space time validation scenarios the following results can be observed 1 in calibration the averages for the 26 subcatchments of the f ns for the models m hru1 lag0 m hru1 lag1 m hru2 lag1 m hru2 lag2 and m hru3 lag2 were 0 80 0 83 0 85 0 85 0 86 respectively hence there was a general increase in performance when increasing the number of hrus of the more complex models the corresponding standard deviations of the f ns values were 6 4 10 2 6 5 10 2 5 3 10 2 5 0 10 2 and 4 5 10 2 showing a decreasing tendency which indicated a more stable model performance across subcatchments for the more complex models 2 in space time validation the ranking was generally preserved however with lower average and larger spread for all models in particular the f ns average values were 0 76 0 76 0 79 0 80 0 81 and 0 82 while the corresponding standard deviations were 8 1 10 2 8 1 10 2 6 2 10 2 6 8 10 2 and 5 5 10 2 3 the increments in performance between the models in terms of f ns appeared minor for example the difference between the average f ns values of the two hru model m hru2 lag2 and the 3 hrus model m hru3 lag2 was just 0 01 4 the best performing model hence m hru3 lag2 in space time validation had f ns values comprised between 0 64 at luneville one of the smaller subcatchments and 0 91 at cochem the catchment outlet hence overall the analysis in terms of f ns indicated that the modeling progression led to an improvement of performance as hypothesized in section 2 2 2 however based on this analysis alone the differences in model performance did not appear very significant fig 5 shows the f ns values for each individual subcatchment and model variant in space time validation thereby complementing the earlier assessment based on aggregated results differences in f ns values between models were clearly catchment dependent as a general tendency subcatchments characterized by poorer performances when using the simpler model variants e g boncourt luneville reinheim and fremersdorf were the ones that experienced most of the improvement while subcatchments that already presented a relatively high performance were relatively stable hence the model improvements generally had an effect on fixing the outliers rather than producing a uniform improvement for all subcatchments this effect explains why on average the improvement in f ns values was rather minor in order to better assess model differences and understand the associated causes it is important to analyze the streamflow signatures which provide the basis of a diagnostic approach to model evaluation as shown in the subsequent section 3 2 model performance in the signature domain in terms of streamflow signatures we start by reporting the models ability to simulate q obs and q bfi obs we explicitly report the simulations of models m hru1 lag0 m hru2 lag1 and m hru3 lag2 in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 respectively hence the initial model of the chain and the subsequent models that showed the highest improvement in at least one of the signatures this comparison is summarized in the following results 1 all 5 models demonstrated a similar and very good ability to reproduce q obs with f qavg 0 95 both in calibration and in space time validation and a good agreement along the diagonal line this result implies that the differences in the structures of the 5 models did not have an effect on this signature and that m hru1 lag0 the simplest model based on a single hru already contained the ability to simulate this signature 2 the models differed significantly in their ability to reproduce q bfi obs in particular m hru1 lag0 and m hru1 lag1 were unable to simulate differences between subcatchments f qbfi 0 in both cases m hru2 lag1 and m hru2 lag2 provided a better match f qbfi 0 52 and 0 48 respectively in space time validation and m hru3 lag2 significantly improved the fit f qbfi 0 86 in space time validation and a good agreement along the diagonal 3 the performance of the models was lower in space time validation than in calibration however it decreased only slightly in particular the performance of the models in terms of q obs remained more or less unchanged whereas the models ability to reproduce q bfi obs experienced a minor deterioration fig 9 illustrates the ability of the 5 models to correctly simulate hydrographs lags in space time validation each column of a given panel shows the correlation between observed and simulated streamflow for different lags t lag of the simulated streamflow the red cross indicates the lag for which the correlation was maximized the cross should be at t lag 0 if the lag is correctly simulated if the red cross is at t lag 1 it means that the simulated streamflow dynamics are anticipated of one time step in this case one day compared to the observed ones it can be observed that m hru1 lag0 which has no lag functions failed to correctly simulate the lag at 19 out of 26 subcatchments where the lag was always anticipated of one day compared to the observations leading to f qlag 19 in space time validation m hru1 lag1 and m hru2 lag1 which use the simple parameterization of the lag function led to a sensible improvement failing to correctly simulate the lag at 6 of the subcatchments with a lag of 1 and leading to f qlag 6 m hru2 lag2 and m hru3 lag2 which adopt the more complex parameterization of the lag functions further improved the representation of the lags with f qlag 4 it can be noted that models that share the same parameterization of the lag function were consistent both in the number of failures which was exactly the same and in the subcatchments where this failure appear which was similar the calibration performance was consistent with the performance in space time validation with f qlag values of 16 6 6 1 and 2 respectively for the 5 models overall the signatures analysis shows that model modifications had a targeted effect on an individual signature without affecting significantly the others in particular the distribution of the forcings data had an effect on capturing the long term streamflow average the distribution of the landscape in hrus had an effect on simulating the baseflow index and the routing model and successive improvements predominantly affected the hydrograph lags by comparing the results in the signature domain from those in the time domain it is apparent that the streamflow signatures provided a complementary perspective on the relative merits of the three models in particular they helped identify similarities and differences in model simulations which were not immediately apparent with a metric of time series agreement such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 agreement of conceptual model results with perceptual model hypotheses the distributed perceptual model developed in fm2022 has been employed to set up a conceptual model comparison experiment with the purpose of clarifying the effect of model decisions guiding model selection and testing key hypotheses of how dominant processes affect streamflow regional variability five model variants were compared based on the expectation that they would behave differently in their ability to simulate a selection of streamflow signatures namely the streamflow average the baseflow index and the hydrograph lag our results indicated that 1 the benchmark model m hru1 lag0 that accounted for the spatial variability of the forcings but did not account for the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape captured the streamflow average signatures as good as more complex models r 0 95 in space time validation this result indicates that climate rather than landscape affected streamflow average 2 m hru1 lag1 introduced routing elements simply parameterized based on drainage distance this modification greatly improved the simulation of hydrograph lags leading from 19 to 6 subcatchments where the lag was wrongly simulated this result suggests that such drainage distance acts as a primary control on hydrograph lags 3 m hru2 lag1 introduced a partitioning of the landscape into 2 hrus based on relative bedrock permeability inferred from lithology such a partitioning enabled a characterization of the baseflow index signature from r 0 to r 0 52 in space time validation this improvement suggests that lithology acts as a primary control on baseflow 4 m hru2 lag2 introduced a more complex parameterization of the routing elements using additional topography and land use indicators which further improved the characterization of lag times lags reducing from 6 to 4 subcatchments where the lag was wrongly simulated this outcome indicates the role of additional topographic and land use controls on lag times 5 m hru3 lag2 further discretized the landscape into 3 hrus based on a finer resolution of relative bedrock permeability and tailored the model structure to the perceived dominant processes in each hru this model improved the characterization of the baseflow index from r 0 48 to r 0 86 in space time validation which confirms the control of lithology on baseflow in summary the model comparison experiment confirms the key hypotheses of the perceptual model indicating that 1 incorporating into the model structure information about spatial variability of precipitation bedrock permeability topography and land use was essential to capture the signatures of streamflow average baseflow index and hydrograph lag model structures that omitted this information had lower ability to reproduce these signatures 2 the selected streamflow signatures responded to individual processes controls as the model modifications that affected the processes associated to given signature affected minimally the other signatures notably the simulation of the streamflow average was essentially the same for all model variants it is interesting to note that the difference in simulation abilities of the 5 models was much more evident in the signatures domain than in the time domain in terms of average nash sutcliffe efficiency f ns the ranking of performance in the time domain was consistent with the one in the signature domain meaning that higher f ns corresponded to better match of the streamflow signatures however the average f ns of the 5 models varied within a very narrow range 0 80 to 0 86 in calibration and 0 76 to 0 82 in space time validation whereas the models ability to match signatures went from very poor near zero baseflow index correlations or lag wrong at the vast majority of the catchments to relatively good see above small differences in average f ns are explained when considering that differences in f ns values between models were clearly subcatchment dependent hence model improvements generally had an effect on improving the performance of bad performing subcatchments rather than producing a uniform improvement for all subcatchments improving the f ns on a few subcatchments had a low impact on the overall average hence one of the lessons learned from this model comparison was the importance of considering multiple model evaluation criteria and in particular hydrological signatures using signatures for model diagnostics has previously been encouraged in the hydrological literature e g sivapalan 2006 hrachowitz et al 2014 but has rarely been taken up operationally our findings are a clear example of how a model evaluation metric such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency would be a poor indicator to detect differences in the models used which are instead clear and significant in the signatures domain although the model comparison experiment supported the hypotheses noted by the perceptual model the magnitude of model improvements may not always appear consistent with the results of the analyses that underpinned the development of the perceptual model in particular in going from 2 to 3 hrus the model improvement was relatively large from pearson r 0 48 of m hru2 lag2 to r 0 86 of m hru3 lag2 in space time validation compared to the improvement of using 2 to 3 hrus when fitting the baseflow index in fm2022 from pearson r 0 87 to r 0 90 we explain this apparent inconsistency by noting that the models were calibrated to streamflow and not to the streamflow signatures which were used for independent evaluation it might therefore be that the simpler model was too simple in some other respects which created a tradeoff in its ability to accommodate different objectives the more complex model might reduce this tradeoff and enable the model components to better comply with their intended function in terms of modeling hydrograph lags we saw a big improvement when introducing such lag elements to a model that did not consider them when going from m hru1 lag0 to m hru1 lag1 the subcatchments where the lag was wrongly simulated dropped from 19 to 6 in space time validation but we saw a small improvement when introducing a more complex lag parameterization the drop was from 6 to 4 the models use two instruments to simulate such lags being the routing that occurs within the incremental subcatchments which is associated to the analysis on time to peak in fm2022 and the routing that occurs along the river stretches from upstream subcatchments which is associated to the analysis on relative lags in fm2022 the analysis on relative lags of fm2022 did not show a large improvement in going from a simpler used in m hru i lag1 to a more complex formulation used in m hru i lag2 but the time to peak analysis of fm2022 showed a large improvement when going from a simpler to a more complex formulation as shown in table 4 in fm2022 the spearman correlation went from 0 56 for the simpler formulation using only drainage distance to 0 78 for the more complex formulation using 3 landscape attributes which might have raised the expectation that the model improvement associated to a more complex parameterization of the lag functions was larger this apparent disparity of results is explained considering that first the current model application used daily data whereas the analysis of the lags in fm2022 used hourly data and for many subcatchments both the time to peak and the relative lags assessed in fm2022 were sub daily see figs 5 and 9 in fm2022 second here the assessment of hydrograph lags was based on the overall timing agreement of observed and simulated time series which combines all lags introduced by all model elements hence all model reservoirs and lag functions collectively one might ask at this stage what the value of the conceptual model comparison experiment was beyond simply a confirmation of perceptual model hypothesis first a conceptual model can be predictive e g it can predict streamflow time series in other time periods or different catchments whereas a perceptual model is generally qualitative second the conceptual model developed in this paper is an integrative model that has the ability to explain the combined relevant aspects of streamflow spatial variability the individual regressions that were the basis of the perceptual models are a more fragmented representation of catchment behavior each of them designed to mimic an individual aspect of streamflow spatial variability the model m hru3 lag2 is the best performing model and therefore the model of choice however it should not be interpreted as the end of the modeling process but rather as a basis for further explorations there are many possible refinements that can be tested and potentially incorporated depending on the intended model objectives these could include a more complex river routing module or a more spatially refined representation of catchment properties our work has followed the top down philosophy of keeping the model as simple as possible for the task at hand pursuing the same philosophy further model refinements should be tested based on what they add in terms of predictive abilities as well as requirements for the intended model use in this spirit a more complex processes representation should be warranted by an improved explanatory power otherwise it would be unjustified by the data e g grayson et al 1992 4 2 sources of uncertainty uncertainties in hydrological modeling arise from several sources namely structure parameters and observations and propagate as uncertainties in model simulations e g liu and gupta 2007 there are several formal approaches that can be used to quantify such uncertainties beven and binley 1992 kavetski et al 2006 montanari and di baldassarre 2013 including recent approaches that enable the identification of individual model mechanisms in a bayesian framework prieto et al 2021 such formal assessment was not conducted in this study as considered beyond scope however an argumentative assessment of these uncertainties can be provided on the basis of our analyses in terms of model parameters a general argument of the top down approach is that additional complexity is justified by an improvement in model simulations sivapalan et al 2003 as the progression through the 5 models resulted in an improvement in model simulations the model modifications all appear to be supported by the available data and therefore are not expected to result into over parameterization moreover the performance of all models both in the time and in the signature domain degraded only little in space time validation which is also an indication that all models did not appear to over fit the data in terms of uncertainties in model simulations given the correspondence between the objective function and a likelihood function associated to a streamflow error model section 2 3 1 an improvement in such objective function would also result in smaller uncertainties hence the progression through the 5 models would gradually reduce the hydrograph uncertainty bands in terms of model structure the proposed controlled model comparison approach exposes model decisions to evaluation results confirm and reinforce the hypotheses of the perceptual model which as mentioned in fm2022 is also subjected to uncertainty associated to the issue of uncertainty is issue of model transferability hence the extent to which the model can provide predictions outside calibration an ideal objective of hydrological model building is to achieve model transferability in space time and across scales our model development and evaluation approach suggests that the target model has such ability albeit within a prescribed range in particular our space time validation approach indicates that the model is able to extrapolate to different subcatchments within the same region and different time periods than used in calibration with minimal loss in performance moreover the model bridges scales that vary within about two orders of magnitude in the 100 to the 10 000 km2 range hence from the smallest subcatchments to the total catchment area see table 1 in fm2022 however extrapolations beyond the prescribed range such as outside the study area or beyond the range of scales here considered such as in headwater catchments would not be granted and would require further analyses such analyses may be for example represented by repeating our model development approach to some of the smaller subcatchments with corresponding nested gauging stations or to other catchments in a different location 4 3 what do we learn moving to progressively larger scales increasing scales reveal different influence factors on catchment response and associated dominant processes this effect could be attributed the fact that with increasing size smaller scale variability tends to average out and larger scale variability becomes progressively more visible and starts to play a role for example lithology or climatology is more uniform at the headwater scale and becomes more heterogeneous at the regional scale which makes their effects progressively more noticeable other properties may follow an opposite trend for example the fractions of different land uses may be variable at small scales and tend to stabilize when upscaling to the regional scale the effect of lithology on streamflow generation in particular is difficult to analyze when studying an individual catchment where lithology is uniform in a previous study on three headwater catchments in luxembourg fenicia et al 2014 the role of lithology on streamflow response became more visible though catchment comparisons although difficult to isolate as these catchments differed in many other aspects including land use area or topography it became more obvious and discernible when considering a nested catchment setup as in fenicia et al 2016 and in the current study it is interesting to note that although the two latter applications differed in scale by an order of magnitude the signature of lithology continued to be discernible and highly influential on streamflow generation the current application also revealed the effects of variable climatology and the routing of the river network which were considered progressively less important at smaller scales in a different area the thur catchment in switzerland we confirmed the importance of lithology in affecting streamflow regional variability but we also observed strong differences in streamflow seasonality dal molin et al 2020 which we did not observe in the current application other studies have shown the importance of regional groundwater flow which here was considered negligible e g muñoz et al 2016 bouaziz et al 2018 hence catchment responses vary depending places and scales which may affect individual modeling choices other studies on distributed model comparisons have stressed the importance of topography and its effects on quickflow vs baseflow partitioning evaporation and lag times e g gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 our results confirm that topography affected lag times which was incorporated in the parameterization of the lag functions however we could not confirm an effect on evaporation or baseflow a direct comparison of our work with these studies is complicated by the fact that these studies have not considered lithology as a possible control on streamflow variability an important question when attempting to map process space to model space is at which scale such connection should take place many distributed models are based on the premise that physical properties of the basic processes can only be retained at small spatial scales martina et al 2011 for example mhm uses a parameter regionalization approach using data at the smallest possible scale samaniego et al 2010 on the other hand lumped model regionalization e g oudin et al 2008 and catchment classification approaches addor et al 2018 typically seek that connection using aggregated measures of landscape properties hence directly at the scale of a catchment our results support the concept of regions of hydrological similarity or hrus and the idea that a relatively small number of hrus enables a sufficient connection between processes and their model representation within a given region such premise is the basis of many semi distributed models e g savenije 2010 dal molin et al 2020 hence it appears that the connection from process space to model space is in principle possible at multiple scales depending on the scale of the processes that one is interested in representing and provided that appropriate indicators of landscape properties are used that are representative of the processes at that scale as shown in fm2022 and elsewhere e g oudin et al 2010 gnann et al 2021 devising such meaningful landscape indicators is nontrivial and requires careful analysis 4 4 calibration parameters in distributed regional scale models key takeaways in terms of the appropriate number of model calibration parameters for regional scale streamflow simulation our results suggest that this number does not appear to scale up with the catchment size or with the number of subcatchments the best performing model m hru3 lag2 had 12 calibration parameters earlier work in the attert catchment showed that a model with 11 calibration parameters was sufficient to reproduce relevant signatures of streamflow variability at 10 subcatchments fenicia et al 2016 this number of parameters was higher than for a typical lumped streamflow simulation model e g jakeman and hornberger 1993 concluded that the permissible model complexity contains around half a dozen parameters but not orders of magnitude higher e g fenicia et al 2014 found that simulating a complex double peaked hydrograph response in a headwater catchments in luxembourg required 11 parameters such relatively limited complexity for a semi distributed model may appear counterintuitive at first our explanation of this result is twofold first a semi distributed model can be considered as many lumped models operating in parallel but not all of the parameters that characterize these lumped models need to be spatially variable many of such parameters can share the same values or their spatial variability can be prescribed by some parameter regularization relationship that depends on a few global parameters in m hru3 lag2 only the groundwater parameters were kept independent but other parameters where either kept uniform e g the snow or soil related parameters or linked through some regularization relationship e g the routing parameters second hru model structures can be tailored to the dominant processes of individual hrus resulting in being simpler than a typical lumped model for example 2 of the 3 hrus of m hru3 lag2 were characterized just by two buckets as intended to model discharge with specific dynamics fast or slow the number of calibration parameters that results from our model application appears low compared to other studies for example pokhrel et al 2008 needed to estimate 858 parameters of the grid based sacsma model which were reduced to 33 overall parameters using parameter regionalization relationships foglia et al 2009 had 35 calibration parameters in their distributed version of topkapi samaniego et al 2010 related model parameters to observable characteristics and obtained 62 calibration parameters for the distributed mhm model the disparity between our work and these other studies may be explained by the fact that we tailored our bespoke model to a specific catchment and scale which enabled several simplifications a general purpose model as the ones in the studies mentioned above need to consider whatever process may be important in principle even if such processes may not be dominant in a given application understanding what to account for and what to ignore when developing a distributed model is an important question this paper and fm2022 proposed a new way to approach this question instead of starting by feeding a distributed model with data our expert driven approach looks at data first and only then starts the modeling process such informed analysis of the data helps resolve many hydrological modeling questions before the model structure is determined helping bring experimentalist insights into the initiation of the conceptual model construction process and execution of the model calibration approach although the ultimate model is specific to a given region and therefore not transferable to other places where other processes may dominate the model development approach is indeed exportable to other areas more generally we suggest a shift from the quest for a general model which may be an unattainable ideal given differences in model applications to the quest for general model development approaches which can systematically identify a suitable model for a given application our work shows that this can be possible at the regional scale and that expert knowledge supported by an experimentalist modeler dialog can facilitate this process 5 conclusions this study illustrated the development of a semi distributed conceptual model for streamflow simulation at 26 subcatchments within the moselle catchment this bespoke model was informed by a perceptual model for the same catchment developed in fm2022 the perceptual model used 5 model variants of increasing complexity designed to test specific model hypotheses we evaluated the 5 models in a space time validation hence using a set of subcatchments and a time period not used for calibration from a methodological perspective this study showed how the many decisions required for the development of a distributed model can be informed by a perceptual model in particular we showed how the understanding of landscape controls on streamflow spatial variability and how these vary spatially can be translated into model decisions via hrus model structural components and model parameter constraints our comparisons of the 5 model variants clarified the effect of individual model decisions on streamflow simulations and informed the ultimate model selection in particular this model comparison was able to i identify a distributed model in particular m hru3 lag2 that matched key streamflow signatures in space time validation namely streamflow average r 0 96 baseflow index r 0 86 and hydrograph lag time correct at 22 out of 26 subcatchments and ii justify model decisions such as the distribution of precipitation per subcatchment a landscape discretization based on bedrock permeability the particularization of hru model structures based on lithology driven dominant processes and a parameterization of lag functions based on topography and land use derived indices with 12 calibration parameters of which 5 are hru specific and the others global or uniform in all hrus our final conceptual model structure represented a parsimonious representation of streamflow generating processes in the moselle catchment we found that the added value of the conceptual model compared to the perceptual model alone was that it helped provide a unique catchment description that explained several traits of the spatial variability of subcatchment response while we acknowledge that our conceptual model is developed for an individual regional scale catchment and its scope is therefore limited to the context for which it was developed nevertheless the model development approach followed in this study is one that could be put into practice elsewhere we believe this approach could contribute to better understanding regional scale catchment variability and eventually bespoke model development approaches that go beyond the current focus on generalizable models credit authorship

equations of the 5 distributed models are summarized in the tables a1 a5 table a1 summarizes the water balance equations in particular m hru1 lag0 and m hru1 lag1 are both based on a single hru which is represented by a 3 reservoirs structure composed by the reservoirs ur unsaturated fr fast and sr slow ur splits the inflow p ur between a portion that is stored and eventually evaporates as e ur and a portion that eventually produces runoff q ur q ur is then partitioned between p fr and p sr which enter fr and sr respectively the outflows of fr and sr q fr and q sr are summed together and form the outflow of the individual hru q hru m hru2 lag1 and m hru2 lag2 both have 2 hrus high permeability hruh and medium low permeability hruml both hrus are described by the same 3 reservoirs structure described above m hru3 lag2 has 3 hrus high medium and low permeability hruh hrum and hrul respectively the hruh model structure excludes the fr reservoir the hrum model structure has both fr and sr while the hrul model structure excludes the sr reservoir table a2 describes the models constitutive functions with functions symbols defined in table a3 ur partitions incoming precipitation between a portion that is stored and outflow using a power function defined by a parameter β ur evaporation from ur is proportional to the potential evaporation with a parameter c e ur and approaches zero as the reservoir depletes depending on a smoothing parameter m ur the 3 reservoir structure partitions of the outflow from ur between the inflows to fr and sr depending on the parameter d fr is parameterized as a nonlinear reservoir which depends on a parameter k fr and a power α fr fixed at 2 hence a quadratic reservoir sr is a linear reservoir which depends on the parameter k sr the 2 reservoirs structures used for hruh and hrul in m hru3 lag2 parameterize both sr and fr as quadratic reservoirs table a4 describes the snow reservoir precipitation p is partitioned between a portion that is stored and rainfall q p wr rainfall q p wr depends on a temperature threshold t cp wr which is fixed at 0 degrees celsius snowmelt q m wr depends on a temperature threshold t cm wr which is fixed at 2 degrees celsius and on the degree day parameter k wr the temperature thresholds as well as the effective melting rate are smoothed using the method in kavetski and kuczera 2007 the inflow to ur is given by the sum of rainfall and snowmelt for the routing elements a triangular lag function similarly to the hbv model lindström et al 1997 is used this function is described in table a5 and depends on the time base parameter t l routing elements are not present in m hru1 lag0 the other models include the same number of routing elements and differ for the regularization relationship used to scale the time base parameters t l for the various lag functions m hru1 lag1 and m hru2 lag1 use a simpler parameterization where the scaling of the routing depends on drainage distance alone e g lerat et al 2012 incremental subcatchment routing elements cl we assume that the time parameter representing the routing of the incremental subcatchment i is related to its landscape properties by the following expression 9 t i cl a cl l dstd i top where a cl is a calibration parameter and l dstd top already defined in fm2022 indicates the maximum drainage distance of the incremental subcatchment river routing elements rl we assume that the time parameter of the lag functions representing the routing of the river stretch i which goes from the outlet of the subcatchment i indicated with a to the next downstream outlet indicated with b is related to landscape properties by the following expression 10 t i rl a rl l ab i where a rl is a calibration parameter and the symbol l ab already defined in fm2022 represents the drainage distance between the two outlets a and b m hru2 lag2 and m hru3 lag2 use a more complex parameterization of the regularization relationships motivated by the data analysis in the perceptual model which is described as follows incremental subcatchment routing elements cl we assume that the time parameter representing the routing of the incremental subcatchment i is related to its landscape properties by the following expression 11 t i cl a 1 cl a 2 cl l dstg i top l dev i lnd l sl 05 i top where a 1 cl and a 2 cl are calibration parameters and the symbols l dstg top l dev lnd and l sl 05 top already defined in fm2022 represent respectively the geometric distance the fraction of developed land use and the 5 quantile of the slope this expression corresponds to equation 10 in fm2022 river routing elements rl we assume that the time parameter of the lag functions representing the routing of the river stretch i which goes from the outlet of the subcatchment i indicated with a to the next downstream outlet indicated with b is related to landscape properties by the following expression t i rl a rl l ab i a ab i α where a rl is a calibration parameter and the symbols l ab a ab and α already defined in fm2022 represent respectively the distance along the river network between two points a and b the average area between the total subcatchments at a and b and the exponent constant fixed at 0 1 see fm2022 this expression corresponds to equation 12 in fm2022 the absence of feedbacks between landscape elements greatly

3742,moisture recycling an important component of regional precipitation is a key indicator of a region s ability to renew its water resources quantifying moisture recycling allows for a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal structure of the regional water balance therefore an observation and sampling network for precipitation soil samples plant stems and surface water was established in the qilian mountains a transition zone between the tibetan plateau and an arid region approximately 2749 samples were collected and analyzed for their isotopic compositions based on the craig gordon model and the three end member mixing model the evaporation transpiration and advection contributed 8 14 and 78 to precipitation respectively and the total contribution to local moisture recycling was equivalent to 71 mm of precipitation the evaporation fraction tended to decrease from the central qilian mountains to the surrounding areas whereas the transpiration fraction exhibited a decreasing trend from south to north in the south central qilian mountains if all of the moisture recycling precipitation is produced in the flow the water production is approximately 13 billion m3 which is approximately 87 of the average total annual runoff from the qilian mountains and twice the average total annual runoff of the three major inland river basins in the hexi corridor additionally altitude topography vegetation conditions and meteorological factors influence local moisture recycling the results showed that moisture recycling precipitation in cold regions is crucial to ecological stability and water resource supply this study demonstrates that good ecological conditions enhance moisture recycling improve the renewal capacity of water resources and support the stability and sustainable use of regional water resources therefore ecological protection remains an important support for sustainable development in the qilian mountains keywords local moisture recycling water resources stable isotope tracing qilian mountains 1 introduction precipitation is an input to the water cycle the most critical link in the hydrological process and an important component of regional water resources tandong et al 2013 moisture recycling refers to the contribution of moisture from terrestrial evaporation and transpiration to precipitation vander ent and savenije 2013 it includes moisture evaporated from the soil s surface water and plants via plant transpiration davie 2008 moisture recycling is a key indicator of a region s ability to renew its water resources and is an important component of regional precipitation and a key link in the water cycle and water balance in addition quantifying moisture recycling provides a crucial basis for the comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal structures of regional hydrological processes the study of precipitation vapor sources has been a topical issue for hydrologists especially for determining the contribution of water source vapors to regional precipitation and hydrology li et al 2019 pang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 precipitation water vapor consists of two parts advection water vapor and moisture recycling weizu et al 2011 moisture recycling is closely related to land air interaction and climate change and it is of great importance to regional water resource use and sustainable development especially in arid regions seneviratne et al 2010 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is measured by the moisture recycling rate froehlich et al 2008 which is a core variable in hydrological model studies and an important indicator of climate change moreover it is the scientific basis for the development of regional ecological protection policies vander ent et al 2010 with increasing regional evapotranspiration under climate warming many studies have confirmed the increased importance of the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation kong et al 2013 peng et al 2012 cui and li 2015 li et al 2016a b schlesinger and jasechko 2014 yamanaka et al 2007 quantifying the contribution of moisture recycling to regional precipitation will provide a theoretical basis for hydrological process simulation prediction and water resource adaptation studies and provide an important scientific basis for engineering construction agricultural and animal husbandry production and regional ecological protection the precise quantification of moisture recycling has been the focus of hydrological research since the 1990s using the conventional hydrometeorological model eltahir and bras 1994 savenije 1995 schar and luthi 1999 and classic binary water vapor balance models constructed by eltahir and bras eltahir and bras 1994 savenije 1995 developed a new model based on an exponential decrease in water vapor content with an iso rainfall line however this model s approach relies strictly on grid point data which makes it impossible to perform calculations in areas where data are difficult to obtain and even when data are available it is limited by various assumptions resulting in large errors vander ent et al 2010 in addition this approach cannot be easily extended to smaller regional scales and sub precipitation event scales without reducing the resolution and credibility of the results peng et al 2011 stable isotope tracing can compensate for the shortcomings of the hydrometeorological models and provide more accurate results stable isotopes of precipitation are important for determining the water vapor source and quantifying water vapor recirculation gat et al 1994 in particular d excess in precipitation is primarily influenced by meteorological conditions such as relative humidity sea temperature and wind speed in the source area and is a good tracer of water vapor sources wei et al 1994 different water vapor sources have unique stable isotope characteristics which provide a key basis for quantifying the contribution of moisture recycling li et al 2016a a stable isotope tracing model was applied in eastern china where monsoon moisture was the predominant contributor to summer precipitation the model was used to determine the water vapor sources of precipitation on the island of taiwan and their different hydrological effects peng et al 2016 in addition yu et al 2016 confirmed the shorter duration of the impact of monsoonal moisture and earlier retreat at the tingri station on the southeastern tibetan plateau using stable isotope tracing the water vapor source of precipitation was determined to be predominately from westerly air masses in the yushugou region of the tianshan mountains wang et al 2015 ocean originating air parcels comprised approximately 68 of all trajectories in the tianshan mountains and were categorized into five parcels and comprised five subgroups continent originating moisture was then further divided into three subgroups wang et al 2021 in the quanfuzhuang watershed the moisture mainly originates from five directions the southwestern indian ocean sw southeastern pacific ocean se northeastern inland ne the southern branch of the westerlies sb and the northern branch of the westerlies nb jiao et al 2020 in addition the stable isotope method confirmed that the tanggula mountains are an important boundary between the monsoon and non monsoon regions of the tibetan plateau tian et al 2007 based on the d excess record from ice cores in the tanggula mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau the effect of moisture recycling on precipitation has gradually increased since 1940 crawford et al 2013 precipitation on the tibetan plateau during the inter monsoon period is mainly influenced by moisture recycling yu et al 2016 and seasonal changes in precipitation stable isotopes indicate that moisture recycling has a significant effect on summer precipitation at the mado station on the eastern tibetan plateau ren et al 2013 moisture recycling is also an important source of summer precipitation in eastern inner mongolia yamanaka et al 2007 additionally the acceleration of moisture recycling under climate warming has been quantitatively assessed using water balance studies li et al 2016c shen et al 2015 ma et al 2012 cui et al 2009 yinghua and yanqing 2008 wang et al 2008 xu et al 2004 numaguti 1999 trenberth 1999 in summary stable isotope tracing has been applied to determine the moisture recycling rates in wet lake and arid zones but its application in the transition zone between the cold and arid regions is lacking owing to limited stable isotope data the qilian mountains are a transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the northwestern arid region of china and are an important ecological water storage area and watershed in northwest china ecologically these mountains function to protect the ecological stability of the hexi corridor regulate the ecological balance of the tibetan plateau prevent desertification erosion and sedimentation in the hexi corridor and maintain the stability of the corridor oasis precipitation in the qilian mountains plays an important regulatory role in runoff abundance oasis development and lake stability based on 23 extreme climate indices the results showed statistically significant climate warming in the qilian mountains from 1961 to 2017 lv et al 2019 in addition the warming trend in the qilian mountains has accelerated since 1985 therefore the potential evapotranspiration has been increasing over the past 50 years jia 2012 li et al 2019 simulation studies have confirmed a significant increase in actual evapotranspiration during 2003 2012 li et al 2014 owing to the extremely small catchment evapotranspiration in the qilian mountains is dominated by soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration with an average annual evapotranspiration of 515 mm tian et al 2013 observations from may to september in the grasslands confirmed that the evapotranspiration was 434 mm and 238 mm at 3000 m yang et al 2012 and 4200 m li et al 2016b respectively vegetation cover has continued to increase in the qilian mountains in recent years with the most significant increase in summer and autumn and a clear increasing trend of vegetation evapotranspiration chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 wu et al 2015 under these conditions the water vapor renewal rate has accelerated in the qilian mountains from 1960 to 2010 with the enhancement of water vapor utilization efficiency liang et al 2014a in addition studies have shown that the influence of water vapor advection on the water cycle continuously decreased in the qilian mountains against the background of increasing temperature and enhancing evapotranspiration while the effect of moisture recycling on regional water balance has become increasingly significant liang et al 2014b therefore there is a need to quantitatively identify whether the increased regional precipitation is due to the contribution of advection transported water vapor or that of moisture recycling this study was based on the analysis of 2749 samples in terms of precipitation surface water plant stem water and soil water and their isotopic composition the objectives of this study were to a determine the contribution of moisture recycling to regional precipitation and elucidate its influence on regional precipitation processes b determine the factors affecting the moisture recycling components and c identify the significance of water resources and their importance to regional ecological conservation from moisture recycling in the qilian mountains 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the qilian mountains 36 43 n 92 107 e are located on the northeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau at the intersection of the three major plateaus of qinghai tibet mengxin and loess these mountains form a transition zone between the qinghai tibet plateau and the arid northwest and consist of several mountains and wide valleys extending northwest southeast li et al 2016d the qilian mountains are an important part of china s alpine zone and are the only water supply area for inland rivers in the hexi corridor the mountain catchment is the primary water recharge area for the upper reaches of the yellow river the qilian mountains have a temperate continental climate with typical continental characteristics li et al 2016c li et al 2016d owing to the undulating terrain the climate is vertically zoned into desert semi arid steppe semi humid forest steppe and cold humid climates the moisture source is complex in the qilian mountains and is influenced by the warm and humid air currents delivered by the southeast monsoon and cold atlantic air currents the water cycle is also influenced by the indian ocean during summer annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 700 mm with more than half of this concentrated in may and august and with rainfall decreasing from southeast to northwest the annual average temperature in the qilian mountains is approximately 5 25 10 75 which varies considerably with altitude between 1961 and 2016 the average annual temperature and precipitation increased by 0 35 c 10a and 14 7 mm 10a respectively leading to a continuous shortening of the ablation period and an extension of the growing period 3 5 d 10a li et al 2019 the qilian mountains are the only water supply area for three arid inland rivers in the hexi corridor and are an important water recharge area for the upper reaches of the yellow river as well as the source of the alpine inland water system in qinghai province including the qinghai lake and hala lake basins the water system in the qilian mountains is distributed radially from a radiation center of approximately 99 e 38 20 n the main rivers in the area depend on precipitation and glacier snow meltwater to recharge the proportion of this meltwater increased from east to west while the inter annual variation in the runoff was small and there were significant seasonal and daily variations the river runoff in the western and middle sections of the qilian mountains has increased significantly since 1980 whereas the eastern section has shown a slightly decreasing trend dedong and qing 2018 2 2 sample collection and analysis precipitation samples 19 precipitation sample collection sites were deployed in the qilian mountains and a total 1310 groups samples have been collected during 2016 fig 1 each sample collector was placed on a roo a ftop 8 m above the ground and 1 m from the floor of the roof away from the surface soil and any potential pollutant sources sampling was done manually on an event basis using a wet collector which consisted of a 5 l polyethylene collecting flask at the bottom fitted with a polyethylene bottle l26cm in diameter the collected rainfall or snow was then loaded into pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles after each precipitation event the collectors flasks and funnels were deployed at the onset of each precipitation event and were retrieved immediately after the flasks were filled or after the rainfall stopped prior to the installation of collectors the funnels and flasks were carefully cleaned and dried in addition stringent sampling protocols were followed at all times during sample collection and handling to assure samples were not contaminated at the 0 1 ueq l level meteorological parameters such as precipitation wind speed and humidity were recorded simultaneously during the sample collection refer to our previous research for details gui et al 2020 soil

elevations were collected from rivers and tributaries during the study period table 1 a total of 23 samples from springs and 35 samples from reservoirs in the qilian mountains were collected in addition 28 well water samples were collected from the mountainous regions fig 1 for isotope analysis water was extracted from the soil and plant stems we used a cryogenic freezing vacuum extraction system li 2000 beijing liga united technology co ltd china to extract soil water to achieve complete extraction with high precision test tubes containing soil samples were installed on the extraction line and frozen in liquid nitrogen after 10 min the line was checked to ensure that there were no leaks after it was completely sealed the larger test tube was heated using a heating sleeve at 95 c and the smaller test tube was frozen with liquid nitrogen 196 oc water vapor was transferred from the larger test tube to the smaller one and condensed into ice owing to the temperature gradients the extraction process took 2 h and had an efficiency 98 soil and plant stem samples were first passed through a vacuum extraction system to obtain water and then analyzed for stable hydroxide isotope

δ a δ p k ε 1 1 0 3 â k ε where δa is isotopic compositions in atmospheric water vapor and δp is isotopic compositions in precipitation at the cloud base k is the adjusting parameter and ɛ is the equilibrium fractionation factor between water and vapor and can be calculated by ε α 1 α is the equilibrium fractionation factor 1 0 3 i n 2 α 1158 8 t 3 1 0 9 1620 1 t 2 1 0 6 794 84 t 1 0 3 161 04

evaporation line slope slel by the stable isotope values of river water resevitor water and spring water samples was confirmed and then calculations were repeated using k between 0 6 and 1 0 with step width of 0 0001 the final value of k was determined when the difference between slel and the measured lel slope was the lowest or k reached the boundary values 0 6 and 1 0 more details about the calculations were described by skrzypek et al 2015 the measured lel can be calculated as s lel h 1 0 318 ε h 2 δ a 2 δ p 2 ε 1 1 0 32 δ p h 1 0 32 ε h 18 δ a 18 δ p 18 ε 1 1 0 3 18 δ p where h is relative humidity and ɛ is the total fractionation factor defined as ε ε α ε k where kinetic fractionation factor ɛk is calculated as ε k 1 h θ n c d where the weighting value θ for small water body evaporation flux does not influence ambient humidity is 1 and for larger water body like the great lakes and the mediterranean sea is 0 5 the value n for a stable layer like soil and leaf cover is 1 and for a large open water body is 0 5 the values of cd are 25 1 for hydrogen and 28 5 for oxygen respectively araguaset al 2000 as suggested by skrzypek et al 2015 the values of h and n were both set

increase in precipitation and cryosphere melting under climate warming provides water for evapotranspiration in cold regions guodong and huijun 2013 yao et al 2013 as the thawing period of permafrost extends and the freezing period is pushed back the growing season of vegetation is extended and transpiration is enhanced li et al 2021 relevant studies have shown an increase in the evaporation precipitation and moisture recycling rates in northern china over the past 20 years kang wenhong et al 2005 the increased rate of evapotranspiration is 1 14 mm a in the qilian mountains during 2009 2018 lisha et al 2020 the annual mean temperature in china from 2000 to 2018 increased by approximately 0 63 and the annual precipitation and atmospheric water vapor increased by approximately 0 5 and 1 2 respectively relative to those of 1979 2000 the inflow and outflow of water vapor decreased and the precipitation recycling ratio increased by 10 9 su et al 2020 thus increased rates of evapotranspiration provide additional water vapor for moisture recycling in cold regions the contribution of water vapor from local evaporation to precipitation has increased in the qilian mountains in recent decades yin yunhe et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 the following stable isotope characteristics of precipitation reflect the significant contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in the qilian mountains 1 as shown in fig 2 a the intercept of the local meteoric water line lwml δd 7 92δ18o 14 01 is higher than that of the global meteoric water line gwml for precipitation events when the temperature is 0 c when t 0 c in the qilian mountains fig 2 whereas its slope is slightly lower than that of the gwml δd 8δ18o 10 precipitation events when t 0 c mainly occurred during the growing season from may to october characterized by high temperatures and increased evaporation in general the lwml has a lower slope and intercept in the arid region during summer and autumn precipitation the intercept of lwml is usually a good indicator of regional moisture recycling froehlich et al 2008 when stable isotopes of precipitation are affected by high moisture recycling they exhibit a relatively high intercept of lwml this feature indicates the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in the qilian mountains 2 on the inter annual scale the stable isotopes of precipitation showed a significant positive correlation with temperature exhibiting a clear temperature effect of δ18o 0 47 t 10 75 r2 0 37 in the qilian mountains gui et al 2020 however for precipitation events when the temperature was 10 c t 10 c this positive correlation was not observed fig 2b this indicates that the evaporation based enrichment of stable isotopes was offset to some extent by the depletion of stable isotopes due to moisture recycling moreover the moisture recycling effect gradually strengthens causing an increase in d excess thus there is no obvious inverse correlation between δ18o and d excess the same findings have been confirmed in the tianshan mountains pang et al 2011 3 as fig 2c shows the average δ18o and d excess of precipitation at 19 sampling stations show an inverse trend with an increase in altitude for precipitation events at t 10 c there are two possible reasons for this finding at lower elevation sites precipitation stable isotopes were influenced by strong subcloud evaporation processes leading to an increase in δ18o and a decrease in d excess as the altitude increased the moisture recycling effect gradually increased and caused an increase in d excess and a decrease in δ18o 3 2 seasonal variation in moisture recycling fraction the results of the stable isotope tracer modeling indicated that the evaporation fraction accounted for approximately 8 of the precipitation that occurred during the growing season in the qilian mountains equal to 27 mm of precipitation the corresponding contribution rates in may june july august september and october were approximately 5 8 11 12 7 and 6 or 1 2 mm 6 2 mm 10 1 mm 9 6 mm 1 8 mm and 1 3 mm of the monthly precipitation respectively fig 3 in may the contribution of the evaporation fraction to precipitation was generally low with a relatively even distribution ranging from 3 to 9 5 and the maximum was 9 5 and 7 5 for gangcha and tianjun stations respectively on the southern slope of the qilian mountains fig 3 with the general temperature increase in june the contribution of the evaporation fraction increased in the study region but varied significantly from station to station reaching a maximum of 14 8 at gangcha station on the south slope and a minimum of 3 7 at jiayuguan station on the north slope fig 3 the evaporation fraction was generally higher in july and august and the regional differences were relatively high among the 19 stations and the contribution rate was still higher in the southern slope than that in the northern slope of the qilian mountains for example the evaporation fraction at jiayuguan and gulang stations was only 4 8 and 5 on the northern slope in july respectively and 20 8 and 19 7 at gangcha and tianjun stations on the southern slope respectively this contribution declined significantly in september and october with the highest values of 14 5 and 13 6 occurring at the tianjun and gangcha stations respectively fig 3 as fig 4 shows the monthly transpiration fraction in may june july august september and october accounts for approximately 8 14 14 21 21 and 8 of the corresponding monthly precipitations or 1 9 mm 10 8 mm 19 3 mm 16 8 mm 2 1 mm and 1 7 mm respectively in summary the contribution of the transpiration fraction was approximately 14 throughout the growing season in the study region which was equivalent to 44 mm precipitation in addition the transpiration fraction varied considerably over the specific months in may the transpiration fraction was generally low and the contribution was only 3 2 and 2 3 at the gulang and jiayuguan stations in the lower altitude region near the hexi corridor in june during the growing season the increase in temperature and precipitation led to a significant increase in transpiration jiayuguan station had the smallest transpiration fraction reaching an 8 contribution during this period the transpiration fraction further increased in july and reached a maximum of 27 45 at tianjun station in august in september and october there was a gradual decrease at the end of the growing season in summary during the growing season moisture recycling accounted for approximately 22 and contributed 71 mm to the total precipitation in the qilian mountains there was significant seasonal variation in moisture recycling among the 19 stations during the growing season at most sampling stations the moisture recycling fraction increased from may reached a maximum in august and then decreased this trend is consistent with seasonal trends in temperature and evapotranspiration intensity 3 3 spatial distribution as fig 5 shows the evaporation and transpiration fractions were the highest in the central part compared to those in the eastern and western qilian mountains in the central section of the qilian mountains the monthly moisture recycling rates were 14 24 38 38 19 and 18 in may june july august september and october respectively and the corresponding values were 13 21 27 30 14 and 12 in the eastern section and 11 17 26 30 13 and 12 respectively fig 5 interestingly both precipitation and the contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation displayed the same seasonal variations in the eastern and central qilian mountains while the maximum contribution rate from moisture recycling lagged one month behind the maximum precipitation this reflects the marked regional differences in moisture recycling in the qilian mountains the evaporation and transpiration fractions on the southern slope were higher than those on the northern slope of the qilian mountains fig 6 the monthly evaporation fractions from may to october were approximately 5 0 9 9 7 10 9 6 6 and 10 5 for the northern slope and approximately 6 3 9 6 12 9 13 8 9 4 and 7 6 for the southern slope respectively in terms of the transpiration fraction the corresponding values were 7 4 12 6 20 1 10 9 7 5 and 7 5 for the northern slope and 9 0 16 1 23 7 24 5 11 1 and 8 8 respectively for the southern slope for stations on the southern slope the contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation was higher than 20 at the gangcha station located on the edge of qinghai lake and the moisture recycling contribution reached 48 75 in august in contrast the contribution rate was relatively low on the northern slope dropping below 20 at the jiayuguan station in august overall moisture recycling accounted for approximately 21 of the precipitation on the northern slope of the qilian mountains which is equivalent to 66 mm of precipitation the corresponding value for the southern slope was approximately 26 which is equivalent to 85 mm of precipitation fig 6 these differences also reflect the significant variation in moisture recycling in the study region under different climates and environments a similar finding was confirmed for the central tibetan plateau where there are prominent regional differences in the local moisture recycling ratio wdl 31 6 4 8 fhs 18 6 3 7 tth 14 3 8 and tgl 21 7 3 9 zhu et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the evaporation fraction tends to decrease from the central qilian mountains to the surrounding areas with higher values in the qinghai lake and hala lake basins whereas the lower values were distributed in the hexi corridor region additionally both growing season and month exhibited the same spatial pattern of the evaporation fraction there are three possible reasons for this finding the first is the relatively isolated terrain in the central qilian mountains and in the qinghai lake and hala lake basins with high mountains surrounding the low lying central section is favorable for the accumulation of local evaporation water vapor and limits the distribution of water vapor second the lake surface has a stronger evaporation capacity than other surfaces xinyu and bing 2021 confirmed that the annual evaporation of qinghai lake is 40 1 108 m3 based on a water balance model this ensures an abundance of local water vapor third there are differences in the climate and environment of the qilian mountains with high temperatures and low precipitation near the hexi corridor as fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the transpiration fraction is different from that of the evaporation fraction exhibiting a decreasing trend in the transpiration fraction from south to north in the south central qilian mountains in addition the transpiration fraction increased from northwest to southeast in the study region during may june august and october while the growing season spatial pattern was evident during july and september this can be explained by three potential factors first this spatial variation may reflect the influence of vegetation conditions juan et al 2019 confirmed that the average annual normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in the qilian mountains decreases gradually from east to west with the most vegetation growing in the southeastern qilian mountains the coverage of forest grassland and other vegetation types has increased over the past 20 years second this reflects the influence of vegetation evapotranspiration tian et al 2013 reported that evapotranspiration increases from the gobi desert 82 mm a to the qilian mountains 515 mm a this trend is closely related to the land cover and climatic conditions in the study region forests had the highest evapotranspiration 588 mm followed by grasslands 308 mm farmlands 225 mm and desert lands 160 mm the forests are mainly distributed in the eastern and southeastern qilian mountains third this trend reflects the influence of the local topography the intermountain basin qinghai lake and hala lake in the south central qilian mountains and the river valley areas datong river and huangshui river in the southeastern qilian mountains are most conducive to moisture recycling 4 discussion 4 1 contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation and its influence the above analysis indicates that the fractions from advection evaporation and transpiration in precipitation were approximately 78 8 and 14 respectively in the qilian mountains in addition the transpiration fraction in the study area was higher than the area s evaporation fraction peng et al 2011 confirmed that the transpiration fraction accounts for most local moisture recycling in taiwan and china whereas the evaporation fraction accounts for only a small proportion thus the transpiration fraction is an important factor influencing the local microclimate and precipitation using observations from 81 stations worldwide schlesinger and jasechko 2014 reported that transpiration dominates the local moisture recycling process on a global scale and the contribution of the transpiration fraction to precipitation was 39 10 accounting for 61 15 of the local moisture recycling recent observations have confirmed this in different climatic zones around the globe hu et al 2014 found that in the semi arid climate zone of china the transpiration fraction accounts for 83 of the moisture recycling in the saharan climate zone the transpiration fraction accounts for 85 of the moisture recycling yepeza et al 2003 in the semi arid mediterranean climate zone williams et al 2004 the transpiration fraction accounts for 69 86 of the moisture recycling during irrigation and 100 without irrigation in the subalpine monsoon climate zone the forest evapotranspiration water vapor accounted for 75 66 and 97 of the evapotranspiration water vapor on june 21 24 and 25 2006 respectively xu et al 2008 in the temperate maritime climate zone of europe the transpiration fraction accounts for 62 of the moisture recycling in august november and its contribution ranges from 0 to 89 on a daily scale aemisegger et al 2014 observational studies in the xishuangbanna region of yunnan china confirmed that dry season stratospheric fog is mainly caused by local transpiration water vapor zhong et al 2007 in summary the local moisture recycling and precipitation of the qilian mountains are mainly supported by local transpiration water vapor but the detailed mechanism still needs further research on a global scale the influence of moisture recycling on regional precipitation has also been explored and the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is approximately 39 with vegetation transpiration accounting for approximately 61 of global moisture recycling he and richards 2016 evaporation from the land surface has a significant effect on precipitation in eurasia where soil moisture supply evaporation is recharged by atmospheric precipitation numaguti 1999 mountain moisture recycling often creates precipitation at higher elevations allowing close ecohydrological links between subalpine forest ecosystems and alpine meadow ecosystems cui et al 2009 in the amazon basin the contribution of moisture recycling in the partially wetted area to regional precipitation is 25 35 eltahir and bras 1994 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in the alps is 16 froehlich et al 2008 in addition moisture recycling has become an important component of regional precipitation in lake areas with moisture recycling rates of 16 50 in lake ihorty madagascar vallet et al 2008 10 18 in lake michigan usa bowen et al 2012 and 5 16 in the great lakes region of north america gat et al 1994 machavaram et al 1995 as shown in fig 9 and table 2 previous studies have confirmed the significant contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in china the contribution rate displayed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest in china and decreased from the tibetan plateau to the northwestern arid region the qilian mountains form a part of the transitional zone in china from south to north moisture recycling rates reach a maximum of 61 and 55 in sichuan and chongqing respectively wu et al 2021 in taiwan and china the contribution of moisture recycling to annual precipitation in mountainous areas is 37 compared to 31 in plateau areas peng et al 2011 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is approximately 20 and 15 in the middle reaches of the yangtze and yellow rivers respectively xu et al 2004 in the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau the monthly average contribution of evaporation from lakes to local precipitation is 35 2 wu et al 2019 while the contribution is 28 4 31 1 at namucuo lake xu et al 2011 moisture recycling contributes to approximately 22 of the precipitation in the qilian mountains in arid northwestern china this contribution is 16 2 with evaporation and transpiration contributing 9 and 10 3 respectively for larger oases such as urumqi city relatively smaller oases such as shihezi city contribute approximately 5 wang et al 2016 a study in the badain jaran desert showed that the moisture recycling fraction in the lake area is 10 3 10 9 higher than that of the mountainous area le et al 2020 4 2 influencing factors of moisture recycling altitude affects moisture recycling as listed in table 3 the contribution of both the evaporation and transpiration fractions to precipitation increased with altitude in the qilian mountains below 4000 m this trend was more obvious in august the contribution rate of the evaporation fraction increased from 5 5 altitude 2000 m to 8 4 2000 altitude 3000 m and then increased to 15 7 3000 altitude 4000 m showing an overall increase of 10 2 the transpiration fraction increased from 14 a 2000 m to 20 7 2000 altitude 3000 m and then increased to 22 9 3000 altitude 4000 m showing an overall increase of 8 9 the contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation increased from 19 5 altitude 2000 m to 29 1 2000 altitude 3000 m and then increased to 38 6 3000 altitude 4000 m showing an overall increase of 19 1 however there was a decreasing trend in the evaporation fraction when the altitude was 4000 m for example the monthly evaporation fraction at altitudes of 3000 4000 m was 6 2 9 3 14 1 15 7 9 9 and 7 5 from may to october but at altitudes higher than 4000 m the monthly evaporation fractions were 6 2 9 1 12 3 15 8 7 and 5 7 respectively showing a decrease of 0 0 2 1 8 0 7 1 2 and 1 8 respectively the transpiration fraction displayed an increasing trend with increasing altitude above 4000 m from may to october the monthly contribution rates of transpiration were 8 5 14 8 23 8 22 9 9 4 and 8 6 respectively between 3000 and 4000 m however the monthly contribution of the transpiration fraction was 9 14 7 26 23 2 11 5 and 10 8 above 4000 m respectively indicating a difference of 0 5 0 1 2 2 0 3 2 1 and 2 2 respectively in summary an altitude of 4000 m is a significant boundary for moisture recycling in the qilian mountains and moisture recycling shows a significant increasing trend as the altitude increases in vegetation zones below 4000 m but exhibits a stable or even decreasing trend in the cold desert belt with glaciers and snow above 4000 m topography also affects moisture recycling as mentioned above the higher contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation occurred predominantly in the southeastern qilian mountains the intermountain basin qinghai lake and hala lake and the river valley areas datong river and huangshui river wu et al 2021 found that basin topography has a higher moisture recycling rate than other topographic areas a typical example is the sichuan basin a low lying basin surrounded by high mountains where there is an accumulation of local water vapor and the maximum moisture recycling rate is 58 to some extent the size of the study region affects moisture recycling rates when the study area was selected as a single grid point the moisture recycling rate in the middle and lower reaches of the river ranged from 4 to 10 and when the study area was expanded to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the moisture recycling rate increased to ranging from 25 to 35 zhu 2019 trenberth 1999 showed that moisture recycling rates increase with the expansion of the study area and are correlated with seasonal and interannual climate change the subsurface is also an important factor influencing moisture recycling yang et al 2018 found that the catchment area plays a more important role than the temperature in the functioning of moisture recycling in the qinghai tibet plateau and the evaporation capacity of the water surface is stronger than that of the bare ground which results in a lake area having a higher moisture recycling fraction good vegetation cover also promotes moisture recycling by strengthening evapotranspiration li et al 2016a the spatial pattern of moisture recycling especially the transpiration fraction is related to the vegetation conditions as fig 10 a shows the annual mean ndvi decreases from east to west in the qilian mountains during 2000 2018 and the eastern part has the largest ndvi value with the main vegetation types being forest alpine grassland and meadow the ndvi is also higher in the central qilian mountains where the main vegetation type is alpine meadow and typical grassland in the western section which is dominated by desert grassland cold desert belt and bare land the annual mean ndvi was relatively lower for vegetation cover the highest values occurred in the eastern and southeastern qilian mountains with higher values in the central and north central sections and lower values in the western qilian mountains fig 10b in addition the vegetation ndvi has increased over the past 30 years in the qilian mountains chen et al 2015 liu et al 2011 li et al 2021 the largest ndvi occurred in the altitude range of 2000 3900 m in the qilian mountains and the ndvi significantly decreased when the altitude was 3900 m fig 11 this is consistent with the elevation distribution trend of the transpiration fraction thus vegetation conditions are an important factor affecting moisture recycling in addition to the influence of elevation topography and vegetation conditions meteorological factors also influence local moisture recycling the relationships between moisture recycling and temperature precipitation and relative humidity were analyzed in the qilian mountains table 4 the following conclusions were drawn there is a negative correlation between temperature and moisture recycling which means that the contribution rate decreases as temperature increases this indicates that the saturated water vapor pressure also decreases as the temperature increases inhibiting cloud formation and precipitation therefore the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increases as altitude increases decreasing temperature and increasing saturated water vapor pressure are more conducive to the occurrence of precipitation at higher altitudes with the same water vapor content in july and august there was a significant positive correlation between precipitation and moisture recycling this reflects greater precipitation with an increase in the contribution from moisture recycling especially in the high rainfall season the relative humidity was positively correlated with moisture recycling this indicates that the higher the relative humidity is the higher the saturated water vapor pressure is which is conducive to the formation of precipitation from moisture recycling vapor and vice versa these results indicate that temperature and relative humidity are the main meteorological factors affecting moisture recycling thus moisture recycling is influenced by many factors and different factors may interact with each other the detailed mechanism of moisture recycling needs to be further explored 4 3 significance of water resources for moisture recycling the qilian mountains are an important recharge area for the hexi inland water system and the upper reaches of the yellow river the oasis area in the hexi corridor is an important irrigated agricultural area in china with a cropland area of 74 9 104 hm2 in 2017 which watered land accounted for approximately 87 the total volume of water resources was 77 74 108 m3 in the hexi corridor and approximately 90 of the water resources were mainly used for agriculture and the total grain production was up to 315 5 104 tons xu 2020 thus the qilian mountains are important for the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in the hexi corridor and the ecological stability of the entire oasis region the qilian mountain area covers an area of 18 3 104 km2 and the contribution of local moisture recycling to precipitation is approximately 22 throughout the growing season which is equivalent to 71 mm of precipitation it is assumed that all of this precipitation is produced inflow and the water production is approximately 13 billion m3 which is approximately 87 of the average total annual runoff 15 billion m3 from the qilian mountains and twice the average total annual runoff of the three major inland river basins 6 566 billion m3 in the hexi corridor these characteristics indicate that moisture recycling is a very important water resource especially in arid regions as the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the arid region the qilian mountains provide water for three inland basins in arid regions serving nearly 5 million people in the hexi corridor and a large amount of ecological water to maintain the ecological stability of the oases more importantly the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is a key indicator of regional water resource renewal capacity which is of great importance to the sustainable utilization and development of water resources as shown in fig 12 this study reflects the importance of ecological conservation in supporting moisture recycling first ecological protection will achieve ecological stability and vegetation restoration which in turn will enhance the ecological barrier effect second good ecological conditions will enhance moisture recycling in turn improving the renewal capacity of water resources and provide important support for the stability and sustainable use of regional water resources once the ecology is damaged it will affect ecological security and regional water resource supply in addition the contribution of vegetation transpiration to precipitation is relatively high in the qilian mountains which also confirms that good ecological protection is vital to stabilizing and enhancing the contribution of moisture recycling the results also showed that moisture recycling precipitation in cold regions is an important link for ecological stability and sustainable water resource supply in arid regions therefore ecological protection supports sustainable development in the qilian mountains environmental protection needs to be enhanced in the qilian mountains by implementing high level ecological design guidelines and stronger protection policies enhancing the support for scientific and technological development building a public catchment protection model strengthening legislation increasing funding and improving overall management li et al 2021 protecting the ecology of the qilian mountains ensures the security and stability of the ecological barrier and sustainable supply of regional water resources 5 conclusions based on the isotopic data of 1310 precipitation samples 1020 soil water samples 215 surface water samples and 204 plant stem water samples this study quantified the fractions of contributions from terrestrial evaporation and transpiration moisture to local precipitation in the qilian mountains the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the arid region of northwestern china under the strengthening of evapotranspiration with climate warming the occurrence of moisture recycling has been confirmed by lwml temperature effect altitude variation of δ18o and d excess when the temperature is 0 c moisture recycling and advection in the study area accounted for 22 and 78 of precipitation from may to october respectively based on the stable isotope tracing models and the transpiration fraction approximately 14 was higher than the evaporation fraction approximately 8 specifically the local evaporation fraction contributed approximately 27 mm to precipitation the corresponding value for the transpiration fraction was approximately 44 mm and the moisture recycling increased from may reaching a maximum in august and then decreasing throughout the growing season in terms of spatial distribution the evaporation fraction tended to decrease from the central qilian mountains to the surrounding areas whereas the transpiration fraction exhibited a decreasing trend from south to north in the south central qilian mountains overall moisture recycling accounts for 21 and 26 of the precipitation in the northern and southern slopes respectively which is equivalent to 66 mm and 85 mm precipitation the qilian mountains are the transition zone for the spatial pattern of the contribution rate from moisture recycling in china altitude topography vegetation conditions and meteorological factors were the main factors affecting local moisture recycling an altitude of 4000 m is a significant boundary for moisture recycling in the qilian mountains and moisture recycling showed a significant increasing trend with altitude below 4000 m but exhibited a stable or even decreasing trend above 4000 m a higher contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation occurred in the intermountain basin qinghai and hala lakes and river valley areas datong and huangshui rivers of the qilian mountains the spatial pattern of moisture recycling especially the transpiration fraction is also influenced by vegetation cover and ndvi variation in the qilian mountains the contribution rate decreased with increasing temperature owing to the decreased saturated water vapor pressure which inhibited cloud formation and precipitation a higher relative humidity is conducive to the formation of precipitation from moisture recycling vapor and vice versa the qilian mountains are an important recharge area for the hexi inland water system which supports irrigated agriculture in the hexi corridor and for the ecological stability of the entire oasis region if all of the moisture recycling precipitation is produced inflow water production is approximately 13 billion m3 which is approximately 87 of the average total annual runoff from the qilian mountains and twice the average total annual runoff of the three major inland river basins in the hexi corridor moisture recycling precipitation is important for ecological stability and sustainable water resource supply in cold arid regions in addition this study shows that good ecological conditions will enhance moisture recycling which will improve the renewal capacity of water resources and support the stability and sustainable use of regional water resources therefore ecological protection remains an aspect of sustainable development in the qilian mountains ecological protection needs to be enhanced in the qilian mountains to stabilize local moisture recycling and the renewal capacity of regional water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

understanding of the spatial and temporal structure of the regional water balance therefore an observation and sampling network for precipitation soil samples plant stems and surface water was established in the qilian mountains a transition zone between the tibetan plateau and an arid region approximately 2749 samples were collected and analyzed for their isotopic compositions based on the craig gordon model and the three end member mixing model the evaporation transpiration and advection contributed 8 14 and 78 to precipitation respectively and the total contribution to local moisture recycling was equivalent to 71 mm of precipitation the evaporation fraction tended to decrease from the central qilian mountains to the surrounding areas whereas the transpiration fraction exhibited a decreasing trend from south to north in the south central qilian mountains if all of the moisture recycling precipitation is produced in the flow the water production is approximately 13 billion m3 which is approximately 87 of the average total annual runoff from the qilian mountains and twice the average total annual runoff of the three major inland river basins in the hexi corridor additionally altitude topography vegetation conditions and meteorological factors influence local moisture recycling the results showed that moisture recycling precipitation in cold regions is crucial to ecological stability and water resource supply this study demonstrates that good ecological conditions enhance moisture recycling improve the renewal capacity of water resources and support the stability and sustainable use of regional water resources therefore ecological protection remains an important support for sustainable development in the qilian mountains keywords local moisture recycling water resources stable isotope tracing qilian mountains 1 introduction precipitation is an input to the water cycle the most critical link in the hydrological process and an important component of regional water resources tandong et al 2013 moisture recycling refers to the contribution of moisture from terrestrial evaporation and transpiration to precipitation vander ent and savenije 2013 it includes moisture evaporated from the soil s surface water and plants via plant transpiration davie 2008 moisture recycling is a key indicator of a region s ability to renew its water resources and is an important component of regional precipitation and a key link in the water cycle and water balance in addition quantifying moisture recycling provides a crucial basis for the comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal structures of regional hydrological processes the study of precipitation vapor sources has been a topical issue for hydrologists especially for determining the contribution of water source vapors to regional precipitation and hydrology li et al 2019 pang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 precipitation water vapor consists of two parts advection water vapor and moisture recycling weizu et al 2011 moisture recycling is closely related to land air interaction and climate change and it is of great importance to regional water resource use and sustainable development especially in arid regions seneviratne et al 2010 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is measured by the moisture recycling rate froehlich et al 2008 which is a core variable in hydrological model studies and an important indicator of climate change moreover it is the scientific basis for the development of regional ecological protection policies vander ent et al 2010 with increasing regional evapotranspiration under climate warming many studies have confirmed the increased importance of the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation kong et al 2013 peng et al 2012 cui and li 2015 li et al 2016a b schlesinger and jasechko 2014 yamanaka et al 2007 quantifying the contribution of moisture recycling to regional precipitation will provide a theoretical basis for hydrological process simulation prediction and water resource adaptation studies and provide an important scientific basis for engineering construction agricultural and animal husbandry production and regional ecological protection the precise quantification of moisture recycling has been the focus of hydrological research since the 1990s using the conventional hydrometeorological model eltahir and bras 1994 savenije 1995 schar and luthi 1999 and classic binary water vapor balance models constructed by eltahir and bras eltahir and bras 1994 savenije 1995 developed a new model based on an exponential decrease in water vapor content with an iso rainfall line however this model s approach relies strictly on grid point data which makes it impossible to perform calculations in areas where data are difficult to obtain and even when data are available it is limited by various assumptions resulting in large errors vander ent et al 2010 in addition this approach cannot be easily extended to smaller regional scales and sub precipitation event scales without reducing the resolution and credibility of the results peng et al 2011 stable isotope tracing can compensate for the shortcomings of the hydrometeorological models and provide more accurate results stable isotopes of precipitation are important for determining the water vapor source and quantifying water vapor recirculation gat et al 1994 in particular d excess in precipitation is primarily influenced by meteorological conditions such as relative humidity sea temperature and wind speed in the source area and is a good tracer of water vapor sources wei et al 1994 different water vapor sources have unique stable isotope characteristics which provide a key basis for quantifying the contribution of moisture recycling li et al 2016a a stable isotope tracing model was applied in eastern china where monsoon moisture was the predominant contributor to summer precipitation the model was used to determine the water vapor sources of precipitation on the island of taiwan and their different hydrological effects peng et al 2016 in addition yu et al 2016 confirmed the shorter duration of the impact of monsoonal moisture and earlier retreat at the tingri station on the southeastern tibetan plateau using stable isotope tracing the water vapor source of precipitation was determined to be predominately from westerly air masses in the yushugou region of the tianshan mountains wang et al 2015 ocean originating air parcels comprised approximately 68 of all trajectories in the tianshan mountains and were categorized into five parcels and comprised five subgroups continent originating moisture was then further divided into three subgroups wang et al 2021 in the quanfuzhuang watershed the moisture mainly originates from five directions the southwestern indian ocean sw southeastern pacific ocean se northeastern inland ne the southern branch of the westerlies sb and the northern branch of the westerlies nb jiao et al 2020 in addition the stable isotope method confirmed that the tanggula mountains are an important boundary between the monsoon and non monsoon regions of the tibetan plateau tian et al 2007 based on the d excess record from ice cores in the tanggula mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau the effect of moisture recycling on precipitation has gradually increased since 1940 crawford et al 2013 precipitation on the tibetan plateau during the inter monsoon period is mainly influenced by moisture recycling yu et al 2016 and seasonal changes in precipitation stable isotopes indicate that moisture recycling has a significant effect on summer precipitation at the mado station on the eastern tibetan plateau ren et al 2013 moisture recycling is also an important source of summer precipitation in eastern inner mongolia yamanaka et al 2007 additionally the acceleration of moisture recycling under climate warming has been quantitatively assessed using water balance studies li et al 2016c shen et al 2015 ma et al 2012 cui et al 2009 yinghua and yanqing 2008 wang et al 2008 xu et al 2004 numaguti 1999 trenberth 1999 in summary stable isotope tracing has been applied to determine the moisture recycling rates in wet lake and arid zones but its application in the transition zone between the cold and arid regions is lacking owing to limited stable isotope data the qilian mountains are a transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the northwestern arid region of china and are an important ecological water storage area and watershed in northwest china ecologically these mountains function to protect the ecological stability of the hexi corridor regulate the ecological balance of the tibetan plateau prevent desertification erosion and sedimentation in the hexi corridor and maintain the stability of the corridor oasis precipitation in the qilian mountains plays an important regulatory role in runoff abundance oasis development and lake stability based on 23 extreme climate indices the results showed statistically significant climate warming in the qilian mountains from 1961 to 2017 lv et al 2019 in addition the warming trend in the qilian mountains has accelerated since 1985 therefore the potential evapotranspiration has been increasing over the past 50 years jia 2012 li et al 2019 simulation studies have confirmed a significant increase in actual evapotranspiration during 2003 2012 li et al 2014 owing to the extremely small catchment evapotranspiration in the qilian mountains is dominated by soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration with an average annual evapotranspiration of 515 mm tian et al 2013 observations from may to september in the grasslands confirmed that the evapotranspiration was 434 mm and 238 mm at 3000 m yang et al 2012 and 4200 m li et al 2016b respectively vegetation cover has continued to increase in the qilian mountains in recent years with the most significant increase in summer and autumn and a clear increasing trend of vegetation evapotranspiration chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 wu et al 2015 under these conditions the water vapor renewal rate has accelerated in the qilian mountains from 1960 to 2010 with the enhancement of water vapor utilization efficiency liang et al 2014a in addition studies have shown that the influence of water vapor advection on the water cycle continuously decreased in the qilian mountains against the background of increasing temperature and enhancing evapotranspiration while the effect of moisture recycling on regional water balance has become increasingly significant liang et al 2014b therefore there is a need to quantitatively identify whether the increased regional precipitation is due to the contribution of advection transported water vapor or that of moisture recycling this study was based on the analysis of 2749 samples in terms of precipitation surface water plant stem water and soil water and their isotopic composition the objectives of this study were to a determine the contribution of moisture recycling to regional precipitation and elucidate its influence on regional precipitation processes b determine the factors affecting the moisture recycling components and c identify the significance of water resources and their importance to regional ecological conservation from moisture recycling in the qilian mountains 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the qilian mountains 36 43 n 92 107 e are located on the northeastern edge of the qinghai tibet plateau at the intersection of the three major plateaus of qinghai tibet mengxin and loess these mountains form a transition zone between the qinghai tibet plateau and the arid northwest and consist of several mountains and wide valleys extending northwest southeast li et al 2016d the qilian mountains are an important part of china s alpine zone and are the only water supply area for inland rivers in the hexi corridor the mountain catchment is the primary water recharge area for the upper reaches of the yellow river the qilian mountains have a temperate continental climate with typical continental characteristics li et al 2016c li et al 2016d owing to the undulating terrain the climate is vertically zoned into desert semi arid steppe semi humid forest steppe and cold humid climates the moisture source is complex in the qilian mountains and is influenced by the warm and humid air currents delivered by the southeast monsoon and cold atlantic air currents the water cycle is also influenced by the indian ocean during summer annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 700 mm with more than half of this concentrated in may and august and with rainfall decreasing from southeast to northwest the annual average temperature in the qilian mountains is approximately 5 25 10 75 which varies considerably with altitude between 1961 and 2016 the average annual temperature and precipitation increased by 0 35 c 10a and 14 7 mm 10a respectively leading to a continuous shortening of the ablation period and an extension of the growing period 3 5 d 10a li et al 2019 the qilian mountains are the only water supply area for three arid inland rivers in the hexi corridor and are an important water recharge area for the upper reaches of the yellow river as well as the source of the alpine inland water system in qinghai province including the qinghai lake and hala lake basins the water system in the qilian mountains is distributed radially from a radiation center of approximately 99 e 38 20 n the main rivers in the area depend on precipitation and glacier snow meltwater to recharge the proportion of this meltwater increased from east to west while the inter annual variation in the runoff was small and there were significant seasonal and daily variations the river runoff in the western and middle sections of the qilian mountains has increased significantly since 1980 whereas the eastern section has shown a slightly decreasing trend dedong and qing 2018 2 2 sample collection and analysis precipitation samples 19 precipitation sample collection sites were deployed in the qilian mountains and a total 1310 groups samples have been collected during 2016 fig 1 each sample collector was placed on a roo a ftop 8 m above the ground and 1 m from the floor of the roof away from the surface soil and any potential pollutant sources sampling was done manually on an event basis using a wet collector which consisted of a 5 l polyethylene collecting flask at the bottom fitted with a polyethylene bottle l26cm in diameter the collected rainfall or snow was then loaded into pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles after each precipitation event the collectors flasks and funnels were deployed at the onset of each precipitation event and were retrieved immediately after the flasks were filled or after the rainfall stopped prior to the installation of collectors the funnels and flasks were carefully cleaned and dried in addition stringent sampling protocols were followed at all times during sample collection and handling to assure samples were not contaminated at the 0 1 ueq l level meteorological parameters such as precipitation wind speed and humidity were recorded simultaneously during the sample collection refer to our previous research for details gui et al 2020 soil water samples in summer and autumn during the main moisture recycling period we dug soil profiles with a depth of 100 cm at 19 fixed stations similar to precipitation collection points with a total of 114 soil profiles an additional 90 soil profiles were sampled at different elevations during the growing season in 2017 table 1 a total of 1020 soil water samples were collected monthly during may october from forests scrublands grasslands and croplands from 204 soil profiles each section was divided into five layers with a boundary of 20 cm plant stem water samples samples from forests scrublands grasslands and croplands were collected from different landscapes including alpine meadow belt alpine grassland belt alpine forest belt alpine farmland and farmland at various elevations in the qilian mountains table 1 a total of 204 vegetation stem water samples from 204 soil profile sites were collected fig 1 surface water samples a total of 129 surface river samples from different elevations were collected from rivers and tributaries during the study period table 1 a total of 23 samples from springs and 35 samples from reservoirs in the qilian mountains were collected in addition 28 well water samples were collected from the mountainous regions fig 1 for isotope analysis water was extracted from the soil and plant stems we used a cryogenic freezing vacuum extraction system li 2000 beijing liga united technology co ltd china to extract soil water to achieve complete extraction with high precision test tubes containing soil samples were installed on the extraction line and frozen in liquid nitrogen after 10 min the line was checked to ensure that there were no leaks after it was completely sealed the larger test tube was heated using a heating sleeve at 95 c and the smaller test tube was frozen with liquid nitrogen 196 oc water vapor was transferred from the larger test tube to the smaller one and condensed into ice owing to the temperature gradients the extraction process took 2 h and had an efficiency 98 soil and plant stem samples were first passed through a vacuum extraction system to obtain water and then analyzed for stable hydroxide isotope concentrations stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation and soil water samples were analyzed at the key laboratory of eco hydrology of the inland river basin at the chinese academy of sciences using a liquid water stable isotope analyzer model dlt 100 los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa the accuracies of 18o 16o and d h were 0 2 and 0 5 respectively for plant stem water samples the δd measurements were performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x 7 series thermo scientific waltham ma usa and δ18o using a mat 253 mass spectrometer with gasbench ii thermo scientific at the state key laboratory of cryospheric sciences with a precision of 0 5 for δd and 0 05 for δ18o the results are reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 1 calculation on δ18o and δd of atmospheric water vapor based on precipitation isotopes the δ18o and δd for atmospheric water vapor can be estimated by the following method gibson and reid 2014 δ a δ p k ε 1 1 0 3 â k ε where δa is isotopic compositions in atmospheric water vapor and δp is isotopic compositions in precipitation at the cloud base k is the adjusting parameter and ɛ is the equilibrium fractionation factor between water and vapor and can be calculated by ε α 1 α is the equilibrium fractionation factor 1 0 3 i n 2 α 1158 8 t 3 1 0 9 1620 1 t 2 1 0 6 794 84 t 1 0 3 161 04

evaporation line slope slel by the stable isotope values of river water resevitor water and spring water samples was confirmed and then calculations were repeated using k between 0 6 and 1 0 with step width of 0 0001 the final value of k was determined when the difference between slel and the measured lel slope was the lowest or k reached the boundary values 0 6 and 1 0 more details about the calculations were described by skrzypek et al 2015 the measured lel can be calculated as s lel h 1 0 318 ε h 2 δ a 2 δ p 2 ε 1 1 0 32 δ p h 1 0 32 ε h 18 δ a 18 δ p 18 ε 1 1 0 3 18 δ p where h is relative humidity and ɛ is the total fractionation factor defined as ε ε α ε k where kinetic fractionation factor ɛk is calculated as ε k 1 h θ n c d where the weighting value θ for small water body evaporation flux does not influence ambient humidity is 1 and for larger water body like the great lakes and the mediterranean sea is 0 5 the value n for a stable layer like soil and leaf cover is 1 and for a large open water body is 0 5 the values of cd are 25 1 for hydrogen and 28 5 for oxygen respectively araguaset al 2000 as suggested by skrzypek et al 2015 the values of h and n were both set to 1 2 calculation on δ18o and δd of advection water vapor to estimate the isotope ratios in advection water vapor δadv from upwind site to downwind site when vapor isotopes show a depleting trend

isotopic composition of soil evaporation water vapor soil water and atmospheric water vapor other parameters are the same as in the equations above the kinetic fraction factor αk for oxygen 18 18αk

by li et al 2016b there is no isotope fractionation when plant transpired water is taken up by roots therefore the isotope composition δ18ops of local vegetation stem water is the same as that of the transpired water vapor δ 18 o tr δ 18 o ps d tr d ps 5 calculations on the moisture recycling to precipitation a three component mixing model was used to calculate the recycling fractions from soil

increase in precipitation and cryosphere melting under climate warming provides water for evapotranspiration in cold regions guodong and huijun 2013 yao et al 2013 as the thawing period of permafrost extends and the freezing period is pushed back the growing season of vegetation is extended and transpiration is enhanced li et al 2021 relevant studies have shown an increase in the evaporation precipitation and moisture recycling rates in northern china over the past 20 years kang wenhong et al 2005 the increased rate of evapotranspiration is 1 14 mm a in the qilian mountains during 2009 2018 lisha et al 2020 the annual mean temperature in china from 2000 to 2018 increased by approximately 0 63 and the annual precipitation and atmospheric water vapor increased by approximately 0 5 and 1 2 respectively relative to those of 1979 2000 the inflow and outflow of water vapor decreased and the precipitation recycling ratio increased by 10 9 su et al 2020 thus increased rates of evapotranspiration provide additional water vapor for moisture recycling in cold regions the contribution of water vapor from local evaporation to precipitation has increased in the qilian mountains in recent decades yin yunhe et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 the following stable isotope characteristics of precipitation reflect the significant contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in the qilian mountains 1 as shown in fig 2 a the intercept of the local meteoric water line lwml δd 7 92δ18o 14 01 is higher than that of the global meteoric water line gwml for precipitation events when the temperature is 0 c when t 0 c in the qilian mountains fig 2 whereas its slope is slightly lower than that of the gwml δd 8δ18o 10 precipitation events when t 0 c mainly occurred during the growing season from may to october characterized by high temperatures and increased evaporation in general the lwml has a lower slope and intercept in the arid region during summer and autumn precipitation the intercept of lwml is usually a good indicator of regional moisture recycling froehlich et al 2008 when stable isotopes of precipitation are affected by high moisture recycling they exhibit a relatively high intercept of lwml this feature indicates the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in the qilian mountains 2 on the inter annual scale the stable isotopes of precipitation showed a significant positive correlation with temperature exhibiting a clear temperature effect of δ18o 0 47 t 10 75 r2 0 37 in the qilian mountains gui et al 2020 however for precipitation events when the temperature was 10 c t 10 c this positive correlation was not observed fig 2b this indicates that the evaporation based enrichment of stable isotopes was offset to some extent by the depletion of stable isotopes due to moisture recycling moreover the moisture recycling effect gradually strengthens causing an increase in d excess thus there is no obvious inverse correlation between δ18o and d excess the same findings have been confirmed in the tianshan mountains pang et al 2011 3 as fig 2c shows the average δ18o and d excess of precipitation at 19 sampling stations show an inverse trend with an increase in altitude for precipitation events at t 10 c there are two possible reasons for this finding at lower elevation sites precipitation stable isotopes were influenced by strong subcloud evaporation processes leading to an increase in δ18o and a decrease in d excess as the altitude increased the moisture recycling effect gradually increased and caused an increase in d excess and a decrease in δ18o 3 2 seasonal variation in moisture recycling fraction the results of the stable isotope tracer modeling indicated that the evaporation fraction accounted for approximately 8 of the precipitation that occurred during the growing season in the qilian mountains equal to 27 mm of precipitation the corresponding contribution rates in may june july august september and october were approximately 5 8 11 12 7 and 6 or 1 2 mm 6 2 mm 10 1 mm 9 6 mm 1 8 mm and 1 3 mm of the monthly precipitation respectively fig 3 in may the contribution of the evaporation fraction to precipitation was generally low with a relatively even distribution ranging from 3 to 9 5 and the maximum was 9 5 and 7 5 for gangcha and tianjun stations respectively on the southern slope of the qilian mountains fig 3 with the general temperature increase in june the contribution of the evaporation fraction increased in the study region but varied significantly from station to station reaching a maximum of 14 8 at gangcha station on the south slope and a minimum of 3 7 at jiayuguan station on the north slope fig 3 the evaporation fraction was generally higher in july and august and the regional differences were relatively high among the 19 stations and the contribution rate was still higher in the southern slope than that in the northern slope of the qilian mountains for example the evaporation fraction at jiayuguan and gulang stations was only 4 8 and 5 on the northern slope in july respectively and 20 8 and 19 7 at gangcha and tianjun stations on the southern slope respectively this contribution declined significantly in september and october with the highest values of 14 5 and 13 6 occurring at the tianjun and gangcha stations respectively fig 3 as fig 4 shows the monthly transpiration fraction in may june july august september and october accounts for approximately 8 14 14 21 21 and 8 of the corresponding monthly precipitations or 1 9 mm 10 8 mm 19 3 mm 16 8 mm 2 1 mm and 1 7 mm respectively in summary the contribution of the transpiration fraction was approximately 14 throughout the growing season in the study region which was equivalent to 44 mm precipitation in addition the transpiration fraction varied considerably over the specific months in may the transpiration fraction was generally low and the contribution was only 3 2 and 2 3 at the gulang and jiayuguan stations in the lower altitude region near the hexi corridor in june during the growing season the increase in temperature and precipitation led to a significant increase in transpiration jiayuguan station had the smallest transpiration fraction reaching an 8 contribution during this period the transpiration fraction further increased in july and reached a maximum of 27 45 at tianjun station in august in september and october there was a gradual decrease at the end of the growing season in summary during the growing season moisture recycling accounted for approximately 22 and contributed 71 mm to the total precipitation in the qilian mountains there was significant seasonal variation in moisture recycling among the 19 stations during the growing season at most sampling stations the moisture recycling fraction increased from may reached a maximum in august and then decreased this trend is consistent with seasonal trends in temperature and evapotranspiration intensity 3 3 spatial distribution as fig 5 shows the evaporation and transpiration fractions were the highest in the central part compared to those in the eastern and western qilian mountains in the central section of the qilian mountains the monthly moisture recycling rates were 14 24 38 38 19 and 18 in may june july august september and october respectively and the corresponding values were 13 21 27 30 14 and 12 in the eastern section and 11 17 26 30 13 and 12 respectively fig 5 interestingly both precipitation and the contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation displayed the same seasonal variations in the eastern and central qilian mountains while the maximum contribution rate from moisture recycling lagged one month behind the maximum precipitation this reflects the marked regional differences in moisture recycling in the qilian mountains the evaporation and transpiration fractions on the southern slope were higher than those on the northern slope of the qilian mountains fig 6 the monthly evaporation fractions from may to october were approximately 5 0 9 9 7 10 9 6 6 and 10 5 for the northern slope and approximately 6 3 9 6 12 9 13 8 9 4 and 7 6 for the southern slope respectively in terms of the transpiration fraction the corresponding values were 7 4 12 6 20 1 10 9 7 5 and 7 5 for the northern slope and 9 0 16 1 23 7 24 5 11 1 and 8 8 respectively for the southern slope for stations on the southern slope the contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation was higher than 20 at the gangcha station located on the edge of qinghai lake and the moisture recycling contribution reached 48 75 in august in contrast the contribution rate was relatively low on the northern slope dropping below 20 at the jiayuguan station in august overall moisture recycling accounted for approximately 21 of the precipitation on the northern slope of the qilian mountains which is equivalent to 66 mm of precipitation the corresponding value for the southern slope was approximately 26 which is equivalent to 85 mm of precipitation fig 6 these differences also reflect the significant variation in moisture recycling in the study region under different climates and environments a similar finding was confirmed for the central tibetan plateau where there are prominent regional differences in the local moisture recycling ratio wdl 31 6 4 8 fhs 18 6 3 7 tth 14 3 8 and tgl 21 7 3 9 zhu et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 the evaporation fraction tends to decrease from the central qilian mountains to the surrounding areas with higher values in the qinghai lake and hala lake basins whereas the lower values were distributed in the hexi corridor region additionally both growing season and month exhibited the same spatial pattern of the evaporation fraction there are three possible reasons for this finding the first is the relatively isolated terrain in the central qilian mountains and in the qinghai lake and hala lake basins with high mountains surrounding the low lying central section is favorable for the accumulation of local evaporation water vapor and limits the distribution of water vapor second the lake surface has a stronger evaporation capacity than other surfaces xinyu and bing 2021 confirmed that the annual evaporation of qinghai lake is 40 1 108 m3 based on a water balance model this ensures an abundance of local water vapor third there are differences in the climate and environment of the qilian mountains with high temperatures and low precipitation near the hexi corridor as fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the transpiration fraction is different from that of the evaporation fraction exhibiting a decreasing trend in the transpiration fraction from south to north in the south central qilian mountains in addition the transpiration fraction increased from northwest to southeast in the study region during may june august and october while the growing season spatial pattern was evident during july and september this can be explained by three potential factors first this spatial variation may reflect the influence of vegetation conditions juan et al 2019 confirmed that the average annual normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in the qilian mountains decreases gradually from east to west with the most vegetation growing in the southeastern qilian mountains the coverage of forest grassland and other vegetation types has increased over the past 20 years second this reflects the influence of vegetation evapotranspiration tian et al 2013 reported that evapotranspiration increases from the gobi desert 82 mm a to the qilian mountains 515 mm a this trend is closely related to the land cover and climatic conditions in the study region forests had the highest evapotranspiration 588 mm followed by grasslands 308 mm farmlands 225 mm and desert lands 160 mm the forests are mainly distributed in the eastern and southeastern qilian mountains third this trend reflects the influence of the local topography the intermountain basin qinghai lake and hala lake in the south central qilian mountains and the river valley areas datong river and huangshui river in the southeastern qilian mountains are most conducive to moisture recycling 4 discussion 4 1 contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation and its influence the above analysis indicates that the fractions from advection evaporation and transpiration in precipitation were approximately 78 8 and 14 respectively in the qilian mountains in addition the transpiration fraction in the study area was higher than the area s evaporation fraction peng et al 2011 confirmed that the transpiration fraction accounts for most local moisture recycling in taiwan and china whereas the evaporation fraction accounts for only a small proportion thus the transpiration fraction is an important factor influencing the local microclimate and precipitation using observations from 81 stations worldwide schlesinger and jasechko 2014 reported that transpiration dominates the local moisture recycling process on a global scale and the contribution of the transpiration fraction to precipitation was 39 10 accounting for 61 15 of the local moisture recycling recent observations have confirmed this in different climatic zones around the globe hu et al 2014 found that in the semi arid climate zone of china the transpiration fraction accounts for 83 of the moisture recycling in the saharan climate zone the transpiration fraction accounts for 85 of the moisture recycling yepeza et al 2003 in the semi arid mediterranean climate zone williams et al 2004 the transpiration fraction accounts for 69 86 of the moisture recycling during irrigation and 100 without irrigation in the subalpine monsoon climate zone the forest evapotranspiration water vapor accounted for 75 66 and 97 of the evapotranspiration water vapor on june 21 24 and 25 2006 respectively xu et al 2008 in the temperate maritime climate zone of europe the transpiration fraction accounts for 62 of the moisture recycling in august november and its contribution ranges from 0 to 89 on a daily scale aemisegger et al 2014 observational studies in the xishuangbanna region of yunnan china confirmed that dry season stratospheric fog is mainly caused by local transpiration water vapor zhong et al 2007 in summary the local moisture recycling and precipitation of the qilian mountains are mainly supported by local transpiration water vapor but the detailed mechanism still needs further research on a global scale the influence of moisture recycling on regional precipitation has also been explored and the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is approximately 39 with vegetation transpiration accounting for approximately 61 of global moisture recycling he and richards 2016 evaporation from the land surface has a significant effect on precipitation in eurasia where soil moisture supply evaporation is recharged by atmospheric precipitation numaguti 1999 mountain moisture recycling often creates precipitation at higher elevations allowing close ecohydrological links between subalpine forest ecosystems and alpine meadow ecosystems cui et al 2009 in the amazon basin the contribution of moisture recycling in the partially wetted area to regional precipitation is 25 35 eltahir and bras 1994 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in the alps is 16 froehlich et al 2008 in addition moisture recycling has become an important component of regional precipitation in lake areas with moisture recycling rates of 16 50 in lake ihorty madagascar vallet et al 2008 10 18 in lake michigan usa bowen et al 2012 and 5 16 in the great lakes region of north america gat et al 1994 machavaram et al 1995 as shown in fig 9 and table 2 previous studies have confirmed the significant contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation in china the contribution rate displayed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest in china and decreased from the tibetan plateau to the northwestern arid region the qilian mountains form a part of the transitional zone in china from south to north moisture recycling rates reach a maximum of 61 and 55 in sichuan and chongqing respectively wu et al 2021 in taiwan and china the contribution of moisture recycling to annual precipitation in mountainous areas is 37 compared to 31 in plateau areas peng et al 2011 the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is approximately 20 and 15 in the middle reaches of the yangtze and yellow rivers respectively xu et al 2004 in the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau the monthly average contribution of evaporation from lakes to local precipitation is 35 2 wu et al 2019 while the contribution is 28 4 31 1 at namucuo lake xu et al 2011 moisture recycling contributes to approximately 22 of the precipitation in the qilian mountains in arid northwestern china this contribution is 16 2 with evaporation and transpiration contributing 9 and 10 3 respectively for larger oases such as urumqi city relatively smaller oases such as shihezi city contribute approximately 5 wang et al 2016 a study in the badain jaran desert showed that the moisture recycling fraction in the lake area is 10 3 10 9 higher than that of the mountainous area le et al 2020 4 2 influencing factors of moisture recycling altitude affects moisture recycling as listed in table 3 the contribution of both the evaporation and transpiration fractions to precipitation increased with altitude in the qilian mountains below 4000 m this trend was more obvious in august the contribution rate of the evaporation fraction increased from 5 5 altitude 2000 m to 8 4 2000 altitude 3000 m and then increased to 15 7 3000 altitude 4000 m showing an overall increase of 10 2 the transpiration fraction increased from 14 a 2000 m to 20 7 2000 altitude 3000 m and then increased to 22 9 3000 altitude 4000 m showing an overall increase of 8 9 the contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation increased from 19 5 altitude 2000 m to 29 1 2000 altitude 3000 m and then increased to 38 6 3000 altitude 4000 m showing an overall increase of 19 1 however there was a decreasing trend in the evaporation fraction when the altitude was 4000 m for example the monthly evaporation fraction at altitudes of 3000 4000 m was 6 2 9 3 14 1 15 7 9 9 and 7 5 from may to october but at altitudes higher than 4000 m the monthly evaporation fractions were 6 2 9 1 12 3 15 8 7 and 5 7 respectively showing a decrease of 0 0 2 1 8 0 7 1 2 and 1 8 respectively the transpiration fraction displayed an increasing trend with increasing altitude above 4000 m from may to october the monthly contribution rates of transpiration were 8 5 14 8 23 8 22 9 9 4 and 8 6 respectively between 3000 and 4000 m however the monthly contribution of the transpiration fraction was 9 14 7 26 23 2 11 5 and 10 8 above 4000 m respectively indicating a difference of 0 5 0 1 2 2 0 3 2 1 and 2 2 respectively in summary an altitude of 4000 m is a significant boundary for moisture recycling in the qilian mountains and moisture recycling shows a significant increasing trend as the altitude increases in vegetation zones below 4000 m but exhibits a stable or even decreasing trend in the cold desert belt with glaciers and snow above 4000 m topography also affects moisture recycling as mentioned above the higher contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation occurred predominantly in the southeastern qilian mountains the intermountain basin qinghai lake and hala lake and the river valley areas datong river and huangshui river wu et al 2021 found that basin topography has a higher moisture recycling rate than other topographic areas a typical example is the sichuan basin a low lying basin surrounded by high mountains where there is an accumulation of local water vapor and the maximum moisture recycling rate is 58 to some extent the size of the study region affects moisture recycling rates when the study area was selected as a single grid point the moisture recycling rate in the middle and lower reaches of the river ranged from 4 to 10 and when the study area was expanded to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the moisture recycling rate increased to ranging from 25 to 35 zhu 2019 trenberth 1999 showed that moisture recycling rates increase with the expansion of the study area and are correlated with seasonal and interannual climate change the subsurface is also an important factor influencing moisture recycling yang et al 2018 found that the catchment area plays a more important role than the temperature in the functioning of moisture recycling in the qinghai tibet plateau and the evaporation capacity of the water surface is stronger than that of the bare ground which results in a lake area having a higher moisture recycling fraction good vegetation cover also promotes moisture recycling by strengthening evapotranspiration li et al 2016a the spatial pattern of moisture recycling especially the transpiration fraction is related to the vegetation conditions as fig 10 a shows the annual mean ndvi decreases from east to west in the qilian mountains during 2000 2018 and the eastern part has the largest ndvi value with the main vegetation types being forest alpine grassland and meadow the ndvi is also higher in the central qilian mountains where the main vegetation type is alpine meadow and typical grassland in the western section which is dominated by desert grassland cold desert belt and bare land the annual mean ndvi was relatively lower for vegetation cover the highest values occurred in the eastern and southeastern qilian mountains with higher values in the central and north central sections and lower values in the western qilian mountains fig 10b in addition the vegetation ndvi has increased over the past 30 years in the qilian mountains chen et al 2015 liu et al 2011 li et al 2021 the largest ndvi occurred in the altitude range of 2000 3900 m in the qilian mountains and the ndvi significantly decreased when the altitude was 3900 m fig 11 this is consistent with the elevation distribution trend of the transpiration fraction thus vegetation conditions are an important factor affecting moisture recycling in addition to the influence of elevation topography and vegetation conditions meteorological factors also influence local moisture recycling the relationships between moisture recycling and temperature precipitation and relative humidity were analyzed in the qilian mountains table 4 the following conclusions were drawn there is a negative correlation between temperature and moisture recycling which means that the contribution rate decreases as temperature increases this indicates that the saturated water vapor pressure also decreases as the temperature increases inhibiting cloud formation and precipitation therefore the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increases as altitude increases decreasing temperature and increasing saturated water vapor pressure are more conducive to the occurrence of precipitation at higher altitudes with the same water vapor content in july and august there was a significant positive correlation between precipitation and moisture recycling this reflects greater precipitation with an increase in the contribution from moisture recycling especially in the high rainfall season the relative humidity was positively correlated with moisture recycling this indicates that the higher the relative humidity is the higher the saturated water vapor pressure is which is conducive to the formation of precipitation from moisture recycling vapor and vice versa these results indicate that temperature and relative humidity are the main meteorological factors affecting moisture recycling thus moisture recycling is influenced by many factors and different factors may interact with each other the detailed mechanism of moisture recycling needs to be further explored 4 3 significance of water resources for moisture recycling the qilian mountains are an important recharge area for the hexi inland water system and the upper reaches of the yellow river the oasis area in the hexi corridor is an important irrigated agricultural area in china with a cropland area of 74 9 104 hm2 in 2017 which watered land accounted for approximately 87 the total volume of water resources was 77 74 108 m3 in the hexi corridor and approximately 90 of the water resources were mainly used for agriculture and the total grain production was up to 315 5 104 tons xu 2020 thus the qilian mountains are important for the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in the hexi corridor and the ecological stability of the entire oasis region the qilian mountain area covers an area of 18 3 104 km2 and the contribution of local moisture recycling to precipitation is approximately 22 throughout the growing season which is equivalent to 71 mm of precipitation it is assumed that all of this precipitation is produced inflow and the water production is approximately 13 billion m3 which is approximately 87 of the average total annual runoff 15 billion m3 from the qilian mountains and twice the average total annual runoff of the three major inland river basins 6 566 billion m3 in the hexi corridor these characteristics indicate that moisture recycling is a very important water resource especially in arid regions as the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the arid region the qilian mountains provide water for three inland basins in arid regions serving nearly 5 million people in the hexi corridor and a large amount of ecological water to maintain the ecological stability of the oases more importantly the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation is a key indicator of regional water resource renewal capacity which is of great importance to the sustainable utilization and development of water resources as shown in fig 12 this study reflects the importance of ecological conservation in supporting moisture recycling first ecological protection will achieve ecological stability and vegetation restoration which in turn will enhance the ecological barrier effect second good ecological conditions will enhance moisture recycling in turn improving the renewal capacity of water resources and provide important support for the stability and sustainable use of regional water resources once the ecology is damaged it will affect ecological security and regional water resource supply in addition the contribution of vegetation transpiration to precipitation is relatively high in the qilian mountains which also confirms that good ecological protection is vital to stabilizing and enhancing the contribution of moisture recycling the results also showed that moisture recycling precipitation in cold regions is an important link for ecological stability and sustainable water resource supply in arid regions therefore ecological protection supports sustainable development in the qilian mountains environmental protection needs to be enhanced in the qilian mountains by implementing high level ecological design guidelines and stronger protection policies enhancing the support for scientific and technological development building a public catchment protection model strengthening legislation increasing funding and improving overall management li et al 2021 protecting the ecology of the qilian mountains ensures the security and stability of the ecological barrier and sustainable supply of regional water resources 5 conclusions based on the isotopic data of 1310 precipitation samples 1020 soil water samples 215 surface water samples and 204 plant stem water samples this study quantified the fractions of contributions from terrestrial evaporation and transpiration moisture to local precipitation in the qilian mountains the transition zone between the tibetan plateau and the arid region of northwestern china under the strengthening of evapotranspiration with climate warming the occurrence of moisture recycling has been confirmed by lwml temperature effect altitude variation of δ18o and d excess when the temperature is 0 c moisture recycling and advection in the study area accounted for 22 and 78 of precipitation from may to october respectively based on the stable isotope tracing models and the transpiration fraction approximately 14 was higher than the evaporation fraction approximately 8 specifically the local evaporation fraction contributed approximately 27 mm to precipitation the corresponding value for the transpiration fraction was approximately 44 mm and the moisture recycling increased from may reaching a maximum in august and then decreasing throughout the growing season in terms of spatial distribution the evaporation fraction tended to decrease from the central qilian mountains to the surrounding areas whereas the transpiration fraction exhibited a decreasing trend from south to north in the south central qilian mountains overall moisture recycling accounts for 21 and 26 of the precipitation in the northern and southern slopes respectively which is equivalent to 66 mm and 85 mm precipitation the qilian mountains are the transition zone for the spatial pattern of the contribution rate from moisture recycling in china altitude topography vegetation conditions and meteorological factors were the main factors affecting local moisture recycling an altitude of 4000 m is a significant boundary for moisture recycling in the qilian mountains and moisture recycling showed a significant increasing trend with altitude below 4000 m but exhibited a stable or even decreasing trend above 4000 m a higher contribution rate from moisture recycling to precipitation occurred in the intermountain basin qinghai and hala lakes and river valley areas datong and huangshui rivers of the qilian mountains the spatial pattern of moisture recycling especially the transpiration fraction is also influenced by vegetation cover and ndvi variation in the qilian mountains the contribution rate decreased with increasing temperature owing to the decreased saturated water vapor pressure which inhibited cloud formation and precipitation a higher relative humidity is conducive to the formation of precipitation from moisture recycling vapor and vice versa the qilian mountains are an important recharge area for the hexi inland water system which supports irrigated agriculture in the hexi corridor and for the ecological stability of the entire oasis region if all of the moisture recycling precipitation is produced inflow water production is approximately 13 billion m3 which is approximately 87 of the average total annual runoff from the qilian mountains and twice the average total annual runoff of the three major inland river basins in the hexi corridor moisture recycling precipitation is important for ecological stability and sustainable water resource supply in cold arid regions in addition this study shows that good ecological conditions will enhance moisture recycling which will improve the renewal capacity of water resources and support the stability and sustainable use of regional water resources therefore ecological protection remains an aspect of sustainable development in the qilian mountains ecological protection needs to be enhanced in the qilian mountains to stabilize local moisture recycling and the renewal capacity of regional water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

3743,channel morphodynamics governed by erosion and deposition processes constitute a relevant aspect of integrated water management planning and development of sustainable fluvial projects according to the water framework directive there is a need for hydromorphological recognition and channel geomorphic adjustment at the national level such a large scale excludes field measurements as the primary research method instead methods that require less resources and are based on relatively simple process representations are required the stream power sp concept combining the effect of channel gradient and discharge has been widely used for quantitative measurements in geomorphic works at different spatial scales but not at the national level so far the primary objective of this study was to estimate total and specific stream power and detect erosion and deposition patterns along the river network in poland given the dominant role of stream slope in sp spatial variations the specific objective was to assess the vertical accuracy of high resolution dem representing water surface elevations along the river course and to propose a method for extraction of elevation points along river reaches that increase the accuracy of dem derived stream slopes we demonstrated that dem generally overestimates the elevation by more than 0 5 m significantly affecting the dem derived stream slope estimation by extracting minimum water surface elevation from dem within a 15 m radius from the target cell river segment endpoint a substantial improvement was achieved the difference between the actual and dem derived water surface elevation dropped to 0 16 m the results indicated that the distribution of dominating processes in polish rivers is strongly governed by the character and origin of the terrain relief and lithological diversity for regions with flat relief most channels are generally in the state of equilibrium whereas in upland and mountainous regions erosion processes are dominant this study demonstrates the potential use of the sp concept for mapping channel sensitivity to erosion and deposition dominance at a national scale which can be relevant for integrated river catchment management keywords specific stream power total stream power dem accuracy assessment poland stream slope representative discharge 1 introduction river channels are dynamic systems continuously adjusting to changes in processes and human interventions across a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal scales gurnell et al 2016 their shape is with time determined by erosion transport and deposition of sediments they strive to maintain a dynamic equilibrium between discharge slope sediment load and sediment size lane 1955 whenever an imbalance between sediment transport capacity quantity that can be transferred downstream and supply actual input to the river reach occurs channel adjustments with substantial changes in their morphology are triggered schumm 1993 such long term shifts in equilibrium might result from climate change local base level changes or human induced alterations affecting both water discharge regime and sediment availability dynamics e g dam closure in channel mining etc regardless of the origin of a disequilibrium when initiated it activates processes of sediment erosion or deposition in the channel this in turn triggers different channel adjustments e g vertical incision aggradation changes in channel width depth and pattern these might eventually result in reduced channel conveyance or an increased risk of in stream infrastructure instability bizzi and lerner 2015 therefore the dynamism of river channel sediment transfer is of vast importance in integrated catchment management with significant implications for river functioning parker et al 2015 channel morphodynamics are most commonly investigated at fine reach scale through field measurements and audits thorne 2002 for large scale regional to national integrated applications detailed field observations are mostly unavailable and impractical to collect prosser et al 2001 notwithstanding european union directive ec 2000 imposes evaluation of the hydromorphological quality of rivers and delivery of catchment management plans at the national level assessments at such a scale require methods requiring fewer resources based on relatively simple process representations newson and large 2006 wallerstein et al 2006 the greatest challenge however is to ensure that the choice of processes and methods as well as the accompanying datasets accurately reflect the controls on sediment transfer at a large scale prosser et al 2001 in recent studies stream power sp has been used as an effective quantitative measure of geomorphic work at different spatial scales kaushal et al 2020 sp is a measure of the major driving forces in the river channel it combines the effect of channel gradient and discharge it can be approximated using measurements of channel width discharge and slope sp can characterise the available power in a river system total stream power tsp and effective utilisation of the available power specific stream power ssp it makes the spatial distribution of sp a useful indicator for mapping erosion and deposition patterns along the river network at different spatial scales kaushal et al 2020 numerous applications of sp reported worldwide concerned prediction of the rate of fluvial incision in bedrock channels willett 1999 prediction of channel pattern eaton et al 2010 identification of thresholds of aggradation and degradation bull 1979 and assessment of channel sensitivity to erosion and deposition processes bizzi and lerner 2015 the practical utilisation of sp as an indicator of channel erosion and deposition potential was based on the approach proposed by parker et al 2015 the method assumes that the ssp value of a particular reach is an indicator of the sediment transport capacity and the ssp value of the immediate upstream reach is an indicator of the sediment supply delivered from upstream the ssp value of a particular reach is divided by the ssp value of the immediate upstream reach the quotient hereafter referred to as ssp balance it is worth emphasising that this approach is affected by several limitations and simplifications the most important one is that the actual sediment availability at a channel location is not considered at all because the method is chiefly based on the transport capacity of two contiguous river sectors most reported studies using the sp concept were conducted at a reach to catchment scale its large scale applications are extremely rare largely due to constrains in the availability of precise digital elevation datasets covering large areas remote sensing techniques and products developed rapidly over the last decade providing very detailed and precise digital elevation model dem datasets at a national scale it allows the quantification of stream slope at high resolution and accurate exploration of sp variability along the complex stream network covering large areas and regions in fact stream slope was reported to have a prevailing impact on variations in sp distribution and magnitude along river systems knighton 1999 and therefore its accurate estimation is of great importance in fine scale investigations field surveyed gps collected water surface slopes are most commonly used the applicability of field based methods however is constrained by the area of the investigated field which renders it impractical for large scale applications when the area of interest exceeds the capabilities of field based methods dem derived stream slopes are most commonly used barker et al 2009 vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 the most accurate dems acquired using light detection and ranging lidar scanning lim et al 2003 after processing act as the basic data source for stream slope determination sharma et al 2021 for perennial rivers where dry conditions are extremely rare dem derived stream slopes calculated along a river profile usually rely on elevation values extracted from dem at opposite edge points over a certain stream length vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 or a cell associated with each dem along the river course bizzi and lerner 2015 parker et al 2015 it should be emphasised that infra red laser beams are absorbed by water surface creating blank polygons on such surfaces in post processing of lidar point clouds each point is then attributed a land or non land water class while creating a continuous dem for areas covered by water lakes rivers elevation is interpolated between the edge points tangential to water surface legleiter 2012 elevation variation at the river bank edge might be enormous particularly in highly vegetated riparian corridors this might significantly affect the locally interpolated elevation values of stream surface this means that caution must be taken when extracting the stream elevation data directly from dem in order to calculate stream slope interestingly studies conducted so far have rarely assessed the accuracy of dems within water surfaces and rivers in particular we aim to fill in this gap with this study the ultimate objective of this study is to estimate total and specific stream power and detect erosion and deposition patterns along a complex river network at a large national scale the specific objective is to assess the vertical accuracy of high resolution dem representing water surface elevations along the river course and to propose a method for the extraction of elevation points along river reaches increasing the accuracy of dem derived stream slopes it is hypothesised that extracting water surface elevation values from dem not from the exact coordinates of the point of interest but within a certain radius of that point might offer more realistic results and improve the accuracy of dem derived stream slope assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description and datasets poland occupies an area of 312683 km2 in central and eastern europe it is predominantly a lowland country within the central european plain and eastern baltic plain kondracki 2002 nearly 75 of the polish territory has an elevation below 200 ma s l only a part of the country has a hilly character shaped by the activity of glaciers in the pleistocene fig 1 a poland is confined to the sudetes and carpathian mountains in the south and the baltic sea in the north the north eastern part of the country is abundant with lakes and low hills formed by glaciations the elevation gradient generally decreases northwards poland has highly variable soils characterised by low content of colloids clay minerals and humic substances it features temperate climate with cold winters and warm summers determined by the geographical location of the country and its landform features it is generally influenced by maritime air from the west polar air from scandinavia and russia and subtropical air from the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea the highest annual precipitation is observed in the mountainous area reaching 1400 mm and lowest in the lowland parts around 550 mm fig 1b at the annual scale precipitation in summer is notably higher than that in winter there are nine river basins draining the territory of poland two of which vistula and odra are dominant covering nearly 275000 km2 88 of the area of the country the total length of perennial streams in poland is nearly 151000 km corresponding to areal mean stream density of 0 48 km km 2 fig 1c according to the classification by dynowska 1997 most rivers in poland are characterised by nival regime significantly fewer of them are nivo pluvial and the least share of rivers feature pluvio nival regime wrzesiński 2017 high flows typically occur in spring due to snowmelt and ice melt and summer due to intense precipitation low flows predominantly occur in late summer and often extend to autumn according to hydrographical map of poland 2010 and studies of klimek 1987 korpak 2007 zawiejska and wyżga 2010 and marcinkowski et al 2017 rivers in poland are mostly characterised by single thread channels for efficient interpretation of the results at a large scale tsp and ssp maps were overlaid with physico geographical regions of poland kondracki 2002 distinguished by geographical location character and origin of the terrain relief and lithological diversity for the purposes of this research sub provinces were merged to a total number of seven

hydrographical map of poland 2010 in gis vector format was used as a reference stream network map it represents the official hydrographical division of the country providing the basis for water management spatial planning environmental protection and reporting to the european commission according to the map the stream network in poland is divided into 57151 reaches average length of 2 47 km and 26694 sub catchments i e hydrographic elementary units delineated based on surface topography and drainage system elements for every tributary and between all confluences along a particular river

2 4 discharge regime in order to solve the total and specific stream power equations eqs 1 and 2 a reference discharge must be defined in a vast majority of studies the median annual flood qmed with two year return period is used in such calculations barker 2008 bizzi and lerner 2015 parker et al 2015 it is assumed that the qmed approximates the morphologically significant bankfull condition in single thread rivers and has sufficient energy to mobilise the riverbed material ryan et al 2005 therefore qmed was selected as the representative flow discharge in this study to estimate qmed values for each of the river sectors it was first calculated for each of the 871 gauging stations in poland through the analysis of their annual maxima series then three methods of qmed calculation were applied based on standard hydrological procedures byczkowski 1996 depending on the flow gauge location in the analysed river sector across poland 1 interpolation of qmed for the river sectors between

accuracy of dem datasets within water surface areas is highly dependent on vegetation abundance dense vegetation cover prevents the laser beam from reaching the actual ground and the last laser reflection from unpenetrated vegetation surface is faultily treated as ground surface dewitt et al 2015 podhoranyi and fedorcak 2015 fig 3 presents a schematic presentation of possible errors resulting from the presence of dense vegetation in the riparian corridor as presented the last beam of lidar laser at densely vegetated river banks overestimates their actual elevation potentially inducing remarkable errors in water surface elevation coming from interpolation to assess the dem accuracy we used the information on exact dates of lidar scanning and actual water levels expressed in cm with a vertical accuracy of 1 cm recorded at the day of flight in 730 flow gauging stations with respect to a known local reference for each station expressed in ma s l by adding water level to station reference altitude we were able to obtain the actual water level elevation in the first step we calculated absolute errors between lidar derived and actual water surface levels in flow gauging stations uniformly distributed across poland the elevation was extracted from dem based on coordinates of each flow gauging station in the second step we created multiple circular buffers around the flow gauging stations radius of 5 10 15 20 25 50 100 150 and 200 m and calculated min median and mean elevation statistics from dem within each buffer zone by creating a buffer we increased chances for capturing more accurate ground and water surface elevations in spots where laser beam penetrated the closest level of actual ground water surface next we assessed absolute errors between actual water surface elevation and that derived from dem from each buffer zone statistics 2 6 slope determination the channel bed slope was estimated based on 1 m resolution dem covering the entire area of poland in the first step a point layer with an interval of 500 m was constructed along the flow path of the river stream network layer then for each of the points a minimum elevation searched within a 15 m radius see section 3 1 for details on the radius determination was assigned from the dem for each 500 m long river segment channel bed slope was calculated by dividing the dem based elevation drop between the upstream point and its downstream neighbour by the downstream distance between the two points along the river course in the final step a median channel bed slope value was assigned within each river sector 2 15 km long enclosed river sectors in order to analyse the impact of the buffer approach on the determination of the channel slope we additionally compared the distributions of slopes for all 500 m long river segments derived by the improved buffer approach and in a traditional way i e directly from dem without adopting the buffer approach 2 7 channel width determination to calculate channel width for each of the river sectors the study employed the national scale dataset developed during the implementation of project it system for protection against extraordinary hazards in poland isok in the project river cross sections were measured total number of 31200 the width range of measured channels spanned from 0 3 to 1527 m cf fig 1a in selected rivers 216 across the country channel width was determined for each of the river sectors in two different ways for river sectors with river cross section measurements available the average channel width was calculated as the median value from all cross sections enclosed by the boundaries of the respective sub catchment as the cross sections were collected with an interval of 500 m their number in each sub catchment was dependent on the river sector length enclosed by the sub catchment and varied between 4 and 30 8 on average in river sectors where cross sectional data were unavailable channel width was estimated as a power law function of the upstream drainage area for the 31200 cross sections a power law regression between measured channel width and the corresponding drainage area was performed the derived relationship was w 0 5267 a0 5115 with an r2 value of 0 69 2 8 erosion and deposition potential mapping a key issue in the application of the ssp balance concept is to define reliable thresholds for distinguishing the dominating potential processes erosion or deposition at river location in previous studies parker et al 2015 bizzi and lerner 2015 such a threshold was derived from field observations with the assumption that dominant channel processes can be identified based on the observed channel form sear et al 2003 for large scale application presented in this study it is impossible to conduct field observations covering the entire country therefore we used a database inventorying actual restoration works conducted in river streams in the years 2012 2013 in poland jabłońska et al 2014 the database included geospatial data on the location and type of restoration works dredging desludging channels as a measure against actual deposition processes and backfilling the breached eroded river bed and banks as a measure against actual erosion processes in a number of river reaches across poland the river stretches included in the inventorying database were intersected with the layer of ssp balance to evaluate average ssp balance within two groups of restoration measures caused by erosion and deposition then the distribution of ssp balance values calculated for erosion and deposition locations was analysed and median ssp balance values among the dredged and backfilled channels were adopted as the thresholds between deposition dominated and equilibrium state channels and equilibrium state and erosion dominated channels respectively setting the thresholds in the study we only considered restored river sites scanned before restoration works constituting 90 of the original dataset to ensure the reliability of sp calculated considering the slopes derived from dem representing the pre restoration conditions 3 results 3 1 dem accuracy assessment dem derived water surface elevation values were assessed using actual elevation values with a vertical accuracy of 1 cm recorded in 730 gauging stations on the day of the lidar scanning flight used as the basic data for dem preparation fig 4 presents the boxplots of minimum mean and median statistics of absolute difference between the flow gauge derived and dem derived elevations calculated at the exact location of each gauge and within nine buffers 5 200 m around gauges negative values indicate that dem overestimates actual water surface elevations while positive ones suggest that it underestimates them as presented in fig 4a the absolute differences in elevation calculated at the exact gauge location in some cases exceed 5 m although the median from all gauges is 0 05 m the 1st and 3rd quartile are 0 51 m and 0 16 m respectively this means that for 25 of gauges the water surface elevation is overestimated by more than 0 5 m and for another 25 it is underestimated by more than 0 16 m it proves that the error of overestimation of elevations in dem is more commonly encountered and the underestimation is less frequent minimum elevation values calculated within each buffer zone instead of elevation extracted from the exact location of flow gauge fig 4a indicate that substantial improvement might be achieved and the overestimation of elevations might be reduced it is particularly visible for buffers of 5 50 m for which median values of absolute difference are 0 16 m 0 21 m 0 22 m 0 24 m 0 26 m and 0 27 m respectively although the median is higher in this case the 1st and 3rd quartiles are considerably lower reaching from 0 08 to 0 23 m 5 m buffer and from 0 19 to 0 41 m 50 m buffer with an increasing buffer the underestimation of water surface elevation substantially increases reaching 0 4 m median for 200 m buffer the use of median and mean statistics within buffers does not only not improve but generally exacerbates the results regardless of the buffer length fig 4b and c causing a gradual increase in the overestimation of elevations in the second step of the assessment absolute differences between flow gauge derived and dem derived calculated as minimum elevation within each buffer water surface elevations were analysed separately for seven physico geographical regions of poland to see if there is a regional dependency of the results as presented in fig 5 an overestimation of elevations seems to be a general issue not strongly region related the dispersion of blue boxes in all regions is quite high with 1st quartile values concentrating around the value of 0 4 to 0 7 m and 3rd quartile not exceeding 0 16 m panels a i in fig 5 orange boxes present the statistics of elevation differences within nine buffers 5 200 m the results indicate that the highest improvement in elevation accuracy was achieved for buffers 5 25 m 1st and 3rd quartile ranging between 0 03 and 0 23 m for buffers larger than 25 m the dispersion of boxes increased substantially and the general underestimation of elevation was observed it should be emphasised that regardless of the method of elevation data extraction from the exact location or as a minimum value within the buffer single outliers are recorded on the boxplots based on the analysis of the results for all buffers a 15 m buffer was used as an optimal value and was further used in this study for stream slope determination it was due to the fact that for that particular buffer the lowest dispersion of outliers and the 1st to 3rd quartile range were recorded compared to the remaining buffers of 5 10 20 and 25 m 3 2 discharge slope and channel width in the first step qmed was calculated individually for 871 gauging stations location presented in fig 2d across poland the calculated qmed values ranged between 0 2 and 3150 m3 s 1 with an average of 109 m3 s 1 then representative flow was estimated for all ungauged river sectors depending on the neighbouring gauge station location following the rules presented in fig 2a c and described in section 2 4 therefore qmed was continuously assigned to the entire stream network and presented on the map fig 6 a the map indicates a consistent downstream increase in discharge expected for rivers in temperate climate the downstream flow increase due to drainage area increase is significantly higher in the southern mountainous part of the country the regional differentiation can be reflected by specific flow the ratio between the flow rate and the respective drainage area which for the central and northern predominantly lowland part of poland reaches 30 l s 1 km 2 and for the southern part of the country 196 l s 1 km 2 channel width was assigned to each of the analysed river sectors either based on actual measurements or in a function of upstream drainage area fig 6b presents the map of river sectors with averaged channel width across poland as indicated widths with some minor exceptions generally increase with drainage area reaching the highest values for two largest polish rivers vistula and odra near their outlets channel slope was determined for each of the analysed river sectors fig 6c the highest slopes locally exceeding 20 0 61 on average are recorded in the southern mountainous part of poland moving gradually to the central and northern part of the country characterised by plain relief channel slopes become milder reaching an average value of 0 23 in fig 7 the distribution slopes for 500 m long river segments based on two methods with and without the buffer approach are presented due to a very large number of river segments around 300000 and outliers the differences might be hard to detect therefore basic statistics for both methods are provided here for the buffer approach the median slope value is 0 16 and the interquartile range is 0 04 0 48 for the non buffer approach the corresponding statistics are 0 25 median and 0 09 0 63 interquartile range the slope distribution statistics prove that the buffer approach provides generally lower slope values which might reduce the overestimations caused by vegetation presence in the dem 3 3 tsp and ssp maps tsp and ssp was calculated for 26694 river sectors across poland and presented in fig 8 due to a large number of river sectors for which sp was calculated fig 9 presents a graph of tsp and ssp values within each region accompanied by basic statistics median 10th and 90th percentile the spatial variability of sp shows characteristic zoning as presented in figs 8a and 9a the highest ssp values were recorded for region vii mountainous western carpathians with a median value of 234 8 w m 2 significantly lower ssp was recorded for region iv mountainous sudety and vi foreland subcarpathians reaching median values of 67 w m 2 and 36 7 w m 2 respectively moving to the north of the country the ssp values gradually decrease reaching median values of 11 8 w m 2 5 4 w m 2 2 8 w m 2 and 4 6 w m 2 for region v uplands iii lowlands ii lowlands lakes and i coast respectively the highest range of ssp values expressed by absolute difference between the 90th and 10th percentile is observed for regions with mountainous character i e vii and iv reaching 667 6 w m 2 and 258 2 w m 2 respectively for regions with lowland character such a range falls below 25 w m 2 for tsp figs 8b and 9b similar spatial distribution is observed with the exception of the largest polish rivers vistula and odra for which tsp increases gradually from upstream to downstream due to an increase in representative flow the highest tsp value 108000 w m 1 is recorded in region ii for the vistula near its outlet to the baltic sea however regardless of the largest rivers in all regions the tsp spatial pattern seems to be consistent with the ssp pattern observed in the statistics regarding the median values the highest tsp is observed in region vii 558 9 w m 1 and gradually decreases northwards reaching the lowest value for region ii 10 w m 1 similarly to ssp for tsp the highest range is observed for mountainous region vii 3533 w m 1 and the lowest for lowland region ii 64 3 w m 1 in order to explain the variation of sp between the physico geographical regions several characteristics stream density channel slope specific flow channel width were provided in table1 average values for these characteristics were calculated within each region as presented in table1 mountainous region vii with the highest recorded sp is characterised by the highest mean channel slope 2 91 stream density 0 68 km km 2 and specific flow 196 l s 1 km 2 among all regions with relatively low channel widths with decreasing slope and specific flow as well as increasing channel width in foreland and upland regions v vi sp gradually declines the lowest sp values coincide with low channel slopes stream density and specific flow reported for lowland and coastal regions 3 4 mapping the erosion and deposition potential to set the thresholds for ssp balance an analysis of the restoration measures inventorying database jabłońska et al 2014 was performed it revealed that nearly 6170 km of streams were subject to dredging or desludging as a result of excessive sedimentation processes fig 10 b and 198 km of streams were backfilled due to excessive erosion fig 10c the distribution of the ssp balance values calculated for erosion and deposition locations among the dredged and backfilled channels is presented in fig 11 as expected the majority of sites where actual dredging or desludging was conducted have ssp balance less than 1 whereas the majority of backfilled channels have ssp balance values of greater than 1 in some recorded cases however erosion and deposition dominated channels have values of ssp balance that fall outside the expected ranges finally median ssp values among erosion 1 42 and deposition 0 69 dominated channels were selected as the thresholds for distinguishing the dominating potential processes deposition and erosion potential were estimated separately for each physico geographical region table2 the results indicate that in all regions the share of deposition dominated channels is similar 27 34 30 on average however a significant difference is recorded among the regions considering the share of equilibrium state and erosion dominated channels in general for regions characterised by flat relief region i ii iii and v most channels are in equilibrium state 58 67 62 on average and only 8 on average seem to be erosion dominated the opposite distribution was observed for upland and mountainous regions iv vii where erosion dominated channels 43 63 prevail over the ones in equilibrium state 9 27 fig 10a 4 discussion geomorphological analysis and recognition have recently become a lawful requirement in europe under the water framework directive wfd it is generally mandatory for the planning and approval of river basin management plans wharton and gilvear 2007 an understanding of river channel dynamics regulated by erosion and deposition processes is also crucial for water management and development of sustainable and cost efficient fluvial projects langat et al 2019 although according to european union directive ec 2000 a complex hydromorphological recognition is required at the national level most studies in europe are still conducted at a reach to catchment scale and there is currently no national scale information to even understand where erosion or deposition is more likely to occur bowman et al 2021 despite their highest accuracy field surveys are obviously generally impractical at such a scale more simplistic methods are therefore required based on input datasets at national extent newson and large 2006 one of the most popular approaches reported in the literature applied for reach to catchment scale is that based on the sp concept barker et al 2009 parker et al 2015 bizzi and lerner 2015 this study extends the area of investigation to test the potential applicability of the sp concept at a national scale an increased area of application poses a great challenge regarding computational capabilities accurate data availability and proper validation of the final results the accuracy of sp calculation obviously depends on the accuracy and reliability of its variable quantities discharge slope and active channel width sp spatial variability is broadly reported to be controlled by the variations in the discharge and slope with the dominant role of the latter knighton 1999 sonam and jain 2018 to ensure accurate results in this study we used the most detailed datasets covering the entire country while calculating each variable quantity of sp the application of the sp concept at the national level might be problematic particularly for transboundary rivers due to the possible differences in data collection methods reporting and finally data availability in this study headwater river sectors of the vistula and odra basins located in belarus ukraine slovakia and czech republic were excluded from the analysis due to data availability such a spatial range limitation in the case of poland is not a serious issue only around 10 of river basins are located outside its boundaries for catchments located in several countries however data availability might be a significant issue there are several ways of calculating representative discharge at ungauged sites reported in the literature it can be simplistically modelled as a function of distance downstream lawler 1995 or extracted from dem using the empirical discharge to drainage area relationship vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 in our study however for most river sectors 96 we calculated the qmed using flow data records directly for gauged sites and as a regression between discharge and drainage area for ungauged sites which was reported to be more accurate and reliable approach barker 2008 bizzi and lerner 2015 for the remaining 4 of river sectors qmed was estimated by means of the maximum specific flow with 50 exceedance probability from the polish atlas of hydrology assumed to be generally less reliable but successfully used providing acceptable results for selected catchments in poland banasik et al 2012 significant uncertainty related to stream slope values derived from dems has been frequently discussed in the literature vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 parker et al 2015 although previous studies demonstrated that water surfaces can be delineated from a lidar dataset it is subject to an important limitation the near infrared laser pulses are absorbed by water and therefore fail to provide precise elevation from submerged areas of the channel notebaert et al 2009 surprisingly only several studies to date have assessed dem derived water surface elevation error in fluvial assessment applications legleiter 2012 used lidar data to assess the agreement between field surveyed and lidar derived water surface elevations in two gravel bed river reaches in the usa legleiter 2012 reported high agreement between these two elevation datasets a standard error of 0 12 m and reach averaged water surface slopes derived based on them as essentially identical as reported by legleiter 2012 however the analysis has been conducted for relatively short and sparsely vegetated river reaches for which the ground surface at the water s edge was easily accessible by laser pulses different accuracy was expected for highly vegetated riparian corridors where ground surface is usually not penetrated by laser beam therefore along with the fact that the dominant role in sp spatial variability can be attributed to stream slope in this study we firstly assessed the accuracy of dem derived slopes and secondly proposed a method for extracting water surface elevations reducing slope errors to capture all types of vegetation cover in the near bank zone we conducted the analysis in nearly all gauged rivers in poland including highly and sparsely vegetated lowland and mountainous meandering braiding and anastomosing types by using 730 gauging station records on water surface elevation with a vertical accuracy of 1 cm we demonstrated that dem generally overestimates the elevation by more than 0 5 m 1st quartile for the ensemble reaching extreme values of up to 3 5 m significantly affecting the dem derived stream slope estimation by extracting the minimum water surface elevation from dem within a 15 m radius from the target cell river stretch endpoint a substantial improvement was achieved and the 1st quartile difference between the actual and dem derived water surface elevation dropped to 0 16 m extreme values not exceeding 2 m it resulted in remarkable differences in slope values compared to the traditional approach non buffer of extracting water surface elevations from dem the slope distribution statistics prove that the buffer approach generally provides lower slope values which might reduce the overestimations caused by vegetation presence in the dem it should be emphasised however that such an improvement was possible due to the use of high resolution 1 m dem it has been widely reported that the accuracy in slope assessment is greater when high resolution input dems are used paz and collischonn 2007 vianello et al 2009 it is likely that the use of coarser resolution dem 5m might not improve the accuracy of slope estimation due to generally lower accuracy of the dem itself and a smaller number of cells falling within a 15 m radius around the target cell for coarser resolution dems an increased radius of up to 50 m might however still improve the slope assessment as the results obtained for 50 m radius were still satisfactory median difference 0 27 m when a dem with lower vertical accuracy is used 1m it is recommended in the literature bizzi and lerner 2012 to increase the length of reach for which slope is calculated from 500 m to 2 4 km this might mask some fine scale variations but reduces the uncertainty caused by dem inaccuracy for future development of our research it would be interesting to correlate differences between real and dem derived elevation with the height density and type of vegetation which most probably play a crucial role in determining such differences erosion and deposition potential mapping based on ssp values is strongly influenced by the active channel width in this study this parameter has been considered in lower detail compared to other variables in studies where collection of in situ measurements of channel width is impractical it is most commonly estimated using a width bank full discharge drainage area relationship following power law harman et al 1999 brummer and montgomery 2003 the deviation of the actual channel width along a particular river from those calculated by power law relationship however may depend on the estimation of uncertainty as well as natural variability destro et al 2018 this study employed the national database of river cross sections total number of 31200 collected in the years 2010 2012 measured at selected river reaches to estimate the relationship between the catchment area and channel width and applies it to all river sectors where width measurements were not collected a previous study by destro et al 2018 emphasised the remarkable sensitivity to the assumptions concerning bank full channel width drainage area therefore this variable can be treated as a limitation of our study in this study we used the datasets of the highest possible accuracy at the national scale to calculate sp and map the erosion and deposition potential for the entire country concerning the accuracy of the methods the advantage of field measurements in geomorphological recognition over the desk based simplified calculations is unquestionable parker et al 2015 however when considering the scale of application in integrated large scale planning the situation shifts calculation of sp at the national scale allowed to assess the ssp balance and indicate potential areas where channels are erosion deposition dominated or remain in equilibrium state one of the key issues is to define thresholds for ssp balance distinguishing the dominating processes bizzi and lerner 2015 used the absolute difference between the ssp and tsp of neighbouring reaches to define the transition zone between erosion or unstable and deposition or stable classes parker et al 2015 used a relative change of ssp values between the investigated and immediate upstream reach setting the threshold values of 0 59 upper threshold for deposition and 2 3 lower threshold for erosion this study took advantage of the national database of conducted restoration measures in poland in the period 2012 2013 the idea was to set the threshold values based on the ssp values calculated in streams where actual erosion or deposition processes occurred which seems more realistic it is worth emphasising that our threshold values 0 69 and 1 42 are relatively close to the ones reported by parker et al 2015 our results indicate that the dominating processes distribution in rivers differs significantly among the seven regions for regions characterised by flat relief most channels are generally in equilibrium state whereas in upland and mountainous regions erosion processes are dominant the presented study is affected by several limitations and simplifications beside the bank full channel width estimation already mentioned in the previous paragraph important limitations of the ssp balance concept need to be emphasised first of all it assumes that a river sector will be able to transport sediment at a rate proportional to the ssp rate bagnold 1966 demonstrated that sediment transport rate is closely associated with ssp although it is also controlled by bed and bank particle size and weight which determine their entrainment threshold bull 1979 second in the ssp balance concept the actual sediment availability at a channel location is not considered and the method is based on the transport capacity of two contiguous river sectors the greatest difficulty in studies at such a scale is related to the validation of the results in some studies at a catchment scale bizzi and lerner 2015 parker et al 2015 results are confronted with field surveys at a national scale such comparison covering the entire river network is difficult a validation was attempted however considering selected reaches where previous scientific works highlighted conditions of erosion deposition for general discussion on the coherence of our results with previous knowledge about the morphodynamic state of selected polish rivers for example in the study of lach and wyżga 2002 and wyżga 2007 conducted for polish carpathian rivers region vii in our study a shift of dominating processes from aggrading in 19th century to incising in 20th century was reported resulting in channel erosion and deepening similar processes with dominating erosion have been recognised in the carpathian region in our study witek kasprzak et al 2020 investigated the morphodynamic processes in the nysa kłodzka river catchment located in region iv sudety mountain and reported erosion to be the dominant process in the river system which coincides with our findings for this catchment in another study by dysarz et al 2017 conducted for lowland ner river catchment located in region iii the authors recognised sediment deposition to be the dominating process along the river similar results were obtained from our ssp balance approach for the ner river on the other hand in the study of łajczak 2006 for the lowland nida catchment region v erosion was recognised as the prevailing process for the upper part of the river which is at variance with our results based on the ssp balance concept in the downstream section however where deposition was dominant results were consistent in both studies the confrontation of our results based on the ssp balance concept with reach scale field observations suggests that at the general level the recognition of prevailing processes at the level of river sectors is rather accurate although not in all cases therefore much broader validation with local studies could possibly improve the assessment of erosion deposition patterns along the river network in poland this means that the outputs presented in this study should not be used in isolation in river management planning however it is strongly recommended to use them in conjunction with field reconnaissance and additional detailed examination of aerial photographs and satellite imagery the highest advantage of this study comes from the fact that it can be used in the first phase of water management planning aimed at indicating potential areas of interest depending on the objective of the implemented project preventing either excessive erosion or deposition particular reaches can be selected and subject to further detailed analysis the output presented here covering the entire country is of great importance for river managers developing management plans at a national level 5 conclusion this paper examines the application of the sp concept at a national scale to indicate potential areas river sectors prone to erosion deposition or remaining in the equilibrium state high resolution datasets on topography lidar based and river flow records as well as channel cross section measurements were used to calculate average sp for 26694 river sectors in poland our results permit drawing the following conclusions dem derived water surface elevations extracted in a traditional way were overestimated by 0 5 m 1st quartile value for 730 gauging stations due to vegetation presence resulting in general overestimation of stream gradients across poland adopting the buffer approach method for extracting water elevation from dem reduced the elevation overestimation to 0 16 m 1st quartile value for 730 gauging stations and provided generally lower slope values reducing the impact of vegetation dominating processes distribution in polish rivers is strongly governed by the character and origin of the terrain relief and lithological diversity for regions characterised by flat relief most channels are in the equilibrium state whereas in upland and mountainous regions erosion processes are dominant the outputs presented in this study should not be used in isolation in river

3743,channel morphodynamics governed by erosion and deposition processes constitute a relevant aspect of integrated water management planning and development of sustainable fluvial projects according to the water framework directive there is a need for hydromorphological recognition and channel geomorphic adjustment at the national level such a large scale excludes field measurements as the primary research method instead methods that require less resources and are based on relatively simple process representations are required the stream power sp concept combining the effect of channel gradient and discharge has been widely used for quantitative measurements in geomorphic works at different spatial scales but not at the national level so far the primary objective of this study was to estimate total and specific stream power and detect erosion and deposition patterns along the river network in poland given the dominant role of stream slope in sp spatial variations the specific objective was to assess the vertical accuracy of high resolution dem representing water surface elevations along the river course and to propose a method for extraction of elevation points along river reaches that increase the accuracy of dem derived stream slopes we demonstrated that dem generally overestimates the elevation by more than 0 5 m significantly affecting the dem derived stream slope estimation by extracting minimum water surface elevation from dem within a 15 m radius from the target cell river segment endpoint a substantial improvement was achieved the difference between the actual and dem derived water surface elevation dropped to 0 16 m the results indicated that the distribution of dominating processes in polish rivers is strongly governed by the character and origin of the terrain relief and lithological diversity for regions with flat relief most channels are generally in the state of equilibrium whereas in upland and mountainous regions erosion processes are dominant this study demonstrates the potential use of the sp concept for mapping channel sensitivity to erosion and deposition dominance at a national scale which can be relevant for integrated river catchment management keywords specific stream power total stream power dem accuracy assessment poland stream slope representative discharge 1 introduction river channels are dynamic systems continuously adjusting to changes in processes and human interventions across a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal scales gurnell et al 2016 their shape is with time determined by erosion transport and deposition of sediments they strive to maintain a dynamic equilibrium between discharge slope sediment load and sediment size lane 1955 whenever an imbalance between sediment transport capacity quantity that can be transferred downstream and supply actual input to the river reach occurs channel adjustments with substantial changes in their morphology are triggered schumm 1993 such long term shifts in equilibrium might result from climate change local base level changes or human induced alterations affecting both water discharge regime and sediment availability dynamics e g dam closure in channel mining etc regardless of the origin of a disequilibrium when initiated it activates processes of sediment erosion or deposition in the channel this in turn triggers different channel adjustments e g vertical incision aggradation changes in channel width depth and pattern these might eventually result in reduced channel conveyance or an increased risk of in stream infrastructure instability bizzi and lerner 2015 therefore the dynamism of river channel sediment transfer is of vast importance in integrated catchment management with significant implications for river functioning parker et al 2015 channel morphodynamics are most commonly investigated at fine reach scale through field measurements and audits thorne 2002 for large scale regional to national integrated applications detailed field observations are mostly unavailable and impractical to collect prosser et al 2001 notwithstanding european union directive ec 2000 imposes evaluation of the hydromorphological quality of rivers and delivery of catchment management plans at the national level assessments at such a scale require methods requiring fewer resources based on relatively simple process representations newson and large 2006 wallerstein et al 2006 the greatest challenge however is to ensure that the choice of processes and methods as well as the accompanying datasets accurately reflect the controls on sediment transfer at a large scale prosser et al 2001 in recent studies stream power sp has been used as an effective quantitative measure of geomorphic work at different spatial scales kaushal et al 2020 sp is a measure of the major driving forces in the river channel it combines the effect of channel gradient and discharge it can be approximated using measurements of channel width discharge and slope sp can characterise the available power in a river system total stream power tsp and effective utilisation of the available power specific stream power ssp it makes the spatial distribution of sp a useful indicator for mapping erosion and deposition patterns along the river network at different spatial scales kaushal et al 2020 numerous applications of sp reported worldwide concerned prediction of the rate of fluvial incision in bedrock channels willett 1999 prediction of channel pattern eaton et al 2010 identification of thresholds of aggradation and degradation bull 1979 and assessment of channel sensitivity to erosion and deposition processes bizzi and lerner 2015 the practical utilisation of sp as an indicator of channel erosion and deposition potential was based on the approach proposed by parker et al 2015 the method assumes that the ssp value of a particular reach is an indicator of the sediment transport capacity and the ssp value of the immediate upstream reach is an indicator of the sediment supply delivered from upstream the ssp value of a particular reach is divided by the ssp value of the immediate upstream reach the quotient hereafter referred to as ssp balance it is worth emphasising that this approach is affected by several limitations and simplifications the most important one is that the actual sediment availability at a channel location is not considered at all because the method is chiefly based on the transport capacity of two contiguous river sectors most reported studies using the sp concept were conducted at a reach to catchment scale its large scale applications are extremely rare largely due to constrains in the availability of precise digital elevation datasets covering large areas remote sensing techniques and products developed rapidly over the last decade providing very detailed and precise digital elevation model dem datasets at a national scale it allows the quantification of stream slope at high resolution and accurate exploration of sp variability along the complex stream network covering large areas and regions in fact stream slope was reported to have a prevailing impact on variations in sp distribution and magnitude along river systems knighton 1999 and therefore its accurate estimation is of great importance in fine scale investigations field surveyed gps collected water surface slopes are most commonly used the applicability of field based methods however is constrained by the area of the investigated field which renders it impractical for large scale applications when the area of interest exceeds the capabilities of field based methods dem derived stream slopes are most commonly used barker et al 2009 vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 the most accurate dems acquired using light detection and ranging lidar scanning lim et al 2003 after processing act as the basic data source for stream slope determination sharma et al 2021 for perennial rivers where dry conditions are extremely rare dem derived stream slopes calculated along a river profile usually rely on elevation values extracted from dem at opposite edge points over a certain stream length vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 or a cell associated with each dem along the river course bizzi and lerner 2015 parker et al 2015 it should be emphasised that infra red laser beams are absorbed by water surface creating blank polygons on such surfaces in post processing of lidar point clouds each point is then attributed a land or non land water class while creating a continuous dem for areas covered by water lakes rivers elevation is interpolated between the edge points tangential to water surface legleiter 2012 elevation variation at the river bank edge might be enormous particularly in highly vegetated riparian corridors this might significantly affect the locally interpolated elevation values of stream surface this means that caution must be taken when extracting the stream elevation data directly from dem in order to calculate stream slope interestingly studies conducted so far have rarely assessed the accuracy of dems within water surfaces and rivers in particular we aim to fill in this gap with this study the ultimate objective of this study is to estimate total and specific stream power and detect erosion and deposition patterns along a complex river network at a large national scale the specific objective is to assess the vertical accuracy of high resolution dem representing water surface elevations along the river course and to propose a method for the extraction of elevation points along river reaches increasing the accuracy of dem derived stream slopes it is hypothesised that extracting water surface elevation values from dem not from the exact coordinates of the point of interest but within a certain radius of that point might offer more realistic results and improve the accuracy of dem derived stream slope assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description and datasets poland occupies an area of 312683 km2 in central and eastern europe it is predominantly a lowland country within the central european plain and eastern baltic plain kondracki 2002 nearly 75 of the polish territory has an elevation below 200 ma s l only a part of the country has a hilly character shaped by the activity of glaciers in the pleistocene fig 1 a poland is confined to the sudetes and carpathian mountains in the south and the baltic sea in the north the north eastern part of the country is abundant with lakes and low hills formed by glaciations the elevation gradient generally decreases northwards poland has highly variable soils characterised by low content of colloids clay minerals and humic substances it features temperate climate with cold winters and warm summers determined by the geographical location of the country and its landform features it is generally influenced by maritime air from the west polar air from scandinavia and russia and subtropical air from the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea the highest annual precipitation is observed in the mountainous area reaching 1400 mm and lowest in the lowland parts around 550 mm fig 1b at the annual scale precipitation in summer is notably higher than that in winter there are nine river basins draining the territory of poland two of which vistula and odra are dominant covering nearly 275000 km2 88 of the area of the country the total length of perennial streams in poland is nearly 151000 km corresponding to areal mean stream density of 0 48 km km 2 fig 1c according to the classification by dynowska 1997 most rivers in poland are characterised by nival regime significantly fewer of them are nivo pluvial and the least share of rivers feature pluvio nival regime wrzesiński 2017 high flows typically occur in spring due to snowmelt and ice melt and summer due to intense precipitation low flows predominantly occur in late summer and often extend to autumn according to hydrographical map of poland 2010 and studies of klimek 1987 korpak 2007 zawiejska and wyżga 2010 and marcinkowski et al 2017 rivers in poland are mostly characterised by single thread channels for efficient interpretation of the results at a large scale tsp and ssp maps were overlaid with physico geographical regions of poland kondracki 2002 distinguished by geographical location character and origin of the terrain relief and lithological diversity for the purposes of this research sub provinces were merged to a total number of seven

hydrographical map of poland 2010 in gis vector format was used as a reference stream network map it represents the official hydrographical division of the country providing the basis for water management spatial planning environmental protection and reporting to the european commission according to the map the stream network in poland is divided into 57151 reaches average length of 2 47 km

2 4 discharge regime in order to solve the total and specific stream power equations eqs 1 and 2 a reference discharge must be defined in a vast majority of studies the median annual flood qmed with two year return period is used in such calculations barker 2008 bizzi and lerner 2015 parker et al 2015 it is assumed that the qmed approximates the morphologically significant bankfull condition in single thread rivers and has sufficient energy to mobilise the riverbed material ryan et al 2005 therefore qmed was selected as the representative flow discharge in this study to estimate qmed values for each of the river sectors it was first calculated for each of the 871 gauging stations in poland through the analysis of their annual maxima series then three methods of qmed calculation were applied based on standard hydrological procedures byczkowski 1996 depending on the flow gauge location in the analysed river sector across poland 1 interpolation of qmed for the river sectors between

accuracy of dem datasets within water surface areas is highly dependent on vegetation abundance dense vegetation cover prevents the laser beam from reaching the actual ground and the last laser reflection from unpenetrated vegetation surface is faultily treated as ground surface dewitt et al 2015 podhoranyi and fedorcak 2015 fig 3 presents a schematic presentation of possible errors resulting from the presence of dense vegetation in the riparian corridor as presented the last beam of lidar laser at densely vegetated river banks overestimates their actual elevation potentially inducing remarkable errors in water surface elevation coming from interpolation to assess the dem accuracy we used the information on exact dates of lidar scanning and actual water levels expressed in cm with a vertical accuracy of 1 cm recorded at the day of flight in 730 flow gauging stations with respect to a known local reference for each station expressed in ma s l by adding water level to station reference altitude we were able to obtain the actual water level elevation in the first step we calculated absolute errors between lidar derived and actual water surface levels in flow gauging stations uniformly distributed across poland the elevation was extracted from dem based on coordinates of each flow gauging station in the second step we created multiple circular buffers around the flow gauging stations radius of 5 10 15 20 25 50 100 150 and 200 m and calculated min median and mean elevation statistics from dem within each buffer zone by creating a buffer we increased chances for capturing more accurate ground and water surface elevations in spots where laser beam penetrated the closest level of actual ground water surface next we assessed absolute errors between actual water surface elevation and that derived from dem from each buffer zone statistics 2 6 slope determination the channel bed slope was estimated based on 1 m resolution dem covering the entire area of poland in the first step a point layer with an interval of 500 m was constructed along the flow path of the river stream network layer then for each of the points a minimum elevation searched within a 15 m radius see section 3 1 for details on the radius determination was assigned from the dem for each 500 m long river segment channel bed slope was calculated by dividing the dem based elevation drop between the upstream point and its downstream neighbour by the downstream distance between the two points along the river course in the final step a median channel bed slope value was assigned within each river sector 2 15 km long enclosed river sectors in order to analyse the impact of the buffer approach on the determination of the channel slope we additionally compared the distributions of slopes for all 500 m long river segments derived by the improved buffer approach and in a traditional way i e directly from dem without adopting the buffer approach 2 7 channel width determination to calculate channel width for each of the river sectors the study employed the national scale dataset developed during the implementation of project it system for protection against extraordinary hazards in poland isok in the project river cross sections were measured total number of 31200 the width range of measured channels spanned from 0 3 to 1527 m cf fig 1a in selected rivers 216 across the country channel width was determined for each of the river sectors in two different ways for river sectors with river cross section measurements available the average channel width was calculated as the median value from all cross sections enclosed by the boundaries of the respective sub catchment as the cross sections were collected with an interval of 500 m their number in each sub catchment was dependent on the river sector length enclosed by the sub catchment and varied between 4 and 30 8 on average in river sectors where cross sectional data were unavailable channel width was estimated as a power law function of the upstream drainage area for the 31200 cross sections a power law regression between measured channel width and the corresponding drainage area was performed the derived relationship was w 0 5267 a0 5115 with an r2 value of 0 69 2 8 erosion and deposition potential mapping a key issue in the application of the ssp balance concept is to define reliable thresholds for distinguishing the dominating potential processes erosion or deposition at river location in previous studies parker et al 2015 bizzi and lerner 2015 such a threshold was derived from field observations with the assumption that dominant channel processes can be identified based on the observed channel form sear et al 2003 for large scale application presented in this study it is impossible to conduct field observations covering the entire country therefore we used a database inventorying actual restoration works conducted in river streams in the years 2012 2013 in poland jabłońska et al 2014 the database included geospatial data on the location and type of restoration works dredging desludging channels as a measure against actual deposition processes and backfilling the breached eroded river bed and banks as a measure against actual erosion processes in a number of river reaches across poland the river stretches included in the inventorying database were intersected with the layer of ssp balance to evaluate average ssp balance within two groups of restoration measures caused by erosion and deposition then the distribution of ssp balance values calculated for erosion and deposition locations was analysed and median ssp balance values among the dredged and backfilled channels were adopted as the thresholds between deposition dominated and equilibrium state channels and equilibrium state and erosion dominated channels respectively setting the thresholds in the study we only considered restored river sites scanned before restoration works constituting 90 of the original dataset to ensure the reliability of sp calculated considering the slopes derived from dem representing the pre restoration conditions 3 results 3 1 dem accuracy assessment dem derived water surface elevation values were assessed using actual elevation values with a vertical accuracy of 1 cm recorded in 730 gauging stations on the day of the lidar scanning flight used as the basic data for dem preparation fig 4 presents the boxplots of minimum mean and median statistics of absolute difference between the flow gauge derived and dem derived elevations calculated at the exact location of each gauge and within nine buffers 5 200 m around gauges negative values indicate that dem overestimates actual water surface elevations while positive ones suggest that it underestimates them as presented in fig 4a the absolute differences in elevation calculated at the exact gauge location in some cases exceed 5 m although the median from all gauges is 0 05 m the 1st and 3rd quartile are 0 51 m and 0 16 m respectively this means that for 25 of gauges the water surface elevation is overestimated by more than 0 5 m and for another 25 it is underestimated by more than 0 16 m it proves that the error of overestimation of elevations in dem is more commonly encountered and the underestimation is less frequent minimum elevation values calculated within each buffer zone instead of elevation extracted from the exact location of flow gauge fig 4a indicate that substantial improvement might be achieved and the overestimation of elevations might be reduced it is particularly visible for buffers of 5 50 m for which median values of absolute difference are 0 16 m 0 21 m 0 22 m 0 24 m 0 26 m and 0 27 m respectively although the median is higher in this case the 1st and 3rd quartiles are considerably lower reaching from 0 08 to 0 23 m 5 m buffer and from 0 19 to 0 41 m 50 m buffer with an increasing buffer the underestimation of water surface elevation substantially increases reaching 0 4 m median for 200 m buffer the use of median and mean statistics within buffers does not only not improve but generally exacerbates the results regardless of the buffer length fig 4b and c causing a gradual increase in the overestimation of elevations in the second step of the assessment absolute differences between flow gauge derived and dem derived calculated as minimum elevation within each buffer water surface elevations were analysed separately for seven physico geographical regions of poland to see if there is a regional dependency of the results as presented in fig 5 an overestimation of elevations seems to be a general issue not strongly region related the dispersion of blue boxes in all regions is quite high with 1st quartile values concentrating around the value of 0 4 to 0 7 m and 3rd quartile not exceeding 0 16 m panels a i in fig 5 orange boxes present the statistics of elevation differences within nine buffers 5 200 m the results indicate that the highest improvement in elevation accuracy was achieved for buffers 5 25 m 1st and 3rd quartile ranging between 0 03 and 0 23 m for buffers larger than 25 m the dispersion of boxes increased substantially and the general underestimation of elevation was observed it should be emphasised that regardless of the method of elevation data extraction from the exact location or as a minimum value within the buffer single outliers are recorded on the boxplots based on the analysis of the results for all buffers a 15 m buffer was used as an optimal value and was further used in this study for stream slope determination it was due to the fact that for that particular buffer the lowest dispersion of outliers and the 1st to 3rd quartile range were recorded compared to the remaining buffers of 5 10 20 and 25 m 3 2 discharge slope and channel width in the first step qmed was calculated individually for 871 gauging stations location presented in fig 2d across poland the calculated qmed values ranged between 0 2 and 3150 m3 s 1 with an average of 109 m3 s 1 then representative flow was estimated for all ungauged river sectors depending on the neighbouring gauge station location following the rules presented in fig 2a c and described in section 2 4 therefore qmed was continuously assigned to the entire stream network and presented on the map fig 6 a the map indicates a consistent downstream increase in discharge expected for rivers in temperate climate the downstream flow increase due to drainage area increase is significantly higher in the southern mountainous part of the country the regional differentiation can be reflected by specific flow the ratio between the flow rate and the respective drainage area which for the central and northern predominantly lowland part of poland reaches 30 l s 1 km 2 and for the southern part of the country 196 l s 1 km 2 channel width was assigned to each of the analysed river sectors either based on actual measurements or in a function of upstream drainage area fig 6b presents the map of river sectors with averaged channel width across poland as indicated widths with some minor exceptions generally increase with drainage area reaching the highest values for two largest polish rivers vistula and odra near their outlets channel slope was determined for each of the analysed river sectors fig 6c the highest slopes locally exceeding 20 0 61 on average are recorded in the southern mountainous part of poland moving gradually to the central and northern part of the country characterised by plain relief channel slopes become milder reaching an average value of 0 23 in fig 7 the distribution slopes for 500 m long river segments based on two methods with and without the buffer approach are presented due to a very large number of river segments around 300000 and outliers the differences might be hard to detect therefore basic statistics for both methods are provided here for the buffer approach the median slope value is 0 16 and the interquartile range is 0 04 0 48 for the non buffer approach the corresponding statistics are 0 25 median and 0 09 0 63 interquartile range the slope distribution statistics prove that the buffer approach provides generally lower slope values which might reduce the overestimations caused by vegetation presence in the dem 3 3 tsp and ssp maps tsp and ssp was calculated for 26694 river sectors across poland and presented in fig 8 due to a large number of river sectors for which sp was calculated fig 9 presents a graph of tsp and ssp values within each region accompanied by basic statistics median 10th and 90th percentile the spatial variability of sp shows characteristic zoning as presented in figs 8a and 9a the highest ssp values were recorded for region vii mountainous western carpathians with a median value of 234 8 w m 2 significantly lower ssp was recorded for region iv mountainous sudety and vi foreland subcarpathians reaching median values of 67 w m 2 and 36 7 w m 2 respectively moving to the north of the country the ssp values gradually decrease reaching median values of 11 8 w m 2 5 4 w m 2 2 8 w m 2 and 4 6 w m 2 for region v uplands iii lowlands ii lowlands lakes and i coast respectively the highest range of ssp values expressed by absolute difference between the 90th and 10th percentile is observed for regions with mountainous character i e vii and iv reaching 667 6 w m 2 and 258 2 w m 2 respectively for regions with lowland character such a range falls below 25 w m 2 for tsp figs 8b and 9b similar spatial distribution is observed with the exception of the largest polish rivers vistula and odra for which tsp increases gradually from upstream to downstream due to an increase in representative flow the highest tsp value 108000 w m 1 is recorded in region ii for the vistula near its outlet to the baltic sea however regardless of the largest rivers in all regions the tsp spatial pattern seems to be consistent with the ssp pattern observed in the statistics regarding the median values the highest tsp is observed in region vii 558 9 w m 1 and gradually decreases northwards reaching the lowest value for region ii 10 w m 1 similarly to ssp for tsp the highest range is observed for mountainous region vii 3533 w m 1 and the lowest for lowland region ii 64 3 w m 1 in order to explain the variation of sp between the physico geographical regions several characteristics stream density channel slope specific flow channel width were provided in table1 average values for these characteristics were calculated within each region as presented in table1 mountainous region vii with the highest recorded sp is characterised by the highest mean channel slope 2 91 stream density 0 68 km km 2 and specific flow 196 l s 1 km 2 among all regions with relatively low channel widths with decreasing slope and specific flow as well as increasing channel width in foreland and upland regions v vi sp gradually declines the lowest sp values coincide with low channel slopes stream density and specific flow reported for lowland and coastal regions 3 4 mapping the erosion and deposition potential to set the thresholds for ssp balance an analysis of the restoration measures inventorying database jabłońska et al 2014 was performed it revealed that nearly 6170 km of streams were subject to dredging or desludging as a result of excessive sedimentation processes fig 10 b and 198 km of streams were backfilled due to excessive erosion fig 10c the distribution of the ssp balance values calculated for erosion and deposition locations among the dredged and backfilled channels is presented in fig 11 as expected the majority of sites where actual dredging or desludging was conducted have ssp balance less than 1 whereas the majority of backfilled channels have ssp balance values of greater than 1 in some recorded cases however erosion and deposition dominated channels have values of ssp balance that fall outside the expected ranges finally median ssp values among erosion 1 42 and deposition 0 69 dominated channels were selected as the thresholds for distinguishing the dominating potential processes deposition and erosion potential were estimated separately for each physico geographical region table2 the results indicate that in all regions the share of deposition dominated channels is similar 27 34 30 on average however a significant difference is recorded among the regions considering the share of equilibrium state and erosion dominated channels in general for regions characterised by flat relief region i ii iii and v most channels are in equilibrium state 58 67 62 on average and only 8 on average seem to be erosion dominated the opposite distribution was observed for upland and mountainous regions iv vii where erosion dominated channels 43 63 prevail over the ones in equilibrium state 9 27 fig 10a 4 discussion geomorphological analysis and recognition have recently become a lawful requirement in europe under the water framework directive wfd it is generally mandatory for the planning and approval of river basin management plans wharton and gilvear 2007 an understanding of river channel dynamics regulated by erosion and deposition processes is also crucial for water management and development of sustainable and cost efficient fluvial projects langat et al 2019 although according to european union directive ec 2000 a complex hydromorphological recognition is required at the national level most studies in europe are still conducted at a reach to catchment scale and there is currently no national scale information to even understand where erosion or deposition is more likely to occur bowman et al 2021 despite their highest accuracy field surveys are obviously generally impractical at such a scale more simplistic methods are therefore required based on input datasets at national extent newson and large 2006 one of the most popular approaches reported in the literature applied for reach to catchment scale is that based on the sp concept barker et al 2009 parker et al 2015 bizzi and lerner 2015 this study extends the area of investigation to test the potential applicability of the sp concept at a national scale an increased area of application poses a great challenge regarding computational capabilities accurate data availability and proper validation of the final results the accuracy of sp calculation obviously depends on the accuracy and reliability of its variable quantities discharge slope and active channel width sp spatial variability is broadly reported to be controlled by the variations in the discharge and slope with the dominant role of the latter knighton 1999 sonam and jain 2018 to ensure accurate results in this study we used the most detailed datasets covering the entire country while calculating each variable quantity of sp the application of the sp concept at the national level might be problematic particularly for transboundary rivers due to the possible differences in data collection methods reporting and finally data availability in this study headwater river sectors of the vistula and odra basins located in belarus ukraine slovakia and czech republic were excluded from the analysis due to data availability such a spatial range limitation in the case of poland is not a serious issue only around 10 of river basins are located outside its boundaries for catchments located in several countries however data availability might be a significant issue there are several ways of calculating representative discharge at ungauged sites reported in the literature it can be simplistically modelled as a function of distance downstream lawler 1995 or extracted from dem using the empirical discharge to drainage area relationship vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 in our study however for most river sectors 96 we calculated the qmed using flow data records directly for gauged sites and as a regression between discharge and drainage area for ungauged sites which was reported to be more accurate and reliable approach barker 2008 bizzi and lerner 2015 for the remaining 4 of river sectors qmed was estimated by means of the maximum specific flow with 50 exceedance probability from the polish atlas of hydrology assumed to be generally less reliable but successfully used providing acceptable results for selected catchments in poland banasik et al 2012 significant uncertainty related to stream slope values derived from dems has been frequently discussed in the literature vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 parker et al 2015 although previous studies demonstrated that water surfaces can be delineated from a lidar dataset it is subject to an important limitation the near infrared laser pulses are absorbed by water and therefore fail to provide precise elevation from submerged areas of the channel notebaert et al 2009 surprisingly only several studies to date have assessed dem derived water surface elevation error in fluvial assessment applications legleiter 2012 used lidar data to assess the agreement between field surveyed and lidar derived water surface elevations in two gravel bed river reaches in the usa legleiter 2012 reported high agreement between these two elevation datasets a standard error of 0 12 m and reach averaged water surface slopes derived based on them as essentially identical as reported by legleiter 2012 however the analysis has been conducted for relatively short and sparsely vegetated river reaches for which the ground surface at the water s edge was easily accessible by laser pulses different accuracy was expected for highly vegetated riparian corridors where ground surface is usually not penetrated by laser beam therefore along with the fact that the dominant role in sp spatial variability can be attributed to stream slope in this study we firstly assessed the accuracy of dem derived slopes and secondly proposed a method for extracting water surface elevations reducing slope errors to capture all types of vegetation cover in the near bank zone we conducted the analysis in nearly all gauged rivers in poland including highly and sparsely vegetated lowland and mountainous meandering braiding and anastomosing types by using 730 gauging station records on water surface elevation with a vertical accuracy of 1 cm we demonstrated that dem generally overestimates the elevation by more than 0 5 m 1st quartile for the ensemble reaching extreme values of up to 3 5 m significantly affecting the dem derived stream slope estimation by extracting the minimum water surface elevation from dem within a 15 m radius from the target cell river stretch endpoint a substantial improvement was achieved and the 1st quartile difference between the actual and dem derived water surface elevation dropped to 0 16 m extreme values not exceeding 2 m it resulted in remarkable differences in slope values compared to the traditional approach non buffer of extracting water surface elevations from dem the slope distribution statistics prove that the buffer approach generally provides lower slope values which might reduce the overestimations caused by vegetation presence in the dem it should be emphasised however that such an improvement was possible due to the use of high resolution 1 m dem it has been widely reported that the accuracy in slope assessment is greater when high resolution input dems are used paz and collischonn 2007 vianello et al 2009 it is likely that the use of coarser resolution dem 5m might not improve the accuracy of slope estimation due to generally lower accuracy of the dem itself and a smaller number of cells falling within a 15 m radius around the target cell for coarser resolution dems an increased radius of up to 50 m might however still improve the slope assessment as the results obtained for 50 m radius were still satisfactory median difference 0 27 m when a dem with lower vertical accuracy is used 1m it is recommended in the literature bizzi and lerner 2012 to increase the length of reach for which slope is calculated from 500 m to 2 4 km this might mask some fine scale variations but reduces the uncertainty caused by dem inaccuracy for future development of our research it would be interesting to correlate differences between real and dem derived elevation with the height density and type of vegetation which most probably play a crucial role in determining such differences erosion and deposition potential mapping based on ssp values is strongly influenced by the active channel width in this study this parameter has been considered in lower detail compared to other variables in studies where collection of in situ measurements of channel width is impractical it is most commonly estimated using a width bank full discharge drainage area relationship following power law harman et al 1999 brummer and montgomery 2003 the deviation of the actual channel width along a particular river from those calculated by power law relationship however may depend on the estimation of uncertainty as well as natural variability destro et al 2018 this study employed the national database of river cross sections total number of 31200 collected in the years 2010 2012 measured at selected river reaches to estimate the relationship between the catchment area and channel width and applies it to all river sectors where width measurements were not collected a previous study by destro et al 2018 emphasised the remarkable sensitivity to the assumptions concerning bank full channel width drainage area therefore this variable can be treated as a limitation of our study in this study we used the datasets of the highest possible accuracy at the national scale to calculate sp and map the erosion and deposition potential for the entire country concerning the accuracy of the methods the advantage of field measurements in geomorphological recognition over the desk based simplified calculations is unquestionable parker et al 2015 however when considering the scale of application in integrated large scale planning the situation shifts calculation of sp at the national scale allowed to assess the ssp balance and indicate potential areas where channels are erosion deposition dominated or remain in equilibrium state one of the key issues is to define thresholds for ssp balance distinguishing the dominating processes bizzi and lerner 2015 used the absolute difference between the ssp and tsp of neighbouring reaches to define the transition zone between erosion or unstable and deposition or stable classes parker et al 2015 used a relative change of ssp values between the investigated and immediate upstream reach setting the threshold values of 0 59 upper threshold for deposition and 2 3 lower threshold for erosion this study took advantage of the national database of conducted restoration measures in poland in the period 2012 2013 the idea was to set the threshold values based on the ssp values calculated in streams where actual erosion or deposition processes occurred which seems more realistic it is worth emphasising that our threshold values 0 69 and 1 42 are relatively close to the ones reported by parker et al 2015 our results indicate that the dominating processes distribution in rivers differs significantly among the seven regions for regions characterised by flat relief most channels are generally in equilibrium state whereas in upland and mountainous regions erosion processes are dominant the presented study is affected by several limitations and simplifications beside the bank full channel width estimation already mentioned in the previous paragraph important limitations of the ssp balance concept need to be emphasised first of all it assumes that a river sector will be able to transport sediment at a rate proportional to the ssp rate bagnold 1966 demonstrated that sediment transport rate is closely associated with ssp although it is also controlled by bed and bank particle size and weight which determine their entrainment threshold bull 1979 second in the ssp balance concept the actual sediment availability at a channel location is not considered and the method is based on the transport capacity of two contiguous river sectors the greatest difficulty in studies at such a scale is related to the validation of the results in some studies at a catchment scale bizzi and lerner 2015 parker et al 2015 results are confronted with field surveys at a national scale such comparison covering the entire river network is difficult a validation was attempted however considering selected reaches where previous scientific works highlighted conditions of erosion deposition for general discussion on the coherence of our results with previous knowledge about the morphodynamic state of selected polish rivers for example in the study of lach and wyżga 2002 and wyżga 2007 conducted for polish carpathian rivers region vii in our study a shift of dominating processes from aggrading in 19th century to incising in 20th century was reported resulting in channel erosion and deepening similar processes with dominating erosion have been recognised in the carpathian region in our study witek kasprzak et al 2020 investigated the morphodynamic processes in the nysa kłodzka river catchment located in region iv sudety mountain and reported erosion to be the dominant process in the river system which coincides with our findings for this catchment in another study by dysarz et al 2017 conducted for lowland ner river catchment located in region iii the authors recognised sediment deposition to be the dominating process along the river similar results were obtained from our ssp balance approach for the ner river on the other hand in the study of łajczak 2006 for the lowland nida catchment region v erosion was recognised as the prevailing process for the upper part of the river which is at variance with our results based on the ssp balance concept in the downstream section however where deposition was dominant results were consistent in both studies the confrontation of our results based on the ssp balance concept with reach scale field observations suggests that at the general level the recognition of prevailing processes at the level of river sectors is rather accurate although not in all cases therefore much broader validation with local studies could possibly improve the assessment of erosion deposition patterns along the river network in poland this means that the outputs presented in this study should not be used in isolation in river management planning however it is strongly recommended to use them in conjunction with field reconnaissance and additional detailed examination of aerial photographs and satellite imagery the highest advantage of this study comes from the fact that it can be used in the first phase of water management planning aimed at indicating potential areas of interest depending on the objective of the implemented project preventing either excessive erosion or deposition particular reaches can be selected and subject to further detailed analysis the output presented here covering the entire country is of great importance for river managers developing management plans at a national level 5 conclusion this paper examines the application of the sp concept at a national scale to indicate potential areas river sectors prone to erosion deposition or remaining in the equilibrium state high resolution datasets on topography lidar based and river flow records as well as channel cross section measurements were used to calculate average sp for 26694 river sectors in poland our results permit drawing the following conclusions dem derived water surface elevations extracted in a traditional way were overestimated by 0 5 m 1st quartile value for 730 gauging stations due to vegetation presence resulting in general overestimation of stream gradients across poland adopting the buffer approach method for extracting water elevation from dem reduced the elevation overestimation to 0 16 m 1st quartile value for 730 gauging stations and provided generally lower slope values reducing the impact of vegetation dominating processes distribution in polish rivers is strongly governed by the character and origin of the terrain relief and lithological diversity for regions characterised by flat relief most channels are in the equilibrium state whereas in upland and mountainous regions erosion processes are dominant the outputs presented in this study should not be used in isolation in river

years of daily rainfall data gridded 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution from 1970 to 2019 has been taken from india meteorological department imd to compute extreme precipitation indices using climpact2 package and time series trend was tested by mann kendall further 51 grid points are divided into three regions region 1 region 2 and region 3 as per the agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin the region wise agroclimatic rainfall variability has been analyzed using monthly standard deviation and anomaly index the run theory was applied for the characterization of drought assessment standardized precipitation index spi was performed for 3 6 12 and 24 months the result found a consecutive dry day cdd with increasing trend significantly and consecutive wet days cwd with decreasing trend may cause a possible impact on agriculture findings revealed that region 2 recorded consequent frequent and maximum droughts events over the basin hence the regional topography and moisture availability perform a major role in regional precipitation variability the output of the current study would be utilized in a better understanding of the drought condition and give a better climate change indication at a regional basin level this finding may be valuable for researchers to find out the crucial agro climatic regions in the basin for preparedness for effective management and planning of water resources keywords agro climatic zones climpact2 drought duration extreme indices rainfall anomaly spi 1 introduction climate variability is a complex process involving the transition between weather variability and climate change presently many regions of the world is experiencing climate variability scafetta et al 2017 masroor et al 2020 and india is one among them dutt et al 2021 the variability in the climate has enhanced the frequency and intensity of the extreme events singh et al 2016 in 2018 the ar4 report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported and warned that the global air surface temperature may go by 1 5 c above the pre industrial baseline temperature between 2030 and 2052 ipcc 2018 sharma et al 2018 due to this changing trend hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts will increase thereby impacting the socio economic and agriculture sector of countries xenarios et al 2019 ipcc 2021 döll et al 2015 reported that almost all regions of the world are likely to experience the negative impact of climate change on water resources and their related ecosystems this will affect global water resources as well as the water availability for domestic and agricultural sectors gleick 2000 bringing in the risk of droughts due to a decrease in precipitation mishra and liu 2014 kim and jehanzaib 2020 many researchers examined the trend and variabilities of extreme precipitation like alexander et al 2006 who analyzed the extreme precipitation trend using different indices from 1951 to 2003 globally a recent study dahal et al 2019 in the roshi river basin reported an increasing trend of consecutive dry days cdd and heavy rainfall days and a decreasing trend in wet days silva et al 2015 observed significant ve trends for the number of cdd and the annual number of extreme precipitation events r30 the risks of precipitation extreme events in the future can be reduced by developing an understanding on or analyzing the spatio temporal extreme precipitation shifts trends and variations according to zhang et al 2017 all the climatic zones have a droughts occurrence feature as a result of arid weather conditions which may persist for long period to produce a serious imbalance in the hydrological cycle a drought will generally be more severe if the precipitation rate changes which causes an increase in other phenomena like greenhouse gases el nĩno southern oscillation enso and so on seneviratne et al 2012 masroor et al 2020 in view of this researchers used several drought indices the commonly used one is the standard precipitation index spi which was suggested by mckee et al 1993 and mckee et al 1995 for the analysis of precipitation data india meteorological department imd classifies a rainfall deficiency of 26 of long term normal rainfall as a drought condition imd 2014 recently the meteorological department has started using spi to calculate dry and wet conditions in countries masroor et al 2020 spi is used in conjunction with other indices such as the rainfall anomaly index rai to identify the intense episodes of drought sobral et al 2018 spi has the potential to identify the beginning and end of a drought event and evaluate the drought impact at various temporal scales monthly to annual the index has been employed in numerous studies as it is an easy measure that uses only precipitation to identify the different dimensions of drought such as duration intensity severity and frequency very limited studies have been carried out in assessing the spatio temporal drought characteristics in the adversely drought affected region of western india the mann kendall mk test owing to its a monotonic characteristics either increasing or decreasing trend is widely used for the significance test in trend analysis in various studies alemu and dioha 2020 india exhibits significant variation in spatial rainfall distribution the country also experience changes in characteristics of different river basins due to climate change pletterbauer et al 2018 lv et al 2019 meresa 2020 tabari 2020 documented the change in extreme rainfall due to climate change which is becoming more prominent nowadays the study on historical climatic trends have improved enormously singh and singh 2012 sharma et al 2018 gebrechorkos et al 2019 and results have highlighted that the changeing in the trend of extreme weather events is expected to have an intense effect on the global environment and worsen the existing problems in a regional river basin several studies westra et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 wei et al 2020 have shown that small changes in the scale and occurrence of precipitation can result in a large influence on the average yearly discharge from the basin the trend of mean annual rainfall reported by some studies at the all india scale are contradictory jain and kumar 2012 praveen et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 severe droughts and floods are projected to occur in 12 river basins of india gosain et al 2006 data from satellite remote sensing and radar is used for precipitation such as the high resolution trmm anagnostou and mei 2018 and nexrad stage iv radar mcgraw et al 2019 to examinethe flood frequency its intensity and related extreme events pingale et al 2014 investigated the spatial and temporal trend analysis for extreme events rainfall and temperature in the arid and semi arid climate of rajasthan where they were used the mann kendall test and found a ve ve trend of rainfall in some western states of india rajasthan gujarat and madhya pradesh the seasonal rivers have a strong connection with the different sectors of the region dryness or drought phenomena is a common problem in these states which has faced massive loss in crop production and water scarcity during the drought years samra 2004 roy and hirway 2007 therefore as per climatic region a prior information of trend variability and drought condition over various river basins is essential especially for the effective preparation and structure of rainfed farming in the field the important features of agro climatic zones are region specific which have a quality of soil type water vapor altitude landscape farming rainfall and other factors within the zone sandhu et al 2016 these agro climatic zones are delineated to understand the rainfall characteristics with a major focus on specific regions which can be used for efficient water resources measurement and planning of schemes government of india 1989 although normal precipitation trends and drought measurement have been studied at several space time levels in the existing literature such site specific studies examining drought characteristics in mahi river basin has not been attempted thus the main focus of the present study is to investigate trends and variations of rainfall with different drought characteristics over the agro climatic zones across mahi river basin the overall study is designed as follows section 1 describes the introduction of the study with some issues and challenges section 2 presents the study area with a climatic characteristic datasets and methodology highlighted in section 3 the results and discussion of the study are presented in sections 4 and the main findings conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 study area the mahi river one of the major west flowing inter state rivers of india which originates from the madhya pradesh tilt toward northern of the vindhya range at an elevation of 500 m amsl the basin is positioned between 72 21 e to 75 19 e and 21 46 n to 24 30 n fig 1 the length of mahi river is 500 km and covers a drainage area of about 34 842 km2 which is about 1 of the entire geographical area of india maurya et al 2021 on the north west it is bounded by the aravalli hills and on the east it is bounded by the ridge that separates it from the chambal basin this basin is made up of 2 sub basins mahi upper sub basin which contains 65 11 of the total basin 41 watersheds and mahi lower sub basin covering 34 89 of the area 22 watersheds bhawan and puram 2014 the mahi basin extends over the states of rajasthan having an area of 15 996 km2 41 73 15 474 km2 40 36 in gujarat and 6 866 km2 17 91 in madhya pradesh mowr 2014 the mean annual precipitation across the basin is 889 mm out of which a major part 97 of total is received during the 4 monsoon months june to september pawar and hire 2018 there are various water resources structures dams alongside the reach that hindrance and control the river flow of the stream there are two large dams in the basin mahi bajaj sagar in rajasthan and the kadana dam in gujarat however majority of the rural population work depending on agriculture farming for their livelihood practice almost entirely rainfed agriculture due to improper irrigation facilities mowr 2014 three agro climatic zones az are present in the basin i e region 1 gujarat plains and hills region 2 central plateau and hills region 3 western plateau and hills sandhu et al 2016 also the regions and distribution of imd grids as per agroclimatic zones over the mahi basin is shown in fig 1 3 database and methodology precipitation extremes and their variability was analyzed using the meteorological data trend analysis was used in this study to understand the changes that have occurred in the past decades the mann kendall significance test was used to analyze the series of trends of environmental and climatic data many studies have used this significance test across the globe with different datasets gadedjisso tossou et al 2020 saini et al 2020 agarwal et al 2021 drought related events and conditions during 1970 2019 were examined using spi the methodological framework used in this study is presented in fig 2 3 1 meteorological data high resolution daily gridded 0 25 0 25 rainfall dataset over india region for 1970 to 2019 was obtained from the imd pune http www imdpu ne gov in srivastava et al 2009 the daily dataset series for the 51 grid points over the basin was extracted the spatial location of these 51 grids is shown in fig 1 and their attributes in table 1 further the grid points were divided into three groups as per the agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin for further analysis this daily rainfall time series were aggregated into monthly rainfall values and analyzed for statistical calculation using python and r studio software for mapping and data analyzing arc gis 10 3 and r 4 0 2 software has been used inverse distance weightage idw method was used for interpolation to generate the spatial pattern of plots 3 2 rainfall anomaly index rai the rai ranks the rainfall values to determine the negative 0 and positive 0 anomalies as defined by van van rooy 1965 the range and classification of rai can be found in hänsel et al 2016 rai analyzes the frequency and intensity of the dry and rainy years in this study the annual accumulated rainfall of the mahi river basin for 50 years from 1970 to 2019 was used for calculating rai first we arranged the annual rainfall data in descending order then the top 10 highest values were averaged to calculate positive anomaly and vice versa for the negative anomaly these are calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively rai 3 n n m n v e a n o m a l i e s rai 3 n n x n v e a n o m a l i e s where n is the actual precipitation mm n is the long term average precipitation mm m is the mean of the top 10 highest values of n for the positive anomaly and x is vice versa of m for the negative anomaly 3 3 extreme climate indices in this study climpact2 software was used to calculate the climate indices by the inbuilt process of quality check and the missing values denoted by 99 9 the world meteorological organization wmo commission for climatology ccl expert team on sector specific climate indices et sci has identified and evaluated sector specific indices which are available at https climpact sci org get started as per our methodology we have selected a total of 10 precipitation indices for better recognizing the change in daily historical time series an explanatory list of the selected indices used in this study is presented in table 2 these indices were calculated for the 1970 2019 period using the climpact2 package developed by the meteorological service of canada details on the full set of climpact2 indices are easily available at https github com arccss extremes climpact2 3 4 standardized precipitation index spi in this study we have used the spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 to determine meteorological drought at numerous time gaps for the calculation of spi we have used the long term time series of precipitation data the spi on each time scale is defined as eq 3 3 spi xi x s where xi is precipitation x is the mean precipitation and s is the standard deviation the spi values vary from 3 to 3 and according to the calculation a positive value of spi shows greater than median precipitation while the negative value shows less than median precipitation tigkas et al 2015 the precipitation data for the period of 1970 to 2019 was used for the spatio temporal evaluation of spi at four different monthly scales 3 6 12 and 24 for the mahi river basin further to study the occurrence and characterization of drought events we used run theory which is proposed by yevjevich 1967 this theory is used for drought parameter identification and investigation of their statistical properties in terms of run length drought duration run sum drought severity and intensity in this study the value of 1 0 was selected as the threshold level the characteristics of the drought events i e drought duration intensity severity and frequency are measured using the run theory and following the details of drought characterization given in spinoni et al 2014 he et al 2016 and mesbahzadeh et al 2020 the spi 12 values were used to define drought identification and characterization of drought duration severity and intensity in all the three agro climatic regions over the basin using equations 4 and 5 4 ds j 1 dd i n d e x j e e denotes a drought event j is a month index j denotes the spi value in a month j 5 di ds dd where dd drought duration in month number of months between the start and end of a drought event ds drought severity the absolute sum of all drought index values during a drought event and di drought intensity the ratio of severity and the drought duration as per spi categories when the index reaches an intensity of 1 0 or less a drought event has occurred and the drought event is considered to have ended when the value of spi becomes positive mckee et al 1993 pandey et al 2021 4 results and discussions 4 1 spatio temporal variability of rainfall the long term annual average precipitation of the mahi river basin ranged from 630 mm to 1200 mm approximately during the period 1970 to 2019 as shown in fig 3 a the maximum annual precipitation 1113 mm was observed in the southern part of the basin i e vadodara region and the lowest was observed towards the northeast of the basin i e 630 mm the spatial distribution of the mean annual rainfall over the basin is represented by the isohyetal map in fig 3b the similarity in rainfall pattern was observed over the upper part of the basin i e some regions of rajasthan and madhya pradesh with 700 mm and 1000 mm respectively to examine the interannual variability of rainfall in the basin the drought years and the rainy years during the period from 1970 to 2019 were visualized using rai fig 4 if the value of rainfall anomaly is very low it relates to the severe drought periods which in the study are aranges from 5 23 in 1976 to 3 59 in 1985 the asymmetry in the rainfall was indicating the presence of interannual variability in the basin this is due to the northern part of the basin largely occupied in rajasthan comprised of sub tropical wet climate and a major part of the basin comprised of tropical wet climate caused mainly due to the existence of vindhyas and the western ghats as depicted in fig 4 the rai value was found to be very low over the mahi river basin van rooy 1965 moreover the output of rainfall abnormalities in fig 4 indicates that in a record many droughts have existed at an even more intense scale mowr 2014 but in the last 10 years droughts have been much less weak 4 2 rainfall variability in agro climatic zones depending on the agro climatic zones of india the entire imd grid point over the study area was divided into 3 regions region 1 gujarat plains and hills region 2 central plateau and hills and region 3 western plateau and hills as shown in fig 1 and table 1 moreover we investigated some statistics of long term rainfall variation in each zone over the basin on a monthly timescale likewise the changes in annual mean rainfall over 3 agro climatic regions for the entire basin during the period 1970 2019 are shown in fig 5 in all the three regions the highest mean annual rainfall was observed in region 1 2006 1639 mm year and region 3 1973 1575 mm year 2019 1589 mm year whereas the lowest mean annual rainfall detected in region 2 i e 2000 415 mm year which is consistent reported in the previous findings mowr 2014 jain et al 2017 4 3 spatial distribution of precipitation extremes in this section we have calculated the indices for extreme rainfall for the period 1970 to 2019 with spatial plots using the idw interpolation method only 10 precipitation indices were selected for this study and analyzed for 51 grid locations in the basin the results of which are shown in fig 6 a j the selected indices represent the diversity of precipitation characteristics and their intensity interestingly all the indices have different features like daily precipitation values percentile amounts and some are based on permanent thresholds that are significant to specific functions the descriptions of selective indices are presented in table 3 4 3 1 duration indices the extreme wetness and dryness of the basin are presented through duration indices it includes sequential dry days and continuous wet days as shown in fig 6a the cdd has a frequency range of 142 227 days from 1970 to 2019 the southern part of the lower basin i e regions of gujarat show some highest cdd which is decreased as we go northward towards the upper part of the basin i e rajasthan area the result of these duration indices indicates how the core region of agriculture over the basin gets dominated by extreme dry days on the other side the range of consecutive wet days was 7 16 days fig 6b the frequency distribution of cwd shows the inverse nature to the cdd with the highest frequency observed toward the center of the basin in the ratlam and vadodara region these findings are consistent with the results reported by pradhan et al 2019 which indicate a decreasing trend of cdd over rajasthan state 4 3 2 absolute indices we have calculated the absolute indices for maximum precipitation with 1 day rx1day and 5 day rx5day fig 6c d in both indices a similar spatial distribution was observed with a minor variation in intensity ranging from 73 to 154 mm rx1day and 146 to 277 mm rx5day respectively fig 6c d the indices shows the northern region of the basin to be experiencing highest maximum 1 day precipitation along with the south and south west region and was least around the central part of the basin overall the results of these indices indicate that the southern parts of the basin is much more at risk to flood related events similar results were reported in districts of gujarat by some previous research sridhar 2009 udani and mathur 2016 4 3 3 percentile based indices the intensity of the extreme rainfall is presented through percentile based indices through which we can easily identify the recent change in extreme precipitation and their related impact on other sectors very wet and extremely wet days are represented by precipitation amounts above 95th and 99th percentile for r95p and r99p respectively the range of both indices varies from 158 to 330 mm and 50 to 117 mm respectively fig 6e f the spatial distribution of both indices fig 6e b indicates that very wet and extremely wet days are more the eastern region of the basin and minimum toward the northern region which covers rajasthan districts like udaipur and chittorgarh 4 3 4 threshold indices in this section we have calculated the number of days with rainfall values below or above a fixed threshold scale indices like the amount of heavy precipitation and very heavy precipitation days are used in this study fig 6 g h presents the spatial distribution of both indices showing observed annual frequency of r10mm and r20mm to be varying in the range of 18 28 days and 9 16 days respectively the number of very heavy precipitation days is high in the eastern region of the basin including some districts of madhya pradesh like ratlam and while the north and north west parts of the basin experience relatively less heavy rainfall if the frequency of these indices increases significantly it will cause a severe impact on the hilly regions and agriculture losses are secondary we have also analyzed other indices like total annual precipitation and simple daily intensity index represented by prcptot and sdii respectively the maximum concentration of prcptot varies from 624 to 1106 mm fig 6i with an east to south gradient high elevation and the presence of aravalli ranges make the northern region to have lower amount of prcptot sdii is maximum in the central parts of the mahi basin and lies within a range of 13 to 23 mm day fig 6j these findings are consistent with the studies of yao et al 2021 which projected an increase in prcptot and sdii in central asia overall the result of these indices highlights and indicates the water stress conditions towards the northern and southern belt of the basin 4 4 trend analysis of extreme precipitation indices in addition to the average values the trends of indices were also analyzed to understand and reach at conclusions on events related to climate change with the help of trend analysis we can understand present climatic conditions and predict future scenarios easily in the present study trend analysis of the selected 10 precipitation indices was carried out for 51 grid locations in the basin and their results are summarized in fig 7 a j table 3 presents the total percentage of the grid with major class cover to identify the precipitation trend where a 100 value shows for all grid points the cwd index showed decreasing trend in almost in all stations on the contrary the cdd has shown a positive trend within the study area only 60 78 of the grid points represent an insignificant increasing trend for cdd out of which a total of 6 points shows a significant trend over the basin fig 7a b in the case of consecutive wet days 35 stations 68 62 represented decreasing trend with no significant increase fig 7b moreover it was observed that grid points with high elevation showed an increasing trend in cdd while regions near coastal areas show a decreasing trend including some parts of madhya pradesh for percentile based indices r95p showed a trend of non significant increase at 60 78 of total stations and including 14 stations have a non significant decreasing trend fig 7f due to inter annual variation in rainfall no trend was observed in r99p fig 7g furthermore for absolute indices rx1day shows an insignificant decreasing trend at 54 90 of total stations but in rx5day 50 of stations have insignificant positive trends fig 7h i the findings highlighted from the indices results are that an increasing trend in indices was found in the upper part of mahi basin region of rajasthan and madhya pradesh which may experience severe rainfall events soil runoff with a negative impact on socio economy in the case of r10mm and r20mm most of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends by 50 to 60 fig 7d e fig 7c shows that aan insignificant decreasing trend in annual total wet day precipitation is observed in 56 86 of stations a similar significant decreasing trend of r10 and r20 was also reported by dubey and sharma 2018 over banas river basin the simple daily intensity index sdii shows an insignificant increasing trend in 54 90 of total stations fig 7j the maximum significant increasing trend was observed towards the upper basin covering areas of rajasthan 4 5 changes in precipitation indices to determine the change in extreme precipitation indices we have divided the whole period into two parts i e 1970 1994 1 and 1995 2019 2 calculated the change between the two the average of each index value at all the grid points indicates the change in the precipitation regime the spatial distribution of change in various precipitation indices are shown in fig 8 a j as shown in fig 8a cdd has decreased in the lowland coastal area of the basin increased in the upper part of the basin i e area of rajasthan with a maximum positive change of 22 59 days whereas for cwd the change was reverse i e high and positive change was observed toward the southern region of the basin fig 8b in the case of the prcptot index a mixed type of change was observed over the study area fig 8c the maximum negative change was found at banswara and vadodara stations r10 and r20 represent the number of heavy and very heavy precipitation days both the indices show the same type of spatial distribution of precipitation fig 8d e the maximum negative change is confined towards the north eastern part of the basin similarly the change in the intense 1 day precipitation indices was observed in the northeast parts of the basin chittorgarh and ratlam as shown in fig 8h whereasa reverse pattern was observed in 5 day precipitation indices fig 8i for r95p and r99p the maximum range of the ve changes were found in the northern and southern part of the basin respectively fig 8f g the maximum positive change is found at the chittorgarh region i e 93 92 mm which reflects those wet days with more rain the result of precipitation changes is consistent with the previous finding liu et al 2016 further we have divided the imd grid points into three regions as per the agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin which are presented in table 1 and the region wise values of the indices was also shown table 4 the length of the dry spell cdd is decreased in region 1 and region 3 except region 2 whereas in almost all the indices the maximum decrease was observed in region 2 followed by region 1 this is because the climate of these regions is semi arid and cover some part of hilly areas on the other hand the decrease in prcptot was maximum in all the region 2 i e 48 7 mm the basin falling under this region are interspersed with plateau and hilly areas 4 6 drought assessment the spatial and temporal patterns of the rainfall amount is closely associated with drought evolution deng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 ye et al 2020 pandey et al 2021 hence to determine and monitor drought intensity spi has been used depending on threshold values of spi mckee et al 1993 the precipitation data for the period of 1970 to 2019 was used for the spatio temporal evaluation of spi at four different monthly scales 3 6 12 and 24 for the whole mahi river basin the time series of spi for the mahi river basin at 3 6 12 and 24 monthly scales are shown in fig 9 a d where the positive value with blue and negative value with red represent the average monthly spi for wet and dry periods respectively the spi 3 and spi 6 very well illustrate the monthly and seasonal fluctuation of precipitation deficit with smoother curves fig 9a b furthermore previously reported studies observed that the shorter time scales of spi values 3 and 6 accurately describe the early warning of meteorological drought along with soil moisture and crop health agricultural drought lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 okpara et al 2017 das et al 2020 in spi 12 due to cumulative duration the identification of wet and dry periods becomes much evident and reflects long term drought patterns hydrological drought though drought was severe before the year 2005 according to the spi 12 drought events were identified in the year 1971 1973 1984 1987 1992 1993 1999 2003 and 2009 2010 with intermittently normal and wet periods some previous studies jain et al 2007 mowr 2014 have widely reported the widespread drought of 2002 2003 and 2007 2008 that is well captured in the present study the mahi river basin is located adjacent to arabian sea which makes the basin more sensitive to to large scale natural occurring events like enso and its significant impact on drought conditions rojas et al 2014 saini and gulati 2014 4 6 1 drought identification and characterization we used the run theory for identification of drought duration severity and intensity in all three regions of agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin the spi 12 values were used to define drought event characteristics by averaging the value of each grid as per three agro climatic regions fig 10 a c the results indicated that all the three regions experienced nearly a similar number of droughts during the period 1970 to 2019 most drought events encountered 11 in region 2 of central plateau and hills while region 1 experienced 9 number of droughts events and region 3 of western plateau and hills experienced the lowest drought events 7 in region 1 it was also observed that the long term continuous drought events were observed in the period 1984 to 1987 and for region 2 it is 2000 to 2003 as shown in fig 10a b a similar result was also reported by masroor et al 2020 in which they found 1981 1992 and 2001 were extreme drought years in godavari middle sub basin using spi 12 4 6 2 spatial analysis of drought the temporal visualization and occurrence of drought events in three agro climatic regions over the mahi river basin illustrated in fig 11 a c as per drought duration dd drought intensity di and drought severity ds of region 2 the 1999 2004 6th drought event was the longest and the most severe one with an average dd of 24 ds 20 41 di 0 75 and moreover these droughts interestingly has a smooth transition of five drought years that started in september 1999 to july 2004 fig 11b the similar result of drought events in region 2 some districts of southern rajasthan was also reported by rathore 2004 the highest number of drought event occurred in region 2 9 followed by region 3 and region 1 i e 7 as shown in table 5 on the other hand the maximum drought intensity was observed in 2nd drought event of region 1 1 62 followed by region 3 and region 1 1 33 table 5 summarizes the three agro climatic regions wise descriptive statistics of the drought events in the mahi river basin the highest drought events were recorded in region 2 which covers the rajasthan area and minimum in both region 1 and region 3 overall it is observed that some previous studies have also widely reported the widespread drought of 1974 1975 1984 1988 1991 1993 and 1999 2003 that is well captured in all three agroclimatic zones of the present study shewale and kumar 2005 roy and hirway 2007 the longest and maximum drought duration was observed as 59 consequent months observed in region 2 with a severity of 78 33 and an intensity of 1 33 as presented in table 5 fig 12 a c shows the spatial variation in average duration severity and intensity for all the three agro climatic regions during the years 1970 2019 the average dd identified by spi 12 was 31 months region 1 24 months region 2 and 29 months region 3 the maximum drought duration was observed over the gujarat plains and hills a similar study over bundelkhand region was carried out using chirps dataset pandey et al 2021 severe drought was observed in all three regions with ds varies from 20 41 to 28 58 and the maximum was estimated in region 3 fig 12b the average di of drought events for all the regions varies from 0 75 to 0 95 and maximum in region 1 fig 12c overall results illustrated that the maximum droughts duration measure over region 2 of central plateau and hills fig 12a its characteristics depend on the geographic location and existing climatic condition of an area 5 conclusions the study explored the space time attributes of rainfall and conclude that the rainfall variability is highly significant in the upper and lower part of the mahi basin in contrast rainfall anomaly accurately monitors the occurrence of meteorological droughts over the basin because the increase in the number of dry days is directly related to the occurrence of drought the inter annual variability of rainfall was also observed in 3 agro climatic zones over the basin on a monthly scale most of the rainfall received in monsoon months which is highly affected by local or regional temperature profile due to this sometimes the pre monsoon months are badly affected by a thunderstorm caused extreme drought conditions and prolonged risk of dry spells over the study region the main finding of the precipitation extremes that the rainfall in central and eastern regions of the basin is very concentrated while less rainfall is received over the southern part of the basin near the coastal area this is due to the heating of the arabian sea and tropospheric warming which lead to the movement of low level jet stream toward the upper region of the basin xavier et al 2018 varikoden et al 2019 viswanadhapalli et al 2020 the finding of extreme indices indicates cdd with increasing trend and cwd with decreasing pattern over the basin due to this extreme variation in rainfall majority of the cultivated area of the basin is dominated by dryness or dry days resulting in drought events the result of some indices also accelerates the water scarcity situation and decreases agricultural efficiency overall the agro climatic region wise result of extreme indices indicates that regions 1 and 3 experience the high intensity of rainfall rx1day and sdii decline in region 1 and region 2 in the north and northeast part of the region variations in precipitation directly affect the agriculture of an area along with its associated sectors hence the outcomes of precipitation indices maybe help in planning of various sectors activities over the basin such as like agriculture planning watershed management etc this study has also investigated the temporal variations and spatial patterns of spi to identify the drought characteristic in the mahi river basin and agro climatic regions from 1970 to 2019 the result of spi concluded that the basin experienced severe drought events before 2005 using spi 12 the agro climatic zone wise drought event observed highest in region 2 of central plateau and hills i e 11 drought events moreover the remarkable longest and severe drought spell was observed during 1999 to 2003 region 2 understanding rainfall patterns protect the productivity of other resources by water scarcity which may increase potential drought events in the climatic region of the mahi basin hence spi emerge as an effective index for time space analysis of dry and wet conditions over the basin overall these results give a clear indication of a risk of prolonged dry spells in agro climatic regions during the cropping season that would negatively impact crop productivity and increase concern over food security such integrated analysis of rainfall patterns with agro climatic regions may be beneficial in the planning of water related activities and strategies that can combat the impact of changing climate on agriculture and other productivity in the face of climate change the current study may help and suggest some strategies for irrigation facilities during the crop growing periods credit authorship

3744,understanding the trend and variability in hydroclimatic extremes as well as drought characteristics in the context of changing climate is of paramount importance in the management of watershed and rain fed farming systems this study focuses on understanding the variations in rainfall patterns drought types with 3 regions of the agro climatic zone in the mahi river basin india the basin is surrounded by three states i e rajasthan madhya pradesh and gujarat which is known for its substantial drought occurrences very limited studies have been carried out using agroclimatic indices a 50 years of daily rainfall data gridded 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution from 1970 to 2019 has been taken from india meteorological department imd to compute extreme precipitation indices using climpact2 package and time series trend was tested by mann kendall further 51 grid points are divided into three regions region 1 region 2 and region 3 as per the agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin the region wise agroclimatic rainfall variability has been analyzed using monthly standard deviation and anomaly index the run theory was applied for the characterization of drought assessment standardized precipitation index spi was performed for 3 6 12 and 24 months the result found a consecutive dry day cdd with increasing trend significantly and consecutive wet days cwd with decreasing trend may cause a possible impact on agriculture findings revealed that region 2 recorded consequent frequent and maximum droughts events over the basin hence the regional topography and moisture availability perform a major role in regional precipitation variability the output of the current study would be utilized in a better understanding of the drought condition and give a better climate change indication at a regional basin level this finding may be valuable for researchers to find out the crucial agro climatic regions in the basin for preparedness for effective management and planning of water resources keywords agro climatic zones climpact2 drought duration extreme indices rainfall anomaly spi 1 introduction climate variability is a complex process involving the transition between weather variability and climate change presently many regions of the world is experiencing climate variability scafetta et al 2017 masroor et al 2020 and india is one among them dutt et al 2021 the variability in the climate has enhanced the frequency and intensity of the extreme events singh et al 2016 in 2018 the ar4 report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reported and warned that the global air surface temperature may go by 1 5 c above the pre industrial baseline temperature between 2030 and 2052 ipcc 2018 sharma et al 2018 due to this changing trend hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts will increase thereby impacting the socio economic and agriculture sector of countries xenarios et al 2019 ipcc 2021 döll et al 2015 reported that almost all regions of the world are likely to experience the negative impact of climate change on water resources and their related ecosystems this will affect global water resources as well as the water availability for domestic and agricultural sectors gleick 2000 bringing in the risk of droughts due to a decrease in precipitation mishra and liu 2014 kim and jehanzaib 2020 many researchers examined the trend and variabilities of extreme precipitation like alexander et al 2006 who analyzed the extreme precipitation trend using different indices from 1951 to 2003 globally a recent study dahal et al 2019 in the roshi river basin reported an increasing trend of consecutive dry days cdd and heavy rainfall days and a decreasing trend in wet days silva et al 2015 observed significant ve trends for the number of cdd and the annual number of extreme precipitation events r30 the risks of precipitation extreme events in the future can be reduced by developing an understanding on or analyzing the spatio temporal extreme precipitation shifts trends and variations according to zhang et al 2017 all the climatic zones have a droughts occurrence feature as a result of arid weather conditions which may persist for long period to produce a serious imbalance in the hydrological cycle a drought will generally be more severe if the precipitation rate changes which causes an increase in other phenomena like greenhouse gases el nĩno southern oscillation enso and so on seneviratne et al 2012 masroor et al 2020 in view of this researchers used several drought indices the commonly used one is the standard precipitation index spi which was suggested by mckee et al 1993 and mckee et al 1995 for the analysis of precipitation data india meteorological department imd classifies a rainfall deficiency of 26 of long term normal rainfall as a drought condition imd 2014 recently the meteorological department has started using spi to calculate dry and wet conditions in countries masroor et al 2020 spi is used in conjunction with other indices such as the rainfall anomaly index rai to identify the intense episodes of drought sobral et al 2018 spi has the potential to identify the beginning and end of a drought event and evaluate the drought impact at various temporal scales monthly to annual the index has been employed in numerous studies as it is an easy measure that uses only precipitation to identify the different dimensions of drought such as duration intensity severity and frequency very limited studies have been carried out in assessing the spatio temporal drought characteristics in the adversely drought affected region of western india the mann kendall mk test owing to its a monotonic characteristics either increasing or decreasing trend is widely used for the significance test in trend analysis in various studies alemu and dioha 2020 india exhibits significant variation in spatial rainfall distribution the country also experience changes in characteristics of different river basins due to climate change pletterbauer et al 2018 lv et al 2019 meresa 2020 tabari 2020 documented the change in extreme rainfall due to climate change which is becoming more prominent nowadays the study on historical climatic trends have improved enormously singh and singh 2012 sharma et al 2018 gebrechorkos et al 2019 and results have highlighted that the changeing in the trend of extreme weather events is expected to have an intense effect on the global environment and worsen the existing problems in a regional river basin several studies westra et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 wei et al 2020 have shown that small changes in the scale and occurrence of precipitation can result in a large influence on the average yearly discharge from the basin the trend of mean annual rainfall reported by some studies at the all india scale are contradictory jain and kumar 2012 praveen et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 severe droughts and floods are projected to occur in 12 river basins of india gosain et al 2006 data from satellite remote sensing and radar is used for precipitation such as the high resolution trmm anagnostou and mei 2018 and nexrad stage iv radar mcgraw et al 2019 to examinethe flood frequency its intensity and related extreme events pingale et al 2014 investigated the spatial and temporal trend analysis for extreme events rainfall and temperature in the arid and semi arid climate of rajasthan where they were used the mann kendall test and found a ve ve trend of rainfall in some western states of india rajasthan gujarat and madhya pradesh the seasonal rivers have a strong connection with the different sectors of the region dryness or drought phenomena is a common problem in these states which has faced massive loss in crop production and water scarcity during the drought years samra 2004 roy and hirway 2007 therefore as per climatic region a prior information of trend variability and drought condition over various river basins is essential especially for the effective preparation and structure of rainfed farming in the field the important features of agro climatic zones are region specific which have a quality of soil type water vapor altitude landscape farming rainfall and other factors within the zone sandhu et al 2016 these agro climatic zones are delineated to understand the rainfall characteristics with a major focus on specific regions which can be used for efficient water resources measurement and planning of schemes government of india 1989 although normal precipitation trends and drought measurement have been studied at several space time levels in the existing literature such site specific studies examining drought characteristics in mahi river basin has not been attempted thus the main focus of the present study is to investigate trends and variations of rainfall with different drought characteristics over the agro climatic zones across mahi river basin the overall study is designed as follows section 1 describes the introduction of the study with some issues and challenges section 2 presents the study area with a climatic characteristic datasets and methodology highlighted in section 3 the results and discussion of the study are presented in sections 4 and the main findings conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 study area the mahi river one of the major west flowing inter state rivers of india which originates from the madhya pradesh tilt toward northern of the vindhya range at an elevation of 500 m amsl the basin is positioned between 72 21 e to 75 19 e and 21 46 n to 24 30 n fig 1 the length of mahi river is 500 km and covers a drainage area of about 34 842 km2 which is about 1 of the entire geographical area of india maurya et al 2021 on the north west it is bounded by the aravalli hills and on the east it is bounded by the ridge that separates it from the chambal basin this basin is made up of 2 sub basins mahi upper sub basin which contains 65 11 of the total basin 41 watersheds and mahi lower sub basin covering 34 89 of the area 22 watersheds bhawan and puram 2014 the mahi basin extends over the states of rajasthan having an area of 15 996 km2 41 73 15 474 km2 40 36 in gujarat and 6 866 km2 17 91 in madhya pradesh mowr 2014 the mean annual precipitation across the basin is 889 mm out of which a major part 97 of total is received during the 4 monsoon months june to september pawar and hire 2018 there are various water resources structures dams alongside the reach that hindrance and control the river flow of the stream there are two large dams in the basin mahi bajaj sagar in rajasthan and the kadana dam in gujarat however majority of the rural population work depending on agriculture farming for their livelihood practice almost entirely rainfed agriculture due to improper irrigation facilities mowr 2014 three agro climatic zones az are present in the basin i e region 1 gujarat plains and hills region 2 central plateau and hills region 3 western plateau and hills sandhu et al 2016 also the regions and distribution of imd grids as per agroclimatic zones over the mahi basin is shown in fig 1 3 database and methodology precipitation extremes and their variability was analyzed using the meteorological data trend analysis was used in this study to understand the changes that have occurred in the past decades the mann kendall significance test was used to analyze the series of trends of environmental and climatic data many studies have used this significance test across the globe with different datasets gadedjisso tossou et al 2020 saini et al 2020 agarwal et al 2021 drought related events and conditions during 1970 2019 were examined using spi the methodological framework used in this study is presented in fig 2 3 1 meteorological data high resolution daily gridded 0 25 0 25 rainfall dataset over india region for 1970 to 2019 was obtained from the imd pune http www imdpu ne gov in srivastava et al 2009 the daily dataset series for the 51 grid points over the basin was extracted the spatial location of these 51 grids is shown in fig 1 and their attributes in table 1 further the grid points were divided into three groups as per the agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin for further analysis this daily rainfall time series were aggregated into monthly rainfall values and analyzed for statistical calculation using python and r studio software for mapping and data analyzing arc gis 10 3 and r 4 0 2 software has been used inverse distance weightage idw method was used for interpolation to generate the spatial pattern of plots 3 2 rainfall anomaly index rai the rai ranks the rainfall values to determine the negative 0 and positive 0 anomalies as defined by van van rooy 1965 the range and classification of rai can be found in hänsel et al 2016 rai analyzes the frequency and intensity of the dry and rainy years in this study the annual accumulated rainfall of the mahi river basin for 50 years from 1970 to 2019 was used for calculating rai first we arranged the annual rainfall data in descending order then the top 10 highest values were averaged to calculate positive anomaly and vice versa for the negative anomaly these are calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively rai 3 n n m n v e a n o m a l i e s rai 3 n n x n v e a n o m a l i e s where n is the actual precipitation mm n is the long term average precipitation mm m is the mean of the top 10 highest values of n for the positive anomaly and x is vice versa of m for the negative anomaly 3 3 extreme climate indices in this study climpact2 software was used to calculate the climate indices by the inbuilt process of quality check and the missing values denoted by 99 9 the world meteorological organization wmo commission for climatology ccl expert team on sector specific climate indices et sci has identified and evaluated sector specific indices which are available at https climpact sci org get started as per our methodology we have selected a total of 10 precipitation indices for better recognizing the change in daily historical time series an explanatory list of the selected indices used in this study is presented in table 2 these indices were calculated for the 1970 2019 period using the climpact2 package developed by the meteorological service of canada details on the full set of climpact2 indices are easily available at https github com arccss extremes climpact2 3 4 standardized precipitation index spi in this study we have used the spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 to determine meteorological drought at numerous time gaps for the calculation of spi we have used the long term time series of precipitation data the spi on each time scale is defined as eq 3 3 spi xi x s where xi is precipitation x is the mean precipitation and s is the standard deviation the spi values vary from 3 to 3 and according to the calculation a positive value of spi shows greater than median precipitation while the negative value shows less than median precipitation tigkas et al 2015 the precipitation data for the period of 1970 to 2019 was used for the spatio temporal evaluation of spi at four different monthly scales 3 6 12 and 24 for the mahi river basin further to study the occurrence and characterization of drought events we used run theory which is proposed by yevjevich 1967 this theory is used for drought parameter identification and investigation of their statistical properties in terms of run length drought duration run sum drought severity and intensity in this study the value of 1 0 was selected as the threshold level the characteristics of the drought events i e drought duration intensity severity and frequency are measured using the run theory and following the details of drought characterization given in spinoni et al 2014 he et al 2016 and mesbahzadeh et al 2020 the spi 12 values were used to define drought identification and characterization of drought duration severity and intensity in all the three agro climatic regions over the basin using equations 4 and 5 4 ds j 1 dd i n d e x j e e denotes a drought event j is a month index j denotes the spi value in a month j 5 di ds dd where dd drought duration in month number of months between the start and end of a drought event ds drought severity the absolute sum of all drought index values during a drought event and di drought intensity the ratio of severity and the drought duration as per spi categories when the index reaches an intensity of 1 0 or less a drought event has occurred and the drought event is considered to have ended when the value of spi becomes positive mckee et al 1993 pandey et al 2021 4 results and discussions 4 1 spatio temporal variability of rainfall the long term annual average precipitation of the mahi river basin ranged from 630 mm to 1200 mm approximately during the period 1970 to 2019 as shown in fig 3 a the maximum annual precipitation 1113 mm was observed in the southern part of the basin i e vadodara region and the lowest was observed towards the northeast of the basin i e 630 mm the spatial distribution of the mean annual rainfall over the basin is represented by the isohyetal map in fig 3b the similarity in rainfall pattern was observed over the upper part of the basin i e some regions of rajasthan and madhya pradesh with 700 mm and 1000 mm respectively to examine the interannual variability of rainfall in the basin the drought years and the rainy years during the period from 1970 to 2019 were visualized using rai fig 4 if the value of rainfall anomaly is very low it relates to the severe drought periods which in the study are aranges from 5 23 in 1976 to 3 59 in 1985 the asymmetry in the rainfall was indicating the presence of interannual variability in the basin this is due to the northern part of the basin largely occupied in rajasthan comprised of sub tropical wet climate and a major part of the basin comprised of tropical wet climate caused mainly due to the existence of vindhyas and the western ghats as depicted in fig 4 the rai value was found to be very low over the mahi river basin van rooy 1965 moreover the output of rainfall abnormalities in fig 4 indicates that in a record many droughts have existed at an even more intense scale mowr 2014 but in the last 10 years droughts have been much less weak 4 2 rainfall variability in agro climatic zones depending on the agro climatic zones of india the entire imd grid point over the study area was divided into 3 regions region 1 gujarat plains and hills region 2 central plateau and hills and region 3 western plateau and hills as shown in fig 1 and table 1 moreover we investigated some statistics of long term rainfall variation in each zone over the basin on a monthly timescale likewise the changes in annual mean rainfall over 3 agro climatic regions for the entire basin during the period 1970 2019 are shown in fig 5 in all the three regions the highest mean annual rainfall was observed in region 1 2006 1639 mm year and region 3 1973 1575 mm year 2019 1589 mm year whereas the lowest mean annual rainfall detected in region 2 i e 2000 415 mm year which is consistent reported in the previous findings mowr 2014 jain et al 2017 4 3 spatial distribution of precipitation extremes in this section we have calculated the indices for extreme rainfall for the period 1970 to 2019 with spatial plots using the idw interpolation method only 10 precipitation indices were selected for this study and analyzed for 51 grid locations in the basin the results of which are shown in fig 6 a j the selected indices represent the diversity of precipitation characteristics and their intensity interestingly all the indices have different features like daily precipitation values percentile amounts and some are based on permanent thresholds that are significant to specific functions the descriptions of selective indices are presented in table 3 4 3 1 duration indices the extreme wetness and dryness of the basin are presented through duration indices it includes sequential dry days and continuous wet days as shown in fig 6a the cdd has a frequency range of 142 227 days from 1970 to 2019 the southern part of the lower basin i e regions of gujarat show some highest cdd which is decreased as we go northward towards the upper part of the basin i e rajasthan area the result of these duration indices indicates how the core region of agriculture over the basin gets dominated by extreme dry days on the other side the range of consecutive wet days was 7 16 days fig 6b the frequency distribution of cwd shows the inverse nature to the cdd with the highest frequency observed toward the center of the basin in the ratlam and vadodara region these findings are consistent with the results reported by pradhan et al 2019 which indicate a decreasing trend of cdd over rajasthan state 4 3 2 absolute indices we have calculated the absolute indices for maximum precipitation with 1 day rx1day and 5 day rx5day fig 6c d in both indices a similar spatial distribution was observed with a minor variation in intensity ranging from 73 to 154 mm rx1day and 146 to 277 mm rx5day respectively fig 6c d the indices shows the northern region of the basin to be experiencing highest maximum 1 day precipitation along with the south and south west region and was least around the central part of the basin overall the results of these indices indicate that the southern parts of the basin is much more at risk to flood related events similar results were reported in districts of gujarat by some previous research sridhar 2009 udani and mathur 2016 4 3 3 percentile based indices the intensity of the extreme rainfall is presented through percentile based indices through which we can easily identify the recent change in extreme precipitation and their related impact on other sectors very wet and extremely wet days are represented by precipitation amounts above 95th and 99th percentile for r95p and r99p respectively the range of both indices varies from 158 to 330 mm and 50 to 117 mm respectively fig 6e f the spatial distribution of both indices fig 6e b indicates that very wet and extremely wet days are more the eastern region of the basin and minimum toward the northern region which covers rajasthan districts like udaipur and chittorgarh 4 3 4 threshold indices in this section we have calculated the number of days with rainfall values below or above a fixed threshold scale indices like the amount of heavy precipitation and very heavy precipitation days are used in this study fig 6 g h presents the spatial distribution of both indices showing observed annual frequency of r10mm and r20mm to be varying in the range of 18 28 days and 9 16 days respectively the number of very heavy precipitation days is high in the eastern region of the basin including some districts of madhya pradesh like ratlam and while the north and north west parts of the basin experience relatively less heavy rainfall if the frequency of these indices increases significantly it will cause a severe impact on the hilly regions and agriculture losses are secondary we have also analyzed other indices like total annual precipitation and simple daily intensity index represented by prcptot and sdii respectively the maximum concentration of prcptot varies from 624 to 1106 mm fig 6i with an east to south gradient high elevation and the presence of aravalli ranges make the northern region to have lower amount of prcptot sdii is maximum in the central parts of the mahi basin and lies within a range of 13 to 23 mm day fig 6j these findings are consistent with the studies of yao et al 2021 which projected an increase in prcptot and sdii in central asia overall the result of these indices highlights and indicates the water stress conditions towards the northern and southern belt of the basin 4 4 trend analysis of extreme precipitation indices in addition to the average values the trends of indices were also analyzed to understand and reach at conclusions on events related to climate change with the help of trend analysis we can understand present climatic conditions and predict future scenarios easily in the present study trend analysis of the selected 10 precipitation indices was carried out for 51 grid locations in the basin and their results are summarized in fig 7 a j table 3 presents the total percentage of the grid with major class cover to identify the precipitation trend where a 100 value shows for all grid points the cwd index showed decreasing trend in almost in all stations on the contrary the cdd has shown a positive trend within the study area only 60 78 of the grid points represent an insignificant increasing trend for cdd out of which a total of 6 points shows a significant trend over the basin fig 7a b in the case of consecutive wet days 35 stations 68 62 represented decreasing trend with no significant increase fig 7b moreover it was observed that grid points with high elevation showed an increasing trend in cdd while regions near coastal areas show a decreasing trend including some parts of madhya pradesh for percentile based indices r95p showed a trend of non significant increase at 60 78 of total stations and including 14 stations have a non significant decreasing trend fig 7f due to inter annual variation in rainfall no trend was observed in r99p fig 7g furthermore for absolute indices rx1day shows an insignificant decreasing trend at 54 90 of total stations but in rx5day 50 of stations have insignificant positive trends fig 7h i the findings highlighted from the indices results are that an increasing trend in indices was found in the upper part of mahi basin region of rajasthan and madhya pradesh which may experience severe rainfall events soil runoff with a negative impact on socio economy in the case of r10mm and r20mm most of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends by 50 to 60 fig 7d e fig 7c shows that aan insignificant decreasing trend in annual total wet day precipitation is observed in 56 86 of stations a similar significant decreasing trend of r10 and r20 was also reported by dubey and sharma 2018 over banas river basin the simple daily intensity index sdii shows an insignificant increasing trend in 54 90 of total stations fig 7j the maximum significant increasing trend was observed towards the upper basin covering areas of rajasthan 4 5 changes in precipitation indices to determine the change in extreme precipitation indices we have divided the whole period into two parts i e 1970 1994 1 and 1995 2019 2 calculated the change between the two the average of each index value at all the grid points indicates the change in the precipitation regime the spatial distribution of change in various precipitation indices are shown in fig 8 a j as shown in fig 8a cdd has decreased in the lowland coastal area of the basin increased in the upper part of the basin i e area of rajasthan with a maximum positive change of 22 59 days whereas for cwd the change was reverse i e high and positive change was observed toward the southern region of the basin fig 8b in the case of the prcptot index a mixed type of change was observed over the study area fig 8c the maximum negative change was found at banswara and vadodara stations r10 and r20 represent the number of heavy and very heavy precipitation days both the indices show the same type of spatial distribution of precipitation fig 8d e the maximum negative change is confined towards the north eastern part of the basin similarly the change in the intense 1 day precipitation indices was observed in the northeast parts of the basin chittorgarh and ratlam as shown in fig 8h whereasa reverse pattern was observed in 5 day precipitation indices fig 8i for r95p and r99p the maximum range of the ve changes were found in the northern and southern part of the basin respectively fig 8f g the maximum positive change is found at the chittorgarh region i e 93 92 mm which reflects those wet days with more rain the result of precipitation changes is consistent with the previous finding liu et al 2016 further we have divided the imd grid points into three regions as per the agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin which are presented in table 1 and the region wise values of the indices was also shown table 4 the length of the dry spell cdd is decreased in region 1 and region 3 except region 2 whereas in almost all the indices the maximum decrease was observed in region 2 followed by region 1 this is because the climate of these regions is semi arid and cover some part of hilly areas on the other hand the decrease in prcptot was maximum in all the region 2 i e 48 7 mm the basin falling under this region are interspersed with plateau and hilly areas 4 6 drought assessment the spatial and temporal patterns of the rainfall amount is closely associated with drought evolution deng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 ye et al 2020 pandey et al 2021 hence to determine and monitor drought intensity spi has been used depending on threshold values of spi mckee et al 1993 the precipitation data for the period of 1970 to 2019 was used for the spatio temporal evaluation of spi at four different monthly scales 3 6 12 and 24 for the whole mahi river basin the time series of spi for the mahi river basin at 3 6 12 and 24 monthly scales are shown in fig 9 a d where the positive value with blue and negative value with red represent the average monthly spi for wet and dry periods respectively the spi 3 and spi 6 very well illustrate the monthly and seasonal fluctuation of precipitation deficit with smoother curves fig 9a b furthermore previously reported studies observed that the shorter time scales of spi values 3 and 6 accurately describe the early warning of meteorological drought along with soil moisture and crop health agricultural drought lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 okpara et al 2017 das et al 2020 in spi 12 due to cumulative duration the identification of wet and dry periods becomes much evident and reflects long term drought patterns hydrological drought though drought was severe before the year 2005 according to the spi 12 drought events were identified in the year 1971 1973 1984 1987 1992 1993 1999 2003 and 2009 2010 with intermittently normal and wet periods some previous studies jain et al 2007 mowr 2014 have widely reported the widespread drought of 2002 2003 and 2007 2008 that is well captured in the present study the mahi river basin is located adjacent to arabian sea which makes the basin more sensitive to to large scale natural occurring events like enso and its significant impact on drought conditions rojas et al 2014 saini and gulati 2014 4 6 1 drought identification and characterization we used the run theory for identification of drought duration severity and intensity in all three regions of agro climatic zones over the mahi river basin the spi 12 values were used to define drought event characteristics by averaging the value of each grid as per three agro climatic regions fig 10 a c the results indicated that all the three regions experienced nearly a similar number of droughts during the period 1970 to 2019 most drought events encountered 11 in region 2 of central plateau and hills while region 1 experienced 9 number of droughts events and region 3 of western plateau and hills experienced the lowest drought events 7 in region 1 it was also observed that the long term continuous drought events were observed in the period 1984 to 1987 and for region 2 it is 2000 to 2003 as shown in fig 10a b a similar result was also reported by masroor et al 2020 in which they found 1981 1992 and 2001 were extreme drought years in godavari middle sub basin using spi 12 4 6 2 spatial analysis of drought the temporal visualization and occurrence of drought events in three agro climatic regions over the mahi river basin illustrated in fig 11 a c as per drought duration dd drought intensity di and drought severity ds of region 2 the 1999 2004 6th drought event was the longest and the most severe one with an average dd of 24 ds 20 41 di 0 75 and moreover these droughts interestingly has a smooth transition of five drought years that started in september 1999 to july 2004 fig 11b the similar result of drought events in region 2 some districts of southern rajasthan was also reported by rathore 2004 the highest number of drought event occurred in region 2 9 followed by region 3 and region 1 i e 7 as shown in table 5 on the other hand the maximum drought intensity was observed in 2nd drought event of region 1 1 62 followed by region 3 and region 1 1 33 table 5 summarizes the three agro climatic regions wise descriptive statistics of the drought events in the mahi river basin the highest drought events were recorded in region 2 which covers the rajasthan area and minimum in both region 1 and region 3 overall it is observed that some previous studies have also widely reported the widespread drought of 1974 1975 1984 1988 1991 1993 and 1999 2003 that is well captured in all three agroclimatic zones of the present study shewale and kumar 2005 roy and hirway 2007 the longest and maximum drought duration was observed as 59 consequent months observed in region 2 with a severity of 78 33 and an intensity of 1 33 as presented in table 5 fig 12 a c shows the spatial variation in average duration severity and intensity for all the three agro climatic regions during the years 1970 2019 the average dd identified by spi 12 was 31 months region 1 24 months region 2 and 29 months region 3 the maximum drought duration was observed over the gujarat plains and hills a similar study over bundelkhand region was carried out using chirps dataset pandey et al 2021 severe drought was observed in all three regions with ds varies from 20 41 to 28 58 and the maximum was estimated in region 3 fig 12b the average di of drought events for all the regions varies from 0 75 to 0 95 and maximum in region 1 fig 12c overall results illustrated that the maximum droughts duration measure over region 2 of central plateau and hills fig 12a its characteristics depend on the geographic location and existing climatic condition of an area 5 conclusions the study explored the space time attributes of rainfall and conclude that the rainfall variability is highly significant in the upper and lower part of the mahi basin in contrast rainfall anomaly accurately monitors the occurrence of meteorological droughts over the basin because the increase in the number of dry days is directly related to the occurrence of drought the inter annual variability of rainfall was also observed in 3 agro climatic zones over the basin on a monthly scale most of the rainfall received in monsoon months which is highly affected by local or regional temperature profile due to this sometimes the pre monsoon months are badly affected by a thunderstorm caused extreme drought conditions and prolonged risk of dry spells over the study region the main finding of the precipitation extremes that the rainfall in central and eastern regions of the basin is very concentrated while less rainfall is received over the southern part of the basin near the coastal area this is due to the heating of the arabian sea and tropospheric warming which lead to the movement of low level jet stream toward the upper region of the basin xavier et al 2018 varikoden et al 2019 viswanadhapalli et al 2020 the finding of extreme indices indicates cdd with increasing trend and cwd with decreasing pattern over the basin due to this extreme variation in rainfall majority of the cultivated area of the basin is dominated by dryness or dry days resulting in drought events the result of some indices also accelerates the water scarcity situation and decreases agricultural efficiency overall the agro climatic region wise result of extreme indices indicates that regions 1 and 3 experience the high intensity of rainfall rx1day and sdii decline in region 1 and region 2 in the north and northeast part of the region variations in precipitation directly affect the agriculture of an area along with its associated sectors hence the outcomes of precipitation indices maybe help in planning of various sectors activities over the basin such as like agriculture planning watershed management etc this study has also investigated the temporal variations and spatial patterns of spi to identify the drought characteristic in the mahi river basin and agro climatic regions from 1970 to 2019 the result of spi concluded that the basin experienced severe drought events before 2005 using spi 12 the agro climatic zone wise drought event observed highest in region 2 of central plateau and hills i e 11 drought events moreover the remarkable longest and severe drought spell was observed during 1999 to 2003 region 2 understanding rainfall patterns protect the productivity of other resources by water scarcity which may increase potential drought events in the climatic region of the mahi basin hence spi emerge as an effective index for time space analysis of dry and wet conditions over the basin overall these results give a clear indication of a risk of prolonged dry spells in agro climatic regions during the cropping season that would negatively impact crop productivity and increase concern over food security such integrated analysis of rainfall patterns with agro climatic regions may be beneficial in the planning of water related activities and strategies that can combat the impact of changing climate on agriculture and other productivity in the face of climate change the current study may help and suggest some strategies for irrigation facilities during the crop growing periods credit authorship
