17740,we recently reported sobhani et al 2020 that when a confocal raman microscope imaged a nanoplastic with the diameter of 100 nm the imaging lateral size was 300 400 nm due to the diffraction limit of the laser spot in this study we examine the lateral intensity distribution of the raman signal emitted by nanoplastics diameters ranging 30 600 nm within the excitation laser spot we find that the raman emission intensity similar to the excitation power density distributed within a laser spot also follows a lateral gaussian distribution to image and visualise individual nanoplastics we i decrease the mapping pixel size in a hope to generate an image with high resolution and simultaneously to pick up items from the blind point we can then either ii offset the colour to intentionally image only the high intensity portion of the raman signal emitted from the centre of the laser spot to localise the exact position of the nanoplastic or iii categorise the imaged nanoplastics to different groups via their raman intensity to simultaneously and separately visualise large nanoplastics strong raman signals medium nanoplastics and small nanoplastics in an effort to avoid the shielding and overlooking of weak signals we iv also cross check multi images simultaneously mapped at two or three characteristic peaks via either a logic or or a logic and algorithm thus the imaging uncertainty can be significantly reduced from a statistical point of view graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic nanoplastic environmental contamination pixel size raman mapping image car paint polishing dust 1 introduction while microplastics with the size of 1 μm 5 mm are major environmental contamination concerns nanoplastics with the size of 1000 nm are surfacing as a new issue alimi et al 2018 mitrano et al 2019 richardson and ternes 2018 this new contamination issue is not yet well known most likely due to the absence of appropriate analytical technologies silva et al 2018 perhaps nanoplastics are generally introduced into the environment via the fragmentation of macro and microplastics gigault et al 2018 once released into the environment their sorption transportation fate and bioavailability are governed by their chemical physical properties that are mainly dominated by their size domingos et al 2009 lead et al 2018 for example the accumulation of nanosized particles in living organisms can affect the organisms activity and feeding behaviour mattsson et al 2017 as well as their metabolism mattsson et al 2015 moreover the high specific surface area of nanoplastics increases the potential for releasing chemicals such as monomers and additives or adsorbing concentrating other environmental pollutants wright and kelly 2017 understanding the risks of nanoplastics in the environment requires a standard method for their identification koelmans et al 2019 which is currently still a challenge silva et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 among the available optical analytical methods x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and raman spectroscopy have been used to study nanoplastics for example xps along with scanning electron microscopy sem has been used to identify the nanoplastics present in facial scrubs hernandez et al 2017 and released from teabags hernandez et al 2019 this technique is limited to elemental information and cannot provide exact polymer identification in contrast raman can provide specific information about the polymer via its fingerprint spectra schwaferts et al 2020 in analysis of an individual nanoplastic however the weak raman signal due to the small size of the nanoplastic could result in large numbers of false positives or false negatives lenz et al 2015 song et al 2015 avoiding these false analyses during identification via raman imaging is of great importance to increase the certainty of such analysis raman spectroscopy has been largely engaged to study molecular structures in different areas compared with infrared ir spectroscopy the advantages of raman spectroscopy include high lateral resolution high spectral coverage specific fingerprint spectrum and low interference from water all of which make raman spectroscopy unique especially in the study of nanostructured materials and biological systems ivleva et al 2017 nascimento 2018 vašková 2011 as already mentioned a major concern about raman spectroscopy is related to its extremely small scattering cross section which results in the weak signal schwaferts et al 2020 when a pixel s information is available the intensity can be mapped as an image in terms of the lateral resolution for an image raman is superior to ir due to the short wavelength of a laser for excitation sobhani et al 2019 however the resolution is still constrained by the diffraction limit of the laser spot that is needed to excite the raman emission kawata et al 2017 recently raman imaging has been used to visualise and identify nanoplastics of sizes down to 100 nm this was achieved by distinguishing the laser spot the pixel size and the nanoplastic size position within the laser spot sobhani et al 2020 in the meantime to break through the diffraction limit of laser several other technologies have also been developed to visualise small particles one such technology is tip enhanced raman scattering ters this technique uses a metal probe with a tip or nanoparticle to scan the surface of the sample in order to enhance the raman scattering locally the high sensitivity of ters is attributed to the large local electromagnetic field that is produced by the sharp metal tip kawata et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 another technology is scanning near field optical microscopy snom by focusing the excitation laser through an aperture with a diameter smaller than the laser wavelength snom can extend the spatial resolution into the nanometre range kohli 2012 zhang et al 2017 recently for example snom imaging has been combined with ir to reach high resolution characterisation and identification of plastic polymers meyns et al 2019 the third technology is the superlens zhang and liu 2008 using metamaterials a superlens can enhance evanescent waves contributing to a high resolution image liu et al 2007 taubner et al 2006 zhang and liu 2008 in general ters snom and superlens can provide simultaneous acquisition of a mapping image of a sample and also high lateral resolution of an optical image that is below the diffraction limit adams et al 2016 kusch et al 2018 prats mateu and gierlinger 2017 rygula et al 2018 even with these advanced technologies the analysis of nanoplastics via mapping and imaging is still a challenge when an objective lens of 100 is employed for confocal raman imaging a laser spot is a disk i e an airy or fresnel disk constrained by the diffraction limit with a lateral resolution of 300 nm or the full width at half maximum intensity of λ 2na where λ is wavelength of the laser 532 nm in this study na is the numerical aperture 0 9 for a 100 objective lens or the lateral diameter of 1 22λ na 720 nm hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2008 we have distinguished the pixel size in the mapping image output as the emission of raman signal from the laser spot input as the excitation and noted that the image resolution is actually determined by the pixel size when we map nanoplastics with the diameter of 100 nm the mapped nanoplastics in the image show at the much larger size of 300 400 nm most likely the reason is the diffraction limit of the laser spot when focused on the nanoplastics for scanning and emitting the raman signal zhang and liu 2008 in this study we look closely to check if we can scan small nanoplastics down to 30 nm by overcoming the diffraction limit of the laser spot furthermore we compare two algorithms logic or and logic and to cross check two images that are mapped simultaneously at two different characteristic peaks to increase the certainty of the raman imaging and to avoid false signal analysis to some degree 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and microplastics nanoplastics all nanoplastics and chemicals including polystyrene ps nanoparticles 2 aqueous suspension with diameters of 600 nm 300 nm and 100 nm sulphuric acid h2so4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from sigma aldrich australia and used as received unless further indicated small nanoplastics of polystyrene with diameters of 100 nm and 50 nm but actually ranging within 30 80 nm for 50 nm were sourced from zhongkeleiming technology co ltd china 2 2 sample preparation the components of the sample supporting matrix used to distribute the nanoplastics including a glass slide a gold coated silicon wafer from sigma aldrich australia and a grid silicon wafer from ted pella usa were cleaned by soaking in piranha solution 2 1 h2so4 h2o2 v v overnight to remove any possible organic contaminants care is needed when handling this solution as it reacts vigorously with organic compounds sherman 1990 for the distribution of ps nanoplastics ps nanoplastics were diluted 10 times v v in milli q water with sonication for 5 min subsequently a droplet 2 μl was spread and distributed on the surface of the glass slide the gold wafer or the silicon wafer for the raman test the glass matrix was a good choice due to its clean raman background we also cross checked the morphology by raman imaging and sem imaging in the same position in this case sem needed a conductive matrix such as the gold and silicon wafers or the coated glass for the gold wafer the coating was actually made of a layer of gold nanoparticle under sem this gold nanoparticle background should be distinguished from the nanoplastics under raman it was difficult to align the position to find the same area scanned for the sem imaging these constraints could be overcome by the use of a grid silicon wafer the flat surface of silicon has almost no background for sem imaging the grid could easily mark the position for raman and sem imaging at the same position however the raman signal from the silicon wafer behaved a strong background for raman imaging these advantages and disadvantages of different matrix must be balanced the sample preparation for car paint polishing dust has been reported before sobhani et al 2020 in general the dust samples were collected on a driveway when the clear coating paint of a car s engine hood was polished by hand before the raman testing a sample of 2 μl was dropped onto the gold wafer surface and dried in air after the dropping drying process the sample was washed with milli q water to remove the possible salt precipitated from the tap water 2 3 raman and sem raman spectra were recorded in air using a witec confocal raman microscope alpha 300rs germany equipped with a 532 nm laser diode 30 mw a ccd detector cooled to 60 c was used to collect stokes raman signals under a 100 objective lens nikon japan at room temperature 24 c over the wavenumber range of 0 4000 cm 1 with an integration time of 5 s for measurements of a single spectrum or 1 2 s per pixel for image mapping in the latter case the stage stepping distance controlled by a piezo driven scanning stage for each raman signal collection at each pixel was usually 200 nm 200 nm pixel which is defined as the image resolution in this study to study the effect of the pixel size the stage stepping distance was also changed to 333 nm 333 nm 100 nm 100 nm or 40 nm 40 nm respectively the scanning duration was increased accordingly for example to image an area of 1 μm 1 μm with the pixel size of 333 nm 333 nm the scanning duration was 9 s it increased to 100 s with the pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm and to 625 s with the pixel size of 40 nm 40 nm if each pixel took 1 s to collect the raman signal for raman image mapping the sample was scanned over an area of 10 μm 10 μm using a 100 objective lens with the numerical aperture of 0 9 after generating the mapping image the exact position of a smaller area usually 2 μm 2 μm to catch an individual particle or to select a specific area was scanned again with a smaller pixel size as already suggested the different plastics exhibited different raman activity and emitted different intensities of raman spectra as previously reported sobhani et al 2019 for example the raman signal at 1000 cm 1 was picked up to image the ps nanoplastics along with other characteristic peaks i e 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 the intensity images at different peaks were mapped for imaging algorithm analysis to smooth the intensity image or to reduce the roughness a pixel colour interpolation was generally carried out sometimes the image was mapped without the colour interpolation to study the raman signal at each pixel the raman signal intensity also depended on the surface morphology of the plastic sample supporting matrix as well as the position of the focal plane on the sample therefore the raman signal s intensity was optimised either by moving the focal plane or adjusting the laser power the raman signal was analysed using witec project software by just picking up the net intensity of their unique characteristic peaks for image mapping any interference that might originate from background and noise such as fluorescence or organic matter could be effectively avoided by subtracting the baseline of the collected raman spectra after automatic integration as the peak area or sum via software that is the background was generally subtracted using the collected signal at both sides of the selected raman peak in the raman spectrum an exceptional situation occurred when noise akin to a spiked sharp peak such as cosmic rays most likely originating from the ccd detector itself appeared at the selected peak position for the image such as at 1000 cm 1 for ps which is an infrequent occurrence with usually 1 likelihood to further avoid this bias and false imaging an imaging algorithm analysis is recommended particularly when the raman signal is weak an sem zeiss sigma vp germany equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd was used to characterise the morphology of the microplastics nanoplastics the individual mapping images were analysed merged or separated using imagej software 2 4 image algorithm analysis when a mapping image is generated by the raman intensity at a selected characteristic peak via peak integration after subtracting and averaging the background to visualise the plastic the pixel area of interest from this image can be further identified by extracting the full raman spectrum at the mapping pixel that is at any specific position pixel of the mapping image the full raman spectrum containing all the peaks not just the selected characteristic peak can be extracted and compared with the standard spectrum i e the fingerprint of the reference plastic to verify and confirm whether the mapping signal originates either from the specific plastic or from noise when an image is mapped at a selected peak such as at 1000 cm 1 the signal can be mapped as different colours rgb or red green and blue according to the peak intensity and colour scale bar this image can be separated and categorised via the rgb channel to three sub images with the colours r g and b representing the different intensities of the raman signal those different intensities colours of the image were intentionally assigned to different sizes of the nanoplastics obviously the pre condition for this categorisation is that the signal intensity is certainly related to the size of the nanoplastic as discussed before sobhani et al 2020 the raman signal actually varies and depends on i the laser power density ii the size position within the laser spot surface morphology and raman activity of the nanoplastic iii the raman scattering direction or the collection efficiency iv the focal plane on the sample and v the integration time to collect the raman signal etc consequently although this assignation from the raman intensity to the size of the nanoplastic makes it difficult to compare different raman images at different positions the assignation should be acceptable within a raman image within a mapping image variations from other influence factors are either fixed or ignorable except for the size of the nanoplastic from the raman spectra several images were simultaneously mapped at different peaks such as at 1000 cm 1 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 or 3055 cm 1 respectively two or three images corresponding to two or three different characteristic peaks can be merged either by logic or or logic and in the case of logic or any mapped signal or dots from any image parent images is picked up and merged into a new image daughter image obviously any bias and false noise from parent images mapped at the different raman peaks might be picked up in the case of logic and only the signal or dots that appear simultaneously in both the parent images can be picked up in a new daughter image although some signal might be lost the noise is also expected to be reduced in the daughter image these two algorithms were compared with each other in this study the logic or approach was also employed to merge the raman image with the sem image to simultaneously visualise the polymer information and the surface morphology 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoplastics with the diameter of 300 nm fig 1 a shows a nanoplastic with the size of 300 nm in an sem image an individual nanoplastic has been mapped in fig 1 b sobhani et al 2020 the typical raman spectra are shown in fig 1 c the clean background in the range of 0 70 cm 1 might be due to the filtration of excitation laser before the collection of raman signal by the ccd detector the main characteristic peaks of ps have been marked including 1000 cm 1 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 the inset in fig 1 c shows how to estimate the peak intensity via integrating a peak area and subtracting the background in black when the colour interpolation has been removed the mapping image is changed from fig 1 b to fig 1 d along the x and y axis directions marked in fig 1 d the peak intensity at each pixel is indicated in fig 1 e g the distribution of the peak intensity can be fitted with a gaussian distribution holle et al 2006 as presented in fig 1 e g the fitting parameter and equation are also listed in fig 1 f and g this provides the option of using the raman output to monitor the intensity distribution and the power density of the laser spot s input steidtner and pettinger 2008 zhang and liu 2008 in terms of this output the raman signal the fitting peak width w the full width at half maximum is different in fig 1 e g 346 nm x axis vs 228 nm y axis the possible reason for the difference is either burnt nanoplastics by laser during the scanning process or position shifting during the scanning process in fig 1 h the schematic drawing of the laser with the diameter d and nanoplastics with the diameter d is shown ideally the raman signal is expected only within the red squared area dashed line with the width of d d because the laser can then cover and excite the nanoplastic for raman emission that is the reason why the size of the nanoplastic in the sem image is different from that in the raman image as suggested in fig 1 a and b although the variation of raman intensity is there the gaussian peak fitting provides another approach to estimate the size of the mapped nanoplastics however it is not clear whether this gaussian peak width w is determined by the nanoplastics size d 300 nm or by the laser spot size d an airy or fresnel disk due to the diffraction hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 to identify it we test small nanoplastics d 100 nm and 30 80 nm in the following parts 3 2 pixel size imaging resolution before testing small nanoplastics with the diameter of 100 nm the size of the laser spot must be distinguished from the mapping pixel which is defined as the image resolution in this study as shown in fig 2 d in our previous report sobhani et al 2020 in this study we take the resolution size of the laser spot as 300 nm hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2008 although this value has a limited influence on our subsequent analysis while we cannot change the laser spot size with the full width at half maximum intensity of 300 nm or the diameter of 720 nm we can easily change and control the pixel size to increase the resolution of the mapping image from 333 nm 333 nm to 100 nm 100 nm which is smaller than the size of a laser spot size but similar to the nanoplastic size the schematic drawing is shown in fig 2 in fig 2 a when the pixel size is large the image resolution is low in this case the exact position of the nanoplastics is unknown that is the nanoplastic i can be located anywhere within the green circle the laser spot to emit a raman signal although the intensity might vary due to the laser intensity of a gaussian distribution holle et al 2006 as shown in fig 2 d and e in the meantime the laser scanning might have a blind point for example in fig 2 a nanoplastic ii was not scanned by the laser spot so it cannot be mapped and imaged this situation can be improved when the pixel size is decreased to 100 nm 100 nm as shown in fig 2 b in this case the pixel laser scanning step and mapped as a square in the intensity image is smaller than the laser spot disk which leads to the overlapping of laser spots such as laser i and ii consequently during the laser scanning process nanoplastic i can be scanned by 12 laser spots such as i and ii subsequently emitting a raman signal 12 times therefore 12 pixels will receive the raman signal to map as 12 squares and light on furthermore due to the different position of the nanoplastic within the laser spot as shown in fig 2 d the raman signal intensity might vary for the laser spot i the nanoplastic i is positioned close to the laser spot centre for the laser spot ii the nanoplastic i is distant and at the boundary of the laser spot due to the variation in laser power density the raman intensity is expected to vary as well as shown in fig 2 d and e the intensity varied signal is mapped as different colours at the related pixel square from white a strong raman signal collected from laser i to grey a weak raman signal collected from laser ii interestingly the nanoplastic ii at the blind point in fig 2 a can also be mapped 9 times within the image in fig 2 b due to the decrease in pixel size from 333 nm 333 nm 100 nm 100 nm different intensities of the raman signals are again expected as suggested by the different laser spots iii v in fig 2 b d consequently a different colour of pixels is mapped the in the intensity image as suggested in fig 2 b f we need to emphasis again that when the pixel resolution is increased or the pixel size is decreased the scanning duration is prolonged from 9 s with the pixel size of 333 nm 333 nm to 100 s with the pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm to scan an area of 1 μm 1 μm or from 36 s to 400 s to scan an area of 2 μm 2 μm if each pixel takes 1 s to collect the raman signal beyond the decreased pixel size another approach to improve resolution of the image s position is to offset the colour such as to change the colour scale bars from fig 2 b to fig 2 c right insets that is the image in fig 2 c is intentionally generated by selectively collecting the strong raman signals that is because we expect that in terms of the nanoplastic ii in fig 2 b the strongest signal is collected when the nanoplastic centres itself in the laser spot v holle et al 2006 akin to the tip of an iceberg to generate a white pixel in the intensity mapping image the signal weakens when the nanoplastic is located more remote from the laser spot centre iii iv the weakest signal is emitted when the laser spot might cover just part of the nanoplastic as shown as situation iii after removing the weak signal for mapping image fig 2 c is generated with a much better position resolution for mapping the individual nanoplastic consequently an individual nanoplastic of 100 nm can be imaged and localised in principle in the meantime in fig 2 c the mapped size might be either well matched with the size of the nanoplastic ii or still larger as shown for nanoplastic i that is the colour offsetting approach still has limitations in general nanoplastics down to 100 nm can be mapped and localised either by decreasing the pixel size to enable the nanoplastic to centre at the laser spot or by offsetting the raman signal along this hypothesis direction a further decrease in pixel size is proposed in this study such as to 40 nm 40 nm to map nanoplastics of 30 80 nm 3 3 nanoplastics with the diameter of 100 nm fig 3 shows the results for nanoplastics of 100 nm in diameter the cross like pattern in fig 3 a in the sem image can also be mapped in fig 3 b f particularly in fig 3 b and c suggesting that nanoplastics of 100 nm can be imaged and visualised to align the same position for sem and raman imaging we distributed the nanoplastics on a silicon surface with a grid mark consequently the raman signal from the silicon was collected as the background along with the plastic s signal as shown in fig 3 g the silicon shows a strong peak at 520 cm 1 that is mapped as an image in fig 3 b interestingly the cross like pattern of the nanoplastics can be seen the reason is not clear although we have observed this phenomenon many times perhaps the raman signal particularly the fluorescence background in the presence of the nanoplastic overlaps onto the silicon signal as suggested in fig 3 g to generate the mapping image in fig 3 b more research is needed the different peaks generated different mapping images as shown in fig 3 c f although the ps nanoplastic yields a strong raman emission at the peak 1000 cm 1 it overlaps with the silicon peak as shown in fig 3 g it is therefore not selected for raman imaging here even though the other peaks are weak from the images fig 3 c f we still can identify the nanoplastics pattern shown in fig 3 a particularly in fig 3 c which is mapped at the peak of 1230 cm 1 the cross like pattern can be easily identified the other peaks intensity images also map the light on area although the cross like pattern is less clear uncertain mapping image mainly due to the weak raman signal emitted by the small nanoplastics with diameters of 100 nm in this case the intensity of the peak area not the peak height is necessary to distinguish the signal from the background noise as suggested in fig 1 c in the meantime the variation on the z axis from either the sample matrix or the piezo driven scanning stage might lead to the variation of the laser intensity towards the signal emission for a confocal raman hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2008 we further test the hypothesis in fig 2 by focusing on an individual nanoplastic with the diameter of 100 nm the results are shown in fig 4 the sem image is shown in fig 4 a in fig 4 b d and f the pixel size is 100 nm 100 nm with an integration time of 2 s not 1 s in order to collect the strong raman signal at peak 1000 cm 1 with a clean background from the gold wafer surface not from the silicon surface at the selected pixels in fig 4 b the left side of x axis the raman spectra are presented in fig 4 h intensity being offset for clarification as discussed in the analysis of fig 2 colour offsetting can improve the position resolution as shown in fig 4 b d and 4 f in which the colour scale bar has been changed from fig 4 c 4 e to fig 4 g respectively in fig 4 b d the maximum colour scale is set at 150 cts to optimise the colour brightness contrast however overshooting might occur there which means that in the central part the pixel colour will be the same although their raman intensities might be different this situation is improved in fig 4 f where the colour scale bar is offset at 200 210 cts the gaussian fitting curves are shown in fig 4 i and j with the gaussian peak width of 183 nm and 118 nm in the x and y axes respectively that is due to the limit of diffraction of the laser spot and the variation in the scanning step or pixel size the mapping spot has the diameter of 118 183 nm greater than its physical size of 100 nm as presented in fig 2 a and b fig 4 k presents the relationship between the fitting gaussian peak width i e the full width at half maximum and the diameter of the nanoplastics a link is observed down to 50 nm to be discussed later also see figs s1 2 in supplementary information suggesting a breakthrough of the diffraction limit of the excitation laser to achieve that breakthrough however i the scanning pixel size must be decreased which leads to a long scanning duration a much longer testing time and the colour must be offset possibly losing some signals for imaging ii the fitting variation on w also strongly depends on the pixel size as assumed in fig 2 a b and figs s1 s2 iii the dependence of w on d is significant for small nanoplastics such as in the range of 30 80 nm perhaps the smaller size of a nanoplastic can generate a better resolution a smaller moving step within a laser spot to monitor the gaussian distribution of the laser input steidtner and pettinger 2008 zhang and liu 2008 given the pixel size is significantly reduced this hypothesis gains support by comparison of the schematic drawing in fig 4 i with that in fig 1 d in the meantime the weak signal from the small nanoplastics might also lead to fitting variation 3 4 mixed nanoplastics with diameters of 300 nm and 100 nm in fig 3 c the raman signals of the mapped dots are weak due to the small size of the nanoplastics if small nanoplastics are mixed with large ones the larger ones generally emit a stronger signal in this case the strong raman signal emitted by large nanoplastics or aggregates might shield the weak signals from small nanoplastics to address this challenge 300 nm nanoplastics were mixed with 100 nm nanoplastics for analysis as shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a the colour scale bar was set at 0 200 cts to visualise all the nanoplastics regardless of whether the signal was strong up to 1400 cts or weak still higher than 10 cts the large bright spots in fig 5 a are assigned to the nanoplastics aggregates circled in fig 5 k l the weak spots might originate from individual nanoplastics we also set a rainbow colour scale bar as shown in fig 5 d to paint the different intensities of the raman signal to different colours the results are shown in fig 5 c and e now we could visualise small nanoplastics together with large ones fig 5 e is an alternative version of fig 5 c with a 3 dimensional view to further confirm the weak dots in fig 5 a the marked area was scanned using two different pixel sizes 333 nm 333 nm and 100 nm 100 nm the results are presented in fig 5 f and g respectively the mapping resolution could be improved by increasing the pixel resolution after colour offsetting the image in fig 5 i is even better confirming the hypothesis in relation to fig 2 due to the difficulty in alignment for raman and sem imaging at the same position on the gold wafer surface the sem image in fig 5 k might not be the exact position for raman mapping in fig 5 a and could be the neighbouring area the alignment became more difficult at the smaller size such as after zooming in the scanning area from the image in fig 5 k to that in fig 5 l anyway the aggregate can be observed in fig 5 k and l circled and a laser spot can simultaneously cover several nanoplastics whether they are individual or aggregated to emit the raman signal as a sum another analytical approach is to categorise and separate the nanoplastics according to their intensity as shown in fig 6 a strong raman signal higher than 100 cts can be mapped as fig 6 a in accordance with the colour bar in fig 6 b the signals are most likely from the aggregates of nanoplastics or large nanoplastics in fig 6 c the focus is on the weak signal 0 100 cts after removal of the strong signals in accordance with the colour scale bar in fig 6 d the mapped dots can be assigned to individual nanoplastics of 300 nm or 100 nm if they are not from noise it is important to be mindful of the mapped pixel size the smallest size of the dots in fig 6 c is 200 nm whereas the size of the nanoplastics is either 100 nm or 300 nm the image in fig 6 c can be further categorised to 3 different groups in terms of their intensity that being 70 100 cts to generate figs 6 e 30 70 cts to generate figs 6 f and 0 30 cts to generate fig 6 g the dots in fig 6 e can be assigned to 300 nm nanoplastics in fig 6 f to 100 nm nanoplastics and in fig 6 g to possible background noise or to uncertain signals further research is needed to confirm this approach particularly how to solve signals uncertainty 3 5 nanoplastics with a diameter in a range of 30 80 nm admittedly the above categorisation must be based on the certain raman signal which means there is no or at least no significant false of the raman signal for imaging in most cases the certain signal means the raman signal is strong or high ratio of signal noise such as when the nanoplastics are larger than 300 nm when the nanoplastics are as small as 100 nm the raman signal is weak which might lead to difficulty in distinguishing the signal from noise schwaferts et al 2020 this uncertainty becomes more serious when the nanoplastics diameters get smaller such as in the range of 30 80 nm as shown next here the silicon grid was selected to distribute the nanoplastic samples to enable sem and raman analysis at the same position fig 7 a shows the sem image at the exact position for raman imaging in fig 7 b h the silicon peak at 520 cm 1 is mapped as fig 7 b where the distribution pattern along the diagonal of the nanoplastics cannot be seen suggesting that the contribution of nanoplastics is weak at this selected peak considering that the ps nanoplastics yield a raman spectrum as shown in figs 1 c and 3 g there are several characteristic peak candidates for mapping the intensity images are shown in fig 7 c f which are mapped according to the peaks intensity at 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 respectively again the image mapped at 1000 cm 1 is not shown here due to the peak overlapping with silicon in fig 7 c g there are numerous mapping dots many more than the nanoplastics in the sem image in fig 7 a due to the bias issue and false raman signal at the selected peaks for imaging for an individual nanoplastic circled in fig 7 a c the data analysis is presented in fig s2 supplementary information basically the typical raman is weak and peak area integration of the signal is needed to distinguish it from the background noise as shown in fig s2 c to increase the signal s mapping certainty in the image two mapped images can be merged together either by logic or as shown in fig 7 g or by logic and as shown in fig 7 h respectively obviously the image in fig 7 h is much superior to that in fig 7 g in terms of signal certainty to match fig 7 a that is the chance of noise being simultaneously mapped via logic and at two selected peaks is significantly lowered thus it is a useful approach for decreasing the mapping noise when the raman signal is weak 3 6 real sample of car paint polishing dust the approach discussed above is validated in fig 8 where a real sample of car paint polishing dust is tested the weak raman signal generates fuzzy images in fig 8 a and b whereas the strong signal generates a better image in fig 8 f in accordance with their peak intensities as indicated in fig 8 e because the certainty of the image in fig 8 a and b is lower than that in fig 8 i the algorithm is needed for the analysis therefore from the parent images in fig 8 a and b the logic and generates an image in fig 8 c this daughter image seems to have less noise with a cleaner background than that in fig 8 a and b suggesting the advantage of the algorithm of logic and when this raman image is merged with the sem image via logic or fig 8 d is generated in this image we can simultaneously visualise the surface morphology from sem the flower like pattern and the distribution of plastic polymer from raman as previously reported sobhani et al 2020 there might be two domains or two components in the paint as suggested by their raman spectra in fig 8 e the raman image in fig 8 f can merge with the sem image to generate the image in fig 8 g and to visualise the distribution the strong raman signal means the certainty of the image is high at least higher than that in fig 8 a therefore the algorithm of logic or is employed for the direct overlap of raman image in fig 8 f onto an sem image we can merge more images by the algorithm as demonstrated in fig 8 h including raman images in fig 8 a b f simultaneously mapped at 3 different characteristic peaks and an sem image that is the images in fig 8 a and b are merged together via logic and to generate an image in fig 8 c which is further merged with the image in fig 8 f and the sem image via logic or to generate an image in the end as shown in fig 8 h we can clearly see the distribution of two components of plastic along with the morphology of the flower like pattern this approach is further validated by analysing other samples including a mixed nanoplastics sample with diameters of 600 nm and 300 nm two nanoplastic samples with diameters of 300 nm or 30 80 nm and a microplastics spiked sand sample as shown in figs s3 s6 supplementary information in general to increase the certainty of the signal logic and is recommended to reduce the noise by cross checking the signal conversely to avoid loss of signal logic or is recommended 4 conclusion to increase the resolution of mapping images extensive research has been undertaken such as scanning near field optical microscopy snom zhang et al 2017 tip enhanced raman scattering ters kawata et al 2017 superlens liu et al 2007 zhang and liu 2008 a simple approach was investigated in this study along with our previous one sobhani et al 2020 through raman imaging via pixel resolution improvement and colour offsetting for identification and visualisation of nanoplastics this is encouraging particularly given the consideration that nanoplastics could lead to adverse effects in humans and the environment and that identification and visualisation of nanoplastics are not yet well demonstrated two algorithms were also compared to analyse the intensity images logic or and logic and to avoid bias issues and reduce signal uncertainty the logic and algorithm is recommended merging at least two intensity images mapped at different characteristic raman peaks together for cross checking however to avoid loss of the signal logic or is suggested improving the analytical algorithm is still a challenge along with discovering how to enhance the weak raman signal from nanoplastics

17740,we recently reported sobhani et al 2020 that when a confocal raman microscope imaged a nanoplastic with the diameter of 100 nm the imaging lateral size was 300 400 nm due to the diffraction limit of the laser spot in this study we examine the lateral intensity distribution of the raman signal emitted by nanoplastics diameters ranging 30 600 nm within the excitation laser spot we find that the raman emission intensity similar to the excitation power density distributed within a laser spot also follows a lateral gaussian distribution to image and visualise individual nanoplastics we i decrease the mapping pixel size in a hope to generate an image with high resolution and simultaneously to pick up items from the blind point we can then either ii offset the colour to intentionally image only the high intensity portion of the raman signal emitted from the centre of the laser spot to localise the exact position of the nanoplastic or iii categorise the imaged nanoplastics to different groups via their raman intensity to simultaneously and separately visualise large nanoplastics strong raman signals medium nanoplastics and small nanoplastics in an effort to avoid the shielding and overlooking of weak signals we iv also cross check multi images simultaneously mapped at two or three characteristic peaks via either a logic or or a logic and algorithm thus the imaging uncertainty can be significantly reduced from a statistical point of view graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic nanoplastic environmental contamination pixel size raman mapping image car paint polishing dust 1 introduction while microplastics with the size of 1 μm 5 mm are major environmental contamination concerns nanoplastics with the size of 1000 nm are surfacing as a new issue alimi et al 2018 mitrano et al 2019 richardson and ternes 2018 this new contamination issue is not yet well known most likely due to the absence of appropriate analytical technologies silva et al 2018 perhaps nanoplastics are generally introduced into the environment via the fragmentation of macro and microplastics gigault et al 2018 once released into the environment their sorption transportation fate and bioavailability are governed by their chemical physical properties that are mainly dominated by their size domingos et al 2009 lead et al 2018 for example the accumulation of nanosized particles in living organisms can affect the organisms activity and feeding behaviour mattsson et al 2017 as well as their metabolism mattsson et al 2015 moreover the high specific surface area of nanoplastics increases the potential for releasing chemicals such as monomers and additives or adsorbing concentrating other environmental pollutants wright and kelly 2017 understanding the risks of nanoplastics in the environment requires a standard method for their identification koelmans et al 2019 which is currently still a challenge silva et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 among the available optical analytical methods x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and raman spectroscopy have been used to study nanoplastics for example xps along with scanning electron microscopy sem has been used to identify the nanoplastics present in facial scrubs hernandez et al 2017 and released from teabags hernandez et al 2019 this technique is limited to elemental information and cannot provide exact polymer identification in contrast raman can provide specific information about the polymer via its fingerprint spectra schwaferts et al 2020 in analysis of an individual nanoplastic however the weak raman signal due to the small size of the nanoplastic could result in large numbers of false positives or false negatives lenz et al 2015 song et al 2015 avoiding these false analyses during identification via raman imaging is of great importance to increase the certainty of such analysis raman spectroscopy has been largely engaged to study molecular structures in different areas compared with infrared ir spectroscopy the advantages of raman spectroscopy include high lateral resolution high spectral coverage specific fingerprint spectrum and low interference from water all of which make raman spectroscopy unique especially in the study of nanostructured materials and biological systems ivleva et al 2017 nascimento 2018 vašková 2011 as already mentioned a major concern about raman spectroscopy is related to its extremely small scattering cross section which results in the weak signal schwaferts et al 2020 when a pixel s information is available the intensity can be mapped as an image in terms of the lateral resolution for an image raman is superior to ir due to the short wavelength of a laser for excitation sobhani et al 2019 however the resolution is still constrained by the diffraction limit of the laser spot that is needed to excite the raman emission kawata et al 2017 recently raman imaging has been used to visualise and identify nanoplastics of sizes down to 100 nm this was achieved by distinguishing the laser spot the pixel size and the nanoplastic size position within the laser spot sobhani et al 2020 in the meantime to break through the diffraction limit of laser several other technologies have also been developed to visualise small particles one such technology is tip enhanced raman scattering ters this technique uses a metal probe with a tip or nanoparticle to scan the surface of the sample in order to enhance the raman scattering locally the high sensitivity of ters is attributed to the large local electromagnetic field that is produced by the sharp metal tip kawata et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 another technology is scanning near field optical microscopy snom by focusing the excitation laser through an aperture with a diameter smaller than the laser wavelength snom can extend the spatial resolution into the nanometre range kohli 2012 zhang et al 2017 recently for example snom imaging has been combined with ir to reach high resolution characterisation and identification of plastic polymers meyns et al 2019 the third technology is the superlens zhang and liu 2008 using metamaterials a superlens can enhance evanescent waves contributing to a high resolution image liu et al 2007 taubner et al 2006 zhang and liu 2008 in general ters snom and superlens can provide simultaneous acquisition of a mapping image of a sample and also high lateral resolution of an optical image that is below the diffraction limit adams et al 2016 kusch et al 2018 prats mateu and gierlinger 2017 rygula et al 2018 even with these advanced technologies the analysis of nanoplastics via mapping and imaging is still a challenge when an objective lens of 100 is employed for confocal raman imaging a laser spot is a disk i e an airy or fresnel disk constrained by the diffraction limit with a lateral resolution of 300 nm or the full width at half maximum intensity of λ 2na where λ is wavelength of the laser 532 nm in this study na is the numerical aperture 0 9 for a 100 objective lens or the lateral diameter of 1 22λ na 720 nm hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2008 we have distinguished the pixel size in the mapping image output as the emission of raman signal from the laser spot input as the excitation and noted that the image resolution is actually determined by the pixel size when we map nanoplastics with the diameter of 100 nm the mapped nanoplastics in the image show at the much larger size of 300 400 nm most likely the reason is the diffraction limit of the laser spot when focused on the nanoplastics for scanning and emitting the raman signal zhang and liu 2008 in this study we look closely to check if we can scan small nanoplastics down to 30 nm by overcoming the diffraction limit of the laser spot furthermore we compare two algorithms logic or and logic and to cross check two images that are mapped simultaneously at two different characteristic peaks to increase the certainty of the raman imaging and to avoid false signal analysis to some degree 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and microplastics nanoplastics all nanoplastics and chemicals including polystyrene ps nanoparticles 2 aqueous suspension with diameters of 600 nm 300 nm and 100 nm sulphuric acid h2so4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from sigma aldrich australia and used as received unless further indicated small nanoplastics of polystyrene with diameters of 100 nm and 50 nm but actually ranging within 30 80 nm for 50 nm were sourced from zhongkeleiming technology co ltd china 2 2 sample preparation the components of the sample supporting matrix used to distribute the nanoplastics including a glass slide a gold coated silicon wafer from sigma aldrich australia and a grid silicon wafer from ted pella usa were cleaned by soaking in piranha solution 2 1 h2so4 h2o2 v v overnight to remove any possible organic contaminants care is needed when handling this solution as it reacts vigorously with organic compounds sherman 1990 for the distribution of ps nanoplastics ps nanoplastics were diluted 10 times v v in milli q water with sonication for 5 min subsequently a droplet 2 μl was spread and distributed on the surface of the glass slide the gold wafer or the silicon wafer for the raman test the glass matrix was a good choice due to its clean raman background we also cross checked the morphology by raman imaging and sem imaging in the same position in this case sem needed a conductive matrix such as the gold and silicon wafers or the coated glass for the gold wafer the coating was actually made of a layer of gold nanoparticle under sem this gold nanoparticle background should be distinguished from the nanoplastics under raman it was difficult to align the position to find the same area scanned for the sem imaging these constraints could be overcome by the use of a grid silicon wafer the flat surface of silicon has almost no background for sem imaging the grid could easily mark the position for raman and sem imaging at the same position however the raman signal from the silicon wafer behaved a strong background for raman imaging these advantages and disadvantages of different matrix must be balanced the sample preparation for car paint polishing dust has been reported before sobhani et al 2020 in general the dust samples were collected on a driveway when the clear coating paint of a car s engine hood was polished by hand before the raman testing a sample of 2 μl was dropped onto the gold wafer surface and dried in air after the dropping drying process the sample was washed with milli q water to remove the possible salt precipitated from the tap water 2 3 raman and sem raman spectra were recorded in air using a witec confocal raman microscope alpha 300rs germany equipped with a 532 nm laser diode 30 mw a ccd detector cooled to 60 c was used to collect stokes raman signals under a 100 objective lens nikon japan at room temperature 24 c over the wavenumber range of 0 4000 cm 1 with an integration time of 5 s for measurements of a single spectrum or 1 2 s per pixel for image mapping in the latter case the stage stepping distance controlled by a piezo driven scanning stage for each raman signal collection at each pixel was usually 200 nm 200 nm pixel which is defined as the image resolution in this study to study the effect of the pixel size the stage stepping distance was also changed to 333 nm 333 nm 100 nm 100 nm or 40 nm 40 nm respectively the scanning duration was increased accordingly for example to image an area of 1 μm 1 μm with the pixel size of 333 nm 333 nm the scanning duration was 9 s it increased to 100 s with the pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm and to 625 s with the pixel size of 40 nm 40 nm if each pixel took 1 s to collect the raman signal for raman image mapping the sample was scanned over an area of 10 μm 10 μm using a 100 objective lens with the numerical aperture of 0 9 after generating the mapping image the exact position of a smaller area usually 2 μm 2 μm to catch an individual particle or to select a specific area was scanned again with a smaller pixel size as already suggested the different plastics exhibited different raman activity and emitted different intensities of raman spectra as previously reported sobhani et al 2019 for example the raman signal at 1000 cm 1 was picked up to image the ps nanoplastics along with other characteristic peaks i e 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 the intensity images at different peaks were mapped for imaging algorithm analysis to smooth the intensity image or to reduce the roughness a pixel colour interpolation was generally carried out sometimes the image was mapped without the colour interpolation to study the raman signal at each pixel the raman signal intensity also depended on the surface morphology of the plastic sample supporting matrix as well as the position of the focal plane on the sample therefore the raman signal s intensity was optimised either by moving the focal plane or adjusting the laser power the raman signal was analysed using witec project software by just picking up the net intensity of their unique characteristic peaks for image mapping any interference that might originate from background and noise such as fluorescence or organic matter could be effectively avoided by subtracting the baseline of the collected raman spectra after automatic integration as the peak area or sum via software that is the background was generally subtracted using the collected signal at both sides of the selected raman peak in the raman spectrum an exceptional situation occurred when noise akin to a spiked sharp peak such as cosmic rays most likely originating from the ccd detector itself appeared at the selected peak position for the image such as at 1000 cm 1 for ps which is an infrequent occurrence with usually 1 likelihood to further avoid this bias and false imaging an imaging algorithm analysis is recommended particularly when the raman signal is weak an sem zeiss sigma vp germany equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd was used to characterise the morphology of the microplastics nanoplastics the individual mapping images were analysed merged or separated using imagej software 2 4 image algorithm analysis when a mapping image is generated by the raman intensity at a selected characteristic peak via peak integration after subtracting and averaging the background to visualise the plastic the pixel area of interest from this image can be further identified by extracting the full raman spectrum at the mapping pixel that is at any specific position pixel of the mapping image the full raman spectrum containing all the peaks not just the selected characteristic peak can be extracted and compared with the standard spectrum i e the fingerprint of the reference plastic to verify and confirm whether the mapping signal originates either from the specific plastic or from noise when an image is mapped at a selected peak such as at 1000 cm 1 the signal can be mapped as different colours rgb or red green and blue according to the peak intensity and colour scale bar this image can be separated and categorised via the rgb channel to three sub images with the colours r g and b representing the different intensities of the raman signal those different intensities colours of the image were intentionally assigned to different sizes of the nanoplastics obviously the pre condition for this categorisation is that the signal intensity is certainly related to the size of the nanoplastic as discussed before sobhani et al 2020 the raman signal actually varies and depends on i the laser power density ii the size position within the laser spot surface morphology and raman activity of the nanoplastic iii the raman scattering direction or the collection efficiency iv the focal plane on the sample and v the integration time to collect the raman signal etc consequently although this assignation from the raman intensity to the size of the nanoplastic makes it difficult to compare different raman images at different positions the assignation should be acceptable within a raman image within a mapping image variations from other influence factors are either fixed or ignorable except for the size of the nanoplastic from the raman spectra several images were simultaneously mapped at different peaks such as at 1000 cm 1 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 or 3055 cm 1 respectively two or three images corresponding to two or three different characteristic peaks can be merged either by logic or or logic and in the case of logic or any mapped signal or dots from any image parent images is picked up and merged into a new image daughter image obviously any bias and false noise from parent images mapped at the different raman peaks might be picked up in the case of logic and only the signal or dots that appear simultaneously in both the parent images can be picked up in a new daughter image although some signal might be lost the noise is also expected to be reduced in the daughter image these two algorithms were compared with each other in this study the logic or approach was also employed to merge the raman image with the sem image to simultaneously visualise the polymer information and the surface morphology 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanoplastics with the diameter of 300 nm fig 1 a shows a nanoplastic with the size of 300 nm in an sem image an individual nanoplastic has been mapped in fig 1 b sobhani et al 2020 the typical raman spectra are shown in fig 1 c the clean background in the range of 0 70 cm 1 might be due to the filtration of excitation laser before the collection of raman signal by the ccd detector the main characteristic peaks of ps have been marked including 1000 cm 1 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 the inset in fig 1 c shows how to estimate the peak intensity via integrating a peak area and subtracting the background in black when the colour interpolation has been removed the mapping image is changed from fig 1 b to fig 1 d along the x and y axis directions marked in fig 1 d the peak intensity at each pixel is indicated in fig 1 e g the distribution of the peak intensity can be fitted with a gaussian distribution holle et al 2006 as presented in fig 1 e g the fitting parameter and equation are also listed in fig 1 f and g this provides the option of using the raman output to monitor the intensity distribution and the power density of the laser spot s input steidtner and pettinger 2008 zhang and liu 2008 in terms of this output the raman signal the fitting peak width w the full width at half maximum is different in fig 1 e g 346 nm x axis vs 228 nm y axis the possible reason for the difference is either burnt nanoplastics by laser during the scanning process or position shifting during the scanning process in fig 1 h the schematic drawing of the laser with the diameter d and nanoplastics with the diameter d is shown ideally the raman signal is expected only within the red squared area dashed line with the width of d d because the laser can then cover and excite the nanoplastic for raman emission that is the reason why the size of the nanoplastic in the sem image is different from that in the raman image as suggested in fig 1 a and b although the variation of raman intensity is there the gaussian peak fitting provides another approach to estimate the size of the mapped nanoplastics however it is not clear whether this gaussian peak width w is determined by the nanoplastics size d 300 nm or by the laser spot size d an airy or fresnel disk due to the diffraction hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 to identify it we test small nanoplastics d 100 nm and 30 80 nm in the following parts 3 2 pixel size imaging resolution before testing small nanoplastics with the diameter of 100 nm the size of the laser spot must be distinguished from the mapping pixel which is defined as the image resolution in this study as shown in fig 2 d in our previous report sobhani et al 2020 in this study we take the resolution size of the laser spot as 300 nm hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2008 although this value has a limited influence on our subsequent analysis while we cannot change the laser spot size with the full width at half maximum intensity of 300 nm or the diameter of 720 nm we can easily change and control the pixel size to increase the resolution of the mapping image from 333 nm 333 nm to 100 nm 100 nm which is smaller than the size of a laser spot size but similar to the nanoplastic size the schematic drawing is shown in fig 2 in fig 2 a when the pixel size is large the image resolution is low in this case the exact position of the nanoplastics is unknown that is the nanoplastic i can be located anywhere within the green circle the laser spot to emit a raman signal although the intensity might vary due to the laser intensity of a gaussian distribution holle et al 2006 as shown in fig 2 d and e in the meantime the laser scanning might have a blind point for example in fig 2 a nanoplastic ii was not scanned by the laser spot so it cannot be mapped and imaged this situation can be improved when the pixel size is decreased to 100 nm 100 nm as shown in fig 2 b in this case the pixel laser scanning step and mapped as a square in the intensity image is smaller than the laser spot disk which leads to the overlapping of laser spots such as laser i and ii consequently during the laser scanning process nanoplastic i can be scanned by 12 laser spots such as i and ii subsequently emitting a raman signal 12 times therefore 12 pixels will receive the raman signal to map as 12 squares and light on furthermore due to the different position of the nanoplastic within the laser spot as shown in fig 2 d the raman signal intensity might vary for the laser spot i the nanoplastic i is positioned close to the laser spot centre for the laser spot ii the nanoplastic i is distant and at the boundary of the laser spot due to the variation in laser power density the raman intensity is expected to vary as well as shown in fig 2 d and e the intensity varied signal is mapped as different colours at the related pixel square from white a strong raman signal collected from laser i to grey a weak raman signal collected from laser ii interestingly the nanoplastic ii at the blind point in fig 2 a can also be mapped 9 times within the image in fig 2 b due to the decrease in pixel size from 333 nm 333 nm 100 nm 100 nm different intensities of the raman signals are again expected as suggested by the different laser spots iii v in fig 2 b d consequently a different colour of pixels is mapped the in the intensity image as suggested in fig 2 b f we need to emphasis again that when the pixel resolution is increased or the pixel size is decreased the scanning duration is prolonged from 9 s with the pixel size of 333 nm 333 nm to 100 s with the pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm to scan an area of 1 μm 1 μm or from 36 s to 400 s to scan an area of 2 μm 2 μm if each pixel takes 1 s to collect the raman signal beyond the decreased pixel size another approach to improve resolution of the image s position is to offset the colour such as to change the colour scale bars from fig 2 b to fig 2 c right insets that is the image in fig 2 c is intentionally generated by selectively collecting the strong raman signals that is because we expect that in terms of the nanoplastic ii in fig 2 b the strongest signal is collected when the nanoplastic centres itself in the laser spot v holle et al 2006 akin to the tip of an iceberg to generate a white pixel in the intensity mapping image the signal weakens when the nanoplastic is located more remote from the laser spot centre iii iv the weakest signal is emitted when the laser spot might cover just part of the nanoplastic as shown as situation iii after removing the weak signal for mapping image fig 2 c is generated with a much better position resolution for mapping the individual nanoplastic consequently an individual nanoplastic of 100 nm can be imaged and localised in principle in the meantime in fig 2 c the mapped size might be either well matched with the size of the nanoplastic ii or still larger as shown for nanoplastic i that is the colour offsetting approach still has limitations in general nanoplastics down to 100 nm can be mapped and localised either by decreasing the pixel size to enable the nanoplastic to centre at the laser spot or by offsetting the raman signal along this hypothesis direction a further decrease in pixel size is proposed in this study such as to 40 nm 40 nm to map nanoplastics of 30 80 nm 3 3 nanoplastics with the diameter of 100 nm fig 3 shows the results for nanoplastics of 100 nm in diameter the cross like pattern in fig 3 a in the sem image can also be mapped in fig 3 b f particularly in fig 3 b and c suggesting that nanoplastics of 100 nm can be imaged and visualised to align the same position for sem and raman imaging we distributed the nanoplastics on a silicon surface with a grid mark consequently the raman signal from the silicon was collected as the background along with the plastic s signal as shown in fig 3 g the silicon shows a strong peak at 520 cm 1 that is mapped as an image in fig 3 b interestingly the cross like pattern of the nanoplastics can be seen the reason is not clear although we have observed this phenomenon many times perhaps the raman signal particularly the fluorescence background in the presence of the nanoplastic overlaps onto the silicon signal as suggested in fig 3 g to generate the mapping image in fig 3 b more research is needed the different peaks generated different mapping images as shown in fig 3 c f although the ps nanoplastic yields a strong raman emission at the peak 1000 cm 1 it overlaps with the silicon peak as shown in fig 3 g it is therefore not selected for raman imaging here even though the other peaks are weak from the images fig 3 c f we still can identify the nanoplastics pattern shown in fig 3 a particularly in fig 3 c which is mapped at the peak of 1230 cm 1 the cross like pattern can be easily identified the other peaks intensity images also map the light on area although the cross like pattern is less clear uncertain mapping image mainly due to the weak raman signal emitted by the small nanoplastics with diameters of 100 nm in this case the intensity of the peak area not the peak height is necessary to distinguish the signal from the background noise as suggested in fig 1 c in the meantime the variation on the z axis from either the sample matrix or the piezo driven scanning stage might lead to the variation of the laser intensity towards the signal emission for a confocal raman hell 2007 lewandowska 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang and liu 2008 we further test the hypothesis in fig 2 by focusing on an individual nanoplastic with the diameter of 100 nm the results are shown in fig 4 the sem image is shown in fig 4 a in fig 4 b d and f the pixel size is 100 nm 100 nm with an integration time of 2 s not 1 s in order to collect the strong raman signal at peak 1000 cm 1 with a clean background from the gold wafer surface not from the silicon surface at the selected pixels in fig 4 b the left side of x axis the raman spectra are presented in fig 4 h intensity being offset for clarification as discussed in the analysis of fig 2 colour offsetting can improve the position resolution as shown in fig 4 b d and 4 f in which the colour scale bar has been changed from fig 4 c 4 e to fig 4 g respectively in fig 4 b d the maximum colour scale is set at 150 cts to optimise the colour brightness contrast however overshooting might occur there which means that in the central part the pixel colour will be the same although their raman intensities might be different this situation is improved in fig 4 f where the colour scale bar is offset at 200 210 cts the gaussian fitting curves are shown in fig 4 i and j with the gaussian peak width of 183 nm and 118 nm in the x and y axes respectively that is due to the limit of diffraction of the laser spot and the variation in the scanning step or pixel size the mapping spot has the diameter of 118 183 nm greater than its physical size of 100 nm as presented in fig 2 a and b fig 4 k presents the relationship between the fitting gaussian peak width i e the full width at half maximum and the diameter of the nanoplastics a link is observed down to 50 nm to be discussed later also see figs s1 2 in supplementary information suggesting a breakthrough of the diffraction limit of the excitation laser to achieve that breakthrough however i the scanning pixel size must be decreased which leads to a long scanning duration a much longer testing time and the colour must be offset possibly losing some signals for imaging ii the fitting variation on w also strongly depends on the pixel size as assumed in fig 2 a b and figs s1 s2 iii the dependence of w on d is significant for small nanoplastics such as in the range of 30 80 nm perhaps the smaller size of a nanoplastic can generate a better resolution a smaller moving step within a laser spot to monitor the gaussian distribution of the laser input steidtner and pettinger 2008 zhang and liu 2008 given the pixel size is significantly reduced this hypothesis gains support by comparison of the schematic drawing in fig 4 i with that in fig 1 d in the meantime the weak signal from the small nanoplastics might also lead to fitting variation 3 4 mixed nanoplastics with diameters of 300 nm and 100 nm in fig 3 c the raman signals of the mapped dots are weak due to the small size of the nanoplastics if small nanoplastics are mixed with large ones the larger ones generally emit a stronger signal in this case the strong raman signal emitted by large nanoplastics or aggregates might shield the weak signals from small nanoplastics to address this challenge 300 nm nanoplastics were mixed with 100 nm nanoplastics for analysis as shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a the colour scale bar was set at 0 200 cts to visualise all the nanoplastics regardless of whether the signal was strong up to 1400 cts or weak still higher than 10 cts the large bright spots in fig 5 a are assigned to the nanoplastics aggregates circled in fig 5 k l the weak spots might originate from individual nanoplastics we also set a rainbow colour scale bar as shown in fig 5 d to paint the different intensities of the raman signal to different colours the results are shown in fig 5 c and e now we could visualise small nanoplastics together with large ones fig 5 e is an alternative version of fig 5 c with a 3 dimensional view to further confirm the weak dots in fig 5 a the marked area was scanned using two different pixel sizes 333 nm 333 nm and 100 nm 100 nm the results are presented in fig 5 f and g respectively the mapping resolution could be improved by increasing the pixel resolution after colour offsetting the image in fig 5 i is even better confirming the hypothesis in relation to fig 2 due to the difficulty in alignment for raman and sem imaging at the same position on the gold wafer surface the sem image in fig 5 k might not be the exact position for raman mapping in fig 5 a and could be the neighbouring area the alignment became more difficult at the smaller size such as after zooming in the scanning area from the image in fig 5 k to that in fig 5 l anyway the aggregate can be observed in fig 5 k and l circled and a laser spot can simultaneously cover several nanoplastics whether they are individual or aggregated to emit the raman signal as a sum another analytical approach is to categorise and separate the nanoplastics according to their intensity as shown in fig 6 a strong raman signal higher than 100 cts can be mapped as fig 6 a in accordance with the colour bar in fig 6 b the signals are most likely from the aggregates of nanoplastics or large nanoplastics in fig 6 c the focus is on the weak signal 0 100 cts after removal of the strong signals in accordance with the colour scale bar in fig 6 d the mapped dots can be assigned to individual nanoplastics of 300 nm or 100 nm if they are not from noise it is important to be mindful of the mapped pixel size the smallest size of the dots in fig 6 c is 200 nm whereas the size of the nanoplastics is either 100 nm or 300 nm the image in fig 6 c can be further categorised to 3 different groups in terms of their intensity that being 70 100 cts to generate figs 6 e 30 70 cts to generate figs 6 f and 0 30 cts to generate fig 6 g the dots in fig 6 e can be assigned to 300 nm nanoplastics in fig 6 f to 100 nm nanoplastics and in fig 6 g to possible background noise or to uncertain signals further research is needed to confirm this approach particularly how to solve signals uncertainty 3 5 nanoplastics with a diameter in a range of 30 80 nm admittedly the above categorisation must be based on the certain raman signal which means there is no or at least no significant false of the raman signal for imaging in most cases the certain signal means the raman signal is strong or high ratio of signal noise such as when the nanoplastics are larger than 300 nm when the nanoplastics are as small as 100 nm the raman signal is weak which might lead to difficulty in distinguishing the signal from noise schwaferts et al 2020 this uncertainty becomes more serious when the nanoplastics diameters get smaller such as in the range of 30 80 nm as shown next here the silicon grid was selected to distribute the nanoplastic samples to enable sem and raman analysis at the same position fig 7 a shows the sem image at the exact position for raman imaging in fig 7 b h the silicon peak at 520 cm 1 is mapped as fig 7 b where the distribution pattern along the diagonal of the nanoplastics cannot be seen suggesting that the contribution of nanoplastics is weak at this selected peak considering that the ps nanoplastics yield a raman spectrum as shown in figs 1 c and 3 g there are several characteristic peak candidates for mapping the intensity images are shown in fig 7 c f which are mapped according to the peaks intensity at 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 respectively again the image mapped at 1000 cm 1 is not shown here due to the peak overlapping with silicon in fig 7 c g there are numerous mapping dots many more than the nanoplastics in the sem image in fig 7 a due to the bias issue and false raman signal at the selected peaks for imaging for an individual nanoplastic circled in fig 7 a c the data analysis is presented in fig s2 supplementary information basically the typical raman is weak and peak area integration of the signal is needed to distinguish it from the background noise as shown in fig s2 c to increase the signal s mapping certainty in the image two mapped images can be merged together either by logic or as shown in fig 7 g or by logic and as shown in fig 7 h respectively obviously the image in fig 7 h is much superior to that in fig 7 g in terms of signal certainty to match fig 7 a that is the chance of noise being simultaneously mapped via logic and at two selected peaks is significantly lowered thus it is a useful approach for decreasing the mapping noise when the raman signal is weak 3 6 real sample of car paint polishing dust the approach discussed above is validated in fig 8 where a real sample of car paint polishing dust is tested the weak raman signal generates fuzzy images in fig 8 a and b whereas the strong signal generates a better image in fig 8 f in accordance with their peak intensities as indicated in fig 8 e because the certainty of the image in fig 8 a and b is lower than that in fig 8 i the algorithm is needed for the analysis therefore from the parent images in fig 8 a and b the logic and generates an image in fig 8 c this daughter image seems to have less noise with a cleaner background than that in fig 8 a and b suggesting the advantage of the algorithm of logic and when this raman image is merged with the sem image via logic or fig 8 d is generated in this image we can simultaneously visualise the surface morphology from sem the flower like pattern and the distribution of plastic polymer from raman as previously reported sobhani et al 2020 there might be two domains or two components in the paint as suggested by their raman spectra in fig 8 e the raman image in fig 8 f can merge with the sem image to generate the image in fig 8 g and to visualise the distribution the strong raman signal means the certainty of the image is high at least higher than that in fig 8 a therefore the algorithm of logic or is employed for the direct overlap of raman image in fig 8 f onto an sem image we can merge more images by the algorithm as demonstrated in fig 8 h including raman images in fig 8 a b f simultaneously mapped at 3 different characteristic peaks and an sem image that is the images in fig 8 a and b are merged together via logic and to generate an image in fig 8 c which is further merged with the image in fig 8 f and the sem image via logic or to generate an image in the end as shown in fig 8 h we can clearly see the distribution of two components of plastic along with the morphology of the flower like pattern this approach is further validated by analysing other samples including a mixed nanoplastics sample with diameters of 600 nm and 300 nm two nanoplastic samples with diameters of 300 nm or 30 80 nm and a microplastics spiked sand sample as shown in figs s3 s6 supplementary information in general to increase the certainty of the signal logic and is recommended to reduce the noise by cross checking the signal conversely to avoid loss of signal logic or is recommended 4 conclusion to increase the resolution of mapping images extensive research has been undertaken such as scanning near field optical microscopy snom zhang et al 2017 tip enhanced raman scattering ters kawata et al 2017 superlens liu et al 2007 zhang and liu 2008 a simple approach was investigated in this study along with our previous one sobhani et al 2020 through raman imaging via pixel resolution improvement and colour offsetting for identification and visualisation of nanoplastics this is encouraging particularly given the consideration that nanoplastics could lead to adverse effects in humans and the environment and that identification and visualisation of nanoplastics are not yet well demonstrated two algorithms were also compared to analyse the intensity images logic or and logic and to avoid bias issues and reduce signal uncertainty the logic and algorithm is recommended merging at least two intensity images mapped at different characteristic raman peaks together for cross checking however to avoid loss of the signal logic or is suggested improving the analytical algorithm is still a challenge along with discovering how to enhance the weak raman signal from nanoplastics

17741,legally prescribed chemical monitoring is unfit for determining the pollution status of surface waters and there is a need for improved assessment methods that consider the aggregated risk of all bioavailable micropollutants present in the aquatic environment therefore the present study aimed to advance effect based water quality assessment by implementing methodological improvements and to gain insight into contamination source specific bioanalytical responses passive sampling of non polar and polar organic compounds and metals was applied at 14 surface water locations that were characterized by two major anthropogenic contamination sources agriculture and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent as well as reference locations with a low expected impact from micropollutants departing from the experience gained in previous studies a battery of 20 in vivo and in vitro bioassays was composed and subsequently exposed to the passive sampler extracts next the bioanalytical responses were divided by their respective effect based trigger values to obtain effect based risk quotients which were summed per location these cumulative ecotoxicological risks were lowest for reference locations 4 3 10 9 followed by agriculture locations 11 3 27 2 and the highest for wwtp locations 12 8 47 7 and were mainly driven by polar organic contaminants the bioanalytical assessment of the joint risks of metals and non polar organic compounds resulted in the successful identification of pollution source specific ecotoxicological risk profiles none of the bioassays were significantly associated with reference locations nor with multiple location types while horticulture locations were significantly characterized by anti ar and anti pr activity and cytotoxicity and wwtp sites by erα activity and toxicity in the in vivo bioassays it is concluded that the presently employed advanced effect based methods can readily be applied in surface water quality assessment and that the integration of chemical and effect based monitoring approaches will foster future proof water quality assessment strategies on the road to a non toxic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutants bioassay battery passive sampling water quality monitoring wastewater agriculture 1 introduction surface waters are contaminated with an increasing diversity of anthropogenic compounds giving rise to the presence of complex contaminant mixtures that can cause serious harm to aquatic ecosystems bernhardt et al 2017 schwarzenbach et al 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 legislations like the european water framework directive wfd european commission 2013 and the united states clean water act cwa epa 2019 aim to protect surface waters from human impacts by the implementation of chemical and ecological water quality criteria however the separate interpretations of the chemical and ecological status of water bodies often yield divergent water quality management advice which poses practical problems for the implementation of measures to protect surface waters from further degradation posthuma et al 2019 as a result there is a growing consensus among scientists and authorities that the methods currently used for chemical and ecological water quality assessment require a revision to obtain a more coherent and future proof approach altenburger et al 2019 escher et al 2020b faust et al 2019 traditionally chemical water quality is assessed by the monitoring of concentrations of a limited list of individual priority compounds however environmental concentrations of these compounds are decreasing and consequently currently identified risks to aquatic ecosystems are caused by complex mixtures of un known unregulated and unmonitored compounds brack et al 2019 neale et al 2017 hence the legally prescribed strategies are unfit for the monitoring of chemical pollution of surface waters and there is thus a need for improved assessment methods that consider the aggregated risk of all bioavailable micropollutants present in the aquatic environment drakvik et al 2020 consequently there is an increasing interest in the use of bioanalytical tools in environmental quality assessment brack et al 2019 brooks et al 2020 di paolo et al 2016 escher et al 2018 villeneuve et al 2019 bioanalytical responses to environmental samples are caused by the combined action of all bioavailable mixtures of un known compounds and their metabolites present in the sample thereby overcoming the limitations posed by chemical analysis of a limited number of target compounds brack et al 2019 doyle et al 2015 effect based strategies have been successful in the identification of ecotoxicological risks in surface waters and the ranking of locations based on these risks blackwell et al 2019 de baat et al 2019 hamers et al 2018 novák et al 2018 van der oost et al 2017a however the regular implementation of effect based methods in chemical water quality monitoring is still in its infancy and several scientific challenges in this field remain to be addressed brack et al 2019 among these are the establishment and standardization of a coherent battery of bioassays that covers all chemical groups that can potentially harm aquatic ecosystems the agreement on effect based trigger values ebts that differentiate between acceptable and poor water quality and the need for evaluation and validation of effect based methods in field based studies brack et al 2019 furthermore the development of a better understanding of contamination source specific bioanalytical response profiles is important because it can aid in the application of mitigation efforts following from effect based water quality assessment müller et al 2020 hence refinement of the current methods and an improved interpretation of bioanalytical responses is recommended for the implementation of effect based methods in regulatory frameworks like the cwa and the wfd bopp et al 2018 drakvik et al 2020 to answer the research needs outlined above the present study aimed to advance effect based water quality assessment by implementing methodological improvements and to gain insight into contamination source specific bioanalytical responses to this end the presently applied monitoring strategy combined passive sampling a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays and ebts to screen for potential ecotoxicological risks in surface waters the methodological improvements explored here were the bioanalytical risk assessment of metals and the streamlining of previously used bioassay batteries to represent those endpoints most relevant to aquatic ecosystem health de baat et al 2019 due to a strong focus on emerging organic contaminants metals have only rarely been included in the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical assessment of chemical surface water quality brack et al 2019 roig et al 2011 despite their potential toxicity therefore in the present study the bioanalytical risk assessment of metals was integrated with that of organic contaminants furthermore to simultaneously investigate the increasing risk of polar compounds in aquatic ecosystems reemtsma et al 2016 the in vivo bioassays were performed not only on non polar organic extracts as in previous studies but also on polar organic and metal extracts the streamlining of the bioassay battery followed from the experience gained in previous studies de baat et al 2019 and resulted in the exclusion of tests that were previously unresponsive in surface water quality assessment gr calux antibiotics waterscan and algal growth inhibition and their replacement with relevant and responsive endpoints anti pr calux and algal photosynthetic inhibition bioassay battery responses for the investigated locations were used to gain insight in contamination source specific toxicity profiles and the potential risks they pose to aquatic ecosystems therefore locations were selected that were distinctly characterized by two major anthropogenic contamination sources agriculture and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent as well as reference locations with a low expected impact from micropollutants 2 material methods 2 1 sampling locations sampling locations were selected in collaboration with nine dutch regional water authorities this resulted in a set of 14 lowland streams and drainage ditches in the netherlands within three location types fig 1 and table s1 either surrounded by ornamental flower bulb horticulture horticulture n 5 directly receiving wwtp effluent wwtp n 4 or reference locations with no known contamination sources reference n 5 the locations were comparable in width depth and flow velocity table s2 sampling of micropollutants was conducted by the continuous deployment of passive samplers at the sampling locations between august 20th and october 5th 2018 2 2 passive sampler deployment extraction and sampled volume estimation 2 2 1 passive sampling devices silicone rubber sr sheets with a weight of 20 g per set of six sheets spiked with performance reference compounds prcs were obtained from deltares utrecht the netherlands and applied for the sampling of non polar compounds booij et al 2002 polar organic chemical integrative samplers pocis containing 0 2 g of oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance sorbent hlb waters etten leur the netherlands were constructed in the laboratory at the university of amsterdam si 2 and applied for the sampling of compounds in the more polar range alvarez et al 2004 diffusive gradients in thin films dgt containing a 0 15 ml mixed chelex and tio2 metsorb binding layer were obtained from dgt research lancaster uk and applied for the sampling of metals from the surface water panther et al 2014 the samplers were transported to the study sites in airtight packaging at 4 c unexposed blanks of all sampler types were included in all subsequent analyses additional information on passive sampler construction extraction and sampled volume calculation is given in si 2 2 2 2 field deployment of passive samplers sr sheets and pocis were deployed simultaneously at each sampling location in separate stainless steel cages the mesh size of the cages allowed a largely unobstructed flow of water around the samplers cages with samplers were suspended in the middle of the water column to ensure permanent inundation of the samplers while avoiding direct diffusion of compounds from the sediment to the samplers per location six sr sheets and four pocis were exposed for a period of 6 wk after exposure the samplers were cleaned in the field with local water and a scrubbing sponge to remove biofouling transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at 20 c until extraction three dgts per location were deployed for 2 wk halfway through the pocis and sr deployment period dgts were retained in polyacrylate holders in the middle of the water column after exposure dgts were rinsed in the field with deionized water transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at 4 c until extraction 2 2 3 extraction of sr all equipment used in the sr extraction procedure was cleaned with acetone and lc grade acetonitrile biosolve the netherlands before use sr sheets were thawed and dried and the six sheets per location were folded and stacked in a harmonica shape to maximize the surface contact area with the extraction solvent and placed at the bottom of a 150 ml erlenmeyer flask fig s1 after the addition of 75 ml lc grade acetonitrile the flasks were closed and placed on a shaker for 2 d at 110 rpm extracts were stored at 4 c and the extraction procedure was repeated once more both extracts were combined in round bottom flasks and evaporated on a büchi rotavapor system flawil switzerland at 45 c and 117 mbar to approximately 5 ml the extracts were subsequently transferred to glass vials filled up to exactly 10 ml with lc grade acetonitrile by weight and stored at 20 c until analyses 2 2 4 extraction of pocis frozen pocis were freeze dried overnight at 53 c in a scanvac coolsafe freeze dryer all equipment used in the pocis extraction procedure was cleaned with acetone and lc grade acetonitrile before use each pocis was disassembled and the dry sorbent of the four pocis that were exposed per location was pooled and transferred to a 6 ml glass supelco spe column with teflon frit sigma aldrich the netherlands using a glass funnel the mass of the recovered sorbent per location was recorded with an analytical balance the spe columns were placed on an spe manifold and eluted three times with 3 ml lc grade acetonitrile under vacuum finally the extracts were topped up to exactly 10 ml with acetonitrile by weight and stored at 20 c until analyses 2 2 5 extraction of dgt all equipment used in the dgt extraction procedure was acid cleaned with 0 1 m hno3 and ultrapure water the three dgts per location were disassembled and their binding layers combined in 3 ml of 1 0 m hno3 extracted for 24 h at room temperature after which the extracts were stored at 4 c until analyses 2 2 6 estimation of sampled water volumes 2 2 6 1 sr sampling rates for sr were calculated based on the rate of prc dissipation from the sheets during the field exposure booij and smedes 2010 prc chemical analysis was performed at the laboratory of tno utrecht the netherlands analytical details provided in si 2 subsequently 50 of the calculated sampling rate for each location was used as a provisional estimation of the average extracted water volume per day based on the assumption that 50 of the organic contaminants present in the surface water reach equilibrium with the sr during field exposure as described by van der oost et al 2017a 2 2 6 2 pocis the reported average sampling rate for pocis of 0 18 l d harman et al 2012 that was previously successfully applied in combination with effect based water quality assessment de baat et al 2019 was used to determine the concentration factor of the field deployed pocis to compare bioassay responses between sites a correction for the hlb sorbent recovery was applied to incorporate sorbent loss during the extraction procedure to this end the remaining sorbent mass after extraction was divided by the initial sorbent mass 0 8 g for four pocis and the total estimated volume per location 30 24 l for four pocis was multiplied by this fraction to obtain a final sampled volume and to ensure an impartial comparison between locations 2 2 6 3 dgt since no general approach for the interpretation of bioassay results in combination with dgt extracts was available roig et al 2011 a novel approach to determine sampled volumes of dgt samplers was presently developed by using sampled water volumes for toxicity interpretation this new approach is now in line with that for organic extracts the sampling rate for the dgt samplers was determined using a theoretical approach as well as an approach based on the detected masses of metals that had accumulated in the samplers both approaches rely on dgt theory as outlined in numerous publications that confirm the usability of dgts to obtain time weighted average field concentrations of metals e g allan et al 2007 davison and zhang 2012 for the theoretical approach a formula was derived from the equations reported by allan et al 2007 1 rs da δg by using the constants given in table s3 and assuming a mean value for d of 5 0 10 6 cm2s 1 a daily sampling rate rs per 3 dgt samplers was derived of 44 2 ml d this theoretically derived sampling rate was subsequently confirmed using the labile metal concentrations in the water cwater which were calculated using the metal concentrations detected in the dgt extracts ce to allow for these calculations concentrations of cd cu fe pb and zn in the dgt extracts were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer optima 8300 perkinelmer only cu fe and zn were detected table s4 and the calculations were therefore based on these concentrations cwater values were calculated as follows using the variables and constants listed in table s3 first the mass of metal accumulated in the resin gel layer m was calculated for each metal using equation 2 2 m ce vhno3 vgel fe second cwater was calculated using equation 3 3 cwater mδg dat last the sampling rate of the dgt samplers was calculated using equation 4 4 rs m cwater 14 these calculations resulted in an experimentally derived mean sampling rate per 3 dgt samplers of 44 9 ml d which is very close to the theoretically derived sampling rate 44 2 ml d the small difference between the theoretical and experimental sampling rate is attributable to the variation of d with temperature which was accounted for in the experimentally derived sampling rate calculation therefore a mean sampled volume of 44 9 ml d for 3 dgt samplers was used in the subsequent data interpretation 2 3 bioassay battery a battery of 20 bioassays i e 20 unique bioassay x passive sampler extract combinations was applied for the detection of ecotoxicological effects at the investigated locations table 1 the whole organism daphnia and pam tests were performed at the laboratory of the university of amsterdam and the aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay was performed at the laboratory of the vrije universiteit amsterdam the in vitro calux assays were performed at the biodetection systems laboratory amsterdam the netherlands 2 3 1 sample pre treatment organic extracts were transferred to dimethyl sulfoxide dmso before application in the bioassays to this end the extracts were evaporated to dryness under n2 flow at room temperature and redissolved in dmso bioassays with organic extracts were performed at a 0 1 1 dmso concentration to improve compound solubility in the exposure media and a control was always included to confirm the non toxicity of the solvent inorganic extracts were freeze dried overnight at 53 c in a scanvac coolsafe freeze dryer and redissolved in exposure medium before exposure in the bioassays to eliminate the hno3 from the extracts full recovery of metal concentrations using this sample treatment method was confirmed in a separate experiment using internal standards data not shown 2 3 2 whole organism bioassays the whole organism aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition daphnia and pam bioassays were performed on dilution series of the extracts of all three passive samplers resulting in nine in vivo responses the aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay further referred to as bacterial bioluminescence assay was performed according to hamers et al 2001 luminescence inhibition was measured after 15 min of exposure to the passive sampler extracts the daphnia test was performed with d magna 24 h originating from an in house culture according to oecd guideline 202 with reduced test volumes as previously described van der oost et al 2017a daphnid immobilization was recorded after 48 h of exposure the pam test was performed using the freshwater microalga raphidocelis subcapitata originating from an in house culture according to de baat et al 2018 photosynthetic inhibition was measured after 4 5 h of exposure toxicity in the in vivo assays was expressed as toxic units tu wherein one tu represented the dilution at which the extract caused 50 effect for the respective endpoints ec50 ec50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with the built in log logistic model in graphpad prism graphpad software inc v 5 00 san diego ca usa next the bioassay responses were corrected for the estimated sampled water volumes of the passive samplers to represent the tu at the sampling locations 2 3 3 calux assays the passive sampler extracts were analysed by a panel of in vitro calux bioassays specific calux assays were performed on either non polar sr or polar pocis organic extracts sr extracts were subjected to dr pah pparγ nrf2 pxr and p53 without s9 metabolism assays and pocis extracts were subjected to erα anti ar and anti pr assays according to previously described protocols alygizakis et al 2019 the dr calux assay was performed with a sulfuric acid clean up step to eliminate degradable compounds e g pahs and to isolate the persistent compounds e g dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls cytotoxicity of the calux cells was monitored in both pocis and sr extracts to rule out confounding influences on test outcomes responses in the in vitro assays were expressed as concentrations of bioanalytical equivalents beq of the reference compounds table 1 or as tu p53 and cytotoxicity and corrected for the estimated sampled water volumes of the passive samplers to represent the beq l and tu at the sampling locations 2 4 risk interpretation using ebts bioanalytical responses were compared to ebts for ecotoxicological risk interpretation ebts reported by van der oost et al 2017b were used unless more recently derived ebts were available which was the case for the erα brion et al 2019 and anti ar escher et al 2018 calux assays for the pah and pxr calux assays strongly divergent ebts were reported by van der oost et al 2017b and escher et al 2018 hampering consolidated conclusions on ecotoxicological risks for these endpoints alygizakis et al 2019 therefore the influence of the ebts on the risk interpretation for these tests was explored in the present study and intermediate values were derived based on the methods outlined by escher et al 2018 as described in si 3 pah 62 1 ng beq l and pxr 5 4 μg neq l additionally a preliminary ebt was derived for the anti pr calux assay 13 ng ru486 eq l based on the value previously reported by escher et al 2018 as the reported reference compound differed from the one used in the present study si 3 since no ebts were previously defined for the application of dgt extracts in bioassays a preliminary ebt of 0 05 tu was presently derived for all three in vivo bioassays based on the approach outlined by van der oost et al 2017b si 3 this allowed for the interpretation of the bioassay responses to the dgt extracts in line with the approach for the organic extracts 2 5 statistical analysis the responses of all bioassays were divided by their respective ebts to obtain an effect based risk quotient where a quotient 1 represents a potential ecotoxicological risk indicated by that particular bioassay these effect based risk quotients were used for two purposes i the sum of these values yielded a cumulative ecotoxicological risk σ effect based risk quotient for each location and ii the quotients were subjected to multivariate analysis to gain insight into location type specific ecotoxicological response profiles to this end non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed in r r core team v 3 6 1 vienna austria using the metamds function in the vegan package based on dissimilarities calculated with the bray curtis index statistical differences between the location types were investigated using an analysis of similarity anosim using the anosim function the multipatt function with r g association function 9999 permutations and α 0 05 in the indicspecies package was then used to perform a multilevel pattern analysis to identify the bioassays that were significantly associated with the different location types 3 results 3 1 bioassay response frequencies all 20 unique bioassay x passive sampler extract combinations were successfully performed and all assays met their respective validity criteria responses of all bioassays for all locations converted to surface water concentrations are given in the supporting information 4 next it was determined how frequently the different extract x bioassay combinations resulted in the detection of potential ecotoxicological risks fig 2 bioassay responses were categorized as no response or a response below or above the ebt of that test the response frequencies ranged from no response at all locations for the daphnia assay exposed to metal extracts to ebt exceedance at 75 of locations for the erα and anti ar calux assays which were exposed to polar extracts out of the battery of 20 bioassays 11 showed responses above their ebts hence 55 of the applied bioassays indicated the presence of a potential ecotoxicological risk at one or multiple locations the most responsive assays ebt exceedance at 50 of locations were the erα anti ar pxr and anti pr calux assays the least responsive assays no response at 50 of locations were the dr and pparγ calux assays and the daphnia assay exposed to non polar and metal extracts and the pam algae bioassay in combination with all three extracts the substantial differences in the responsiveness of the applied bioassays to the passive sampler extracts illustrates that bioassays can be more or less effective in the bioanalytical assessment of surface water quality and highlights the need for the establishment and standardization of a coherent battery of bioassays 3 2 bioassay battery response profiles ebt exceedances were observed for all location types including the reference locations fig 3 the cumulative effect based risk quotients allowed the ranking of sites based on the potential ecotoxicological risks and the specific bioassay battery response profiles gave insight into the compound groups responsible for the risks at each location reference locations exhibited the lowest cumulative effect based risk quotients 4 3 10 9 followed by horticulture locations 11 3 27 2 and wwtp locations 12 8 47 7 on average ebts were most frequently exceeded at horticulture locations 22 of bioassays followed by wwtp locations 18 and least frequently at reference locations 13 these observations suggest distinct differences in bioanalytical response profiles between the location types which was subsequently corroborated by multivariate analysis of the bioassay responses the nmds ordination showed that the locations could indeed be grouped based on the location type fig 4 stress 0 086 and the anosim test confirmed that the bioassay battery response profiles differed significantly between location types anosim statistic r 0 6414 p 0 0001 the multilevel pattern analysis revealed that none of the bioassays were significantly associated with reference locations nor were any bioassays significantly associated with multiple location types contrastingly horticulture locations were significantly characterized by responses in the anti pr stat 0 962 p 0 0001 cytotoxicity polar stat 0 811 p 0 0014 and anti ar stat 0 651 p 0 0052 calux assays wwtp locations on the other hand were significantly characterized by responses in the bacterial bioluminescence assay polar stat 0 899 p 0 0006 metals stat 0 548 p 0 0036 erα calux stat 0 845 p 0 0006 daphnia non polar stat 0 713 p 0 0087 polar stat 0 674 p 0 0106 and pam algae polar stat 0 663 p 0 021 assays these observations confirm that each of the investigated contamination sources induced specific and non overlapping characteristic bioanalytical response profiles this in turn suggests that horticulture and wwtp effluent give rise to distinct chemical pollution profiles in surface waters which was not observed for unpolluted locations 4 discussion 4 1 methodological improvements for a better ecotoxicological risk identification 4 1 1 bioanalytical risk assessment of metals the identification of ecotoxicological risks in effect based surface water quality assessment depends strongly on the applied sampling methodology only compounds that are captured by the applied sampling methods present at concentrations above bioanalytical detection limits will elicit effects in the bioassays highlighting the importance of effective sampling strategies that ensure the sequestration of a wide range of compounds abbas et al 2019 passive sampling is often used in combination with bioassays as it allows for the sampling of a wide variety of bioavailable compounds and simultaneously concentrates the water resulting in lower bioanalytical detection limits altenburger et al 2019 however effect based strategies often have a strong focus on organic contamination and only rarely have metals been included in the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical assessment of chemical surface water quality roig et al 2011 in the present study passive sampling of metals was applied in combination with three in vivo bioassays matching the approach used for the bioanalytical risk assessment of organic compounds toxic effects of the metal extracts were observed in the pam algae and bacterial bioluminescence bioassays and comparison of the effects to the presently derived ebts elucidated potential risks to bacteria by metals at wwtp locations highlighting the relevance of effect based risk assessment of metals in surface waters as shown here this novel approach can easily be merged with existing effect based monitoring strategies to include the bioanalytical assessment of risks of bioavailable metal concentrations in aquatic systems 4 1 2 streamlining of previously used bioassay batteries to better represent endpoints relevant to aquatic ecosystem health to encompass a wide range of responsive endpoints that are representative of micropollutant risks in surface waters several adjustments to previously applied bioassay batteries were made the revised battery allowed for the detection of potential ecotoxicological risks caused by the presence of metals and polar and non polar organic compounds the addition of the anti pr calux assay resulted in the detection of potential ecotoxicological risks at 50 of the investigated locations and is thus a relevant amendment to previously applied bioassay batteries de baat et al 2019 van der oost et al 2017a furthermore performing the three in vivo assays not only on non polar organic extracts but also on polar organic and metal extracts elucidated potential ecotoxicological risks of polar compounds and metals that would have otherwise gone undetected this is in line with the study of hamers et al 2018 who found generally higher in vivo responses to polar extracts than to non polar extracts and reflects the expected increased risk caused by the increasing presence of polar compounds in surface waters reemtsma et al 2016 however to meet the monitoring requirements that are related to future shifts in the chemical properties of contaminants of emerging concern cecs effect based monitoring strategies should be open to further modifications and improvements improved passive sampling techniques for highly polar as well as ionizable organic compounds augusto et al 2013 escher et al 2020a combined with bioassays responsive to such compounds should result in future proof solutions that allow for risk assessment of these cecs considering assays that were not responsive in the currently applied bioassay battery the presently observed lack of dr calux activity is in line with previous predictions that dioxins and dioxin like compounds do not contribute substantially to the risks of organic micropollutants in surface waters de baat et al 2019 therefore the inclusion of the dr calux assay in bioassay batteries for surface water quality monitoring appears to present little relevance however as the sediment is the ultimate sink for dioxins and as such also represents a repository for legacy contamination with dioxins the use of the dr calux assay in sediment quality assessment remains relevant in the present study the traditional algal growth inhibition test was substituted by the pam algae bioassay which was expected to better elucidate the frequent presence of herbicides in surface waters de baat et al 2018 schreiner et al 2016 however the assay never showed an ebt exceedance and was in fact one of the least responsive assays in the battery nonetheless the pam algae assay gave a response at 29 of the locations which is a substantial increase compared to the previously observed response frequency of only 4 in the standard 72 h algae growth inhibition test de baat et al 2019 the lack of responses that exceed the ebt may be attributable to an actual low risk caused by herbicides in surface waters in the netherlands vonk and kraak 2020 at least at the sites presently sampled in late summer in many other intensive agricultural areas however the presence of hazardous concentrations of herbicides has been reported vonk and kraak 2020 and hence an even more sensitive algal bioassay may better elucidate the risks of herbicides in surface waters in effect based monitoring strategies riegraf et al 2019 the presently applied bioassay battery represents endpoints at all organizational levels that are relevant to aquatic ecosystem health as was proposed for holistic effect based water quality assessment by neale et al 2017 yet although it spans a wide variety of relevant endpoints some gaps remain in terms of the identification of groups of compounds that are contamination source specific and are expected to potentially cause serious harm to aquatic ecosystems most notably pesticides malaj et al 2014 munz et al 2017 and antibiotics paulus et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 pesticides in general do elicit toxic responses in anti ar and anti pr assays amongst others li et al 2008 liscio et al 2014 mnif et al 2011 however other endocrine disrupting compounds like pharmaceuticals and flame retardants can also elicit responses in such assays liscio et al 2014 hence attributing the observed effects to specific compounds requires confirmation either by highly specific bioassays or by chemical analysis for example the pam algae and daphnia bioassays can help tease out the effects of herbicides and insecticides respectively however specific effects of fungicides are as of yet not covered in the bioassay battery and expansion of the battery with fungal bioassays should allow for the isolation of fungicide toxicity similarly the bacterial bioluminescence assay responds to toxicity caused by certain antimicrobials but will also respond to a multitude of other compounds with specific and narcotic modes of action and is not able to isolate the effects of antibiotics highly specific bacterial reporter assays that can elucidate the activity of specific groups of antibiotics are currently being developed jonkers et al 2020 yet the lack of available ebts presently stands in the way of their application in bioassay batteries bioassays that allow for the identification of compound group specific effects will strongly aid in the identification of the responsible compounds in subsequent chemical analysis by narrowing down the list of suspects promising setups have been developed in recent years that combine ecologically relevant in vivo bioassays with liquid chromatography to obtain high throughput setups for effect directed analysis of ecologically relevant contaminants this is an approach with a high applicability in effect based water quality monitoring strategies like the present for all three in vivo bioassays that were applied in the present study effect directed analysis approaches were recently developed that can thus be readily implemented into effect based monitoring strategies to aid in the identification of causative compounds guo et al 2019 logemann et al 2019 riegraf et al 2019 in the future bioassay battery compositions can be tailored to include relevant assays depending on research or monitoring aims and to anticipate the ever changing nature of chemical pollution of surface waters 4 2 the influence of effect based trigger values on the outcome of bioanalytical surface water quality assessment ebts are critical in the determination of the significance of effects observed in bioassay batteries similar to what environmental quality standards represent for single compounds ebts indicate predicted no risk levels for mixtures of compounds that are present in environmental samples this highlights the importance of the establishment of reliable ebts a field of research that is gaining traction in recent years brion et al 2019 escher et al 2018 tang et al 2013 van der oost et al 2017b although there is consensus on the ebts for many bioassays for several strongly divergent ebts are reported hindering consolidated conclusions on ecotoxicological risks for those endpoints alygizakis et al 2019 this is most strikingly the case for the pah and pxr calux assays for which the ebts derived by van der oost et al 2017b and escher et al 2018 differ substantially pah 150 vs 6 2 ng beq l and pxr 3 vs 54 μg neq l respectively therefore in the present study the influence of the ebts of these two assays on the ecotoxicological risk assessment was investigated by comparing the resulting number of ebt exceedances and effect based risk quotients for all investigated locations table 2 additionally to merge the divergent ebts preliminary empirical intermediate ebts for both assays are presently proposed and used in the final effect based risk assessment pah 62 1 ng beq l and pxr 5 4 μg neq l for these two assays it appears that the activity except for two locations where the pah calux assay exhibited very high responses is uniformly present at all the investigated locations the application of the different ebts clearly illustrates their large and divergent impact on the resulting risk interpretation the van der oost et al 2017b values would result in almost no ebt exceedance for the pah calux and exceedance at almost all locations for the pxr calux contrastingly the escher et al 2018 values would result in ebt exceedances at almost all locations for the pah calux and no exceedance at all for the pxr calux whether the presently proposed intermediate ebts are in fact more representative of the risks of non specific chemical stress and pahs in surface waters is to be determined in future research the present exploration of the influence of ebts on the outcome of effect based risk assessments highlights the need for a consensus on ebts for a unified application in environmental monitoring frameworks the continuation of empirical research that links bioassay responses with adverse effects on the ecological status of water bodies is expected to further develop the scientific basis that is necessary for the reliable derivation of environmentally relevant ebts nonetheless bioanalytical responses are absolute and can be compared and ranked between locations and between studies regardless of the availability of ebts for risk interpretation moreover for spatiotemporal monitoring of ecotoxicological risks currently obtained bioanalytical responses can retroactively be compared to refined ebts that may be developed in the future hence the current lack of a consensus on ebts for a few bioassays is no practical limitation to the wide application of effect based tools in surface water quality assessment 4 3 location type specific bioanalytical response profiles the cumulative effect based risk quotients obtained in the present study indicated that ecotoxicological risks are potentially present even at reference locations this illustrates that micropollutants are ubiquitous and pervasive in densely populated river deltas like the netherlands which is corroborated by the general presence of non specific chemical stress at all locations as indicated by the promiscuous pxr calux assay nonetheless horticulture and wwtp locations always exhibited higher cumulative effect based risk quotients than the reference locations ecotoxicological profiles at horticulture locations were characterized by responses to polar extracts in the anti ar anti pr and cytotoxicity calux assays apart from toxicity to target organisms pesticides and their metabolites can have endocrine disrupting activities and the presently observed characteristic response profile for horticulture locations is likely a result of agricultural activity and the resulting use of pesticides on the surrounding fields mnif et al 2011 the wwtp locations contrastingly were characterized by responses to polar extracts in the erα calux assay and the three in vivo bioassays and for the daphnia bioassay to non polar extracts and the bacterial bioluminescence assay to metal extracts these responses were partly previously reported for wwtp effluent impacted surface waters in which they were related to the presence of complex mixtures of cecs like pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides and industrial chemicals altenburger et al 2018 alygizakis et al 2019 hence the two main anthropogenic contamination sources investigated in the present study give rise to unique ecotoxicological response profiles this is important because characteristic bioassay responses that are related to specific sources of pollution can aid the identification of potential causative contamination sources at impacted surface water locations for which the origin of pollution is not known furthermore this will allow the targeted implementation of mitigation measures that reduce the risks of chemical contamination in surface waters interestingly the majority of the potential ecotoxicological risks in the present study were caused by polar organic contaminants in both in vivo and in vitro assays underlining the urgency of the increasing risks caused by polar cecs in surface waters reemtsma et al 2016 these risks were especially pronounced in wwtp effluent impacted surface waters which highlights the critical need for the use of safer compounds input prevention and the implementation of advanced wastewater treatment technologies kümmerer et al 2018 5 conclusions passive sampling combined with effect based methods allows the detection of ecotoxicological risks of mixtures of a much wider range of bioavailable compounds than traditional chemical based methods prescribed by the wfd and cwa thus effect based methods are highly effective and superior to traditional chemical analytical methods in the screening of surface waters for potential ecotoxicological risks an elaborate bioanalytical toolbox is now available that allows the identification of contamination source specific ecotoxicological response profiles paving the way for the identification of causative groups of compounds the advancement of effect based monitoring methods and their implementation in regulatory frameworks like the wfd and cwa will empower scientists and authorities to work together on the way forward to protect water resources nonetheless chemical analyses that transcend a priori selected target compound lists are still fundamental to the identification of specific compounds that drive the observed risks and as such allow mitigation efforts for risk abatement ultimately the integration of chemical and effect based monitoring approaches will foster future proof water quality assessment strategies on the road to a non toxic environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17741,legally prescribed chemical monitoring is unfit for determining the pollution status of surface waters and there is a need for improved assessment methods that consider the aggregated risk of all bioavailable micropollutants present in the aquatic environment therefore the present study aimed to advance effect based water quality assessment by implementing methodological improvements and to gain insight into contamination source specific bioanalytical responses passive sampling of non polar and polar organic compounds and metals was applied at 14 surface water locations that were characterized by two major anthropogenic contamination sources agriculture and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent as well as reference locations with a low expected impact from micropollutants departing from the experience gained in previous studies a battery of 20 in vivo and in vitro bioassays was composed and subsequently exposed to the passive sampler extracts next the bioanalytical responses were divided by their respective effect based trigger values to obtain effect based risk quotients which were summed per location these cumulative ecotoxicological risks were lowest for reference locations 4 3 10 9 followed by agriculture locations 11 3 27 2 and the highest for wwtp locations 12 8 47 7 and were mainly driven by polar organic contaminants the bioanalytical assessment of the joint risks of metals and non polar organic compounds resulted in the successful identification of pollution source specific ecotoxicological risk profiles none of the bioassays were significantly associated with reference locations nor with multiple location types while horticulture locations were significantly characterized by anti ar and anti pr activity and cytotoxicity and wwtp sites by erα activity and toxicity in the in vivo bioassays it is concluded that the presently employed advanced effect based methods can readily be applied in surface water quality assessment and that the integration of chemical and effect based monitoring approaches will foster future proof water quality assessment strategies on the road to a non toxic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutants bioassay battery passive sampling water quality monitoring wastewater agriculture 1 introduction surface waters are contaminated with an increasing diversity of anthropogenic compounds giving rise to the presence of complex contaminant mixtures that can cause serious harm to aquatic ecosystems bernhardt et al 2017 schwarzenbach et al 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 legislations like the european water framework directive wfd european commission 2013 and the united states clean water act cwa epa 2019 aim to protect surface waters from human impacts by the implementation of chemical and ecological water quality criteria however the separate interpretations of the chemical and ecological status of water bodies often yield divergent water quality management advice which poses practical problems for the implementation of measures to protect surface waters from further degradation posthuma et al 2019 as a result there is a growing consensus among scientists and authorities that the methods currently used for chemical and ecological water quality assessment require a revision to obtain a more coherent and future proof approach altenburger et al 2019 escher et al 2020b faust et al 2019 traditionally chemical water quality is assessed by the monitoring of concentrations of a limited list of individual priority compounds however environmental concentrations of these compounds are decreasing and consequently currently identified risks to aquatic ecosystems are caused by complex mixtures of un known unregulated and unmonitored compounds brack et al 2019 neale et al 2017 hence the legally prescribed strategies are unfit for the monitoring of chemical pollution of surface waters and there is thus a need for improved assessment methods that consider the aggregated risk of all bioavailable micropollutants present in the aquatic environment drakvik et al 2020 consequently there is an increasing interest in the use of bioanalytical tools in environmental quality assessment brack et al 2019 brooks et al 2020 di paolo et al 2016 escher et al 2018 villeneuve et al 2019 bioanalytical responses to environmental samples are caused by the combined action of all bioavailable mixtures of un known compounds and their metabolites present in the sample thereby overcoming the limitations posed by chemical analysis of a limited number of target compounds brack et al 2019 doyle et al 2015 effect based strategies have been successful in the identification of ecotoxicological risks in surface waters and the ranking of locations based on these risks blackwell et al 2019 de baat et al 2019 hamers et al 2018 novák et al 2018 van der oost et al 2017a however the regular implementation of effect based methods in chemical water quality monitoring is still in its infancy and several scientific challenges in this field remain to be addressed brack et al 2019 among these are the establishment and standardization of a coherent battery of bioassays that covers all chemical groups that can potentially harm aquatic ecosystems the agreement on effect based trigger values ebts that differentiate between acceptable and poor water quality and the need for evaluation and validation of effect based methods in field based studies brack et al 2019 furthermore the development of a better understanding of contamination source specific bioanalytical response profiles is important because it can aid in the application of mitigation efforts following from effect based water quality assessment müller et al 2020 hence refinement of the current methods and an improved interpretation of bioanalytical responses is recommended for the implementation of effect based methods in regulatory frameworks like the cwa and the wfd bopp et al 2018 drakvik et al 2020 to answer the research needs outlined above the present study aimed to advance effect based water quality assessment by implementing methodological improvements and to gain insight into contamination source specific bioanalytical responses to this end the presently applied monitoring strategy combined passive sampling a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays and ebts to screen for potential ecotoxicological risks in surface waters the methodological improvements explored here were the bioanalytical risk assessment of metals and the streamlining of previously used bioassay batteries to represent those endpoints most relevant to aquatic ecosystem health de baat et al 2019 due to a strong focus on emerging organic contaminants metals have only rarely been included in the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical assessment of chemical surface water quality brack et al 2019 roig et al 2011 despite their potential toxicity therefore in the present study the bioanalytical risk assessment of metals was integrated with that of organic contaminants furthermore to simultaneously investigate the increasing risk of polar compounds in aquatic ecosystems reemtsma et al 2016 the in vivo bioassays were performed not only on non polar organic extracts as in previous studies but also on polar organic and metal extracts the streamlining of the bioassay battery followed from the experience gained in previous studies de baat et al 2019 and resulted in the exclusion of tests that were previously unresponsive in surface water quality assessment gr calux antibiotics waterscan and algal growth inhibition and their replacement with relevant and responsive endpoints anti pr calux and algal photosynthetic inhibition bioassay battery responses for the investigated locations were used to gain insight in contamination source specific toxicity profiles and the potential risks they pose to aquatic ecosystems therefore locations were selected that were distinctly characterized by two major anthropogenic contamination sources agriculture and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent as well as reference locations with a low expected impact from micropollutants 2 material methods 2 1 sampling locations sampling locations were selected in collaboration with nine dutch regional water authorities this resulted in a set of 14 lowland streams and drainage ditches in the netherlands within three location types fig 1 and table s1 either surrounded by ornamental flower bulb horticulture horticulture n 5 directly receiving wwtp effluent wwtp n 4 or reference locations with no known contamination sources reference n 5 the locations were comparable in width depth and flow velocity table s2 sampling of micropollutants was conducted by the continuous deployment of passive samplers at the sampling locations between august 20th and october 5th 2018 2 2 passive sampler deployment extraction and sampled volume estimation 2 2 1 passive sampling devices silicone rubber sr sheets with a weight of 20 g per set of six sheets spiked with performance reference compounds prcs were obtained from deltares utrecht the netherlands and applied for the sampling of non polar compounds booij et al 2002 polar organic chemical integrative samplers pocis containing 0 2 g of oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance sorbent hlb waters etten leur the netherlands were constructed in the laboratory at the university of amsterdam si 2 and applied for the sampling of compounds in the more polar range alvarez et al 2004 diffusive gradients in thin films dgt containing a 0 15 ml mixed chelex and tio2 metsorb binding layer were obtained from dgt research lancaster uk and applied for the sampling of metals from the surface water panther et al 2014 the samplers were transported to the study sites in airtight packaging at 4 c unexposed blanks of all sampler types were included in all subsequent analyses additional information on passive sampler construction extraction and sampled volume calculation is given in si 2 2 2 2 field deployment of passive samplers sr sheets and pocis were deployed simultaneously at each sampling location in separate stainless steel cages the mesh size of the cages allowed a largely unobstructed flow of water around the samplers cages with samplers were suspended in the middle of the water column to ensure permanent inundation of the samplers while avoiding direct diffusion of compounds from the sediment to the samplers per location six sr sheets and four pocis were exposed for a period of 6 wk after exposure the samplers were cleaned in the field with local water and a scrubbing sponge to remove biofouling transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at 20 c until extraction three dgts per location were deployed for 2 wk halfway through the pocis and sr deployment period dgts were retained in polyacrylate holders in the middle of the water column after exposure dgts were rinsed in the field with deionized water transported to the laboratory on ice and stored at 4 c until extraction 2 2 3 extraction of sr all equipment used in the sr extraction procedure was cleaned with acetone and lc grade acetonitrile biosolve the netherlands before use sr sheets were thawed and dried and the six sheets per location were folded and stacked in a harmonica shape to maximize the surface contact area with the extraction solvent and placed at the bottom of a 150 ml erlenmeyer flask fig s1 after the addition of 75 ml lc grade acetonitrile the flasks were closed and placed on a shaker for 2 d at 110 rpm extracts were stored at 4 c and the extraction procedure was repeated once more both extracts were combined in round bottom flasks and evaporated on a büchi rotavapor system flawil switzerland at 45 c and 117 mbar to approximately 5 ml the extracts were subsequently transferred to glass vials filled up to exactly 10 ml with lc grade acetonitrile by weight and stored at 20 c until analyses 2 2 4 extraction of pocis frozen pocis were freeze dried overnight at 53 c in a scanvac coolsafe freeze dryer all equipment used in the pocis extraction procedure was cleaned with acetone and lc grade acetonitrile before use each pocis was disassembled and the dry sorbent of the four pocis that were exposed per location was pooled and transferred to a 6 ml glass supelco spe column with teflon frit sigma aldrich the netherlands using a glass funnel the mass of the recovered sorbent per location was recorded with an analytical balance the spe columns were placed on an spe manifold and eluted three times with 3 ml lc grade acetonitrile under vacuum finally the extracts were topped up to exactly 10 ml with acetonitrile by weight and stored at 20 c until analyses 2 2 5 extraction of dgt all equipment used in the dgt extraction procedure was acid cleaned with 0 1 m hno3 and ultrapure water the three dgts per location were disassembled and their binding layers combined in 3 ml of 1 0 m hno3 extracted for 24 h at room temperature after which the extracts were stored at 4 c until analyses 2 2 6 estimation of sampled water volumes 2 2 6 1 sr sampling rates for sr were calculated based on the rate of prc dissipation from the sheets during the field exposure booij and smedes 2010 prc chemical analysis was performed at the laboratory of tno utrecht the netherlands analytical details provided in si 2 subsequently 50 of the calculated sampling rate for each location was used as a provisional estimation of the average extracted water volume per day based on the assumption that 50 of the organic contaminants present in the surface water reach equilibrium with the sr during field exposure as described by van der oost et al 2017a 2 2 6 2 pocis the reported average sampling rate for pocis of 0 18 l d harman et al 2012 that was previously successfully applied in combination with effect based water quality assessment de baat et al 2019 was used to determine the concentration factor of the field deployed pocis to compare bioassay responses between sites a correction for the hlb sorbent recovery was applied to incorporate sorbent loss during the extraction procedure to this end the remaining sorbent mass after extraction was divided by the initial sorbent mass 0 8 g for four pocis and the total estimated volume per location 30 24 l for four pocis was multiplied by this fraction to obtain a final sampled volume and to ensure an impartial comparison between locations 2 2 6 3 dgt since no general approach for the interpretation of bioassay results in combination with dgt extracts was available roig et al 2011 a novel approach to determine sampled volumes of dgt samplers was presently developed by using sampled water volumes for toxicity interpretation this new approach is now in line with that for organic extracts the sampling rate for the dgt samplers was determined using a theoretical approach as well as an approach based on the detected masses of metals that had accumulated in the samplers both approaches rely on dgt theory as outlined in numerous publications that confirm the usability of dgts to obtain time weighted average field concentrations of metals e g allan et al 2007 davison and zhang 2012 for the theoretical approach a formula was derived from the equations reported by allan et al 2007 1 rs da δg by using the constants given in table s3 and assuming a mean value for d of 5 0 10 6 cm2s 1 a daily sampling rate rs per 3 dgt samplers was derived of 44 2 ml d this theoretically derived sampling rate was subsequently confirmed using the labile metal concentrations in the water cwater which were calculated using the metal concentrations detected in the dgt extracts ce to allow for these calculations concentrations of cd cu fe pb and zn in the dgt extracts were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer optima 8300 perkinelmer only cu fe and zn were detected table s4 and the calculations were therefore based on these concentrations cwater values were calculated as follows using the variables and constants listed in table s3 first the mass of metal accumulated in the resin gel layer m was calculated for each metal using equation 2 2 m ce vhno3 vgel fe second cwater was calculated using equation 3 3 cwater mδg dat last the sampling rate of the dgt samplers was calculated using equation 4 4 rs m cwater 14 these calculations resulted in an experimentally derived mean sampling rate per 3 dgt samplers of 44 9 ml d which is very close to the theoretically derived sampling rate 44 2 ml d the small difference between the theoretical and experimental sampling rate is attributable to the variation of d with temperature which was accounted for in the experimentally derived sampling rate calculation therefore a mean sampled volume of 44 9 ml d for 3 dgt samplers was used in the subsequent data interpretation 2 3 bioassay battery a battery of 20 bioassays i e 20 unique bioassay x passive sampler extract combinations was applied for the detection of ecotoxicological effects at the investigated locations table 1 the whole organism daphnia and pam tests were performed at the laboratory of the university of amsterdam and the aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay was performed at the laboratory of the vrije universiteit amsterdam the in vitro calux assays were performed at the biodetection systems laboratory amsterdam the netherlands 2 3 1 sample pre treatment organic extracts were transferred to dimethyl sulfoxide dmso before application in the bioassays to this end the extracts were evaporated to dryness under n2 flow at room temperature and redissolved in dmso bioassays with organic extracts were performed at a 0 1 1 dmso concentration to improve compound solubility in the exposure media and a control was always included to confirm the non toxicity of the solvent inorganic extracts were freeze dried overnight at 53 c in a scanvac coolsafe freeze dryer and redissolved in exposure medium before exposure in the bioassays to eliminate the hno3 from the extracts full recovery of metal concentrations using this sample treatment method was confirmed in a separate experiment using internal standards data not shown 2 3 2 whole organism bioassays the whole organism aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition daphnia and pam bioassays were performed on dilution series of the extracts of all three passive samplers resulting in nine in vivo responses the aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence inhibition assay further referred to as bacterial bioluminescence assay was performed according to hamers et al 2001 luminescence inhibition was measured after 15 min of exposure to the passive sampler extracts the daphnia test was performed with d magna 24 h originating from an in house culture according to oecd guideline 202 with reduced test volumes as previously described van der oost et al 2017a daphnid immobilization was recorded after 48 h of exposure the pam test was performed using the freshwater microalga raphidocelis subcapitata originating from an in house culture according to de baat et al 2018 photosynthetic inhibition was measured after 4 5 h of exposure toxicity in the in vivo assays was expressed as toxic units tu wherein one tu represented the dilution at which the extract caused 50 effect for the respective endpoints ec50 ec50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with the built in log logistic model in graphpad prism graphpad software inc v 5 00 san diego ca usa next the bioassay responses were corrected for the estimated sampled water volumes of the passive samplers to represent the tu at the sampling locations 2 3 3 calux assays the passive sampler extracts were analysed by a panel of in vitro calux bioassays specific calux assays were performed on either non polar sr or polar pocis organic extracts sr extracts were subjected to dr pah pparγ nrf2 pxr and p53 without s9 metabolism assays and pocis extracts were subjected to erα anti ar and anti pr assays according to previously described protocols alygizakis et al 2019 the dr calux assay was performed with a sulfuric acid clean up step to eliminate degradable compounds e g pahs and to isolate the persistent compounds e g dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls cytotoxicity of the calux cells was monitored in both pocis and sr extracts to rule out confounding influences on test outcomes responses in the in vitro assays were expressed as concentrations of bioanalytical equivalents beq of the reference compounds table 1 or as tu p53 and cytotoxicity and corrected for the estimated sampled water volumes of the passive samplers to represent the beq l and tu at the sampling locations 2 4 risk interpretation using ebts bioanalytical responses were compared to ebts for ecotoxicological risk interpretation ebts reported by van der oost et al 2017b were used unless more recently derived ebts were available which was the case for the erα brion et al 2019 and anti ar escher et al 2018 calux assays for the pah and pxr calux assays strongly divergent ebts were reported by van der oost et al 2017b and escher et al 2018 hampering consolidated conclusions on ecotoxicological risks for these endpoints alygizakis et al 2019 therefore the influence of the ebts on the risk interpretation for these tests was explored in the present study and intermediate values were derived based on the methods outlined by escher et al 2018 as described in si 3 pah 62 1 ng beq l and pxr 5 4 μg neq l additionally a preliminary ebt was derived for the anti pr calux assay 13 ng ru486 eq l based on the value previously reported by escher et al 2018 as the reported reference compound differed from the one used in the present study si 3 since no ebts were previously defined for the application of dgt extracts in bioassays a preliminary ebt of 0 05 tu was presently derived for all three in vivo bioassays based on the approach outlined by van der oost et al 2017b si 3 this allowed for the interpretation of the bioassay responses to the dgt extracts in line with the approach for the organic extracts 2 5 statistical analysis the responses of all bioassays were divided by their respective ebts to obtain an effect based risk quotient where a quotient 1 represents a potential ecotoxicological risk indicated by that particular bioassay these effect based risk quotients were used for two purposes i the sum of these values yielded a cumulative ecotoxicological risk σ effect based risk quotient for each location and ii the quotients were subjected to multivariate analysis to gain insight into location type specific ecotoxicological response profiles to this end non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed in r r core team v 3 6 1 vienna austria using the metamds function in the vegan package based on dissimilarities calculated with the bray curtis index statistical differences between the location types were investigated using an analysis of similarity anosim using the anosim function the multipatt function with r g association function 9999 permutations and α 0 05 in the indicspecies package was then used to perform a multilevel pattern analysis to identify the bioassays that were significantly associated with the different location types 3 results 3 1 bioassay response frequencies all 20 unique bioassay x passive sampler extract combinations were successfully performed and all assays met their respective validity criteria responses of all bioassays for all locations converted to surface water concentrations are given in the supporting information 4 next it was determined how frequently the different extract x bioassay combinations resulted in the detection of potential ecotoxicological risks fig 2 bioassay responses were categorized as no response or a response below or above the ebt of that test the response frequencies ranged from no response at all locations for the daphnia assay exposed to metal extracts to ebt exceedance at 75 of locations for the erα and anti ar calux assays which were exposed to polar extracts out of the battery of 20 bioassays 11 showed responses above their ebts hence 55 of the applied bioassays indicated the presence of a potential ecotoxicological risk at one or multiple locations the most responsive assays ebt exceedance at 50 of locations were the erα anti ar pxr and anti pr calux assays the least responsive assays no response at 50 of locations were the dr and pparγ calux assays and the daphnia assay exposed to non polar and metal extracts and the pam algae bioassay in combination with all three extracts the substantial differences in the responsiveness of the applied bioassays to the passive sampler extracts illustrates that bioassays can be more or less effective in the bioanalytical assessment of surface water quality and highlights the need for the establishment and standardization of a coherent battery of bioassays 3 2 bioassay battery response profiles ebt exceedances were observed for all location types including the reference locations fig 3 the cumulative effect based risk quotients allowed the ranking of sites based on the potential ecotoxicological risks and the specific bioassay battery response profiles gave insight into the compound groups responsible for the risks at each location reference locations exhibited the lowest cumulative effect based risk quotients 4 3 10 9 followed by horticulture locations 11 3 27 2 and wwtp locations 12 8 47 7 on average ebts were most frequently exceeded at horticulture locations 22 of bioassays followed by wwtp locations 18 and least frequently at reference locations 13 these observations suggest distinct differences in bioanalytical response profiles between the location types which was subsequently corroborated by multivariate analysis of the bioassay responses the nmds ordination showed that the locations could indeed be grouped based on the location type fig 4 stress 0 086 and the anosim test confirmed that the bioassay battery response profiles differed significantly between location types anosim statistic r 0 6414 p 0 0001 the multilevel pattern analysis revealed that none of the bioassays were significantly associated with reference locations nor were any bioassays significantly associated with multiple location types contrastingly horticulture locations were significantly characterized by responses in the anti pr stat 0 962 p 0 0001 cytotoxicity polar stat 0 811 p 0 0014 and anti ar stat 0 651 p 0 0052 calux assays wwtp locations on the other hand were significantly characterized by responses in the bacterial bioluminescence assay polar stat 0 899 p 0 0006 metals stat 0 548 p 0 0036 erα calux stat 0 845 p 0 0006 daphnia non polar stat 0 713 p 0 0087 polar stat 0 674 p 0 0106 and pam algae polar stat 0 663 p 0 021 assays these observations confirm that each of the investigated contamination sources induced specific and non overlapping characteristic bioanalytical response profiles this in turn suggests that horticulture and wwtp effluent give rise to distinct chemical pollution profiles in surface waters which was not observed for unpolluted locations 4 discussion 4 1 methodological improvements for a better ecotoxicological risk identification 4 1 1 bioanalytical risk assessment of metals the identification of ecotoxicological risks in effect based surface water quality assessment depends strongly on the applied sampling methodology only compounds that are captured by the applied sampling methods present at concentrations above bioanalytical detection limits will elicit effects in the bioassays highlighting the importance of effective sampling strategies that ensure the sequestration of a wide range of compounds abbas et al 2019 passive sampling is often used in combination with bioassays as it allows for the sampling of a wide variety of bioavailable compounds and simultaneously concentrates the water resulting in lower bioanalytical detection limits altenburger et al 2019 however effect based strategies often have a strong focus on organic contamination and only rarely have metals been included in the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical assessment of chemical surface water quality roig et al 2011 in the present study passive sampling of metals was applied in combination with three in vivo bioassays matching the approach used for the bioanalytical risk assessment of organic compounds toxic effects of the metal extracts were observed in the pam algae and bacterial bioluminescence bioassays and comparison of the effects to the presently derived ebts elucidated potential risks to bacteria by metals at wwtp locations highlighting the relevance of effect based risk assessment of metals in surface waters as shown here this novel approach can easily be merged with existing effect based monitoring strategies to include the bioanalytical assessment of risks of bioavailable metal concentrations in aquatic systems 4 1 2 streamlining of previously used bioassay batteries to better represent endpoints relevant to aquatic ecosystem health to encompass a wide range of responsive endpoints that are representative of micropollutant risks in surface waters several adjustments to previously applied bioassay batteries were made the revised battery allowed for the detection of potential ecotoxicological risks caused by the presence of metals and polar and non polar organic compounds the addition of the anti pr calux assay resulted in the detection of potential ecotoxicological risks at 50 of the investigated locations and is thus a relevant amendment to previously applied bioassay batteries de baat et al 2019 van der oost et al 2017a furthermore performing the three in vivo assays not only on non polar organic extracts but also on polar organic and metal extracts elucidated potential ecotoxicological risks of polar compounds and metals that would have otherwise gone undetected this is in line with the study of hamers et al 2018 who found generally higher in vivo responses to polar extracts than to non polar extracts and reflects the expected increased risk caused by the increasing presence of polar compounds in surface waters reemtsma et al 2016 however to meet the monitoring requirements that are related to future shifts in the chemical properties of contaminants of emerging concern cecs effect based monitoring strategies should be open to further modifications and improvements improved passive sampling techniques for highly polar as well as ionizable organic compounds augusto et al 2013 escher et al 2020a combined with bioassays responsive to such compounds should result in future proof solutions that allow for risk assessment of these cecs considering assays that were not responsive in the currently applied bioassay battery the presently observed lack of dr calux activity is in line with previous predictions that dioxins and dioxin like compounds do not contribute substantially to the risks of organic micropollutants in surface waters de baat et al 2019 therefore the inclusion of the dr calux assay in bioassay batteries for surface water quality monitoring appears to present little relevance however as the sediment is the ultimate sink for dioxins and as such also represents a repository for legacy contamination with dioxins the use of the dr calux assay in sediment quality assessment remains relevant in the present study the traditional algal growth inhibition test was substituted by the pam algae bioassay which was expected to better elucidate the frequent presence of herbicides in surface waters de baat et al 2018 schreiner et al 2016 however the assay never showed an ebt exceedance and was in fact one of the least responsive assays in the battery nonetheless the pam algae assay gave a response at 29 of the locations which is a substantial increase compared to the previously observed response frequency of only 4 in the standard 72 h algae growth inhibition test de baat et al 2019 the lack of responses that exceed the ebt may be attributable to an actual low risk caused by herbicides in surface waters in the netherlands vonk and kraak 2020 at least at the sites presently sampled in late summer in many other intensive agricultural areas however the presence of hazardous concentrations of herbicides has been reported vonk and kraak 2020 and hence an even more sensitive algal bioassay may better elucidate the risks of herbicides in surface waters in effect based monitoring strategies riegraf et al 2019 the presently applied bioassay battery represents endpoints at all organizational levels that are relevant to aquatic ecosystem health as was proposed for holistic effect based water quality assessment by neale et al 2017 yet although it spans a wide variety of relevant endpoints some gaps remain in terms of the identification of groups of compounds that are contamination source specific and are expected to potentially cause serious harm to aquatic ecosystems most notably pesticides malaj et al 2014 munz et al 2017 and antibiotics paulus et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 pesticides in general do elicit toxic responses in anti ar and anti pr assays amongst others li et al 2008 liscio et al 2014 mnif et al 2011 however other endocrine disrupting compounds like pharmaceuticals and flame retardants can also elicit responses in such assays liscio et al 2014 hence attributing the observed effects to specific compounds requires confirmation either by highly specific bioassays or by chemical analysis for example the pam algae and daphnia bioassays can help tease out the effects of herbicides and insecticides respectively however specific effects of fungicides are as of yet not covered in the bioassay battery and expansion of the battery with fungal bioassays should allow for the isolation of fungicide toxicity similarly the bacterial bioluminescence assay responds to toxicity caused by certain antimicrobials but will also respond to a multitude of other compounds with specific and narcotic modes of action and is not able to isolate the effects of antibiotics highly specific bacterial reporter assays that can elucidate the activity of specific groups of antibiotics are currently being developed jonkers et al 2020 yet the lack of available ebts presently stands in the way of their application in bioassay batteries bioassays that allow for the identification of compound group specific effects will strongly aid in the identification of the responsible compounds in subsequent chemical analysis by narrowing down the list of suspects promising setups have been developed in recent years that combine ecologically relevant in vivo bioassays with liquid chromatography to obtain high throughput setups for effect directed analysis of ecologically relevant contaminants this is an approach with a high applicability in effect based water quality monitoring strategies like the present for all three in vivo bioassays that were applied in the present study effect directed analysis approaches were recently developed that can thus be readily implemented into effect based monitoring strategies to aid in the identification of causative compounds guo et al 2019 logemann et al 2019 riegraf et al 2019 in the future bioassay battery compositions can be tailored to include relevant assays depending on research or monitoring aims and to anticipate the ever changing nature of chemical pollution of surface waters 4 2 the influence of effect based trigger values on the outcome of bioanalytical surface water quality assessment ebts are critical in the determination of the significance of effects observed in bioassay batteries similar to what environmental quality standards represent for single compounds ebts indicate predicted no risk levels for mixtures of compounds that are present in environmental samples this highlights the importance of the establishment of reliable ebts a field of research that is gaining traction in recent years brion et al 2019 escher et al 2018 tang et al 2013 van der oost et al 2017b although there is consensus on the ebts for many bioassays for several strongly divergent ebts are reported hindering consolidated conclusions on ecotoxicological risks for those endpoints alygizakis et al 2019 this is most strikingly the case for the pah and pxr calux assays for which the ebts derived by van der oost et al 2017b and escher et al 2018 differ substantially pah 150 vs 6 2 ng beq l and pxr 3 vs 54 μg neq l respectively therefore in the present study the influence of the ebts of these two assays on the ecotoxicological risk assessment was investigated by comparing the resulting number of ebt exceedances and effect based risk quotients for all investigated locations table 2 additionally to merge the divergent ebts preliminary empirical intermediate ebts for both assays are presently proposed and used in the final effect based risk assessment pah 62 1 ng beq l and pxr 5 4 μg neq l for these two assays it appears that the activity except for two locations where the pah calux assay exhibited very high responses is uniformly present at all the investigated locations the application of the different ebts clearly illustrates their large and divergent impact on the resulting risk interpretation the van der oost et al 2017b values would result in almost no ebt exceedance for the pah calux and exceedance at almost all locations for the pxr calux contrastingly the escher et al 2018 values would result in ebt exceedances at almost all locations for the pah calux and no exceedance at all for the pxr calux whether the presently proposed intermediate ebts are in fact more representative of the risks of non specific chemical stress and pahs in surface waters is to be determined in future research the present exploration of the influence of ebts on the outcome of effect based risk assessments highlights the need for a consensus on ebts for a unified application in environmental monitoring frameworks the continuation of empirical research that links bioassay responses with adverse effects on the ecological status of water bodies is expected to further develop the scientific basis that is necessary for the reliable derivation of environmentally relevant ebts nonetheless bioanalytical responses are absolute and can be compared and ranked between locations and between studies regardless of the availability of ebts for risk interpretation moreover for spatiotemporal monitoring of ecotoxicological risks currently obtained bioanalytical responses can retroactively be compared to refined ebts that may be developed in the future hence the current lack of a consensus on ebts for a few bioassays is no practical limitation to the wide application of effect based tools in surface water quality assessment 4 3 location type specific bioanalytical response profiles the cumulative effect based risk quotients obtained in the present study indicated that ecotoxicological risks are potentially present even at reference locations this illustrates that micropollutants are ubiquitous and pervasive in densely populated river deltas like the netherlands which is corroborated by the general presence of non specific chemical stress at all locations as indicated by the promiscuous pxr calux assay nonetheless horticulture and wwtp locations always exhibited higher cumulative effect based risk quotients than the reference locations ecotoxicological profiles at horticulture locations were characterized by responses to polar extracts in the anti ar anti pr and cytotoxicity calux assays apart from toxicity to target organisms pesticides and their metabolites can have endocrine disrupting activities and the presently observed characteristic response profile for horticulture locations is likely a result of agricultural activity and the resulting use of pesticides on the surrounding fields mnif et al 2011 the wwtp locations contrastingly were characterized by responses to polar extracts in the erα calux assay and the three in vivo bioassays and for the daphnia bioassay to non polar extracts and the bacterial bioluminescence assay to metal extracts these responses were partly previously reported for wwtp effluent impacted surface waters in which they were related to the presence of complex mixtures of cecs like pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides and industrial chemicals altenburger et al 2018 alygizakis et al 2019 hence the two main anthropogenic contamination sources investigated in the present study give rise to unique ecotoxicological response profiles this is important because characteristic bioassay responses that are related to specific sources of pollution can aid the identification of potential causative contamination sources at impacted surface water locations for which the origin of pollution is not known furthermore this will allow the targeted implementation of mitigation measures that reduce the risks of chemical contamination in surface waters interestingly the majority of the potential ecotoxicological risks in the present study were caused by polar organic contaminants in both in vivo and in vitro assays underlining the urgency of the increasing risks caused by polar cecs in surface waters reemtsma et al 2016 these risks were especially pronounced in wwtp effluent impacted surface waters which highlights the critical need for the use of safer compounds input prevention and the implementation of advanced wastewater treatment technologies kümmerer et al 2018 5 conclusions passive sampling combined with effect based methods allows the detection of ecotoxicological risks of mixtures of a much wider range of bioavailable compounds than traditional chemical based methods prescribed by the wfd and cwa thus effect based methods are highly effective and superior to traditional chemical analytical methods in the screening of surface waters for potential ecotoxicological risks an elaborate bioanalytical toolbox is now available that allows the identification of contamination source specific ecotoxicological response profiles paving the way for the identification of causative groups of compounds the advancement of effect based monitoring methods and their implementation in regulatory frameworks like the wfd and cwa will empower scientists and authorities to work together on the way forward to protect water resources nonetheless chemical analyses that transcend a priori selected target compound lists are still fundamental to the identification of specific compounds that drive the observed risks and as such allow mitigation efforts for risk abatement ultimately the integration of chemical and effect based monitoring approaches will foster future proof water quality assessment strategies on the road to a non toxic environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17742,in this study a new photo aging pathway in the aquatic environments and the underlying transformation mechanism were described for polyvinyl chloride microplastic pvc mp our results indicated that the photo aging of pvc mp was strongly dependent on particle size and the aging reaction could be facilitated in the presence of low molecular weight organic acid lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii complex under simulated and natural sunlight irradiation and ambient conditions the hydroxyl radical oh generated from the photolysis of lmwoa or its ferric complexes played a dominant role in enhancing pvc mp degradation in situ fourier transform infrared and raman spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations further confirmed that c cl bond cleavage and formation of polyene and carbonyl underwent on the pvc mp surface especially in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii moreover pvc mp surface oxidation also led to the increase of the specific surface area and affinity towards water as indicated by the results of scanning electron microscopy brunauer emmett teller tests and contact angles for water which would further enhance the adsorption of polar contaminants on pvc mp and thus increase the health risk of pvc mp on aquatic organisms graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyvinyl chloride microplastic low molecular weight organic acid reactive oxygen species dechlorination aging process 1 introduction recently microplastic mp size 5 mm has become a ubiquitous environmental problem and raised great concerns for environmental researchers and the public cole et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 huerta lwanga et al 2016 mp itself is divided into two categories primary and secondary mps the primary source refers to plastics that are manufactured in microscopic size such as abrasive scrubbers used in facial cleansers fendall and sewell 2009 while the secondary mps are generally derived from fragmentation of large plastics via photolytic mechanical thermal hydrolytic and biological degradation processes in the environments cole et al 2011 with the excellent chemical and physical properties polyvinyl chloride pvc plastics have been widely used in various industrial and domestic products since 2006 china has exceeded the usa in the capacity of pvc production becoming the largest pvc producer in the world research report on china s polyvinyl chloride pvc industry 2017 however most of the pvc plastics are littered without collection and the presence of macro and micro sized debris of pvc has been ubiquitously detected in various environmental matrices browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 it was reported that pvc was one of the most common mps found in sandy beaches browne et al 2010 and it could account for 25 of mps in estuaries browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 green et al 2016 according to a recent study the abundance of pvc mp with size 0 5 mm could reach 400 pellets m 3 in the pearl river of china yan et al 2019 due to the greater density of pvc 1 20 1 45 g cm 3 compared to freshwater and seawater the amount of pvc mp existing in natural waters was often underestimated claessens et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 moreover based on the toxicity assessments of pvc mp after ingestion pvc mp could cause suppressed feeding activity intestinal damage and increase of lethality for lugworm arenicola marina zebrafish danio rerio and nematode caenorhabditis elegans respectively green et al 2016 lei et al 2018 in addition due to the presence of chlorine atoms in the polymer skeleton pvc mp could exhibit greater toxicity than polyethylene to lugworms green et al 2016 however even the environmental distribution and toxicity of pvc mp have been extensively investigated only limited information is available for the environmental transformation of pvc mp in various circumstances it has been reported that sunlight irradiation is a major pathway for the generation of mp particles song et al 2017 moreover photo transformation could enhance the mobility and adsorption capacities of mps for common environmental pollutants e g pyrene and ciprofloxacin cip which might be resulted from the increased surface area and hydrophilicity liu et al 2019a 2019b while the natural photo aging of mps is generally considered as a slow process especially in aquatic environments zhu et al 2020 recent studies have confirmed that the reactive oxygen species ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radical anion o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh exhibited great potentials to accelerate the aging process of mps in the aquatic system liu et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to investigate the photo transformation of pvc mp in the presence of active substances that are able to generate ros under solar irradiation low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas e g oxalic and citric acids are widely distributed in the environment albert and martens 1997 cieśliński et al 1998 strobel 2001 these lmwoas are major components of plant root exudates and can be leached into river in the forms of free acids or metal complexes jones 1998 upon solar or ultraviolet irradiation lmwoas can undergo decomposition with the formation of highly reductive species i e carbon dioxide radical anion co2 e co2 co2 1 9 v wardman 1989 tachikawa et al 2004 it has been further reported that when lmwoas form complexes with metal ions e g fe iii the generation of co2 during photolysis becomes more facile especially for oxalate abrahamson et al 1994 in addition under ambient condition co2 could react with oxygen molecules further generating ros such as o2 and oh mangiante et al 2017 for microscopic pvc particles once released into the environment they might have great potential to interact with lmwoas and undergo redox reactions which could significantly affect their environmental fate however so far to the best of our knowledge there is no report for the interactions between pvc mp and the reactive species derived from photolysis of lmwoas the objective of this study was to gain more insights into the environmental behaviors of pvc mp in the presence of lmwoas under environmentally relevant conditions oxalic and citric acids were used as the model lmwoas the effects of mp particle size and the presence of fe iii in the reaction system were systematically investigated the degradation mechanism and surface characterization of pvc mp under simulated sunlight irradiation were studied by electron paramagnetic resonance epr in situ microscope of attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in situ micro atr ftir and in situ raman spectroscopy the changes of pvc mp surface properties were further evaluated by the adsorption of a representative polar compound i e ciprofloxacin the results obtained from this research would reveal a new degradation pathway for pvc mp and provide valuable information to assess the potential environmental transformation of pvc mp in natural aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals details of chemicals are provided in text s1 2 2 pvc mp photo transformation in the presence of lmwoas under different oxic conditions the photo reaction experiments were conducted in aqueous solution 40 ml containing 100 mg l 1 pvc mp and 100 μm lmwoa i e oxalate and citrate pvc mp particles with different sizes of 2 10 25 and 150 μm were used in the experiments the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 with 1 0 mm phosphate buffer the photochemical reaction was performed in a merry go round xpa 7 model reactor xujiang electromechanical inc nanjing china in which a 500 w xenon lamp institute of electric light source beijing was used as the light source to simulate sunlight irradiation the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 c using a cylindrical quartz cold trap and a recycled cooling water system the light intensity on the surface of the quartz reaction tube was measured as 40 mw cm 2 by a cel np2000 10 radiometer ceaulight inc beijing china a magnetic stir bar was placed in each tube to ensure that pvc mp was fully suspended at predetermined time interval during the course of reaction samples were sacrificed and the released cl concentrations during the photoreaction were measured by an ion chromatography ics900 dionex co usa equipped with a conductivity detector and an as23 anionic column a mixture of 3 5 mm na2co3 and 1 0 mm nahco3 was served as the eluent and the flow rate was set as 1 0 ml min 1 similar experiments were also conducted in the presence of both lmwoa and fe iii mixture solution of 100 μm lmwoa and 10 μm fe iii i e oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii to investigate the effect of lmwoa fe iii complex on the photo aging of pvc mp in addition photo degradation of control groups i e pvc mp only and pvc mp in the presence of fe iii was also studied for comparison the effect of lmwoa dosage on the transformation of pvc mp was also investigated by adding 5 and 2000 μm oxalic citric acids to obtain insights into the effect of dissolved oxygen the decomposition kinetics experiments were further studied under anaerobic and oxygenated conditions by purging n2 99 5 and o2 99 99 respectively all the experiments were conducted in triplicates similar experiments were also performed under natural solar irradiation from may 1 to may 28 2020 the sample was rotated with a 30 slope on the building roof of the school of the environment nanjing university china 32 7 n 118 57 e the cel np2000 10 radiometer ceaulight inc beijing china and thermometer was used to record the light intensity and temperature at 9 00 13 00 and 17 00 respectively reaction samples were kept in the dark when not exposed to sunlight 2 3 epr measurements the epr measurements were conducted on a bruker epr spectrometer x2 band a300 6 1 at room temperature 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was served as the probe molecule to capture radical species generated in the photoreaction the initial concentrations of lmwoa fe iii and dmpo were 1 0 mm 0 1 mm and 10 0 mm respectively the spectra of generated radicals derived from photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii were recorded by the reaction with dmpo using the following instrumental parameters microwave frequency 9 76 ghz modulation frequency 100 khz microwave power 20 mw modulation amplitude 1 0 g receiver gain 1 0 103 the irradiation system was composed of a cel s500 light source ceaulight beijing china equipped with a 500 w xenon lamp 2 4 nbt nitroblue tetrazolium chloride test and quenching experiments it has been well studied that nbt is an effective probe reagent for detection of superoxide radicals obregón et al 2016 bielski et al 1980 the o2 radical is able to reduce nbt into less soluble blue monoformazan which possesses strong absorbance at 540 nm bielski et al 1980 more experiment details are shown in text s2 considering the great potential of co2 radicals for reduction of nbt bielski et al 1980 the uv vis spectra were also collected from the above mentioned treatment groups with the addition of superoxide dismutase sod as o2 scavenger to support the generation of o2 robak and gryglewski 1988 in order to evaluate the contribution from different ros for degradation of pvc mp tert butanol tba sod and catalase cat were employed as quenching reagents for oh o2 and h2o2 respectively to observe any changes in the chloride release of pvc mp 2 5 the quantification of h2o2 generated during photo irradiation the amount of h2o2 generated during the photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii was determined spectrophotometrically using a peroxidase catalyzed oxidation of n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method reported by bader et al 1988 detailed information on the quantification of photo generated h2o2 is provided in text s3 2 6 in situ spectroscopic analysis for pvc mp photo aging process scheme s1 shows the schematic diagram of the in situ micro atr ftir system bruker hyperion 2000 ettlingen germany for each measurement a single pvc mp particle 150 μm was firstly immobilized by a 100 mesh stainless steel sieve and then placed in lmwoa or lmwoa fe iii solution for photo irradiation 500 w xenon light source cel s500 ceaulight beijing china once pvc mp was immobilized the specific single particle could be located based on the shape surroundings and coordinates on the stepper due to the effect of water on ftir signals the lmwoa solutions were removed and the immobilized pvc mp was rinsed with pure water for three times after air drying the specific single pvc mp particle was analyzed by ftir measurements the light intensity on the surface of immobilized pvc mp pellet was 75 mw cm 2 the infrared spectra ranging from 600 to 4000 cm 1 of the immobilized single pvc mp particle were collected after photo aging for a specific period and the structural changes of the analyzed pvc mp surface after 48 h radiation were recorded as fourier transform infrared imaging spectroscopy ft iris image by micro atr ftir the analyzed surface with an area of 100 75 μm for all samples referred to a grid of 10 points in x axis and 10 points in y axis and each point was corresponded to an ir spectrum for comparison the in situ ftir spectra and ft iris images were also obtained for control groups of pvc and pvc fe iii systems to trace the surface reaction on pvc mp in situ irradiation time resolved raman itr raman spectra were also determined using a jobin yvon spectrometer xplora plus horiba scientific equipped with a 514 nm laser and the in situ itr raman spectroscopic setup is shown in scheme s2 the labspec6 spectroscopy suite software was utilized for analysis of pvc mp bonding information an olympus bx41 microscope equipped with 10 olympus mplann and 50 olympus lmplanfl objectives was used to focus the laser beam on the immobilized single pvc mp particle and to collect the raman scattered light from the particle after predetermined time interval a 500 w xenon light cel s500 ceaulight beijing china was used to provide irradiation similar to the determination of in situ micro atr ftir spectra raman spectra in the range of 600 4000 cm 1 of immobilized single pvc mp particle were collected in the presence or absence of lmwoa lmwoa fe iii therefore local information micron scale on pvc mp surface could also be obtained from raman spectroscopy 2 7 surface characterization of pvc mp in order characterize the surface change of pvc mp before and after photo treatments under ambient conditions the scanning electron microscopy sem brunauer emmett teller bet analyzer and goniometer were employed to investigate the surface morphologies bet surface areas and contact angles for water θ w respectively experiment details are listed in text s4 2 8 theoretical calculation and statistical analysis gaussian 09w program frisch et al 2009 with density functional theory dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to investigate the geometrical and chemical properties of pvc at different aging stages such as bond length and electron density of frontier molecular orbitals i e the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo to simplify the calculation pvc of six monomers was utilized for gaussian simulation which has been reported by hamed mashhadzadeh et al 2017 the 6 31g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of c h o and cl the spss statistical package ver 16 0 spss company chicago usa was used to perform statistical analysis and one way anova followed by dunnett s test was conducted to assess significant differences p 0 05 2 9 adsorption of ciprofloxacin by pristine and photo aged pvc mp the pvc mp particles after photo aging were collected and rinsed with ultrapure water for at least three times prior to the adsorption of cip which was selected as the representative polar pollutant detailed information on the adsorption experiments is provided in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo transformation of pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa lmwoa fe iii under different oxic conditions as shown in fig 1 under simulated sunlight irradiation the pvc mp particle itself underwent direct photolysis and the photo induced degradation process was strongly size dependent the released cl concentrations after 96 h irradiation were 21 4 13 2 10 6 and 7 2 μm for 2 10 25 and 150 μm pvc mps respectively the highest cl release was observed for pvc mp with the smallest particle size 2 μm fig 1 which could be ascribed to the highest light utilization efficiency resulting from the greatest specific surface area interestingly the addition of oxalate and oxalate fe iii complex could significantly enhance the dechlorination reaction fig 1 for pvc mps with different sizes while bare fe iii exhibited slight inhibition on pvc mp dechlorination compared to the control sample e g for 2 μm pvc mp the released cl concentration increased from 21 4 to 24 0 and 31 6 μm after 96 h light exposure in the presence of oxalate and oxalate fe iii respectively for 10 25 and 150 μm pvc mp the respective dechlorination ratios increased by 30 0 55 1 and 36 9 when oxalate was added whereas 80 0 109 3 and 72 1 increases of dechlorination ratios were obtained in the presence of oxalate fe iii similarly the effects of citrate and citrate fe iii on pvc mp dechlorination were investigated and the enhanced cl release was also observed especially in the presence of citrate fe iii fig s1 the dechlorination kinetics of pvc mp upon photo irradiation followed zero order kinetics model and the fitted zero order dechlorination rate constants k obs are listed in table s1 consistent with the dechlorination ratio the greatest enhancement for cl release rate was also obtained for pvc oxalate fe iii system which is 1 43 1 71 1 85 and 1 80 times higher than those of 2 10 25 and 150 μm bare pvc mp respectively compared to oxalate fe iii citrate fe iii complex exhibited lower contribution to the photo induced dechlorination process abrahamson et al 1994 explored the quantum yields for photoreduction of various ferric carboxylate and reported that the quantum yield of oxalate fe iii was greater than that of citrate fe iii therefore the photolysis of ferric oxalate would produce more active substrates than ferric citrate as shown in fig s2 the amount of h2o2 increased as the photo irradiation prolonged and the final concentrations of h2o2 were 1 21 0 64 7 71 and 3 02 μm in the systems of oxalate citrate oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii respectively which was consistent with our dechlorination results figs 1 and s1 therefore the produced amount of h2o2 was positively correlated with the release of chloride ion as shown in fig s3 5 μm oxalate or citrate exhibited negligible effect on the dechlorination of pvc mp however noticeable increase in the dechlorination was observed for the group of pvc citrate fe iii while 2000 μm oxalic citric acids and their ferric complexes showed significant enhancement in the chloride release of pvc mp fig s4 however by comparison with the results of 100 μm lmwoa only slight increase in pvc mp dechlorination was observed when 20 times higher amounts of oxalic and citric acids were employed fig 1 s1 and s4 which could be attributed to the quenching of reactive species by excessive lmwoa for natural sunlight experiments average solar intensity and temperature were recorded in fig s5 as shown in figs s6 and s7 the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii could also accelerate the dechlorination process of pvc mp under natural conditions which is consistent with the results obtained by simulated sunlight treatments similar photo irradiation experiments were also conducted under anaerobic and oxygenated conditions as shown in the supporting information figs s8 s11 pvc mp dechlorination processes were significantly inhibited in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii when lacking of oxygen for instance the k obs values of pvc mp 2 μm dechlorination decreased from 21 88 10 2 to 9 11 10 2 and from 29 20 10 2 to 5 90 10 2 μm h 1 for pvc oxalate and pvc oxalate fe iii systems respectively tables s1 and s2 in contrast dramatic increases of released cl concentrations were observed after aerating oxygen for all photo irradiation groups in the presence of oxalate and citrate tables s1 and s3 therefore our results strongly suggest that oxygen or oxygen induced ros might be responsible for the photo dechlorination of pvc mp 3 2 determination of photo generated reactive species epr with dmpo as the probe molecule was utilized to monitor the reactive radicals involved in photolysis process of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii systems fig 2 shows the epr spectra of dmpo co2 and dmpo oh spin adducts generated under the irradiation of oxalate citrate and their ferric carboxylates in the presence of dmpo when oxalate solution was exposed to light as illustrated in fig 2a sextet characteristic peaks with a n 15 7 g and a β h 18 7 g and four line signals with a n a β h 15 0 g appeared and increased along with the illumination time which were referred to epr signals of co2 and oh respectively villamena et al 2006 janzen et al 1978 the formation of co2 and oh was also observed for oxalate fe iii system under irradiation and the corresponding signals of dmpo co2 and dmpo oh adducts were significantly enhanced compared to the photolysis of bare oxalate fig 2b which could be attributed to the accelerated electron transfer from oxalate ligand to the center ferric ion in oxalate fe iii complex mangiante et al 2017 briefly three oxalates can form a complex with ferric iron under light irradiation the intramolecular electron transfer from one ligand oxalate to fe iii undergoes within 1 ps to generate fe ii coordinated by two spectator and one oxalate radical which subsequently dissociates into a co2 molecule and a co2 within 40 ps mangiante et al 2017 different from the epr spectrum of sole oxalate solution more obvious changes were observed in oxalate fe iii system in addition as the irradiation prolonged the co2 signal weakened while the oh peaks were strengthened fig 2b which might be explained by the transformation from co2 to o2 and further converting to oh similar epr spectra were obtained for citrate and citrate fe iii systems fig 2c and d while the co2 and oh peaks of citrate and citrate fe iii were less intense than those of oxalate and oxalate fe iii respectively fig 2 it was reported that oxalate and ferric oxalate exhibited higher photolysis efficiency than citrate and citrate fe iii complex thus greater production of co2 and subsequent ros would be obtained for reaction solution containing oxalate abrahamson et al 1994 although o2 was not directly detected in the epr measurements fig 2 possibly due to its high instability in aqueous solution at room temperature the generation of superoxide radical was further confirmed via nbt test as shown in fig s12 the absorbance at 540 nm was observed and enhanced with the irradiation time for oxalate citrate oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii systems indicating that monoformazan was produced from the reduction of nbt bielski et al 1980 furthermore significant inhibition 65 of monoformazan production in the presence of sod provided convincing evidence for the formation of superoxide radicals fig s13 as sod was considered as the specific quenching reagent for o2 ge et al 2019 therefore we could conclude that o2 can be generated from photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii in the presence of o2 which is consistent with the results in prior study that o2 exhibits great potential to transform into o2 by reaction with oxalate radical or co2 zuo and hoigne 1992 the contribution from oh o2 and h2o2 to pvc mp transformation was further investigated by tba sod and cat quenching experiments respectively as shown in fig s14a the addition of tba completely inhibited the positive effects of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii on cl release of pvc mp since tba only suppresses the production of oh piechowski et al 1992 achola et al 2020 it suggests that oh plays an important role for the enhancement of pvc mp dechlorination and that neither o2 nor h2o2 exhibits significant effects on cl release similar results were also obtained when adding sod or cat confirming o2 and h2o2 are essential for the generation of hydroxyl radicals figs s14b and c as reported in previous literatures o2 could be firstly generated from o2 reacting with co2 and lmwoa radicals subsequently transforming into h2o2 via combination with protons and then h2o2 underwent photolysis to produce the strong oxidant oh chen et al 2018 hou et al 2016 as a result hydroxyl radical is the major ros that contributes to the enhanced cl release of pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii 3 3 in situ single particle spectroscopic analysis to further elucidate the underlying aging mechanism in situ single particle micro atr ftir technique was employed to investigate the effects of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii on the surface properties of pvc mp it was reported that the ir spectra of pvc mp would change along with the dechlorination process in which alkene and polyene structures were formed due to the cleavage of c cl bonds on pvc surface kise 1982 geddes 1967 similar results were also observed in our experiments for pristine pvc mp the peaks at 617 695 836 962 1254 1334 1428 and 2950 cm 1 corresponded to c cl stretching in pvc syndiotactic sequence c cl stretching in isotactic sequence ch2 rocking trans ch wagging ch rocking ch2 deformation ch deformation and c h stretching respectively fig 3 a quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 after photo aging three new absorption bands at 1600 1750 and 3300 cm 1 appeared fig 3 which were assigned to cc co and oh stretching vibrations respectively rajendran and uma 2001 the appearance of alkene carbonyl and hydroxyl groups indicated that dehydrochlorination and oxidation reactions occurred during the photo irradiation process gradual increase of cc peak intensity along with the irradiation time was observed in the in situ single particle micro atr ftir spectra for all photo irradiated pvc mp samples fig 3 however compared to the ir spectra of pvc and pvc fe iii fig 3a and b the presence of oxalate oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii significantly accelerated the generation of unsaturated alkenes fig 3c e f which was consistent with our dechlorination results figs 1d and s1d it demonstrates that oh is possibly involved in the cleavage of c cl bond moreover in situ ir spectra showed the occurrence of both ketone 1750 cm 1 and alcohol 3300 cm 1 groups for all pvc mps used in the present study fig 3 which could be attributed to o2 induced peroxidation reaction reported by decker and balandier 1981a the presence of lmwoa i e oxalate citrate and lmwoa fe iii i e oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii also exhibited great potential to enhance co absorbance whereas inhibitory effects on the production of hydroxyl group fig 3c e f in addition the surface changes of pvc mp pellets were further evidenced by the results of ft iris images as shown in fig 4 the signal intensities of cc and co were almost consistent with the dechlorination results following the order of pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc pvc fe iii however the signal intensity of oh group followed the opposite order pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc pvc fe iii the apparent contradictory might be attributed to the consumption of hydroxyl groups by photo generated oxidative oh radicals more specifically the oh group was converted into co group via the reaction with oh thus leading to stronger co absorbance but weaker oh signal compared to the control sample similar results have been reported that the alcohols could be oxidized into ketone or aldehyde groups upon the attack of hydroxyl radicals cederbaum and dicker 1983 cederbaum et al 1983 furthermore similar ftir is images were also obtained in natural solar irradiation systems with enhanced aging degree of pvc mp when lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii existed fig s15 which further confirmed the practical significance of lmwoa in natural aging process of pvc mp the occurrence of cc double bond was further confirmed by in situ single particle raman analysis as illustrated in fig s16 for pristine pvc the peaks at 635 697 1113 1436 and 2912 cm 1 were assigned to c cl stretching c c bending c h bending and c h stretching vibrations respectively prokhorov et al 2016 ellahi et al 1995 interestingly a new peak around 1510 cm 1 appeared upon the light irradiation in the presence of oxalate fe iii fig s16e which was referred to the conjugated cc stretching mode ellahi et al 1995 moreover the peak intensity increased and the position red shifted as the light irradiation prolonged indicating the extension for the length of conjugated polyene sequence fig s16e baruya et al 1983 similar results were also obtained in the raman spectra of pvc pvc fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate and pvc citrate fe iii systems figs s16a b c d f and the increase of cc peak intensity followed the similar order as micro atr ftir spectra pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc fe iii pvc therefore in situ raman spectra provide further evidences that the photo induced dechlorination of pvc mps assisted by lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii can promote the generation of polyene structures however in contrast to the results of ftir no co and oh vibration signals were detected in the raman spectra which could be explained by the low sensitivity of raman spectroscopy for the oxidation groups e g carbonyls and hydroxyls ołdak et al 2005 3 4 proposed aging pathways for pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa or lmwoa fe iii our results clearly demonstrate that the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii can enhance pvc mp dechlorination and oxidation processes via the photo generated oh and the photo induced aging pathways are proposed based on the previous studies and our theoretical calculations when exposed to simulated solar irradiation dehydrochlorination readily undergoes with the production of carbo cations r1 and r2 which are subsequently transformed into alkene p1 and polyene p2 structures in aged pvc polymers respectively fig 5 route i gardette and lemaire 1991 decker and balandier 1982 jian et al 1991 according to decker and balandier 1981b 1982 during the photolysis of pvc plastic under oxic condition the o2 induced peroxidation mechanism is also involved in the dehydrochlorination chain reaction as shown in fig 5 route ii a cyclic peroxide r3 is firstly generated via the addition of o2 into the conjugated double cc bond of p2 subsequently r3 decomposes and produces a new propagating radical r4 which could rearrange into alkoxy biradical r5 with the final products of α β unsaturated ketones and alcohols p3 decker and balandier 1981a the generation of oxygen containing functional groups i e co and oh on pvc mp surface is able to increase the hydrophilic property of pvc mp thus promoting the interaction with polar species in aqueous systems liu et al 2019b li et al 2018 real et al 2005 as mentioned above oh can be generated from the photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii and subsequent reaction with oxygen molecule our results further confirm that oh plays the dominant role in pvc mp dechlorination and oxidation processes in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii it is well known that isopropyl alcohol is commonly utilized to quench oh with acetone as the oxidation product cederbaum et al 1981 therefore alcohol group in aged pvc mps i e p3 might be attacked by oh and transformed into carbonyl group p4 in route iii fig 5 subsequently p4 can be further dechlorinated upon photo irradiation or oh oxidation producing a new carbocation r6 which undergoes either h subtraction or oh addition to form products p5 and p6 respectively in addition p6 can also be oxidized by oh to form a polyketone product p7 it was reported that oh could attach to the alkene group which was then converted into ketone kim et al 2017 moreover the presence of oxygen containing moieties on the pvc mp surface could significantly decrease the interface energy of pvc water as indicated by the results of contact angles fig s17 thus enhancing the contact possibility between oh and alkene group in aged polymer as a result p5 would undergo further oxidation by oh with the production of p8 fig 5 and the attack position could be deduced based on the results of homo and lumo orbitals of p5 fig s18 similar oh induced transformation could also apply to p7 the aging pathway via oh attack was further evidenced by theoretical calculations since routes i and ii have been well recognized in previous literatures decker and balandier 1981b 1982 jian et al 1991 we only calculated the bond lengths and electron densities of molecular orbitals for products and intermediates in route iii fig 5 as discussed above the photo generated co and oh groups can enhance the hydrophilicity of pvc mp particle p3 which provides more contact possibility and redox reaction potential between oh group on pvc mp and the ros generated from photolysis of lmwoa lmwoa fe iii as p3 is converted to p6 during the aging process more oxygen atoms are added into the pvc mp polymer skeleton and a greater distribution of homo electron on the newly generated hydroxyl group is obtained for p6 compared to oh in p3 fig s18 it indicates that these hydroxyl groups on the surface of photo aged pvc mp particles are more facile to be oxidized by the photo generated oh radicals furthermore our theoretical results also show that the maximum length of c cl bond adjacent to the unsaturated carbonyl and alkylene of p6 1 855 å is longer than that of p3 1 841 å fig s18 implying that these c cl groups would be more prone to oh attack therefore the results of homo electron distribution and c cl bond length provide more convincing evidence for oh induced dechlorination and oxidation reactions of pvc mp 3 5 surface characterization and adsorption of cip onto pvc mps in order to investigate the surface topography sem images were collected for the pvc mp samples before and after photo irradiation as shown in fig s19 the surface of pristine pvc mp appeared uniform and glossy however harsh and uneven surfaces were observed for the photo aged polymers especially for the images of pvc mp irradiated when lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii existed fig s19 in addition to surface morphology the specific surface areas were also influenced by the photo treatments as indicated by the bet results as listed in table s4 all the pvc mp samples that underwent aging processes exhibited increase in specific surface areas and more significant increase was observed in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii for instance the bet surface areas of 2 μm microplastics were 67 8 70 3 69 9 74 3 81 9 72 1 and 77 4 m2 g 1 for virgin pvc mp photo aged pvc mp and photo aged pvc mp in the presence of fe iii oxalate oxalate fe iii citrate and citrate fe iii respectively the greatest increase of 20 8 in specific surface area was obtained for pvc oxalate fe iii group fig s17 shows the digital image of water droplets on the pvc mp disks and the calculated θ w values the calculated θ w of pristine pvc mp was 145 8 while significant decreases of θ w values were observed after photo treatments following the order pvc fe iii 112 1 pvc 102 9 pvc citrate 99 7 pvc oxalate 69 2 pvc citrate fe iii 52 0 pvc oxalate fe iii 35 4 fig s17 the lowering θ w could be attributed to the increase of oxygen containing moieties on pvc mp surface resulting from photo aging process the increase of oxidation degree on pvc mp after photo aging in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii would improve the affinity towards water therefore the enhanced hydrophilicity of pvc mp could significantly influence the adsorption of polar contaminants as shown in fig s20 the adsorption of cip by both pristine and aged pvc mp followed langmuir isotherm model moreover the adsorption of cip was significantly enhanced after pvc mp was aged under simulated sunlight especially in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii as listed in table s5 the fitted maximum adsorption capacities q max of cip were 6 65 7 51 7 53 9 78 8 02 10 87 and 10 18 mg g 1 for pristine pvc aged pvc pvc fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii respectively table s5 the greatest enhancement in adsorption was observed for pvc oxalate fe iii with increase of 63 therefore in addition to the increased specific surface area the enhancement for cip adsorption could be ascribed to the hydrophilic effect and hydrogen bonding interaction due to the formation of carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups on pvc surfaces similar results were also reported that the hydrogen bonding between cip molecule and oxygen containing groups on aged pvc mp could increase the adsorption of the polar antibiotic compound liu et al 2019c it is well recognized that one of the potential hazards of mp is that mp can be ingested by wildlife baird and hooker 2000 since the ingested plastic debris can adsorb and concentrate pollutants it would increase the toxic exposure velzeboer et al 2014 therefore the photo irradiated pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa and lwmoa fe iii would increase the potential toxicity effect of polar contaminants once the pollutant adsorbed pvc mp is ingested by organisms 4 conclusion our results clearly demonstrated that the photo aging process of pvc mp varies as function of particle size and the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii could significantly accelerate the photo transformation of pvc mp in the aquatic environments by photo generated hydroxyl radicals under neutral ph and simulated or natural solar irradiation conditions since oxalate and citrate are common lmwoa salts which are widely distributed in natural environments in the concentrations ranging from several to dozens of mg l 1 albert and martens 1997 kawamura and kaplan 1984 this study would reveal a new degradation route for pvc mp under environmentally relevant conditions during the degradation process polyene structures were formed and then oxidized to ketone and alcohol by o2 and oh radical the photo oxidation induced by lmwoa led to the increase in the hydrophilicity and specific surface area of pvc mp as a result the physicochemical properties of pvc mp surfaces were significantly altered so that the adsorption of polar antibiotics was enhanced which might promote the exposure risk of pvc mp to aquatic organisms therefore the photo aging of pvc mp especially in the presence of lmwoa or lmwoa fe iii should be paid more attentions since this process would significantly impact the environmental behavior and toxicity of pvc mp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17742,in this study a new photo aging pathway in the aquatic environments and the underlying transformation mechanism were described for polyvinyl chloride microplastic pvc mp our results indicated that the photo aging of pvc mp was strongly dependent on particle size and the aging reaction could be facilitated in the presence of low molecular weight organic acid lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii complex under simulated and natural sunlight irradiation and ambient conditions the hydroxyl radical oh generated from the photolysis of lmwoa or its ferric complexes played a dominant role in enhancing pvc mp degradation in situ fourier transform infrared and raman spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations further confirmed that c cl bond cleavage and formation of polyene and carbonyl underwent on the pvc mp surface especially in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii moreover pvc mp surface oxidation also led to the increase of the specific surface area and affinity towards water as indicated by the results of scanning electron microscopy brunauer emmett teller tests and contact angles for water which would further enhance the adsorption of polar contaminants on pvc mp and thus increase the health risk of pvc mp on aquatic organisms graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyvinyl chloride microplastic low molecular weight organic acid reactive oxygen species dechlorination aging process 1 introduction recently microplastic mp size 5 mm has become a ubiquitous environmental problem and raised great concerns for environmental researchers and the public cole et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 huerta lwanga et al 2016 mp itself is divided into two categories primary and secondary mps the primary source refers to plastics that are manufactured in microscopic size such as abrasive scrubbers used in facial cleansers fendall and sewell 2009 while the secondary mps are generally derived from fragmentation of large plastics via photolytic mechanical thermal hydrolytic and biological degradation processes in the environments cole et al 2011 with the excellent chemical and physical properties polyvinyl chloride pvc plastics have been widely used in various industrial and domestic products since 2006 china has exceeded the usa in the capacity of pvc production becoming the largest pvc producer in the world research report on china s polyvinyl chloride pvc industry 2017 however most of the pvc plastics are littered without collection and the presence of macro and micro sized debris of pvc has been ubiquitously detected in various environmental matrices browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 it was reported that pvc was one of the most common mps found in sandy beaches browne et al 2010 and it could account for 25 of mps in estuaries browne et al 2010 thompson et al 2004 green et al 2016 according to a recent study the abundance of pvc mp with size 0 5 mm could reach 400 pellets m 3 in the pearl river of china yan et al 2019 due to the greater density of pvc 1 20 1 45 g cm 3 compared to freshwater and seawater the amount of pvc mp existing in natural waters was often underestimated claessens et al 2013 nuelle et al 2014 moreover based on the toxicity assessments of pvc mp after ingestion pvc mp could cause suppressed feeding activity intestinal damage and increase of lethality for lugworm arenicola marina zebrafish danio rerio and nematode caenorhabditis elegans respectively green et al 2016 lei et al 2018 in addition due to the presence of chlorine atoms in the polymer skeleton pvc mp could exhibit greater toxicity than polyethylene to lugworms green et al 2016 however even the environmental distribution and toxicity of pvc mp have been extensively investigated only limited information is available for the environmental transformation of pvc mp in various circumstances it has been reported that sunlight irradiation is a major pathway for the generation of mp particles song et al 2017 moreover photo transformation could enhance the mobility and adsorption capacities of mps for common environmental pollutants e g pyrene and ciprofloxacin cip which might be resulted from the increased surface area and hydrophilicity liu et al 2019a 2019b while the natural photo aging of mps is generally considered as a slow process especially in aquatic environments zhu et al 2020 recent studies have confirmed that the reactive oxygen species ros such as singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radical anion o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh exhibited great potentials to accelerate the aging process of mps in the aquatic system liu et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to investigate the photo transformation of pvc mp in the presence of active substances that are able to generate ros under solar irradiation low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas e g oxalic and citric acids are widely distributed in the environment albert and martens 1997 cieśliński et al 1998 strobel 2001 these lmwoas are major components of plant root exudates and can be leached into river in the forms of free acids or metal complexes jones 1998 upon solar or ultraviolet irradiation lmwoas can undergo decomposition with the formation of highly reductive species i e carbon dioxide radical anion co2 e co2 co2 1 9 v wardman 1989 tachikawa et al 2004 it has been further reported that when lmwoas form complexes with metal ions e g fe iii the generation of co2 during photolysis becomes more facile especially for oxalate abrahamson et al 1994 in addition under ambient condition co2 could react with oxygen molecules further generating ros such as o2 and oh mangiante et al 2017 for microscopic pvc particles once released into the environment they might have great potential to interact with lmwoas and undergo redox reactions which could significantly affect their environmental fate however so far to the best of our knowledge there is no report for the interactions between pvc mp and the reactive species derived from photolysis of lmwoas the objective of this study was to gain more insights into the environmental behaviors of pvc mp in the presence of lmwoas under environmentally relevant conditions oxalic and citric acids were used as the model lmwoas the effects of mp particle size and the presence of fe iii in the reaction system were systematically investigated the degradation mechanism and surface characterization of pvc mp under simulated sunlight irradiation were studied by electron paramagnetic resonance epr in situ microscope of attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in situ micro atr ftir and in situ raman spectroscopy the changes of pvc mp surface properties were further evaluated by the adsorption of a representative polar compound i e ciprofloxacin the results obtained from this research would reveal a new degradation pathway for pvc mp and provide valuable information to assess the potential environmental transformation of pvc mp in natural aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals details of chemicals are provided in text s1 2 2 pvc mp photo transformation in the presence of lmwoas under different oxic conditions the photo reaction experiments were conducted in aqueous solution 40 ml containing 100 mg l 1 pvc mp and 100 μm lmwoa i e oxalate and citrate pvc mp particles with different sizes of 2 10 25 and 150 μm were used in the experiments the solution ph was controlled at 7 0 0 2 with 1 0 mm phosphate buffer the photochemical reaction was performed in a merry go round xpa 7 model reactor xujiang electromechanical inc nanjing china in which a 500 w xenon lamp institute of electric light source beijing was used as the light source to simulate sunlight irradiation the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 c using a cylindrical quartz cold trap and a recycled cooling water system the light intensity on the surface of the quartz reaction tube was measured as 40 mw cm 2 by a cel np2000 10 radiometer ceaulight inc beijing china a magnetic stir bar was placed in each tube to ensure that pvc mp was fully suspended at predetermined time interval during the course of reaction samples were sacrificed and the released cl concentrations during the photoreaction were measured by an ion chromatography ics900 dionex co usa equipped with a conductivity detector and an as23 anionic column a mixture of 3 5 mm na2co3 and 1 0 mm nahco3 was served as the eluent and the flow rate was set as 1 0 ml min 1 similar experiments were also conducted in the presence of both lmwoa and fe iii mixture solution of 100 μm lmwoa and 10 μm fe iii i e oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii to investigate the effect of lmwoa fe iii complex on the photo aging of pvc mp in addition photo degradation of control groups i e pvc mp only and pvc mp in the presence of fe iii was also studied for comparison the effect of lmwoa dosage on the transformation of pvc mp was also investigated by adding 5 and 2000 μm oxalic citric acids to obtain insights into the effect of dissolved oxygen the decomposition kinetics experiments were further studied under anaerobic and oxygenated conditions by purging n2 99 5 and o2 99 99 respectively all the experiments were conducted in triplicates similar experiments were also performed under natural solar irradiation from may 1 to may 28 2020 the sample was rotated with a 30 slope on the building roof of the school of the environment nanjing university china 32 7 n 118 57 e the cel np2000 10 radiometer ceaulight inc beijing china and thermometer was used to record the light intensity and temperature at 9 00 13 00 and 17 00 respectively reaction samples were kept in the dark when not exposed to sunlight 2 3 epr measurements the epr measurements were conducted on a bruker epr spectrometer x2 band a300 6 1 at room temperature 5 5 dimethy 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was served as the probe molecule to capture radical species generated in the photoreaction the initial concentrations of lmwoa fe iii and dmpo were 1 0 mm 0 1 mm and 10 0 mm respectively the spectra of generated radicals derived from photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii were recorded by the reaction with dmpo using the following instrumental parameters microwave frequency 9 76 ghz modulation frequency 100 khz microwave power 20 mw modulation amplitude 1 0 g receiver gain 1 0 103 the irradiation system was composed of a cel s500 light source ceaulight beijing china equipped with a 500 w xenon lamp 2 4 nbt nitroblue tetrazolium chloride test and quenching experiments it has been well studied that nbt is an effective probe reagent for detection of superoxide radicals obregón et al 2016 bielski et al 1980 the o2 radical is able to reduce nbt into less soluble blue monoformazan which possesses strong absorbance at 540 nm bielski et al 1980 more experiment details are shown in text s2 considering the great potential of co2 radicals for reduction of nbt bielski et al 1980 the uv vis spectra were also collected from the above mentioned treatment groups with the addition of superoxide dismutase sod as o2 scavenger to support the generation of o2 robak and gryglewski 1988 in order to evaluate the contribution from different ros for degradation of pvc mp tert butanol tba sod and catalase cat were employed as quenching reagents for oh o2 and h2o2 respectively to observe any changes in the chloride release of pvc mp 2 5 the quantification of h2o2 generated during photo irradiation the amount of h2o2 generated during the photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii was determined spectrophotometrically using a peroxidase catalyzed oxidation of n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method reported by bader et al 1988 detailed information on the quantification of photo generated h2o2 is provided in text s3 2 6 in situ spectroscopic analysis for pvc mp photo aging process scheme s1 shows the schematic diagram of the in situ micro atr ftir system bruker hyperion 2000 ettlingen germany for each measurement a single pvc mp particle 150 μm was firstly immobilized by a 100 mesh stainless steel sieve and then placed in lmwoa or lmwoa fe iii solution for photo irradiation 500 w xenon light source cel s500 ceaulight beijing china once pvc mp was immobilized the specific single particle could be located based on the shape surroundings and coordinates on the stepper due to the effect of water on ftir signals the lmwoa solutions were removed and the immobilized pvc mp was rinsed with pure water for three times after air drying the specific single pvc mp particle was analyzed by ftir measurements the light intensity on the surface of immobilized pvc mp pellet was 75 mw cm 2 the infrared spectra ranging from 600 to 4000 cm 1 of the immobilized single pvc mp particle were collected after photo aging for a specific period and the structural changes of the analyzed pvc mp surface after 48 h radiation were recorded as fourier transform infrared imaging spectroscopy ft iris image by micro atr ftir the analyzed surface with an area of 100 75 μm for all samples referred to a grid of 10 points in x axis and 10 points in y axis and each point was corresponded to an ir spectrum for comparison the in situ ftir spectra and ft iris images were also obtained for control groups of pvc and pvc fe iii systems to trace the surface reaction on pvc mp in situ irradiation time resolved raman itr raman spectra were also determined using a jobin yvon spectrometer xplora plus horiba scientific equipped with a 514 nm laser and the in situ itr raman spectroscopic setup is shown in scheme s2 the labspec6 spectroscopy suite software was utilized for analysis of pvc mp bonding information an olympus bx41 microscope equipped with 10 olympus mplann and 50 olympus lmplanfl objectives was used to focus the laser beam on the immobilized single pvc mp particle and to collect the raman scattered light from the particle after predetermined time interval a 500 w xenon light cel s500 ceaulight beijing china was used to provide irradiation similar to the determination of in situ micro atr ftir spectra raman spectra in the range of 600 4000 cm 1 of immobilized single pvc mp particle were collected in the presence or absence of lmwoa lmwoa fe iii therefore local information micron scale on pvc mp surface could also be obtained from raman spectroscopy 2 7 surface characterization of pvc mp in order characterize the surface change of pvc mp before and after photo treatments under ambient conditions the scanning electron microscopy sem brunauer emmett teller bet analyzer and goniometer were employed to investigate the surface morphologies bet surface areas and contact angles for water θ w respectively experiment details are listed in text s4 2 8 theoretical calculation and statistical analysis gaussian 09w program frisch et al 2009 with density functional theory dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to investigate the geometrical and chemical properties of pvc at different aging stages such as bond length and electron density of frontier molecular orbitals i e the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo to simplify the calculation pvc of six monomers was utilized for gaussian simulation which has been reported by hamed mashhadzadeh et al 2017 the 6 31g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of c h o and cl the spss statistical package ver 16 0 spss company chicago usa was used to perform statistical analysis and one way anova followed by dunnett s test was conducted to assess significant differences p 0 05 2 9 adsorption of ciprofloxacin by pristine and photo aged pvc mp the pvc mp particles after photo aging were collected and rinsed with ultrapure water for at least three times prior to the adsorption of cip which was selected as the representative polar pollutant detailed information on the adsorption experiments is provided in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo transformation of pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa lmwoa fe iii under different oxic conditions as shown in fig 1 under simulated sunlight irradiation the pvc mp particle itself underwent direct photolysis and the photo induced degradation process was strongly size dependent the released cl concentrations after 96 h irradiation were 21 4 13 2 10 6 and 7 2 μm for 2 10 25 and 150 μm pvc mps respectively the highest cl release was observed for pvc mp with the smallest particle size 2 μm fig 1 which could be ascribed to the highest light utilization efficiency resulting from the greatest specific surface area interestingly the addition of oxalate and oxalate fe iii complex could significantly enhance the dechlorination reaction fig 1 for pvc mps with different sizes while bare fe iii exhibited slight inhibition on pvc mp dechlorination compared to the control sample e g for 2 μm pvc mp the released cl concentration increased from 21 4 to 24 0 and 31 6 μm after 96 h light exposure in the presence of oxalate and oxalate fe iii respectively for 10 25 and 150 μm pvc mp the respective dechlorination ratios increased by 30 0 55 1 and 36 9 when oxalate was added whereas 80 0 109 3 and 72 1 increases of dechlorination ratios were obtained in the presence of oxalate fe iii similarly the effects of citrate and citrate fe iii on pvc mp dechlorination were investigated and the enhanced cl release was also observed especially in the presence of citrate fe iii fig s1 the dechlorination kinetics of pvc mp upon photo irradiation followed zero order kinetics model and the fitted zero order dechlorination rate constants k obs are listed in table s1 consistent with the dechlorination ratio the greatest enhancement for cl release rate was also obtained for pvc oxalate fe iii system which is 1 43 1 71 1 85 and 1 80 times higher than those of 2 10 25 and 150 μm bare pvc mp respectively compared to oxalate fe iii citrate fe iii complex exhibited lower contribution to the photo induced dechlorination process abrahamson et al 1994 explored the quantum yields for photoreduction of various ferric carboxylate and reported that the quantum yield of oxalate fe iii was greater than that of citrate fe iii therefore the photolysis of ferric oxalate would produce more active substrates than ferric citrate as shown in fig s2 the amount of h2o2 increased as the photo irradiation prolonged and the final concentrations of h2o2 were 1 21 0 64 7 71 and 3 02 μm in the systems of oxalate citrate oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii respectively which was consistent with our dechlorination results figs 1 and s1 therefore the produced amount of h2o2 was positively correlated with the release of chloride ion as shown in fig s3 5 μm oxalate or citrate exhibited negligible effect on the dechlorination of pvc mp however noticeable increase in the dechlorination was observed for the group of pvc citrate fe iii while 2000 μm oxalic citric acids and their ferric complexes showed significant enhancement in the chloride release of pvc mp fig s4 however by comparison with the results of 100 μm lmwoa only slight increase in pvc mp dechlorination was observed when 20 times higher amounts of oxalic and citric acids were employed fig 1 s1 and s4 which could be attributed to the quenching of reactive species by excessive lmwoa for natural sunlight experiments average solar intensity and temperature were recorded in fig s5 as shown in figs s6 and s7 the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii could also accelerate the dechlorination process of pvc mp under natural conditions which is consistent with the results obtained by simulated sunlight treatments similar photo irradiation experiments were also conducted under anaerobic and oxygenated conditions as shown in the supporting information figs s8 s11 pvc mp dechlorination processes were significantly inhibited in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii when lacking of oxygen for instance the k obs values of pvc mp 2 μm dechlorination decreased from 21 88 10 2 to 9 11 10 2 and from 29 20 10 2 to 5 90 10 2 μm h 1 for pvc oxalate and pvc oxalate fe iii systems respectively tables s1 and s2 in contrast dramatic increases of released cl concentrations were observed after aerating oxygen for all photo irradiation groups in the presence of oxalate and citrate tables s1 and s3 therefore our results strongly suggest that oxygen or oxygen induced ros might be responsible for the photo dechlorination of pvc mp 3 2 determination of photo generated reactive species epr with dmpo as the probe molecule was utilized to monitor the reactive radicals involved in photolysis process of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii systems fig 2 shows the epr spectra of dmpo co2 and dmpo oh spin adducts generated under the irradiation of oxalate citrate and their ferric carboxylates in the presence of dmpo when oxalate solution was exposed to light as illustrated in fig 2a sextet characteristic peaks with a n 15 7 g and a β h 18 7 g and four line signals with a n a β h 15 0 g appeared and increased along with the illumination time which were referred to epr signals of co2 and oh respectively villamena et al 2006 janzen et al 1978 the formation of co2 and oh was also observed for oxalate fe iii system under irradiation and the corresponding signals of dmpo co2 and dmpo oh adducts were significantly enhanced compared to the photolysis of bare oxalate fig 2b which could be attributed to the accelerated electron transfer from oxalate ligand to the center ferric ion in oxalate fe iii complex mangiante et al 2017 briefly three oxalates can form a complex with ferric iron under light irradiation the intramolecular electron transfer from one ligand oxalate to fe iii undergoes within 1 ps to generate fe ii coordinated by two spectator and one oxalate radical which subsequently dissociates into a co2 molecule and a co2 within 40 ps mangiante et al 2017 different from the epr spectrum of sole oxalate solution more obvious changes were observed in oxalate fe iii system in addition as the irradiation prolonged the co2 signal weakened while the oh peaks were strengthened fig 2b which might be explained by the transformation from co2 to o2 and further converting to oh similar epr spectra were obtained for citrate and citrate fe iii systems fig 2c and d while the co2 and oh peaks of citrate and citrate fe iii were less intense than those of oxalate and oxalate fe iii respectively fig 2 it was reported that oxalate and ferric oxalate exhibited higher photolysis efficiency than citrate and citrate fe iii complex thus greater production of co2 and subsequent ros would be obtained for reaction solution containing oxalate abrahamson et al 1994 although o2 was not directly detected in the epr measurements fig 2 possibly due to its high instability in aqueous solution at room temperature the generation of superoxide radical was further confirmed via nbt test as shown in fig s12 the absorbance at 540 nm was observed and enhanced with the irradiation time for oxalate citrate oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii systems indicating that monoformazan was produced from the reduction of nbt bielski et al 1980 furthermore significant inhibition 65 of monoformazan production in the presence of sod provided convincing evidence for the formation of superoxide radicals fig s13 as sod was considered as the specific quenching reagent for o2 ge et al 2019 therefore we could conclude that o2 can be generated from photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii in the presence of o2 which is consistent with the results in prior study that o2 exhibits great potential to transform into o2 by reaction with oxalate radical or co2 zuo and hoigne 1992 the contribution from oh o2 and h2o2 to pvc mp transformation was further investigated by tba sod and cat quenching experiments respectively as shown in fig s14a the addition of tba completely inhibited the positive effects of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii on cl release of pvc mp since tba only suppresses the production of oh piechowski et al 1992 achola et al 2020 it suggests that oh plays an important role for the enhancement of pvc mp dechlorination and that neither o2 nor h2o2 exhibits significant effects on cl release similar results were also obtained when adding sod or cat confirming o2 and h2o2 are essential for the generation of hydroxyl radicals figs s14b and c as reported in previous literatures o2 could be firstly generated from o2 reacting with co2 and lmwoa radicals subsequently transforming into h2o2 via combination with protons and then h2o2 underwent photolysis to produce the strong oxidant oh chen et al 2018 hou et al 2016 as a result hydroxyl radical is the major ros that contributes to the enhanced cl release of pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii 3 3 in situ single particle spectroscopic analysis to further elucidate the underlying aging mechanism in situ single particle micro atr ftir technique was employed to investigate the effects of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii on the surface properties of pvc mp it was reported that the ir spectra of pvc mp would change along with the dechlorination process in which alkene and polyene structures were formed due to the cleavage of c cl bonds on pvc surface kise 1982 geddes 1967 similar results were also observed in our experiments for pristine pvc mp the peaks at 617 695 836 962 1254 1334 1428 and 2950 cm 1 corresponded to c cl stretching in pvc syndiotactic sequence c cl stretching in isotactic sequence ch2 rocking trans ch wagging ch rocking ch2 deformation ch deformation and c h stretching respectively fig 3 a quenum et al 1975 ramesh et al 2007 after photo aging three new absorption bands at 1600 1750 and 3300 cm 1 appeared fig 3 which were assigned to cc co and oh stretching vibrations respectively rajendran and uma 2001 the appearance of alkene carbonyl and hydroxyl groups indicated that dehydrochlorination and oxidation reactions occurred during the photo irradiation process gradual increase of cc peak intensity along with the irradiation time was observed in the in situ single particle micro atr ftir spectra for all photo irradiated pvc mp samples fig 3 however compared to the ir spectra of pvc and pvc fe iii fig 3a and b the presence of oxalate oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii significantly accelerated the generation of unsaturated alkenes fig 3c e f which was consistent with our dechlorination results figs 1d and s1d it demonstrates that oh is possibly involved in the cleavage of c cl bond moreover in situ ir spectra showed the occurrence of both ketone 1750 cm 1 and alcohol 3300 cm 1 groups for all pvc mps used in the present study fig 3 which could be attributed to o2 induced peroxidation reaction reported by decker and balandier 1981a the presence of lmwoa i e oxalate citrate and lmwoa fe iii i e oxalate fe iii and citrate fe iii also exhibited great potential to enhance co absorbance whereas inhibitory effects on the production of hydroxyl group fig 3c e f in addition the surface changes of pvc mp pellets were further evidenced by the results of ft iris images as shown in fig 4 the signal intensities of cc and co were almost consistent with the dechlorination results following the order of pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc pvc fe iii however the signal intensity of oh group followed the opposite order pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc pvc fe iii the apparent contradictory might be attributed to the consumption of hydroxyl groups by photo generated oxidative oh radicals more specifically the oh group was converted into co group via the reaction with oh thus leading to stronger co absorbance but weaker oh signal compared to the control sample similar results have been reported that the alcohols could be oxidized into ketone or aldehyde groups upon the attack of hydroxyl radicals cederbaum and dicker 1983 cederbaum et al 1983 furthermore similar ftir is images were also obtained in natural solar irradiation systems with enhanced aging degree of pvc mp when lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii existed fig s15 which further confirmed the practical significance of lmwoa in natural aging process of pvc mp the occurrence of cc double bond was further confirmed by in situ single particle raman analysis as illustrated in fig s16 for pristine pvc the peaks at 635 697 1113 1436 and 2912 cm 1 were assigned to c cl stretching c c bending c h bending and c h stretching vibrations respectively prokhorov et al 2016 ellahi et al 1995 interestingly a new peak around 1510 cm 1 appeared upon the light irradiation in the presence of oxalate fe iii fig s16e which was referred to the conjugated cc stretching mode ellahi et al 1995 moreover the peak intensity increased and the position red shifted as the light irradiation prolonged indicating the extension for the length of conjugated polyene sequence fig s16e baruya et al 1983 similar results were also obtained in the raman spectra of pvc pvc fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate and pvc citrate fe iii systems figs s16a b c d f and the increase of cc peak intensity followed the similar order as micro atr ftir spectra pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc fe iii pvc therefore in situ raman spectra provide further evidences that the photo induced dechlorination of pvc mps assisted by lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii can promote the generation of polyene structures however in contrast to the results of ftir no co and oh vibration signals were detected in the raman spectra which could be explained by the low sensitivity of raman spectroscopy for the oxidation groups e g carbonyls and hydroxyls ołdak et al 2005 3 4 proposed aging pathways for pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa or lmwoa fe iii our results clearly demonstrate that the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii can enhance pvc mp dechlorination and oxidation processes via the photo generated oh and the photo induced aging pathways are proposed based on the previous studies and our theoretical calculations when exposed to simulated solar irradiation dehydrochlorination readily undergoes with the production of carbo cations r1 and r2 which are subsequently transformed into alkene p1 and polyene p2 structures in aged pvc polymers respectively fig 5 route i gardette and lemaire 1991 decker and balandier 1982 jian et al 1991 according to decker and balandier 1981b 1982 during the photolysis of pvc plastic under oxic condition the o2 induced peroxidation mechanism is also involved in the dehydrochlorination chain reaction as shown in fig 5 route ii a cyclic peroxide r3 is firstly generated via the addition of o2 into the conjugated double cc bond of p2 subsequently r3 decomposes and produces a new propagating radical r4 which could rearrange into alkoxy biradical r5 with the final products of α β unsaturated ketones and alcohols p3 decker and balandier 1981a the generation of oxygen containing functional groups i e co and oh on pvc mp surface is able to increase the hydrophilic property of pvc mp thus promoting the interaction with polar species in aqueous systems liu et al 2019b li et al 2018 real et al 2005 as mentioned above oh can be generated from the photolysis of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii and subsequent reaction with oxygen molecule our results further confirm that oh plays the dominant role in pvc mp dechlorination and oxidation processes in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii it is well known that isopropyl alcohol is commonly utilized to quench oh with acetone as the oxidation product cederbaum et al 1981 therefore alcohol group in aged pvc mps i e p3 might be attacked by oh and transformed into carbonyl group p4 in route iii fig 5 subsequently p4 can be further dechlorinated upon photo irradiation or oh oxidation producing a new carbocation r6 which undergoes either h subtraction or oh addition to form products p5 and p6 respectively in addition p6 can also be oxidized by oh to form a polyketone product p7 it was reported that oh could attach to the alkene group which was then converted into ketone kim et al 2017 moreover the presence of oxygen containing moieties on the pvc mp surface could significantly decrease the interface energy of pvc water as indicated by the results of contact angles fig s17 thus enhancing the contact possibility between oh and alkene group in aged polymer as a result p5 would undergo further oxidation by oh with the production of p8 fig 5 and the attack position could be deduced based on the results of homo and lumo orbitals of p5 fig s18 similar oh induced transformation could also apply to p7 the aging pathway via oh attack was further evidenced by theoretical calculations since routes i and ii have been well recognized in previous literatures decker and balandier 1981b 1982 jian et al 1991 we only calculated the bond lengths and electron densities of molecular orbitals for products and intermediates in route iii fig 5 as discussed above the photo generated co and oh groups can enhance the hydrophilicity of pvc mp particle p3 which provides more contact possibility and redox reaction potential between oh group on pvc mp and the ros generated from photolysis of lmwoa lmwoa fe iii as p3 is converted to p6 during the aging process more oxygen atoms are added into the pvc mp polymer skeleton and a greater distribution of homo electron on the newly generated hydroxyl group is obtained for p6 compared to oh in p3 fig s18 it indicates that these hydroxyl groups on the surface of photo aged pvc mp particles are more facile to be oxidized by the photo generated oh radicals furthermore our theoretical results also show that the maximum length of c cl bond adjacent to the unsaturated carbonyl and alkylene of p6 1 855 å is longer than that of p3 1 841 å fig s18 implying that these c cl groups would be more prone to oh attack therefore the results of homo electron distribution and c cl bond length provide more convincing evidence for oh induced dechlorination and oxidation reactions of pvc mp 3 5 surface characterization and adsorption of cip onto pvc mps in order to investigate the surface topography sem images were collected for the pvc mp samples before and after photo irradiation as shown in fig s19 the surface of pristine pvc mp appeared uniform and glossy however harsh and uneven surfaces were observed for the photo aged polymers especially for the images of pvc mp irradiated when lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii existed fig s19 in addition to surface morphology the specific surface areas were also influenced by the photo treatments as indicated by the bet results as listed in table s4 all the pvc mp samples that underwent aging processes exhibited increase in specific surface areas and more significant increase was observed in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii for instance the bet surface areas of 2 μm microplastics were 67 8 70 3 69 9 74 3 81 9 72 1 and 77 4 m2 g 1 for virgin pvc mp photo aged pvc mp and photo aged pvc mp in the presence of fe iii oxalate oxalate fe iii citrate and citrate fe iii respectively the greatest increase of 20 8 in specific surface area was obtained for pvc oxalate fe iii group fig s17 shows the digital image of water droplets on the pvc mp disks and the calculated θ w values the calculated θ w of pristine pvc mp was 145 8 while significant decreases of θ w values were observed after photo treatments following the order pvc fe iii 112 1 pvc 102 9 pvc citrate 99 7 pvc oxalate 69 2 pvc citrate fe iii 52 0 pvc oxalate fe iii 35 4 fig s17 the lowering θ w could be attributed to the increase of oxygen containing moieties on pvc mp surface resulting from photo aging process the increase of oxidation degree on pvc mp after photo aging in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii would improve the affinity towards water therefore the enhanced hydrophilicity of pvc mp could significantly influence the adsorption of polar contaminants as shown in fig s20 the adsorption of cip by both pristine and aged pvc mp followed langmuir isotherm model moreover the adsorption of cip was significantly enhanced after pvc mp was aged under simulated sunlight especially in the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii as listed in table s5 the fitted maximum adsorption capacities q max of cip were 6 65 7 51 7 53 9 78 8 02 10 87 and 10 18 mg g 1 for pristine pvc aged pvc pvc fe iii pvc oxalate pvc citrate pvc oxalate fe iii pvc citrate fe iii respectively table s5 the greatest enhancement in adsorption was observed for pvc oxalate fe iii with increase of 63 therefore in addition to the increased specific surface area the enhancement for cip adsorption could be ascribed to the hydrophilic effect and hydrogen bonding interaction due to the formation of carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups on pvc surfaces similar results were also reported that the hydrogen bonding between cip molecule and oxygen containing groups on aged pvc mp could increase the adsorption of the polar antibiotic compound liu et al 2019c it is well recognized that one of the potential hazards of mp is that mp can be ingested by wildlife baird and hooker 2000 since the ingested plastic debris can adsorb and concentrate pollutants it would increase the toxic exposure velzeboer et al 2014 therefore the photo irradiated pvc mp in the presence of lmwoa and lwmoa fe iii would increase the potential toxicity effect of polar contaminants once the pollutant adsorbed pvc mp is ingested by organisms 4 conclusion our results clearly demonstrated that the photo aging process of pvc mp varies as function of particle size and the presence of lmwoa and lmwoa fe iii could significantly accelerate the photo transformation of pvc mp in the aquatic environments by photo generated hydroxyl radicals under neutral ph and simulated or natural solar irradiation conditions since oxalate and citrate are common lmwoa salts which are widely distributed in natural environments in the concentrations ranging from several to dozens of mg l 1 albert and martens 1997 kawamura and kaplan 1984 this study would reveal a new degradation route for pvc mp under environmentally relevant conditions during the degradation process polyene structures were formed and then oxidized to ketone and alcohol by o2 and oh radical the photo oxidation induced by lmwoa led to the increase in the hydrophilicity and specific surface area of pvc mp as a result the physicochemical properties of pvc mp surfaces were significantly altered so that the adsorption of polar antibiotics was enhanced which might promote the exposure risk of pvc mp to aquatic organisms therefore the photo aging of pvc mp especially in the presence of lmwoa or lmwoa fe iii should be paid more attentions since this process would significantly impact the environmental behavior and toxicity of pvc mp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17743,recapture and recycling of irrigation water is often required to meet enormous water demands at horticultural nurseries we tested four water types associated with a recycled irrigation system at a commercial container nursery in southern california for presence of oomycete plant pathogens from july 2015 to december 2017 these water types included the main source of water originating from a reservoir retention water from an on site collection pond irrigation water received by different growing areas within the nursery and irrigation runoff captured in polyethylene sheet lined runoff channels the genera phytophthora pythium and phytopythium together contributed more than 85 of the total oomycete population detected in the recycled irrigation system the phytophthora and pythium genera were represented by member species from nine 1 4 6 10 and eight a b d f h j different sub generic clades respectively incoming water sourced from the reservoir was found to harbor known plant pathogens such as phytophthora citricola complex p capsici cluster p tropicalis p citrophthora cluster p nemorosa cluster p riparia p cryptogea complex p parsiana cluster p sp nov aff kernoviae pythium dissotocum complex py oligandrum cluster py irregulare and phytopythium litorale runoff water showed the highest oomycete species richness and frequency of detection with both filtration and leaf baiting methods in addition to plant pathogens oomycete fish pathogens such as aphanomyces laevis pythium chondricola complex pythium flevoense complex and saprolegnia diclina complex were also detected in greater abundance in the recycled irrigation water the oomycete species richness in the runoff water was correlated with several environmental parameters such as soil temperature greater oomycete richness in incoming water was associated with higher soil temperatures whereas richness in runoff declines with increasing soil temperature likely suggesting connections to weather dependent nursery operations keywords metabarcoding phytophthora pythium reclaimed water lake mathews reservoir weather impacts 1 introduction water is an expensive limited resource with massive demand a single commercial nursery consumed almost 400 million gallons 1 5 million m3 of water annually in 2015 2016 which approximately equals 2 5 million gallons 25 000 m3 ha 1 of water per acre of growing space pitton et al 2018 water scarcity restrictions imposed on harvesting water from surface and underground sources challenges associated with rain or storm water collection or the high retail cost of municipal water often limit growers from solely depending on these resources to meet their irrigation demand water recycling is a sustainable solution to minimize the water usage and costs associated with procuring water from natural sources while fulfilling water demand at commercial nurseries particularly those located in drought prone areas majsztrik et al 2017 pitton et al 2018 white 2019 recycling of water at a nursery involves capturing surplus water from several over irrigated plant growing areas into systematically connected water channels through which runoff water flows into a collection pond this runoff is then reused for irrigation which may improve sustainability and decrease cost by reducing consumption of high quality water pitton et al 2018 the cost savings can be significant if the high quality irrigation source water is expensive pitton et al 2018 use of runoff water for irrigation can decrease fertilizer application and associated costs as this water has increased concentrations of nutrients that leached from previous irrigation events devincentis et al 2015 the runoff water is also a hazard to nursery plant production since it may accumulate waterborne plant pathogens that could increase the disease risk and cause economic loss due to reduced plant quality contaminated runoff water from nursery plant production predominantly harbors oomycete plant pathogens along with several fungal bacterial viral and parasitic nematode pathogens hong and moorman 2005 this paper will only focus on oomycetes associated with recycled irrigation water oomycetes commonly known as water molds are a group of mostly fungus like eukaryotic microorganisms that can cause diseases in plants fungi humans and other animals fawke et al 2015 kamoun 2003 species of phytophthora pythium and phytopythium are associated with crown and root rot wilt shoot cankers shoot dieback damping off diseases and foliar blight of several horticultural crops ornamentals fruits and vegetables pscheidt and ocamb 2019 and are commonly found in nursery irrigation water hong and moorman 2005 macdonald et al 1994 in warm moist conditions these plant pathogens usually infect hosts by producing motile zoospores asexual spores that are capable of swimming towards and colonizing the host in dry conditions resting spores chlamydospores or oospores may be produced that may remain dormant in soil for a long time and or be dispersed long distances especially through human movement of soil or plants kamoun 2003 larousse and galiana 2017 under favorable conditions soil chlamydospores and oospores germinate to produce mycelium sporangia and zoospores to start the infection cycle kamoun 2003 therefore soil from plant growing areas within the nurseries can be heavily infested with these pathogens junker et al 2016 parke et al 2014 2019 this soil borne inoculum could easily contaminate the entire nursery operation if it infests runoff water that will be recycled for irrigation water disinfestation is therefore key to sustainable nursery practices water disinfestation treatments like chlorination slow sand filtration uv copper ionization and ozonation have been studied to determine their efficacy in eliminating plant pathogens from irrigation water cayanan et al 2009 hong and moorman 2005 hong et al 2003 majsztrik et al 2017 raudales et al 2014 stewart wade 2011 departure from effective protocols for any of these disinfestation treatments could result in plant pathogen release into the nursery monitoring plant pathogen and other microbial populations in irrigation water is important for ensuring effective disinfestation treatment parke and grünwald 2012 periodic testing of water for pathogens could facilitate early detection disease prevention and initiate a rapid mitigation response to evaluate oomycete pathogen risks associated with recycling runoff water we tested four sources of water from a recycled irrigation system at a commercial container nursery in southern california over the course of 2 5 years water sources included the main source of water from a reservoir the irrigation water received by different growing areas within the nursery runoff water and the retention pond water we detected oomycetes with filtration and leaf baiting methods followed by a metabarcoding approach to investigate species incidence diversity and distribution 2 material and methods 2 1 recycled irrigation system at a nursery site the study site was a 170 ha wholesale plant nursery located in southern california that produces container grown woody and herbaceous perennials seasonal products such as poinsettias color annuals and drought tolerant perennials a recycling irrigation system was established to conserve water in this drought prone area the main source of irrigation was the untreated water sourced from lake mathews reservoir with a lesser portion drawn from groundwater wells the reservoir is the western terminus of the colorado river aqueduct and is used as a source of agricultural irrigation water as well as municipal drinking water periodically reservoir water was pumped into a retention pond located at the highest elevation within the nursery before use in irrigation water from the retention pond was filtered and disinfested with chlorine dioxide this treated water was blended with untreated lake mathews water to maintain water pressure and provide sufficient flow rates for irrigation the irrigation water received by different growing areas was thus a mixture of chlorine dioxide treated and untreated retention water excess irrigation runoff and leachate water flowed off polyethylene sheets or weed barrier fabric lining the growing beds into polyethylene sheet lined channels that terminated in a runoff capturing pond treatment of recaptured water changed over the study period before november 4 2015 runoff water from the capturing pond was directly pumped into the retention pond beginning november 4 2015 the runoff water was passed through rapid sand filters before entering the retention pond after august 4 2016 the runoff water was passed through rapid sand filters and injected with sulfuric acid before the retention pond 2 2 site selection and water sampling four water sources representing all phases of the recycled irrigation system were sampled periodically 42 times from july 2015 to december 2017 supplementary table 1 sources included the untreated reservoir water incoming the retention pond water retention irrigation water received by three different growing areas irrigation and finally the runoff water runoff the incoming retention and irrigation water was collected from a hose bib after flushing out the stagnant water whereas the runoff water was collected from runoff channel just before it entered the runoff capturing pond one liter glass bottles were triple rinsed with 250 ml of the sample water before collecting 1 l water each for filtration and leaf baiting after collection samples were stored on ice and transported to the lab within 24 h and stored at 5 c prior to filtration and leaf baiting 2 3 filtration leaf baiting and sequencing each water sample was filtered through a nylon mesh screen 75 μm pore size m75 pentair aquatic bio systems apopka fl to remove large debris each screen was bleached with 10 sodium hypochlorite for 10 min rinsed in deionized di water and air dried between samples the pre filtered sample was then vacuum filtered through a 5 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane cat no smwp04700 mf millipore burlington ma every filter was rolled cut and transferred to a 2 ml tube containing 500 μm garnets and 6 mm zirconium grinding satellites cat no pfmm 500 100 25 ops diagnostics lebanon nj and 950 μl of ctab buffer containing pvp was pipetted into the tube the sample tube was vortexed for 5 s before being stored at 20 c until shipment healthy leaves from potted rhododendron catawbiense grandiflorum plants grown without any fungicide treatments or other pesticides were used to bait oomycetes from water samples bait leaves were collected the same day as water sampling each leaf was placed into a paper tea filter melitta north america clearwater fl with a polystyrene foam packing peanut to float the packet near the water surface and stapled shut a leaf bait packet was placed in each 1 l water sample bottle loosely capped and incubated at room temperature 18 22 c for three days following incubation leaf baits were removed rinsed with tap water and blotted dry on a clean paper towel each leaf was then wrapped in a moist paper towel placed individually in a resealable plastic bag and incubated for an additional seven days after incubation leaves exhibiting brown lesions were selected a sterile hole punch was used to cut 1 5 leaf disks 6 mm diameter from the lesion margin leaf disks were stored in silica gel at room temperature ockels et al 2007 leaf disks and filters were shipped to oregon state university osu for dna extraction dna extraction from filters and leaf baits and pcr using its6 and its7 primers cooke et al 2000 was performed as described in redekar et al 2019 amplicons were sequenced with the illumina miseq sequencing platform at the center of genome research and biocomputing cgrb at osu oomycete detection frequency for filters and leaf baits was calculated as the number of sampling events with positive oomycete detections as a proportion of total sampling events oomycete species found in lesions of rhododendron leaf baits were considered alive and active organisms that were either pathogens capable of causing infections on live plant material or saprophytes that survived on the nutrients from infected baits species abundance was estimated as described below 2 4 sequencing data analyses the low quality ends of the sequencing reads q score 30 were initially trimmed and sequences with a read length less than 100 base pairs were removed to obtain high quality data using cutadapt version 1 10 martin 2011 the high quality sequencing reads were used to determine unique amplicon sequences also knowns as asvs amplicon sequence variants and their abundance in each individual sample using dada2 plugin in qiime version 2018 11 0 bolyen et al 2019 these sequences are available at https tinyurl com asv sequences fasta these sequences were then queried separately against a custom oomycete its1 reference sequence database using a standalone megablast search in nucleotide nucleotide blast version 2 2 29 camacho et al 2009 keller et al 1998 to find a single best matching hit with 99 sequence similarity across at least 150 base pair length the custom oomycete its1 reference sequence database used here is composed of its1 sequences from the database described in redekar et al 2019 and idphy molecular online identification tools for phytophthora abad et al 2019 the blast search identified several oomycete sequences in the dataset and we only focused on these oomycete amplicon sequences in this study sequences that did not match any of the known oomycete reference sequences in our database were not included in the sequence analysis the amplicon sequences of known oomycetes were aligned with mafft alignment plugin katoh and standley 2013 the alignment was masked and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with a fasttree phylogeny plugin price et al 2010 within qiime2 version 2018 11 0 bolyen et al 2019 when multiple oomycete amplicon sequences returned the same taxon with the blast search we added up abundance values of the sequences with identical taxonomic hits within each sample with the results from this step we created an operational taxonomic unit otu abundance table where each otu was a group of similar sequences that corresponded to a unique oomycete taxon this otu abundance data was first relativized by dividing with total number of sequences per sample this relative abundance was then multiplied with the ratio of total amount of dna recovered from each sample i e 1l water to total amount of dna template 50 ng used for pcr to get an adjusted relative abundance unit abundance per liter water this adjustment gives an approximate estimate of oomycetes in 1l water assuming total initial dna in each sample is predominantly originating from oomycetes for leaf bait samples otu data was limited to presence absence of a species shorter its1 amplicon sequences read lengths ranged from 210 to 349 bp average length 255 bp cannot differentiate some closely related oomycete species so we used the cluster complex classification system throughout this paper to indicate groups of indistinguishable species redekar et al 2019 an updated list of indistinguishable species phytophthora clusters and complexes is provided supplementary table 2 as defined for this study a complex is a group of species that share an identical full length its sequence while a cluster is a group of species that have an its1 sequence identical only between its6 and its7 priming sites redekar et al 2019 otu abundance data for filter samples originating from incoming and runoff water were used to perform non metric multidimensional scaling nmds on bray curtis dissimilarity matrix using perform phyloseq r package version 1 16 2 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 since the southern california climate does not correspond to conventional four meteorological seasons spring summer fall winter we classified the southern california climate into 3 classes based on monthly average air temperature cold season from december to february with average air temperature 15 c mild season from march to may and november with average air temperature ranging from 15 to 20 c and finally hot season from june to october with average air temperature 20 c supplementary table 3 seasonal classifications and monthly weather parameters reported by california irrigation management information system cimis station 240 located 12 miles east of the nursery were fitted to determine seasonal impacts on the nmds ordination and significance was tested with permutation test n 999 using vegan r package version 2 4 5 oksanen et al 2018 supplementary table 3 species richness was also fitted to this ordination to determine its correlation with fitted weather parameters 3 results 3 1 pythium and phytophthora clades represented in the recycled irrigation system more than 48 million sequences were analyzed representing 4 809 unique amplicons sequences

indistinguishable species complexes or clusters redekar et al 2019 nine each for pythium and phytophthora and one each for phytopythium achlya and saprolegnia the phytophthora pythium and phytopythium species of which the majority are plant pathogens together contributed more than 85 of the total oomycete population detected in irrigation water both pythium and phytophthora communities in water were represented by species belonging to 8 and 9 different sub generic clades respectively this included pythium clades a b d e f h i and j and phytophthora clades 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 fig 1 3 2 plant pathogenic oomycetes in the incoming lake mathews reservoir water lake mathews harbors oomycete species capable of causing plant disease the oomycete detection frequency from the incoming untreated lake mathews reservoir water incoming was more than 78 and 21 for the filter and leaf bait samples respectively the total number of oomycete species detected on filters increased from 2016 to 2017 n 23 in 2016 and n 47 in 2017 fig 2 during the span of this study with the filtration method we detected a total of 30 pythium spp 23 phytophthora spp 4 saprolegnia spp 2 phytopythium spp 2 aphanomyces spp and one species each of achlya albugo and lagenidium in the incoming fig 2 of these the following taxa were detected on leaf baits phytophthora citricola complex p capsici cluster p

pythium chondricola complex pythium flevoense complex pythium sp nov cbs 232 94 and saprolegnia diclina complex all species detected on leaf baits are recognized as plant pathogens 3 3 oomycete detection frequency in the recycled irrigation system the total number of samples collected for the different water sources differed depending on location supplementary table 1 the oomycete detection frequency on filters was highest for runoff 95 3 40 out of 42 sample times and followed by irrigation 95 1 39 out of 41 times retention 89 2 33 out of 37 times and incoming 78 6 33 out of 42 times table 1 supplementary table 1 for every sampling event we detected oomycetes on filters originating from at least one source of water during 31 of 42 total sampling events 73 8 at least one source of water was found to harbor putative pathogenic oomycete species as determined by lesions on rhododendron leaf baits table 1 the detection frequency of oomycete lesions on leaf baits for runoff retention incoming and irrigation were 57 1 35 1 21 4 and 14 6 respectively table 1 diversity estimates based on filters indicates that the oomycete community detected in incoming was most diverse shannon 1 75 simpson 0 58 as compared to any other on site sources of water however oomycete species richness 10 58 of incoming was less than the runoff 15 75 and greater than other sources of water table 1 interestingly the correlation coefficient r2 between detection frequency and the abundance of oomycete species that are recognized as plant pathogens indicated with status p in fig 3 on filters was 0 2 0 66 0 63 and 0 63 in incoming retention irrigation and runoff respectively indicating that the recycling irrigation water system at the nursery enriches for plant pathogenic oomycete species in irrigation water retention irrigation and runoff 3 4 oomycete species circulating in the recycled irrigation system the most common oomycete taxa detected in runoff with filtration included to 16 pythium spp 13 phytophthora spp 2 phytopythium spp 2 saprolegnia spp and 1 aphanomyces sp fig 3 of these 6 pythium spp 11 phytophthora spp 2 phytopythium spp and 1 saprolegnia sp infected rhododendron leaf baits fig 3 mean adjusted relative abundance for the majority of oomycete species was rare i e 10 abundance per liter water on filters only 9 pythium spp 1 phytophthora spp 1 saprolegnia sp and 1 aphanomyces sp showed abundance 10 species on filters fig 3 phytophthora citricola complex was the only species detected on filters with abundance 10 abundance per liter water and leaf baits from all sources of water within the recycled irrigation system there was no correlation between detection frequency or abundance of recognized plant pathogenic oomycete species detected on filters with their propensity to infect leaf baits for example phytophthora capsici cluster had a high detection frequency 40 70 and was found in greatest abundance 100 abundance per liter water on filters but was not detected on leaf baits certain phytophthora species are moderately host specific erwin and ribeiro 1996 which could interfere with their ability to infect rhododendron baits interestingly some fish pathogenic species such as pythium chondricola complex pythium flevoense complex and saprolegnia diclina complex were repeatedly detected on leaf baits suggesting these could be putative or opportunistic plant pathogens 3 5 correlation of weather parameters with oomycete communities in incoming and runoff water we performed a permutation test n 999 to find significant weather parameters fitting nmds ordination we found strong correlations between the oomycete diversity in the runoff with the weather parameters recorded monthly by a cimis weather station supplementary table 3 located near the nursery and three cold mild hot seasonal conditions the weather data for average air temperature c r2 0 56 total evapotranspiration mm r2 0 55 average soil temperatures c r2 0 51 total precipitation mm r2 0 45 average solar radiation w m2 r2 0 41 average wind speed mph r2 0 38 average vapor pressure kpa r2 0 35 average relative humidity r2 0 33 average dew point c r2 0 30 and seasonal conditions cold mild hot r2 0 18 were a good fit to the nmds ordination of oomycete communities detected in runoff water goodness of fit p value 0 05 however in the case of incoming water only average soil temperature c r2 0 23 p value 0 05 was found to be a good fit fig 4 this suggests that weather has different impacts on the oomycete pathogen diversity in incoming and runoff water interestingly species richness was also a good fit to the nmds ordination of oomycete diversity in both incoming r2 0 22 and runoff r2 0 15 goodness of fit p value 0 05 but the richness vector showed opposite directionality with respect to the soil temperature vector fig 4 richness vector appears to increase with soil temperature for incoming water whereas it decreases with rise in soil temperatures and increased with relative humidity for runoff water 4 discussion high throughput microbial detection approaches such as metabarcoding enables faster processing of a large number and variety of samples compared to conventional culture based methods specific primers and next generation sequencing platforms such as illumina miseq allow detection of a select taxonomic group of microorganisms with greater sensitivity by generating millions of short up to 300 bp read sequences in this study we used a metabarcoding approach to detect oomycete species present in nursery irrigation water using its6 and its7 primers that specifically amplify a short its1 region from most oomycete species this approach however has three limitations an inability to resolve some closely related species redekar et al 2019 failure to detect a few oomycetes species with mismatched priming sites redekar et al 2019 sapkota and nicolaisen 2015 and an inability to detect hybrid sequences with heterozygous loci due to minimal overlap between paired read sequences considering these limitations we have modified our species identification methods to report closely related species as complexes members with identical full length its sequence or clusters members with identical shorter amplified its sequence which has improved the interpretation of our data previously we reported some oomycete species complexes and clusters based on an older reference sequence database and sequences flanked with its6 and its7 priming sites redekar et al 2019 in this study we have reported an updated list of unresolved phytophthora species complexes and clusters based on the updated reference sequence database our oomycete reference database is far from complete limiting our efforts to identify only 21 523 2412 of the total oomycete sequences found in this study we suspect some fungal its sequences are present since its6 and its7 primers will amplify some fungal species sapkota and nicolaisen 2015 which could make up a significant portion of non oomycete sequences in this paper we only describe detections of known oomycete species taking into account our goal to evaluate oomycete pathogen risks associated with recycling runoff water of the 10 oomycete genera detected in the recycled irrigation system pythium phytophthora and phytopythium species collectively contributed more than 85 of the total oomycete population found in irrigation water several of these species have been associated with foliar and root rot diseases of nursery plants for example species such as p cactorum p cambivora p cinnamomi p citricola p citrophthora p cryptogea p hibernalis p nemorosa p nicotianae p syringae and p tropicalis were previously reported to cause foliar diseases at multiple ornamental plant nurseries in southern california yakabe et al 2009 and root rot diseases at multiple native plant nurseries in northern and coastal california rooney latham et al 2019 phytophthora cinnamomi p nicotianae p palmivora and phytopythium helicoides were also previously reported to cause root rot diseases in the same southern california nursery parke et al 2019 pythium in general appears to be the most abundant oomycete genus in nursery irrigation water systems ali shtayeh et al 1991 macdonald et al 1994 parke et al 2019 redekar et al 2019 yang and hong 2016 it is also true in this study where pythium was the most abundant oomycete genus followed by phytophthora and phytopythium several taxa detected in this study were also commonly reported in previous studies based on different california nurseries despite their differences in the species identification methodologies the phytophthora species reported in the recycled irrigation water surveys of southern california nurseries ali shtayeh et al 1991 macdonald et al 1994 parke et al 2019 were also detected in the current study except p megasperma similarly all pythium species reported in the current study were also reported in parke et al 2019 whereas only pythium middletonii and pythium ultimum were similar between this study and ali shtayeh et al 1991 some of these differences could be attributed to different systematic treatments of and or the use of different taxonomic keys to the genus by different authors interestingly the phytophthora and pythium communities detected in recycled irrigation system at this nursery were phylogenetically more diverse clades 1 4 and 6 10 for phytophthora and clades a b d f and h j for pythium than those detected at oregon clades 2 6 and 8 10 for phytophthora and clades a b e and h for pythium parke et al 2014 redekar et al 2019 nurseries multiple surveys have previously reported prevalence of phylogenetically diverse phytophthora community clades 1 4 and 6 10 in california bourret 2018 garbelotto et al 2018 parke et al 2019 rooney latham et al 2014 rooney latham et al 2019 sims et al 2017 yakabe et al 2009 for instance clades 1 3 and 6 8 species were associated with foliar infections at 1 619 california ornamental nurseries yakabe et al 2009 clades 1 2 and 6 8 species from nursery stock were found at california native plant nurseries rooney latham et al 2014 rooney latham et al 2019 sims et al 2017 clades 1 4 and 6 8 species were detected in soil collected from northern california restoration sites bourret 2018 garbelotto et al 2018 and clades 1 2 4 and 6 10 species in water soil and plants were collected from the current southern california nursery parke et al 2019 compared to these phytophthora surveys the current study detected more phytophthora species which could be due to the higher sensitivity of the metabarcoding approach or enrichment of the phytophthora community in recirculating nursery irrigation water interestingly we only detected a single clade 4 species p palmivora although two clade 4 species p quercetorum bourret 2018 garbelotto et al 2018 rooney latham et al 2014 and p palmivora bourret 2018 parke et al 2019 have been reported in california in the current study p palmivora was only detected once on filters corresponding to an incoming water sample collected in july 2017 sampling period p33 in december 2017 p palmivora was also detected on lagerstroemia plants showing severe root necrosis symptoms at the same nursery parke et al 2019 it is possible that the incoming water could have been the source of infection for p palmivora at this nursery the incoming water in this study was sourced from lake mathews in southern california oomycetes were detected in this water more than 78 of the sampling times on filters and more than 21 of the times on leaf bait the latter representing live oomycetes lake mathews is the southwestern end of the colorado river aqueduct located in the lower basin of colorado river map and profile of the colorado river aqueduct 1940 zetland 2011 other researchers have detected phytophthora spp in the colorado river stamler et al 2016 baited headwaters of the colorado river in utah with leaves of cottonwood populus sp and willow salix sp in 2012 and found phytophthora cinnamomi and phytophthora riparia since stream baiting was only conducted once at this site seasonal fluctuations in phytophthora incidence were not evaluated stamler et al 2016 in the current study we detected phytophthora riparia on both filters and rhododendron leaf baits and phytophthora cinnamomi on filters from lake mathews incoming water p cinnamomi was also detected in retention and irrigation water with baiting and filtration recently p cinnamomi was found associated with diseased plants and was also detected in contaminated potting media and reused containers at this nursery parke et al 2019 while it is difficult to delineate the source of this invasive pathogen it is certain that the p cinnamomi is established in the recycled irrigation system here the oomycete species richness and diversity estimates for all four water types in this study were less than that reported for the oregon nursery redekar et al 2019 although quite similar trends were evident for example retention water at both nurseries showed the lowest species richness followed by irrigation water while runoff and incoming water showed the highest richness at the southern california current study and the oregon redekar et al 2019 nursery respectively different oomycete richness in incoming water could be due to different sources of surface water a flowing creek in oregon vs a stationary water reservoir in southern california seasonality was one of the important drivers for oomycete diversity in recycled irrigation water at the oregon nursery redekar et al 2019 this was contrary to earlier work reporting lack of seasonal influence on phytophthora propagules in a recycled irrigation system at other southern california nurseries macdonald et al 1994 these differences could be attributed to a warmer climate in southern california that is characterized by a hot summer warm spring and fall seasons and a mild winter season as compared to oregon where there is greater seasonal variation in the current study weather was found to impact oomycete diversity in runoff and incoming water differently while other researchers have documented trends with weather parameters air temperature precipitation and detection of individual phytophthora species in water junker et al 2016 the current study is to our knowledge the first to examine the relationship of different weather parameters reported monthly by cimis weather station to oomycete species richness and diversity in nursery water the oomycetes in runoff water seemed to be influenced by multiple weather parameters soil temperature was commonly associated with oomycete diversity in both water types however it showed a contrasting relationship with species richness different trends for oomycete diversity in incoming and runoff water could be due to different weather dependent nursery operations for example the runoff water and hence its oomycete species abundance are dependent on irrigation frequency which is determined by evapotranspiration rate which is in turn derived from multiple weather parameters such as solar radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity etc hot dry weather conditions can trigger frequent irrigation events increasing the total runoff volume furthermore the oomycete composition in runoff water is dependent on plant pathogenic species associated with seasonally grown plant host varieties in the nursery for example miniature rosemary trees sold in the christmas market are mostly grown in the summer and fall these were host to phytophthora cryptogea and phytopythium litorale parke et al 2019 in contrast the oomycete communities in the incoming water which is lake mathews reservoir water pumped through pipes is not influenced by weather dependent nursery operations oomycete diversity and its relationship to weather parameters reported here may or may not show similar trends at other nurseries it is important to note that this study used monthly weather report data from cimis weather station s240 that is located approximately 12 miles east of the nursery it is possible that these observations could change if the weather data was collected at the nursery site controlled experiments are required in the future to determine the direct effects of individual weather parameters on oomycete diversity in irrigation water overall the runoff water is heavily infested with oomycete plant and animal pathogenic species blending this contaminated runoff water with the disinfested water for irrigation purposes increases the plant disease risks at this nursery releasing the contaminated runoff water to streams or ponds could have implications for aquatic animal ecology disinfesting runoff water before reuse or release could help prevent these outcomes 5 conclusions to evaluate risks associated with recycling irrigation runoff for nursery plant production we used a metabarcoding approach to detect oomycete plant and animal pathogens in different sources of water incoming retention irrigation and runoff water within a recycled irrigation system at a horticultural nursery in southern california major findings are several oomycete species exist in the recycled irrigation system the nursery irrigation water is selectively enriched for plant pathogenic phytophthora pythium and phytopythium species phytophthora and pythium species detected in this southern california nursery are phylogenetically more diverse than those detected in oregon nurseries lake mathews reservoir the incoming source of water harbors several oomycete plant and animal pathogens harnessing this water without disinfestation for irrigation purposes could introduce new pathogens to the nursery the highest number of oomycete species was detected in runoff water followed by incoming irrigation and reservoir water the oomycete diversity in runoff water was highly influenced by weather parameters suggesting likely connections to weather dependent nursery operations funding sources this project

17743,recapture and recycling of irrigation water is often required to meet enormous water demands at horticultural nurseries we tested four water types associated with a recycled irrigation system at a commercial container nursery in southern california for presence of oomycete plant pathogens from july 2015 to december 2017 these water types included the main source of water originating from a reservoir retention water from an on site collection pond irrigation water received by different growing areas within the nursery and irrigation runoff captured in polyethylene sheet lined runoff channels the genera phytophthora pythium and phytopythium together contributed more than 85 of the total oomycete population detected in the recycled irrigation system the phytophthora and pythium genera were represented by member species from nine 1 4 6 10 and eight a b d f h j different sub generic clades respectively incoming water sourced from the reservoir was found to harbor known plant pathogens such as phytophthora citricola complex p capsici cluster p tropicalis p citrophthora cluster p nemorosa cluster p riparia p cryptogea complex p parsiana cluster p sp nov aff kernoviae pythium dissotocum complex py oligandrum cluster py irregulare and phytopythium litorale runoff water showed the highest oomycete species richness and frequency of detection with both filtration and leaf baiting methods in addition to plant pathogens oomycete fish pathogens such as aphanomyces laevis pythium chondricola complex pythium flevoense complex and saprolegnia diclina complex were also detected in greater abundance in the recycled irrigation water the oomycete species richness in the runoff water was correlated with several environmental parameters such as soil temperature greater oomycete richness in incoming water was associated with higher soil temperatures whereas richness in runoff declines with increasing soil temperature likely suggesting connections to weather dependent nursery operations keywords metabarcoding phytophthora pythium reclaimed water lake mathews reservoir weather impacts 1 introduction water is an expensive limited resource with massive demand a single commercial nursery consumed almost 400 million gallons 1 5 million m3 of water annually in 2015 2016 which approximately equals 2 5 million gallons 25 000 m3 ha 1 of water per acre of growing space pitton et al 2018 water scarcity restrictions imposed on harvesting water from surface and underground sources challenges associated with rain or storm water collection or the high retail cost of municipal water often limit growers from solely depending on these resources to meet their irrigation demand water recycling is a sustainable solution to minimize the water usage and costs associated with procuring water from natural sources while fulfilling water demand at commercial nurseries particularly those located in drought prone areas majsztrik et al 2017 pitton et al 2018 white 2019 recycling of water at a nursery involves capturing surplus water from several over irrigated plant growing areas into systematically connected water channels through which runoff water flows into a collection pond this runoff is then reused for irrigation which may improve sustainability and decrease cost by reducing consumption of high quality water pitton et al 2018 the cost savings can be significant if the high quality irrigation source water is expensive pitton et al 2018 use of runoff water for irrigation can decrease fertilizer application and associated costs as this water has increased concentrations of nutrients that leached from previous irrigation events devincentis et al 2015 the runoff water is also a hazard to nursery plant production since it may accumulate waterborne plant pathogens that could increase the disease risk and cause economic loss due to reduced plant quality contaminated runoff water from nursery plant production predominantly harbors oomycete plant pathogens along with several fungal bacterial viral and parasitic nematode pathogens hong and moorman 2005 this paper will only focus on oomycetes associated with recycled irrigation water oomycetes commonly known as water molds are a group of mostly fungus like eukaryotic microorganisms that can cause diseases in plants fungi humans and other animals fawke et al 2015 kamoun 2003 species of phytophthora pythium and phytopythium are associated with crown and root rot wilt shoot cankers shoot dieback damping off diseases and foliar blight of several horticultural crops ornamentals fruits and vegetables pscheidt and ocamb 2019 and are commonly found in nursery irrigation water hong and moorman 2005 macdonald et al 1994 in warm moist conditions these plant pathogens usually infect hosts by producing motile zoospores asexual spores that are capable of swimming towards and colonizing the host in dry conditions resting spores chlamydospores or oospores may be produced that may remain dormant in soil for a long time and or be dispersed long distances especially through human movement of soil or plants kamoun 2003 larousse and galiana 2017 under favorable conditions soil chlamydospores and oospores germinate to produce mycelium sporangia and zoospores to start the infection cycle kamoun 2003 therefore soil from plant growing areas within the nurseries can be heavily infested with these pathogens junker et al 2016 parke et al 2014 2019 this soil borne inoculum could easily contaminate the entire nursery operation if it infests runoff water that will be recycled for irrigation water disinfestation is therefore key to sustainable nursery practices water disinfestation treatments like chlorination slow sand filtration uv copper ionization and ozonation have been studied to determine their efficacy in eliminating plant pathogens from irrigation water cayanan et al 2009 hong and moorman 2005 hong et al 2003 majsztrik et al 2017 raudales et al 2014 stewart wade 2011 departure from effective protocols for any of these disinfestation treatments could result in plant pathogen release into the nursery monitoring plant pathogen and other microbial populations in irrigation water is important for ensuring effective disinfestation treatment parke and grünwald 2012 periodic testing of water for pathogens could facilitate early detection disease prevention and initiate a rapid mitigation response to evaluate oomycete pathogen risks associated with recycling runoff water we tested four sources of water from a recycled irrigation system at a commercial container nursery in southern california over the course of 2 5 years water sources included the main source of water from a reservoir the irrigation water received by different growing areas within the nursery runoff water and the retention pond water we detected oomycetes with filtration and leaf baiting methods followed by a metabarcoding approach to investigate species incidence diversity and distribution 2 material and methods 2 1 recycled irrigation system at a nursery site the study site was a 170 ha wholesale plant nursery located in southern california that produces container grown woody and herbaceous perennials seasonal products such as poinsettias color annuals and drought tolerant perennials a recycling irrigation system was established to conserve water in this drought prone area the main source of irrigation was the untreated water sourced from lake mathews reservoir with a lesser portion drawn from groundwater wells the reservoir is the western terminus of the colorado river aqueduct and is used as a source of agricultural irrigation water as well as municipal drinking water periodically reservoir water was pumped into a retention pond located at the highest elevation within the nursery before use in irrigation water from the retention pond was filtered and disinfested with chlorine dioxide this treated water was blended with untreated lake mathews water to maintain water pressure and provide sufficient flow rates for irrigation the irrigation water received by different growing areas was thus a mixture of chlorine dioxide treated and untreated retention water excess irrigation runoff and leachate water flowed off polyethylene sheets or weed barrier fabric lining the growing beds into polyethylene sheet lined channels that terminated in a runoff capturing pond treatment of recaptured water changed over the study period before november 4 2015 runoff water from the capturing pond was directly pumped into the retention pond beginning november 4 2015 the runoff water was passed through rapid sand filters before entering the retention pond after august 4 2016 the runoff water was passed through rapid sand filters and injected with sulfuric acid before the retention pond 2 2 site selection and water sampling four water sources representing all phases of the recycled irrigation system were sampled periodically 42 times from july 2015 to december 2017 supplementary table 1 sources included the untreated reservoir water incoming the retention pond water retention irrigation water received by three different growing areas irrigation and finally the runoff water runoff the incoming retention and irrigation water was collected from a hose bib after flushing out the stagnant water whereas the runoff water was collected from runoff channel just before it entered the runoff capturing pond one liter glass bottles were triple rinsed with 250 ml of the sample water before collecting 1 l water each for filtration and leaf baiting after collection samples were stored on ice and transported to the lab within 24 h and stored at 5 c prior to filtration and leaf baiting 2 3 filtration leaf baiting and sequencing each water sample was filtered through a nylon mesh screen 75 μm pore size m75 pentair aquatic bio systems apopka fl to remove large debris each screen was bleached with 10 sodium hypochlorite for 10 min rinsed in deionized di water and air dried between samples the pre filtered sample was then vacuum filtered through a 5 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane cat no smwp04700 mf millipore burlington ma every filter was rolled cut and transferred to a 2 ml tube containing 500 μm garnets and 6 mm zirconium grinding satellites cat no pfmm 500 100 25 ops diagnostics lebanon nj and 950 μl of ctab buffer containing pvp was pipetted into the tube the sample tube was vortexed for 5 s before being stored at 20 c until shipment healthy leaves from potted rhododendron catawbiense grandiflorum plants grown without any fungicide treatments or other pesticides were used to bait oomycetes from water samples bait leaves were collected the same day as water sampling each leaf was placed into a paper tea filter melitta north america clearwater fl with a polystyrene foam packing peanut to float the packet near the water surface and stapled shut a leaf bait packet was placed in each 1 l water sample bottle loosely capped and incubated at room temperature 18 22 c for three days following incubation leaf baits were removed rinsed with tap water and blotted dry on a clean paper towel each leaf was then wrapped in a moist paper towel placed individually in a resealable plastic bag and incubated for an additional seven days after incubation leaves exhibiting brown lesions were selected a sterile hole punch was used to cut 1 5 leaf disks 6 mm diameter from the lesion margin leaf disks were stored in silica gel at room temperature ockels et al 2007 leaf disks and filters were shipped to oregon state university osu for dna extraction dna extraction from filters and leaf baits and pcr using its6 and its7 primers cooke et al 2000 was performed as described in redekar et al 2019 amplicons were sequenced with the illumina miseq sequencing platform at the center of genome research and biocomputing cgrb at osu oomycete detection frequency for filters and leaf baits was calculated as the number of sampling events with positive oomycete detections as a proportion of total sampling events oomycete species found in lesions of rhododendron leaf baits were considered alive and active organisms that were either pathogens capable of causing infections on live plant material or saprophytes that survived on the nutrients from infected baits species abundance was estimated as described below 2 4 sequencing data analyses the low quality ends of the sequencing reads q score 30 were initially trimmed and sequences with a read length less than 100 base pairs were removed to obtain high quality data using cutadapt version 1 10 martin 2011 the high quality sequencing reads were used to determine unique amplicon sequences also knowns as asvs amplicon sequence variants and their abundance in each individual sample using dada2 plugin in qiime version 2018 11 0 bolyen et al 2019 these sequences are available at https tinyurl com asv sequences fasta these sequences were then queried separately against a custom oomycete its1 reference sequence database using a standalone megablast search in nucleotide nucleotide blast version 2 2 29 camacho et al 2009 keller et al 1998 to find a single best matching hit with 99 sequence similarity across at least 150 base pair length the custom oomycete its1 reference sequence database used here is composed of its1 sequences from the database described in redekar et al 2019 and idphy molecular online identification tools for phytophthora abad et al 2019 the blast search identified several oomycete sequences in the dataset and we only focused on these oomycete amplicon sequences in this study sequences that did not match any of the known oomycete reference sequences in our database were not included in the sequence analysis the amplicon sequences of known oomycetes were aligned with mafft alignment plugin katoh and standley 2013 the alignment was masked and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with a fasttree phylogeny plugin price et al 2010 within qiime2 version 2018 11 0 bolyen et al 2019 when multiple oomycete amplicon sequences returned the same taxon with the blast search we added up abundance values of the sequences with identical taxonomic hits within each sample with the results from this step we created an operational taxonomic unit otu abundance table where each otu was a group of similar sequences that corresponded to a unique oomycete taxon this otu abundance data was first relativized by dividing with total number of sequences per sample this relative abundance was then multiplied with the ratio of total amount of dna recovered from each sample i e 1l water to total amount of dna template 50 ng used for pcr to get an adjusted relative abundance unit abundance per liter water this adjustment gives an approximate estimate of oomycetes in 1l water assuming total initial dna in each sample is predominantly originating from oomycetes for leaf bait samples otu data was limited to presence absence of a species shorter its1 amplicon sequences read lengths ranged from 210 to 349 bp average length 255 bp cannot differentiate some closely related oomycete species so we used the cluster complex classification system throughout this paper to indicate groups of indistinguishable species redekar et al 2019 an updated list of indistinguishable species phytophthora clusters and complexes is provided supplementary table 2 as defined for this study a complex is a group of species that share an identical full length its sequence while a cluster is a group of species that have an its1 sequence identical only between its6 and its7 priming sites redekar et al 2019 otu abundance data for filter samples originating from incoming and runoff water were used to perform non metric multidimensional scaling nmds on bray curtis dissimilarity matrix using perform phyloseq r package version 1 16 2 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 since the southern california climate does not correspond to conventional four meteorological seasons spring summer fall winter we classified the southern california climate into 3 classes based on monthly average air temperature cold season from december to february with average air temperature 15 c mild season from march to may and november with average air temperature ranging from 15 to 20 c and finally hot season from june to october with average air temperature 20 c supplementary table 3 seasonal classifications and monthly weather parameters reported by california irrigation management information system cimis station 240 located 12 miles east of the nursery were fitted to determine seasonal impacts on the nmds ordination and significance was tested with permutation test n 999 using vegan r package version 2 4 5 oksanen et al 2018 supplementary table 3 species richness was also fitted to this ordination to determine its correlation with fitted weather parameters 3 results 3 1 pythium and phytophthora clades represented in the recycled irrigation system more than 48 million sequences were analyzed representing 4 809 unique amplicons sequences

sequences 10 87 showed sequence alignment length 150 bp these sequences were considered to have originated from known oomycetes the remaining 1889 sequences 39 28 were considered to have originated from unidentified isolates of known oomycete species or novel oomycetes the known oomycete sequences represented a total of 97 oomycete taxa or otus including 48 pythium spp 30 phytophthora spp 5 phytopythium spp 5 saprolegnia spp 2 aphanomyces spp 2 achlya spp and 2 leptolegnia spp and one species each of apodachlya brevilegnia and albugo fig 1 the above list is inclusive of 22 indistinguishable species complexes or clusters redekar et al 2019 nine each for pythium and phytophthora and one each for phytopythium achlya and saprolegnia the phytophthora pythium and phytopythium species of which the majority are plant pathogens together contributed more than 85 of the total oomycete population detected in irrigation water both pythium and phytophthora communities in water were represented by species belonging to 8 and 9 different sub generic clades respectively this included pythium clades a b d e f h i and j and phytophthora clades 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 fig 1 3 2 plant pathogenic oomycetes in the incoming lake mathews reservoir water lake mathews harbors oomycete species capable of causing plant disease the oomycete detection frequency from the incoming untreated lake mathews reservoir water incoming was more than 78 and 21 for the filter and leaf bait samples respectively the total number of oomycete species detected on filters increased from 2016 to 2017 n 23 in 2016 and n 47 in 2017 fig 2 during the span of this study with the filtration method we detected a total of 30 pythium spp 23 phytophthora spp 4 saprolegnia spp 2 phytopythium spp 2 aphanomyces spp and one species each of achlya albugo and lagenidium in the incoming fig 2 of these the following taxa were detected on leaf baits phytophthora citricola complex p capsici cluster p tropicalis p citrophthora cluster p nemorosa cluster p riparia p cryptogea complex p parsiana cluster p sp nov aff kernoviae pythium chondricola complex pythium dissotocum complex pythium flevoense complex pythium sp nov cbs 232 94 pythium oligandrum cluster pythium irregulare complex phytopythium litorale and saprolegnia diclina complex fig 2 except for the phytophthora sp nov aff kernoviae pythium chondricola complex pythium flevoense complex pythium sp nov cbs 232 94 and saprolegnia diclina complex all species detected on leaf baits are recognized as plant pathogens 3 3 oomycete detection frequency in the recycled irrigation system the total number of samples collected for the different water sources differed depending on location supplementary table 1 the oomycete detection frequency on filters was highest for runoff 95 3 40 out of 42 sample times and followed by irrigation 95 1 39 out of 41 times retention 89 2 33 out of 37 times and incoming 78 6 33 out of 42 times table 1 supplementary table 1 for every sampling event we detected oomycetes on filters originating from at least one source of water during 31 of 42 total sampling events 73 8 at least one source of water was found to harbor putative pathogenic oomycete species as determined by lesions on rhododendron leaf baits table 1 the detection frequency of oomycete lesions on leaf baits for runoff retention incoming and irrigation were 57 1 35 1 21 4 and 14 6 respectively table 1 diversity estimates based on filters indicates that the oomycete community detected in incoming was most diverse shannon 1 75 simpson 0 58 as compared to any other on site sources of water however oomycete species richness 10 58 of incoming was less than the runoff 15 75 and greater than other sources of water table 1 interestingly the correlation coefficient r2 between detection frequency and the abundance of oomycete species that are recognized as plant pathogens indicated with status p in fig 3 on filters was 0 2 0 66 0 63 and 0 63 in incoming retention irrigation and runoff respectively indicating that the recycling irrigation water system at the nursery enriches for plant pathogenic oomycete species in irrigation water retention irrigation and runoff 3 4 oomycete species circulating in the recycled irrigation system the most common oomycete taxa detected in runoff with filtration included to 16 pythium spp 13 phytophthora spp 2 phytopythium spp 2 saprolegnia spp and 1 aphanomyces sp fig 3 of these 6 pythium spp 11 phytophthora spp 2 phytopythium spp and 1 saprolegnia sp infected rhododendron leaf baits fig 3 mean adjusted relative abundance for the majority of oomycete species was rare i e 10 abundance per liter water on filters only 9 pythium spp 1 phytophthora spp 1 saprolegnia sp and 1 aphanomyces sp showed abundance 10 species on filters fig 3 phytophthora citricola complex was the only species detected on filters with abundance 10 abundance per liter water and leaf baits from all sources of water within the recycled irrigation system there was no correlation between detection frequency or abundance of recognized plant pathogenic oomycete species detected on filters with their propensity to infect leaf baits for example phytophthora capsici cluster had a high detection frequency 40 70 and was found in greatest abundance 100 abundance per liter water on filters but was not detected on leaf baits certain phytophthora species are moderately host specific erwin and ribeiro 1996 which could interfere with their ability to infect rhododendron baits interestingly some fish pathogenic species such as pythium chondricola complex pythium flevoense complex and saprolegnia diclina complex were repeatedly detected on leaf baits suggesting these could be putative or opportunistic plant pathogens 3 5 correlation of weather parameters with oomycete communities in incoming and runoff water we performed a permutation test n 999 to find significant weather parameters fitting nmds ordination we found strong correlations between the oomycete diversity in the runoff with the weather parameters recorded monthly by a cimis weather station supplementary table 3 located near the nursery and three cold mild hot seasonal conditions the weather data for average air temperature c r2 0 56 total evapotranspiration mm r2 0 55 average soil temperatures c r2 0 51 total precipitation mm r2 0 45 average solar radiation w m2 r2 0 41 average wind speed mph r2 0 38 average vapor pressure kpa r2 0 35 average relative humidity r2 0 33 average dew point c r2 0 30 and seasonal conditions cold mild hot r2 0 18 were a good fit to the nmds ordination of oomycete communities detected in runoff water goodness of fit p value 0 05 however in the case of incoming water only average soil temperature c r2 0 23 p value 0 05 was found to be a good fit fig 4 this suggests that weather has different impacts on the oomycete pathogen diversity in incoming and runoff water interestingly species richness was also a good fit to the nmds ordination of oomycete diversity in both incoming r2 0 22 and runoff r2 0 15 goodness of fit p value 0 05 but the richness vector showed opposite directionality with respect to the soil temperature vector fig 4 richness vector appears to increase with soil temperature for incoming water whereas it decreases with rise in soil temperatures and increased with relative humidity for runoff water 4 discussion high throughput microbial detection approaches such as metabarcoding enables faster processing of a large number and variety of samples compared to conventional culture based methods specific primers and next generation sequencing platforms such as illumina miseq allow detection of a select taxonomic group of microorganisms with greater sensitivity by generating millions of short up to 300 bp read sequences in this study we used a metabarcoding approach to detect oomycete species present in nursery irrigation water using its6 and its7 primers that specifically amplify a short its1 region from most oomycete species this approach however has three limitations an inability to resolve some closely related species redekar et al 2019 failure to detect a few oomycetes species with mismatched priming sites redekar et al 2019 sapkota and nicolaisen 2015 and an inability to detect hybrid sequences with heterozygous loci due to minimal overlap between paired read sequences considering these limitations we have modified our species identification methods to report closely related species as complexes members with identical full length its sequence or clusters members with identical shorter amplified its sequence which has improved the interpretation of our data previously we reported some oomycete species complexes and clusters based on an older reference sequence database and sequences flanked with its6 and its7 priming sites redekar et al 2019 in this study we have reported an updated list of unresolved phytophthora species complexes and clusters based on the updated reference sequence database our oomycete reference database is far from complete limiting our efforts to identify only 21 523 2412 of the total oomycete sequences found in this study we suspect some fungal its sequences are present since its6 and its7 primers will amplify some fungal species sapkota and nicolaisen 2015 which could make up a significant portion of non oomycete sequences in this paper we only describe detections of known oomycete species taking into account our goal to evaluate oomycete pathogen risks associated with recycling runoff water of the 10 oomycete genera detected in the recycled irrigation system pythium phytophthora and phytopythium species collectively contributed more than 85 of the total oomycete population found in irrigation water several of these species have been associated with foliar and root rot diseases of nursery plants for example species such as p cactorum p cambivora p cinnamomi p citricola p citrophthora p cryptogea p hibernalis p nemorosa p nicotianae p syringae and p tropicalis were previously reported to cause foliar diseases at multiple ornamental plant nurseries in southern california yakabe et al 2009 and root rot diseases at multiple native plant nurseries in northern and coastal california rooney latham et al 2019 phytophthora cinnamomi p nicotianae p palmivora and phytopythium helicoides were also previously reported to cause root rot diseases in the same southern california nursery parke et al 2019 pythium in general appears to be the most abundant oomycete genus in nursery irrigation water systems ali shtayeh et al 1991 macdonald et al 1994 parke et al 2019 redekar et al 2019 yang and hong 2016 it is also true in this study where pythium was the most abundant oomycete genus followed by phytophthora and phytopythium several taxa detected in this study were also commonly reported in previous studies based on different california nurseries despite their differences in the species identification methodologies the phytophthora species reported in the recycled irrigation water surveys of southern california nurseries ali shtayeh et al 1991 macdonald et al 1994 parke et al 2019 were also detected in the current study except p megasperma similarly all pythium species reported in the current study were also reported in parke et al 2019 whereas only pythium middletonii and pythium ultimum were similar between this study and ali shtayeh et al 1991 some of these differences could be attributed to different systematic treatments of and or the use of different taxonomic keys to the genus by different authors interestingly the phytophthora and pythium communities detected in recycled irrigation system at this nursery were phylogenetically more diverse clades 1 4 and 6 10 for phytophthora and clades a b d f and h j for pythium than those detected at oregon clades 2 6 and 8 10 for phytophthora and clades a b e and h for pythium parke et al 2014 redekar et al 2019 nurseries multiple surveys have previously reported prevalence of phylogenetically diverse phytophthora community clades 1 4 and 6 10 in california bourret 2018 garbelotto et al 2018 parke et al 2019 rooney latham et al 2014 rooney latham et al 2019 sims et al 2017 yakabe et al 2009 for instance clades 1 3 and 6 8 species were associated with foliar infections at 1 619 california ornamental nurseries yakabe et al 2009 clades 1 2 and 6 8 species from nursery stock were found at california native plant nurseries rooney latham et al 2014 rooney latham et al 2019 sims et al 2017 clades 1 4 and 6 8 species were detected in soil collected from northern california restoration sites bourret 2018 garbelotto et al 2018 and clades 1 2 4 and 6 10 species in water soil and plants were collected from the current southern california nursery parke et al 2019 compared to these phytophthora surveys the current study detected more phytophthora species which could be due to the higher sensitivity of the metabarcoding approach or enrichment of the phytophthora community in recirculating nursery irrigation water interestingly we only detected a single clade 4 species p palmivora although two clade 4 species p quercetorum bourret 2018 garbelotto et al 2018 rooney latham et al 2014 and p palmivora bourret 2018 parke et al 2019 have been reported in california in the current study p palmivora was only detected once on filters corresponding to an incoming water sample collected in july 2017 sampling period p33 in december 2017 p palmivora was also detected on lagerstroemia plants showing severe root necrosis symptoms at the same nursery parke et al 2019 it is possible that the incoming water could have been the source of infection for p palmivora at this nursery the incoming water in this study was sourced from lake mathews in southern california oomycetes were detected in this water more than 78 of the sampling times on filters and more than 21 of the times on leaf bait the latter representing live oomycetes lake mathews is the southwestern end of the colorado river aqueduct located in the lower basin of colorado river map and profile of the colorado river aqueduct 1940 zetland 2011 other researchers have detected phytophthora spp in the colorado river stamler et al 2016 baited headwaters of the colorado river in utah with leaves of cottonwood populus sp and willow salix sp in 2012 and found phytophthora cinnamomi and phytophthora riparia since stream baiting was only conducted once at this site seasonal fluctuations in phytophthora incidence were not evaluated stamler et al 2016 in the current study we detected phytophthora riparia on both filters and rhododendron leaf baits and phytophthora cinnamomi on filters from lake mathews incoming water p cinnamomi was also detected in retention and irrigation water with baiting and filtration recently p cinnamomi was found associated with diseased plants and was also detected in contaminated potting media and reused containers at this nursery parke et al 2019 while it is difficult to delineate the source of this invasive pathogen it is certain that the p cinnamomi is established in the recycled irrigation system here the oomycete species richness and diversity estimates for all four water types in this study were less than that reported for the oregon nursery redekar et al 2019 although quite similar trends were evident for example retention water at both nurseries showed the lowest species richness followed by irrigation water while runoff and incoming water showed the highest richness at the southern california current study and the oregon redekar et al 2019 nursery respectively different oomycete richness in incoming water could be due to different sources of surface water a flowing creek in oregon vs a stationary water reservoir in southern california seasonality was one of the important drivers for oomycete diversity in recycled irrigation water at the oregon nursery redekar et al 2019 this was contrary to earlier work reporting lack of seasonal influence on phytophthora propagules in a recycled irrigation system at other southern california nurseries macdonald et al 1994 these differences could be attributed to a warmer climate in southern california that is characterized by a hot summer warm spring and fall seasons and a mild winter season as compared to oregon where there is greater seasonal variation in the current study weather was found to impact oomycete diversity in runoff and incoming water differently while other researchers have documented trends with weather parameters air temperature precipitation and detection of individual phytophthora species in water junker et al 2016 the current study is to our knowledge the first to examine the relationship of different weather parameters reported monthly by cimis weather station to oomycete species richness and diversity in nursery water the oomycetes in runoff water seemed to be influenced by multiple weather parameters soil temperature was commonly associated with oomycete diversity in both water types however it showed a contrasting relationship with species richness different trends for oomycete diversity in incoming and runoff water could be due to different weather dependent nursery operations for example the runoff water and hence its oomycete species abundance are dependent on irrigation frequency which is determined by evapotranspiration rate which is in turn derived from multiple weather parameters such as solar radiation air temperature wind speed relative humidity etc hot dry weather conditions can trigger frequent irrigation events increasing the total runoff volume furthermore the oomycete composition in runoff water is dependent on plant pathogenic species associated with seasonally grown plant host varieties in the nursery for example miniature rosemary trees sold in the christmas market are mostly grown in the summer and fall these were host to phytophthora cryptogea and phytopythium litorale parke et al 2019 in contrast the oomycete communities in the incoming water which is lake mathews reservoir water pumped through pipes is not influenced by weather dependent nursery operations oomycete diversity and its relationship to weather parameters reported here may or may not show similar trends at other nurseries it is important to note that this study used monthly weather report data from cimis weather station s240 that is located approximately 12 miles east of the nursery it is possible that these observations could change if the weather data was collected at the nursery site controlled experiments are required in the future to determine the direct effects of individual weather parameters on oomycete diversity in irrigation water overall the runoff water is heavily infested with oomycete plant and animal pathogenic species blending this contaminated runoff water with the disinfested water for irrigation purposes increases the plant disease risks at this nursery releasing the contaminated runoff water to streams or ponds could have implications for aquatic animal ecology disinfesting runoff water before reuse or release could help prevent these outcomes 5 conclusions to evaluate risks associated with recycling irrigation runoff for nursery plant production we used a metabarcoding approach to detect oomycete plant and animal pathogens in different sources of water incoming retention irrigation and runoff water within a recycled irrigation system at a horticultural nursery in southern california major findings are several oomycete species exist in the recycled irrigation system the nursery irrigation water is selectively enriched for plant pathogenic phytophthora pythium and phytopythium species phytophthora and pythium species detected in this southern california nursery are phylogenetically more diverse than those detected in oregon nurseries lake mathews reservoir the incoming source of water harbors several oomycete plant and animal pathogens harnessing this water without disinfestation for irrigation purposes could introduce new pathogens to the nursery the highest number of oomycete species was detected in runoff water followed by incoming irrigation and reservoir water the oomycete diversity in runoff water was highly influenced by weather parameters suggesting likely connections to weather dependent nursery operations funding sources this project

17744,wastewater treatment plant wwtp is one of the major sources of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass to the aquatic environment in this study wastewater samples were collected from 17 wwtps in 17 cities of china to investigate emerging pfass in wwtps to comprehensively identify pfass in the wastewater samples an integrated suspect screening homologue based and fragment based non target screening method is proposed sixty three pfass from 13 classes 25 subclasses were identified including 14 legacy and 49 emerging pfass and this study is the first to report on 12 of these pfass we found that emerging pfass concentration had a significantly positive correlation with the gross domestic product indicating more substitution of legacy pfass in the developed area of china we also analyzed the removal of the 13 pfas classes and found that all discovered pfas classes were not completely removed after the treatment process whereas the class of perfluoroalkyl ether alcohols significantly increased all of these results imply that the release of emerging or unknown pfass from wwtps is a universal but not negligible problem in china graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging pfass non target screening spatial distribution gdp wwtp removal 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are groups of synthetic organic compounds that contain the perfluoroalkyl moiety cnf2n 1 buck et al 2011 pfass have been widely used as surfactants and surface protectors since 1950s but were first reported in the environment in 2001 giesy and kannan 2001 they were then extensively detected in water sludge organism and human serum samples dauchy et al 2017 gao et al 2019 hu et al 2016 langberg et al 2019 yeung et al 2009 the persistence bioaccumulation toxicity and their ubiquity have led to the phase out of legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa worldwide newton et al 2017 from 2001 pfos related products were gradually phased out by the 3m company subsequently pfos related products were added to the stockholm convention in 2009 for their worldwide elimination lam et al 2016 in recent years china has increased its pfass production owing to restriction in the production of pfos pfoa in north american and europe lim et al 2011 xie et al 2013 besides the industry has increased the production of short chain pfass and other replacement chemicals such as genx to substitute for long chain pfoa gebbink et al 2017 gomis et al 2015 there are over 3000 commercial pfass worldwide but less than 2 of these are registered in the reach regulation kemi 2015 most research focused on only well known long chain pfass particularly pfos and pfoa wang et al 2017 previous studies revealed additional unknown pfass in water or blood samples by carrying out total fluorine measurement miyake et al 2007 yeung and mabury 2016 yeung et al 2009 thus to identify unknown pfass in the environment samples is needed high resolution mass spectrum hr ms has been introduced in recent studies to identify novel pfass barzen hanson et al 2017 liu et al 2015 place and field 2012 strynar et al 2015 wang et al 2018 there are essentially three screening strategies for the identification of pfass suspect screening is the most convenient method to identify pfass particularly when the reference ms ms spectra are available liu et al reviewed the pfass identified in recent years and the suspect list including ms and ms ms information was uploaded to the norman suspect list exchange liu et al 2019 non target screening is necessary to identify novel pfass when the suspect list is unavailable and it is divided into homologue based screening and fragment based screening homologue pattern or mass defect can be used to identify pfas homologues considering accurate mass and the elution order in homologues as pfass always occur as homologues cf2 c2f4 cf2o etc gebbink et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the fragment based screening method fluorine fragments such as c2f5 and c2f5o are frequently detected and these fragments can differ in pfass compared with other non fluorine chemicals liu et al used a fragment based in source fragmentation flagging method to identify pfass in wastewater treatment plants wwtps fish and polar bear serum liu et al 2015 2018a 2018b however diagnostic neutral loss such as hf was not considered in the method thus missing some pfass with no diagnostic fragment such as fluorinated telomer sulfonate thus we combined homologue and fragment based methods and considered diagnostic neutral loss in this study wwtps were considered as a major source of pfass to the aquatic environment arvaniti et al 2012 pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however there is still no national survey of occurrence and distribution of emerging pfass in chinese wwtps liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in the present study municipal influent and effluent samples were collected from 17 cities in china the samples were concentrated and injected into a liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass lc hrms a comprehensive pfas screening workflow was established to analyze the data including suspect screening homologue based non target screening and fragment based non target screening methods the main goals of this study are 1 to identify emerging pfass in chinese wwtps 2 to determine the composition and distribution of legacy and emerging pfass in the 17 wwtps 3 to evaluate the removal efficiency of legacy and emerging pfass and 4 to investigate the relationship between the gross

detailed instrumental information is presented in si 2 4 pfas screening workflow the entire screening workflow is summarized in fig 1 the workflow consists of three parts suspect screening based on suspect list non target screening based on homologue series and non target screening based on diagnostic pfas fragment ions or neutral losses in the suspect screening part five suspect lists were collected including an in house database with 45 reference standards ms ms spectra commercial pfass database from ab sciex with 95 ms ms spectra 594 pfass from us epa comptox chemistry dashboard williams et al 2017 1030 pfass from norman suspect list exchange https www norman network com q node 236 and 3706 pfass from oecd pfas list https zenodo org record 2648776 xw0knvzuiya the suspects were screened using tracefinder 4 1 software thermo fisher usa in the homologue based non target screening part a modified workflow from a previous study was used wang et al 2018 the peaks were selected using compound discover software 3 0 thermo fisher usa from 33 samples and were filtered using cf2 normalized mass defect 0 85 or 0 15 yu et al 2018 the peaks were fed into a matlab script and the pfas homologue series was calculated as shown in fig s2 a consistent elution order and isotope pattern was required in a series in the fragment based non target screening part we directly extracted peaks with diagnostic fragment ions or neutral losses rather using in source fragmentation flagging scans we believe this helps us to identify pfas with no diagnostic fragment ions from suspect or homologue based screening the diagnostic pfas fragment ions and neutral losses were collected from previous studies liu et al 2015 2018a and they were fed into ms ms fragment searcher pane in ms dial software to extract potential pfas peaks with diagnostic ions or neutral losses tsugawa et al 2015 in terms of the potential pfass from the suspect or non target screening a positive hit was selected using tracefinder 4 1 software under 1 s n 5 2 mass error 5 ppm 3 isotopic fit threshold 80 and 4 ms ms spectra interpretation the ms ms spectra were interpreted based on literature database or calculation using xcalibur software thermo fisher usa the ms ms error was set to less than 5 mda in the calculation detailed molecular calculation parameters are presented in si besides the peak area of the identified pfas in the samples should be ten times higher than the procedural blank in source fragmentation and co elution peaks were filtered as some pfass would fragment in ion source trier et al 2011 we checked whether the identified pfas is a fragment ion of other confirmed pfass and whether they had same rt 0 2 min confidence levels were assigned to the identified pfass from level 5 to level 1 based on the approach proposed by schymanski et al 2014 the peak areas of all the identified pfass were calculated using tracefinder 4 1 for further data analysis 2 5 quality control and semi quantification procedural blanks were set in each batch of the analysis and instrumental blanks were injected between the samples to check background response twelve internal standards were used to calibrate the matrix effect the peak areas of the identified pfass were normalized using internal standards with the closest retention time baz lomba et al 2016 the instrumental sensitivity and procedural recovery were tested using pfcas c5 c12 and pfsas c6 c8 the limit of quantification detection in procedural blank and procedural recovery were given in table s4 quantification was performed for pfcas c5 c12 and pfsas c6 c8 using authentic standards considering the lack of standards for many identified pfass they were semi quantified against structurally similar authentic standards as presented in table s4 liu et al 2018a 2 6 classification many of the identified pfass had no homologue thus we used class and subclass to group them for better analysis pfass in a subclass were homologues and there can be one or several structurally similar subclasses in one class 2 7 data analysis correlation analysis was performed between annual gdp of the city in 2018 and pcde of pfass using graphpad prism 5 software the annual gdp data of the 17 cities were collected from the chinese national bureau of statistics http www stats gov cn as listed in table s2 the pcde was calculated as follows 1 pcde μg day 1 people 1 c v o l u m e p o p u l a t i o n where pcde is the per capital daily emissions c is the concentration of pfass ng l 1 in influent volume is the daily service volume of each wwtp m3 day 1 and population is the service population of each wwtp the daily service volume and service population of each wwtp are listed in table s2 the fold change between the influent and effluent was calculated with the internal standard normalized peak area to illustrate the removal efficiency of the identified pfass the fold change value indicates whether the pfass were removed fold change 1 or increased fold change 1 in the wwtp in calculating the fold change the undetected peak area was assigned to half of the minimum detected peak area for each pfas the fold change was not calculated if peaks were not detected in both influent and effluent wang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 method performance in instrument sensitivity the ten legacy pfass can be identified in 5 ng ml using standard solution and eight of them can be identified in 1 ng ml the recovery rate n 3 of the 10 legacy pfass ranged from 69 to 120 table s4 the peak areas of pfcas c5 c12 and pfsa c6 c8 were compared under 50 ng ml fig s3 the peak area of pfos is 19 times higher than that of pfoa perfluorononanoate pfna had the highest peak area in pfcas whereas perfluoropentanoate pfpea had the lowest the peak area of pfna is 2 3 times higher than that of pfpea whereas the peak area of pfos is 1 9 times higher than that of perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs the significant peak area difference in the carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids highlights the importance of semi quantification 3 2 discovery of legacy and emerging pfass overall 89 pfass were identified by suspect and non target screening and 63 of them were identified at level 3 or above among the 89 pfass 51 were identified by suspect screening 47 identified by homologue based non target screening and 65 were identified by fragment based non target screening suspect screening is a convenient tool to identify known pfass but only non target screening can identify unknown pfass in non target screening homologue based screening can identify pfass with several homologues but not applicable to individual pfas fragment based screening can identify pfass with characteristic fragments or neutral losses but cannot identify pfass with no characteristic fragment ion or neutral loss the combination of this two non target screening method could expand the scope of novel pfas identification this study is the first to report on 12 of the 63 identified pfass for the use of non target screening method and eight of them were from newly identified subclasses table 1 the identified 63 pfass were classified into 13 classes and further divided into 25 subclasses the structure confidence level semi quantified concentration and whether or not first report the 63 pfass are listed in table 1 the retention time detection frequency and structural information of the 89 identified pfass are listed in table s5 the ms ms spectra of the identified pfass are shown in figs s4 s25 class pfca and pfsa pfcas c4 c12 and pfsas c4 c8 were identified and confirmed with authentic standards based on the retention time and ms ms spectrum their ms ms spectra are shown in fig s4 class hydro substituted pfca h pfca subclass 3 and subclass 4 were identified in this class subclass 3 c4 c10 has been previously reported in wwtps liu et al 2015 song et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and h pfoa in subclass 3 has been reported as a possible degradation product of pfoa in a soil experiment washington et al 2009 for h pfcas c4 c5 fragment m hf co2 1 21 to 0 72 mda was detected in their spectra which is consistent with previous studies liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 however the ms ms spectrum of h pfca c10 is different from that of previous studies we found no fragment m hf co2 however we found c2hf4 and cnf2n 1 1 16 to 0 59 mda in its spectrum fig s5 this suggests that the h atom is at the β position for c10 h pfca nonetheless we attributed this subclass to level 3 owing to the uncertainty of the h atom subclass 4 was identified using fragment based non target screening in which only one compound c5h4f6o3 was found fragments cf3 c3f5 c3h2of3 1 38 to 0 52 mda were detected in its spectrum fig s6 fragment c3f5 was formed by breaking the c o bond and loss of hf c3h2of3 occurred due to loss of co2 cf2 and hf this subclass has not been previously reported however an unsaturated class with one cc bond was previously identified in a chinese wwtp wang et al 2018 class chlorine substituted pfca cl pfca cl pfcas c4 c9 were identified this class is attributed to level 3 based on the m m 2 3 1 isotopic pattern and the ms ms spectra fig s7 owing to the uncertainty of the cl atom position this class has been identified in wastewater and fish sample in previous studies liu et al 2015 2018a wang et al 2018 class unsaturated pfca upfca subclass 6 c5 c6 and subclass 7 c8 were identified in this class in subclass 6 three main fragments were detected namely c3f3o c4f5 and c5f5o 1 10 to 0 73 mda and matched with that of previous studies fig s8 wang et al 2018 similar to subclass 6 subclass 7 also has two cc bonds fragments c4f5 c5f5o c6f7 and c7f7o 1 1 to 0 17 mda which are distinct fragments in subclass 6 were also detected in subclass 7 fig s9 subclass 7 was formed by adding ch2o to subclass 6 using formula calculation ch2 should be linked to cf2 taking other fragments namely m co2 m co2 hf and m co2 2hf 1 11 to 0 21 mda in subclass 7 ms ms spectra into consideration thus we proposed its structure as presented in table 1 subclass 7 is firstly reported in this study class hydro substituted pfsa h pfsa h pfsas c3 c4 c6 c8 c10 were identified fragments so3 so3f and cnf2n 1 1 33 to 0 09 mda were detected in this class and this is also consistent with results reported in a previous study fig s10 newton et al 2017 class chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate cl pfesa cl pfesa c6 c8 was identified fragments fso2 fso3 and m c2f4so3 1 25 to 0 13 mda were detected in subclass 9 and 6 2 cl pfesa was further confirmed with authentic standards based on the retention time and the ms ms spectrum fig s11 6 2 cl pfesa is a principal component of f 53b a metal plating mist suppressant product used only in china since the 1970s wang et al 2013 6 2 cl pfesa has been detected in water air particle fish human serum and even in polar bear serum samples liu et al 2015 2018a 2018b shi et al 2016 yu et al 2018 however 4 2 cl pfesa was first reported in polar serum samples recently this study is the first to report its occurrence in chinese wastewater liu et al 2018b class hydro substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate h pfesa subclass 10 c3 c6 c8 subclass 11 c3 and subclass 12 c4 c5 were identified fragments so3f m c2f4so3 m c2f4so3 hf and m c2f4so3 hf cf2o 1 41 to 0 25 mda were detected in subclass 10 c4 c6 c8 ms ms spectra figs s12a s12d the ms ms spectrum of 6 2 h pfesa is identical with previous study lin et al 2017 thus subclass 10 c4 c6 c8 was identified at level 2a or 2b however a different fragmentation pathway was observed for subclass 10 c3 fragments hso3 cf3 c2f5o c3f5o c3hf6o and c3f5so4 1 31 to 0 21 mda were detected for c3h2f6so4 considering the occurrence of cf3 and c2f5o the h atom should be at the α position the spectrum and structure of subclass 10 c3 are shown in fig s12e and it was assigned to level 3 in subclass 10 6 2 h pfesa has been reported to be a predominant transformation product of 6 2 cl pfesa lin et al 2017 to our knowledge this study is the first to report other four homologues in subclass 10 subclass 11 c3 is structurally similar to subclass 10 c3 where cf2 is substituted with ch2 fragments so3 so2f and cf3o 1 26 to 0 45 mda suggests the structure of this subclass fig s13 however the position of the h atom cannot be determined in subclass 12 fragments so2f so3f cnf2n 1o and ch3so3 1 32 to 0 53 mda indicate that cnf2n 1o and ch2so3h were at two terminals of these structures fig s14 thus a possible structure was proposed at level 3 class fluorinated telomer sulfonate fts 6 2 fts and 8 2 fts were identified in this class fragments m hf m 2hf and so3 1 29 to 0 14 mda were detected in this class and were further confirmed with authentic standards based on the retention time and the ms ms spectra fig s15 ftss were principal degradation products of fluorotelomer surfactants and were also used as alternatives of pfos in metal plating yu et al 2018 class perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide pfsm five subclasses subclass 14 18 were identified in this class in all six pfass were identified in five subclasses using suspect screening the ms ms spectra were compared with those in previous literature or database the ms ms spectra are shown in figs s16 s20 we only detected short chain perfluorobutane sulfonamide fbsa in subclass 14 and fbsa has been used as an alternatives of pfos in a long term chu et al 2016 subclass 15 and subclass17 have been identified in a river near a manufacturing plant in decatur alabama newton et al 2017 subclass 16 has been identified in fire training ground and subclass 18 has been identified in aqueous film forming foams baduel et al 2017 barzen hanson et al 2017 these sulfonamido substances were always applied to surface treatments paper protectors fire fighting foams mining surfactants etc newton et al 2017 shi et al 2018a class unsaturated perfluoroalkyl alcohol upfa upfas c5 c7 were identified in this class fragments m cf2o cnf2n 1 and cnf2n 1 1 09 to 0 07 mda were detected in this class fig s21 which is consistent with previous study wang et al 2018 class perfluoroalkyl ether alcohol pfea subclasses 20 c3 c5 and subclass 21 c3 were identified in this class fragments m cf2o cnf2n 1 and cnf2n 1o 1 4 to 0 38 mda were detected in subclass 20 loss of cf2o indicates that the alcohol bond is located at the terminal cnf2n 1o reflects the position of the ether bond fig s22 subclass 21 c3 is a hydro substitute of subclass 20 according to the formula c3h2f6o2 and the hf neutral loss in ms ms fig s23 this should be a hydrosubstituted ether alcohol we present the structure in table 1 considering fragment cf3 subclass 21 was assigned to level 3 owing to the uncertainty of the h atom position perfluoroalkyl alcohol unsaturated perfluoroalkyl alcohol and chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl alcohol have been identified in in chinese wastewater wang et al 2018 but this study is the first to report the pfea class in environment samples besides it was found that pfeas could be formed in the degradation of perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids which have been used to substitute pfoa in recent years bentel et al 2020 thus we believed that pfeas were formed by the degradation of other perfluoroalkyl ether substances class p perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate obs obs was identified using suspect screening at level 2a obs has been identified in oilfield and air particles in china and the ms ms spectrum reported in the literature matched that of this study xu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 obs has been widely used as an additive or surfactant in china and had a estimated production of 3500 ton a year in china in 2017 bao et al 2017 structure unknown pfass level 4 or 5 pfass twenty six pfass were identified at level 4 or 5 with unknown structure they were identified from distinctive pfas fragment ions or neutral losses some of their ms ms spectra are shown in fig s25 although fragment cf3 and neutral loss hf were observed in the spectra no specific structure can be proposed based on present information in all we have identified 49 emerging pfass and 14 legacy pfass however there is still very limited information on the sources commercial uses and toxicity for most of the emerging pfass newton et al 2017 wang et al 2018 we can only find toxicity data of 6 2 fts obs 6 2 cl pfesa with lc50 to fish at 108 mg l 25 5 mg l 15 5 mg l respectively while the lc50 of pfos to fish was at 17 mg l as a comparison hoke et al 2015 wang et al 2013 xu et al 2017 it is also found that 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylbetaine had similar lc50 with pfos to zebrafish embryos shi et al 2018a thus more investigation is still needed on the toxicity and risk of identified emerging pfass 3 3 occurrence and composition of pfass in 17 wwtps eighty nine pfass including 14 legacy pfass pfcas and pfsas 49 emerging pfass and 26 structure unknown pfass level 4 or 5 were identified in the 17 wwtps in the 17 wwtp samples investigated the detected pfass ranged from 24 to 72 types as shown in fig 2 a the emerging pfass varied from 9 to 42 types in the wastewater samples whereas the legacy pfass ranged from 5 to 14 types and the structure unknown pfass from 8 to 20 types the number of identified emerging pfass was higher than those of the identified structure unknown and legacy pfass except in heb influent as semiquantification could not be performed on structure unknown pfass the peak area of legacy emerging and and structure unknown pfass were compared in terms of the percentage of the peak area legacy emerging and structure unknown pfass varied significantly in different wwtps the percentages of the peak area of legacy pfass 25 on average and that of emerging pfass 30 on average were similar while the structure unknown pfass had a higher percentage of the peak area 45 on average as the peak area of emerging and structure unknown pfass had higher number of detection and peak area than legacy pfass in most wwtps indicating the importance of unknown pfas identification still more precise measurement is needed for the quantification of structure unknown pfass using other tools such as combustion ion chromatography spaan et al 2020 sixty three pfass were identified above level 3 and divided into 13 classes as described in the previous section they were semi quantified with pfca and pfsa standards the semi quantified concentration composition profiles of 13 pfas classes are shown in fig 2b influent and fig 2c effluent the semi quantified concentration proportion of emerging and legacy pfass varied in the 17 wwtps bj beijing had the highest emerging pfass proportion of approximately 90 whereas xa xian and nb ningbo had the lowest emerging pfass proportion of approximately 15 respectively in both influent and effluent this suggests that the emerging pfass constituted a large proportion of pfass even higher than that of legacy pfass in many wwtps in considering 11 emerging pfas classes h pfca pfsm and h pfesa were predominant in the influent and effluent of the 17 wwtps in all the wwtp influent and effluent samples these three classes make up over 80 of emerging pfass however they cover less than 20 in km kunming influent and approximately 50 in fz fuzhou effluent in the effluent samples the proportion of h pfesa obviously decreased compared with that of influent indicating that this class was removed after treatment processes the obs only had a significantly higher proportion in sjz shijiazhuang influent and effluent indicating its use or manufacture around the sampling site the peak area composition profiles of 13 pfas classes are also shown in fig s27 the sulfonic acid classes had a higher proportion when calculated by the peak area than semi quantified concentration considering that the response factors of sulfonic acid classes is higher than those of carboxylic acid classes it is necessary to normalize the composition profile by standards using the semi quantified method to understand the occurrence of individual pfass two heatmaps of 63 identified pfass were drawn with their semi quantified concentration as shown in fig 2d influent and fig 2e effluent in general the compositions of the 13 classes are similar in influent and effluent as shown in figs 2d and e pfca pfsa and h pfca were widely detected in the wwtps in class pfca pfoa had the highest concentration in all the samples followed by short chain pfba and perfluorohexanoate pfhxa however for classes h pfca and cl pfca short chain c4 c5 had the highest concentration furthermore short chain c4 pfass also dominate in classes pfsas and h pfsas a recent study on legacy pfass in chinese wwtps also revealed that perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs pfoa and pfos were dominant legacy pfass in wastewater pan et al 2016 short chain pfass have been largely produced to substitute legacy pfoa and pfos owing to increasing market demands previous studies reported that short chain pfbs or perfluorobutanoic acid pfba was detected as dominant pfass in surface water and fish lam et al 2016 shi et al 2018b zhou et al 2013 for class cl pfesa a primary component of f 53b 6 2 cl pfesa was dominant and was detected in 94 of the samples eight pfass were identified in class h pfesa seven of them were first reported in this study whereas 6 2 h pfesa was identified as a transformation product of 6 2 cl pfesa in an environmental matrix near a metal plating facility lin et al 2017 6 2 h pfesa was identified in 70 of the samples and its semi quantified concentration was lower than that of 6 2 cl pfesa in all the samples which is consistent with the result reported by a previous study on river samples lin et al 2017 however 2 1 h pfesa had a higher concentration than 6 2 h pfesa in this class and it was detected in 94 of the samples 3 4 spatial distribution and removal of pfass in 17 wwtps the spatial distribution of 13 pfas classes is presented in fig 3 a in the influent samples sh shanghai had the highest semi quantified σpfass concentration of 12 000 ng l followed by fz fuzhou 8600 ng l and qd qingdao 7000 ng l in the effluent samples qd qingdao had the highest semi quantified σpfass concentration of 9100 ng l followed by bj beijing 5400 ng l and nb ningbo 3800 ng l the composition profile differs in the above five high pfass concentration wwtps the qd and bj pfas composition profiles were significantly correlated p 0 01 in both influent and effluent whereas pfcas and h pfcas constitute 70 90 of the pfass the fz and sh influent pfas composition profiles were also significantly correlated p 0 01 whereas pfsm h pfesa h pfca and legacy pfass equally make up most of the pfass however for nb pfca constitutes approximately 80 of the total pfass the lowest pfass concentration was detected in km kunming for both influent 220 ng l and effluent 250 ng l the legacy pfcas and pfsas account for approximately 80 of the σpfass concentration in km influent and effluent gdp value is an economic development indicator and has been found to be related to the pfass concentration in china because more commercial products containing pfass were used in developed area kim and kannan 2007 meng et al 2015 piao et al 2017 xie et al 2013 the correlation between the annual gdp of a city and the pcde of legacy or emerging pfass μg day 1 people 1 was analyzed using equation 1 considering the legacy pfass pfcas and pfsas the correlation between the gdp and pcde of legacy pfass was not significant fig 3b p 0 05 in particular no significant correlation was observed between the gdp and pfoa pfos fig s28 however a positive correlation was observed between the gdp and the pcde of summed emerging pfass fig 3c p 0 01 shanghai and beijing had high emerging pfas pcde 1st and 3rd as most developed cities in china this indicates the wide usage of products containing emerging pfass in the developed area same conclusion can be concluded when we correlated gdp and pfass concentration fig s29 in a previous study of chinese municipal wastewater in 2009 a strong positive correlation was observed between pfoa concentration and gdp value nevertheless we found that the correlations of pfoa concentration and gdp value was not significant in 2019 zhang et al 2013 this should be related with the phase out of legacy pfoa pfos in the past ten years but the substitution of emerging pfass is the new concern the removal of 63 pfass is shown in fig 3d using the fold change between the influent and effluent pfass peak area which was normalized with internal standards to correct for the matrix effect to verify whether the pfas class was removed or increased in the wwtps one sample t test was used to calculate whether the log2 fold change in each class was significantly different from 0 legacy pfcas and pfsas were barely removed by the treatment process with median fold change values of 0 95 and 1 08 respectively the treatment technology used in the studied wwtps mainly includes activated sludge chlorination uv irradiation and conventional sedimentation filtration table s2 and these technologies are incapable of removing legacy pfass rahman et al 2014 granular activated carbon and ion exchange resins are the optimal technologies for removal of pfass but they were not used in all the studied municipal wwtps mccleaf et al 2017 ross et al 2018 the removal of emerging pfass is rarely studied in wwtps xiao 2017 in 11 emerging pfas classes five classes namely h pfesa cl pfca cl pfesa fts and h pfca had fold change values 1 p 0 01 suggesting that these classes could be removed through the treatment process of the wwtps the median fold change values of the above five classes were 0 23 0 33 0 40 0 47 and 0 50 respectively among the five classes class h pfca had similar concentration with legacy pfca table s6 median value of 339 ng l and 437 ng l but h pfcas were removed more than pfcas it could be attributed to the activity of carbon hydrogen bond hori et al 2011 it was also observed that class pfea had an obvious increase in wwtps p 0 01 with a median fold change value of 2 8 this indicates that pfea class may be formed by the degradation of other ether pfass through the treatment process the fold changes of other five emerging pfas classes were not significant especially pfsm had the widest range of fold change because that pfsm had a wide range of structures in its subclasses table 1 the removal efficiency of pfass in different wwtps were also different as is seen in fig 3a the pfass were removed more than a half in sh sjz cc zz heb and cq effluents pfas removal in sjz were mostly from obs and h pfesa class in cc cq and heb mostly from h pfca and h pfesa class in zz mostly from pfsm class in sh from almost all detected pfas classes including legacy and emerging classes table s6 as the treatment technology in sh was similar with other wwtps table s2 more investigation is still needed in sh wwtp besides it is worthy to note that although obs was not significantly removed in fig 3d it has a high removal rate in sjz wwtp this could be related with the extreme high concentration of obs in sjz influent 700 ng l as compared with other influents 3 ng l on average 4 conclusions in this study we identified 63 pfass from 13 pfas classes 25 subclasses above level 3 by screening wastewater samples from 17 cities in china this study is the first to report on 12 of these pfass including four pfeas six h pfesas and two other pfass four of them were new homologues of previously identified class and eight were from newly identified subclasses legacy pfass and emerging pfass were widely detected in the 17 wwtps and emerging pfass had comparable or higher concentrations than legacy pfass in wwtps h pfcas h pfesas and pfsms were the predominant emerging pfass in the wwtps we also found that developed cities such as shanghai and beijing would release more emerging pfass than less developed cities out of the identified pfas classes five classes were removed p 0 01 the highest removal was observed in h pfesas with a median fold change of 0 23 class pfea increased in the wwtps indicating that it may be formed by the degradation of other ether pfass during the treatment process these results urge us to evaluate the risk of emerging pfass to ecosystem and human declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17744,wastewater treatment plant wwtp is one of the major sources of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass to the aquatic environment in this study wastewater samples were collected from 17 wwtps in 17 cities of china to investigate emerging pfass in wwtps to comprehensively identify pfass in the wastewater samples an integrated suspect screening homologue based and fragment based non target screening method is proposed sixty three pfass from 13 classes 25 subclasses were identified including 14 legacy and 49 emerging pfass and this study is the first to report on 12 of these pfass we found that emerging pfass concentration had a significantly positive correlation with the gross domestic product indicating more substitution of legacy pfass in the developed area of china we also analyzed the removal of the 13 pfas classes and found that all discovered pfas classes were not completely removed after the treatment process whereas the class of perfluoroalkyl ether alcohols significantly increased all of these results imply that the release of emerging or unknown pfass from wwtps is a universal but not negligible problem in china graphical abstract image 1 keywords

perfluoroalkyl moiety cnf2n 1 buck et al 2011 pfass have been widely used as surfactants and surface protectors since 1950s but were first reported in the environment in 2001 giesy and kannan 2001 they were then extensively detected in water sludge organism and human serum samples dauchy et al 2017 gao et al 2019 hu et al 2016 langberg et al 2019 yeung et al 2009 the persistence bioaccumulation toxicity and their ubiquity have led to the phase out of legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa worldwide newton et al 2017 from 2001 pfos related products were gradually phased out by the 3m company subsequently pfos related products were added to the stockholm convention in 2009 for their worldwide elimination lam et al 2016 in recent years china has increased its pfass production owing to restriction in the production of pfos pfoa in north american and europe lim et al 2011 xie et al 2013 besides the industry has increased the production of short chain pfass and other replacement chemicals such as genx to substitute for long chain pfoa gebbink et al 2017 gomis et al 2015 there are over 3000 commercial pfass worldwide but less than 2 of these are registered in the reach regulation kemi 2015 most research focused on only well known long chain pfass particularly pfos and pfoa wang et al 2017 previous studies revealed additional unknown pfass in water or blood samples by carrying out total fluorine measurement miyake et al 2007 yeung and mabury 2016 yeung et al 2009 thus to identify unknown pfass in the environment samples is needed high resolution mass spectrum hr ms has been introduced in recent studies to identify novel pfass barzen hanson et al 2017 liu et al 2015 place and field 2012 strynar et al 2015 wang et al 2018 there are essentially three screening strategies for the identification of pfass suspect screening is the most convenient method to identify pfass particularly when the reference ms ms spectra are available liu et al reviewed the pfass identified in recent years and the suspect list including ms and ms ms information was uploaded to the norman suspect list exchange liu et al 2019 non target screening is necessary to identify novel pfass when the suspect list is unavailable and it is divided into homologue based screening and fragment based screening homologue pattern or mass defect can be used to identify pfas homologues considering accurate mass and the elution order in homologues as pfass always occur as homologues cf2 c2f4 cf2o etc gebbink et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the fragment based screening method fluorine fragments such as c2f5 and c2f5o are frequently detected and these fragments can differ in pfass compared with other non fluorine chemicals liu et al used a fragment based in source fragmentation flagging method to identify pfass in wastewater treatment plants wwtps fish and polar bear serum liu et al 2015 2018a 2018b however diagnostic neutral loss such as hf was not considered in the method thus missing some pfass with no diagnostic fragment such as fluorinated telomer sulfonate thus we combined homologue and fragment based methods and considered diagnostic neutral loss in this study wwtps were considered as a major source of pfass to the aquatic environment arvaniti et al 2012 pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however there is still no national survey of occurrence and distribution of emerging pfass in chinese wwtps liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 in the present study municipal influent and effluent samples were collected from 17 cities in china the samples were concentrated and injected into a liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass lc hrms a comprehensive pfas screening workflow was established to analyze the data including suspect screening homologue based non target screening and fragment based non target screening methods the main goals of this study are 1 to identify emerging pfass in chinese wwtps 2 to determine the composition and distribution of legacy and emerging pfass in the 17 wwtps 3 to evaluate the removal efficiency of legacy and emerging pfass and 4 to investigate the relationship between the gross domestic product gdp of the city and the per capita daily emissions pcde of legacy and emerging pfass 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sixteen authentic and 12 internal pfas standards were used

preparation instantaneous influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected in 17 operating municipal wwtps in january 2019 all wwtps received only municipal wastewater from urban areas of the city the overall service population of 17 wwtps is 20 million people which equals to 1 4 of chinese population we confirmed that the wwtps areas had five rain free days prior to sampling wwtps basic information such as treatment technology treatment capacity is summarized in table s2 and their geographical locations are presented in fig s1 the 17 wwtps were located in 17 different provinces and all wwtps were in the capital city of the province except wwtps in ningbo and qingdao and qingdao and nb were also very developed city of the province for the wwtp in lanzhou city only the influent sample was collected a total of 33 samples were collected from the 17 wwtps all samples were stored in the laboratory under 4 c prior to analysis after filtration through glass fiber filters 0 7 μm

detailed instrumental information is presented in si 2 4 pfas screening workflow the entire screening workflow is summarized in fig 1 the workflow consists of three parts suspect screening based on suspect list non target screening based on homologue series and non target screening based on diagnostic pfas fragment ions or neutral losses in the suspect screening part five suspect lists were collected including an in house database with 45 reference standards ms ms spectra commercial pfass database from ab sciex with 95 ms ms spectra 594 pfass from us epa comptox chemistry dashboard williams et al 2017 1030 pfass from norman suspect list exchange https www norman network com q node 236 and 3706 pfass from oecd pfas list https zenodo org record 2648776 xw0knvzuiya the suspects were screened using tracefinder 4 1 software thermo fisher usa in the homologue based non target screening part a modified workflow from a previous study was used wang et al 2018 the peaks were selected using compound discover software 3 0 thermo fisher usa from 33 samples and were filtered using cf2 normalized mass defect 0 85 or 0 15 yu et al 2018 the peaks were fed into a matlab script and the pfas homologue series was calculated as shown in fig s2 a consistent elution order and isotope pattern was required in a series in the fragment based non target screening part we directly extracted peaks with diagnostic fragment ions or neutral losses rather using in source fragmentation flagging scans we believe this helps us to identify pfas with no diagnostic fragment ions from suspect or homologue based screening the diagnostic pfas fragment ions and neutral losses were collected from previous studies liu et al 2015 2018a and they were fed into ms ms fragment searcher pane in ms dial software to extract potential pfas peaks with diagnostic ions or neutral losses tsugawa et al 2015 in terms of the potential pfass from the suspect or non target screening a positive hit was selected using tracefinder 4 1 software under 1 s n 5 2 mass error 5 ppm 3 isotopic fit threshold 80 and 4 ms ms spectra interpretation the ms ms spectra were interpreted based on literature database or calculation using xcalibur software thermo fisher usa the ms ms error was set to less than 5 mda in the calculation detailed molecular calculation parameters are presented in si besides the peak area of the identified pfas in the samples should be ten times higher than the procedural blank in source fragmentation and co elution peaks were filtered as some pfass would fragment in ion source trier et al 2011 we checked whether the identified pfas is a fragment ion of other confirmed pfass and whether they had same rt 0 2 min confidence levels were assigned to the identified pfass from level 5 to level 1 based on the approach proposed by schymanski et al 2014 the peak areas of all the identified pfass were calculated using tracefinder 4 1 for further data analysis 2 5 quality control and semi quantification procedural blanks were set in each batch of the analysis and instrumental blanks were injected between the samples to check background response twelve internal standards were used to calibrate the matrix effect the peak areas of the identified pfass were normalized using internal standards with the closest retention time baz lomba et al 2016 the instrumental sensitivity and procedural recovery were tested using pfcas c5 c12 and pfsas c6 c8 the limit of quantification detection in procedural blank and procedural recovery were given in table s4 quantification was performed for pfcas c5 c12 and pfsas c6 c8 using authentic standards considering the lack of standards for many identified pfass they were semi quantified against structurally similar authentic standards as presented in table s4 liu et al 2018a 2 6 classification many of the identified pfass had no homologue thus we used class and subclass to group them for better analysis pfass in a subclass were homologues and there can be one or several structurally similar subclasses in one class 2 7 data analysis correlation analysis was performed between annual gdp of the city in 2018 and pcde of pfass using graphpad prism 5 software the annual gdp data of the 17 cities were collected from the chinese national bureau of statistics http www stats gov cn as listed in table s2 the pcde was calculated as follows 1 pcde μg day 1 people 1 c v o l u m e p o p u l a t i o n where pcde is the per capital daily emissions c is the concentration of pfass ng l 1 in influent volume is the daily service volume of each wwtp m3 day 1 and population is the service population of each wwtp the daily service volume and service population of each wwtp are listed in table s2 the fold change between the influent and effluent was calculated with the internal standard normalized peak area to illustrate the removal efficiency of the identified pfass the fold change value indicates whether the pfass were removed fold change 1 or increased fold change 1 in the wwtp in calculating the fold change the undetected peak area was assigned to half of the minimum detected peak area for each pfas the fold change was not calculated if peaks were not detected in both influent and effluent wang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 method performance in instrument sensitivity the ten legacy pfass can be identified in 5 ng ml using standard solution and eight of them can be identified in 1 ng ml the recovery rate n 3 of the 10 legacy pfass ranged from 69 to 120 table s4 the peak areas of pfcas c5 c12 and pfsa c6 c8 were compared under 50 ng ml fig s3 the peak area of pfos is 19 times higher than that of pfoa perfluorononanoate pfna had the highest peak area in pfcas whereas perfluoropentanoate pfpea had the lowest the peak area of pfna is 2 3 times higher than that of pfpea whereas the peak area of pfos is 1 9 times higher than that of perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs the significant peak area difference in the carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids highlights the importance of semi quantification 3 2 discovery of legacy and emerging pfass overall 89 pfass were identified by suspect and non target screening and 63 of them were identified at level 3 or above among the 89 pfass 51 were identified by suspect screening 47 identified by homologue based non target screening and 65 were identified by fragment based non target screening suspect screening is a convenient tool to identify known pfass but only non target screening can identify unknown pfass in non target screening homologue based screening can identify pfass with several homologues but not applicable to individual pfas fragment based screening can identify pfass with characteristic fragments or neutral losses but cannot identify pfass with no characteristic fragment ion or neutral loss the combination of this two non target screening method could expand the scope of novel pfas identification this study is the first to report on 12 of the 63 identified pfass for the use of non target screening method and eight of them were from newly identified subclasses table 1 the identified 63 pfass were classified into 13 classes and further divided into 25 subclasses the structure confidence level semi quantified concentration and whether or not first report the 63 pfass are listed in table 1 the retention time detection frequency and structural information of the 89 identified pfass are listed in table s5 the ms ms spectra of the identified pfass are shown in figs s4 s25 class pfca and pfsa pfcas c4 c12 and pfsas c4 c8 were identified and confirmed with authentic standards based on the retention time and ms ms spectrum their ms ms spectra are shown in fig s4 class hydro substituted pfca h pfca subclass 3 and subclass 4 were identified in this class subclass 3 c4 c10 has been previously reported in wwtps liu et al 2015 song et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and h pfoa in subclass 3 has been reported as a possible degradation product of pfoa in a soil experiment washington et al 2009 for h pfcas c4 c5 fragment m hf co2 1 21 to 0 72 mda was detected in their spectra which is consistent with previous studies liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018 however the ms ms spectrum of h pfca c10 is different from that of previous studies we found no fragment m hf co2 however we found c2hf4 and cnf2n 1 1 16 to 0 59 mda in its spectrum fig s5 this suggests that the h atom is at the β position for c10 h pfca nonetheless we attributed this subclass to level 3 owing to the uncertainty of the h atom subclass 4 was identified using fragment based non target screening in which only one compound c5h4f6o3 was found fragments cf3 c3f5 c3h2of3 1 38 to 0 52 mda were detected in its spectrum fig s6 fragment c3f5 was formed by breaking the c o bond and loss of hf c3h2of3 occurred due to loss of co2 cf2 and hf this subclass has not been previously reported however an unsaturated class with one cc bond was previously identified in a chinese wwtp wang et al 2018 class chlorine substituted pfca cl pfca cl pfcas c4 c9 were identified this class is attributed to level 3 based on the m m 2 3 1 isotopic pattern and the ms ms spectra fig s7 owing to the uncertainty of the cl atom position this class has been identified in wastewater and fish sample in previous studies liu et al 2015 2018a wang et al 2018 class unsaturated pfca upfca subclass 6 c5 c6 and subclass 7 c8 were identified in this class in subclass 6 three main fragments were detected namely c3f3o c4f5 and c5f5o 1 10 to 0 73 mda and matched with that of previous studies fig s8 wang et al 2018 similar to subclass 6 subclass 7 also has two cc bonds fragments c4f5 c5f5o c6f7 and c7f7o 1 1 to 0 17 mda which are distinct fragments in subclass 6 were also detected in subclass 7 fig s9 subclass 7 was formed by adding ch2o to subclass 6 using formula calculation ch2 should be linked to cf2 taking other fragments namely m co2 m co2 hf and m co2 2hf 1 11 to 0 21 mda in subclass 7 ms ms spectra into consideration thus we proposed its structure as presented in table 1 subclass 7 is firstly reported in this study class hydro substituted pfsa h pfsa h pfsas c3 c4 c6 c8 c10 were identified fragments so3 so3f and cnf2n 1 1 33 to 0 09 mda were detected in this class and this is also consistent with results reported in a previous study fig s10 newton et al 2017 class chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate cl pfesa cl pfesa c6 c8 was identified fragments fso2 fso3 and m c2f4so3 1 25 to 0 13 mda were detected in subclass 9 and 6 2 cl pfesa was further confirmed with authentic standards based on the retention time and the ms ms spectrum fig s11 6 2 cl pfesa is a principal component of f 53b a metal plating mist suppressant product used only in china since the 1970s wang et al 2013 6 2 cl pfesa has been detected in water air particle fish human serum and even in polar bear serum samples liu et al 2015 2018a 2018b shi et al 2016 yu et al 2018 however 4 2 cl pfesa was first reported in polar serum samples recently this study is the first to report its occurrence in chinese wastewater liu et al 2018b class hydro substituted perfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate h pfesa subclass 10 c3 c6 c8 subclass 11 c3 and subclass 12 c4 c5 were identified fragments so3f m c2f4so3 m c2f4so3 hf and m c2f4so3 hf cf2o 1 41 to 0 25 mda were detected in subclass 10 c4 c6 c8 ms ms spectra figs s12a s12d the ms ms spectrum of 6 2 h pfesa is identical with previous study lin et al 2017 thus subclass 10 c4 c6 c8 was identified at level 2a or 2b however a different fragmentation pathway was observed for subclass 10 c3 fragments hso3 cf3 c2f5o c3f5o c3hf6o and c3f5so4 1 31 to 0 21 mda were detected for c3h2f6so4 considering the occurrence of cf3 and c2f5o the h atom should be at the α position the spectrum and structure of subclass 10 c3 are shown in fig s12e and it was assigned to level 3 in subclass 10 6 2 h pfesa has been reported to be a predominant transformation product of 6 2 cl pfesa lin et al 2017 to our knowledge this study is the first to report other four homologues in subclass 10 subclass 11 c3 is structurally similar to subclass 10 c3 where cf2 is substituted with ch2 fragments so3 so2f and cf3o 1 26 to 0 45 mda suggests the structure of this subclass fig s13 however the position of the h atom cannot be determined in subclass 12 fragments so2f so3f cnf2n 1o and ch3so3 1 32 to 0 53 mda indicate that cnf2n 1o and ch2so3h were at two terminals of these structures fig s14 thus a possible structure was proposed at level 3 class fluorinated telomer sulfonate fts 6 2 fts and 8 2 fts were identified in this class fragments m hf m 2hf and so3 1 29 to 0 14 mda were detected in this class and were further confirmed with authentic standards based on the retention time and the ms ms spectra fig s15 ftss were principal degradation products of fluorotelomer surfactants and were also used as alternatives of pfos in metal plating yu et al 2018 class perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide pfsm five subclasses subclass 14 18 were identified in this class in all six pfass were identified in five subclasses using suspect screening the ms ms spectra were compared with those in previous literature or database the ms ms spectra are shown in figs s16 s20 we only detected short chain perfluorobutane sulfonamide fbsa in subclass 14 and fbsa has been used as an alternatives of pfos in a long term chu et al 2016 subclass 15 and subclass17 have been identified in a river near a manufacturing plant in decatur alabama newton et al 2017 subclass 16 has been identified in fire training ground and subclass 18 has been identified in aqueous film forming foams baduel et al 2017 barzen hanson et al 2017 these sulfonamido substances were always applied to surface treatments paper protectors fire fighting foams mining surfactants etc newton et al 2017 shi et al 2018a class unsaturated perfluoroalkyl alcohol upfa upfas c5 c7 were identified in this class fragments m cf2o cnf2n 1 and cnf2n 1 1 09 to 0 07 mda were detected in this class fig s21 which is consistent with previous study wang et al 2018 class perfluoroalkyl ether alcohol pfea subclasses 20 c3 c5 and subclass 21 c3 were identified in this class fragments m cf2o cnf2n 1 and cnf2n 1o 1 4 to 0 38 mda were detected in subclass 20 loss of cf2o indicates that the alcohol bond is located at the terminal cnf2n 1o reflects the position of the ether bond fig s22 subclass 21 c3 is a hydro substitute of subclass 20 according to the formula c3h2f6o2 and the hf neutral loss in ms ms fig s23 this should be a hydrosubstituted ether alcohol we present the structure in table 1 considering fragment cf3 subclass 21 was assigned to level 3 owing to the uncertainty of the h atom position perfluoroalkyl alcohol unsaturated perfluoroalkyl alcohol and chlorine substituted perfluoroalkyl alcohol have been identified in in chinese wastewater wang et al 2018 but this study is the first to report the pfea class in environment samples besides it was found that pfeas could be formed in the degradation of perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids which have been used to substitute pfoa in recent years bentel et al 2020 thus we believed that pfeas were formed by the degradation of other perfluoroalkyl ether substances class p perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate obs obs was identified using suspect screening at level 2a obs has been identified in oilfield and air particles in china and the ms ms spectrum reported in the literature matched that of this study xu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 obs has been widely used as an additive or surfactant in china and had a estimated production of 3500 ton a year in china in 2017 bao et al 2017 structure unknown pfass level 4 or 5 pfass twenty six pfass were identified at level 4 or 5 with unknown structure they were identified from distinctive pfas fragment ions or neutral losses some of their ms ms spectra are shown in fig s25 although fragment cf3 and neutral loss hf were observed in the spectra no specific structure can be proposed based on present information in all we have identified 49 emerging pfass and 14 legacy pfass however there is still very limited information on the sources commercial uses and toxicity for most of the emerging pfass newton et al 2017 wang et al 2018 we can only find toxicity data of 6 2 fts obs 6 2 cl pfesa with lc50 to fish at 108 mg l 25 5 mg l 15 5 mg l respectively while the lc50 of pfos to fish was at 17 mg l as a comparison hoke et al 2015 wang et al 2013 xu et al 2017 it is also found that 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylbetaine had similar lc50 with pfos to zebrafish embryos shi et al 2018a thus more investigation is still needed on the toxicity and risk of identified emerging pfass 3 3 occurrence and composition of pfass in 17 wwtps eighty nine pfass including 14 legacy pfass pfcas and pfsas 49 emerging pfass and 26 structure unknown pfass level 4 or 5 were identified in the 17 wwtps in the 17 wwtp samples investigated the detected pfass ranged from 24 to 72 types as shown in fig 2 a the emerging pfass varied from 9 to 42 types in the wastewater samples whereas the legacy pfass ranged from 5 to 14 types and the structure unknown pfass from 8 to 20 types the number of identified emerging pfass was higher than those of the identified structure unknown and legacy pfass except in heb influent as semiquantification could not be performed on structure unknown pfass the peak area of legacy emerging and and structure unknown pfass were compared in terms of the percentage of the peak area legacy emerging and structure unknown pfass varied significantly in different wwtps the percentages of the peak area of legacy pfass 25 on average and that of emerging pfass 30 on average were similar while the structure unknown pfass had a higher percentage of the peak area 45 on average as the peak area of emerging and structure unknown pfass had higher number of detection and peak area than legacy pfass in most wwtps indicating the importance of unknown pfas identification still more precise measurement is needed for the quantification of structure unknown pfass using other tools such as combustion ion chromatography spaan et al 2020 sixty three pfass were identified above level 3 and divided into 13 classes as described in the previous section they were semi quantified with pfca and pfsa standards the semi quantified concentration composition profiles of 13 pfas classes are shown in fig 2b influent and fig 2c effluent the semi quantified concentration proportion of emerging and legacy pfass varied in the 17 wwtps bj beijing had the highest emerging pfass proportion of approximately 90 whereas xa xian and nb ningbo had the lowest emerging pfass proportion of approximately 15 respectively in both influent and effluent this suggests that the emerging pfass constituted a large proportion of pfass even higher than that of legacy pfass in many wwtps in considering 11 emerging pfas classes h pfca pfsm and h pfesa were predominant in the influent and effluent of the 17 wwtps in all the wwtp influent and effluent samples these three classes make up over 80 of emerging pfass however they cover less than 20 in km kunming influent and approximately 50 in fz fuzhou effluent in the effluent samples the proportion of h pfesa obviously decreased compared with that of influent indicating that this class was removed after treatment processes the obs only had a significantly higher proportion in sjz shijiazhuang influent and effluent indicating its use or manufacture around the sampling site the peak area composition profiles of 13 pfas classes are also shown in fig s27 the sulfonic acid classes had a higher proportion when calculated by the peak area than semi quantified concentration considering that the response factors of sulfonic acid classes is higher than those of carboxylic acid classes it is necessary to normalize the composition profile by standards using the semi quantified method to understand the occurrence of individual pfass two heatmaps of 63 identified pfass were drawn with their semi quantified concentration as shown in fig 2d influent and fig 2e effluent in general the compositions of the 13 classes are similar in influent and effluent as shown in figs 2d and e pfca pfsa and h pfca were widely detected in the wwtps in class pfca pfoa had the highest concentration in all the samples followed by short chain pfba and perfluorohexanoate pfhxa however for classes h pfca and cl pfca short chain c4 c5 had the highest concentration furthermore short chain c4 pfass also dominate in classes pfsas and h pfsas a recent study on legacy pfass in chinese wwtps also revealed that perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs pfoa and pfos were dominant legacy pfass in wastewater pan et al 2016 short chain pfass have been largely produced to substitute legacy pfoa and pfos owing to increasing market demands previous studies reported that short chain pfbs or perfluorobutanoic acid pfba was detected as dominant pfass in surface water and fish lam et al 2016 shi et al 2018b zhou et al 2013 for class cl pfesa a primary component of f 53b 6 2 cl pfesa was dominant and was detected in 94 of the samples eight pfass were identified in class h pfesa seven of them were first reported in this study whereas 6 2 h pfesa was identified as a transformation product of 6 2 cl pfesa in an environmental matrix near a metal plating facility lin et al 2017 6 2 h pfesa was identified in 70 of the samples and its semi quantified concentration was lower than that of 6 2 cl pfesa in all the samples which is consistent with the result reported by a previous study on river samples lin et al 2017 however 2 1 h pfesa had a higher concentration than 6 2 h pfesa in this class and it was detected in 94 of the samples 3 4 spatial distribution and removal of pfass in 17 wwtps the spatial distribution of 13 pfas classes is presented in fig 3 a in the influent samples sh shanghai had the highest semi quantified σpfass concentration of 12 000 ng l followed by fz fuzhou 8600 ng l and qd qingdao 7000 ng l in the effluent samples qd qingdao had the highest semi quantified σpfass concentration of 9100 ng l followed by bj beijing 5400 ng l and nb ningbo 3800 ng l the composition profile differs in the above five high pfass concentration wwtps the qd and bj pfas composition profiles were significantly correlated p 0 01 in both influent and effluent whereas pfcas and h pfcas constitute 70 90 of the pfass the fz and sh influent pfas composition profiles were also significantly correlated p 0 01 whereas pfsm h pfesa h pfca and legacy pfass equally make up most of the pfass however for nb pfca constitutes approximately 80 of the total pfass the lowest pfass concentration was detected in km kunming for both influent 220 ng l and effluent 250 ng l the legacy pfcas and pfsas account for approximately 80 of the σpfass concentration in km influent and effluent gdp value is an economic development indicator and has been found to be related to the pfass concentration in china because more commercial products containing pfass were used in developed area kim and kannan 2007 meng et al 2015 piao et al 2017 xie et al 2013 the correlation between the annual gdp of a city and the pcde of legacy or emerging pfass μg day 1 people 1 was analyzed using equation 1 considering the legacy pfass pfcas and pfsas the correlation between the gdp and pcde of legacy pfass was not significant fig 3b p 0 05 in particular no significant correlation was observed between the gdp and pfoa pfos fig s28 however a positive correlation was observed between the gdp and the pcde of summed emerging pfass fig 3c p 0 01 shanghai and beijing had high emerging pfas pcde 1st and 3rd as most developed cities in china this indicates the wide usage of products containing emerging pfass in the developed area same conclusion can be concluded when we correlated gdp and pfass concentration fig s29 in a previous study of chinese municipal wastewater in 2009 a strong positive correlation was observed between pfoa concentration and gdp value nevertheless we found that the correlations of pfoa concentration and gdp value was not significant in 2019 zhang et al 2013 this should be related with the phase out of legacy pfoa pfos in the past ten years but the substitution of emerging pfass is the new concern the removal of 63 pfass is shown in fig 3d using the fold change between the influent and effluent pfass peak area which was normalized with internal standards to correct for the matrix effect to verify whether the pfas class was removed or increased in the wwtps one sample t test was used to calculate whether the log2 fold change in each class was significantly different from 0 legacy pfcas and pfsas were barely removed by the treatment process with median fold change values of 0 95 and 1 08 respectively the treatment technology used in the studied wwtps mainly includes activated sludge chlorination uv irradiation and conventional sedimentation filtration table s2 and these technologies are incapable of removing legacy pfass rahman et al 2014 granular activated carbon and ion exchange resins are the optimal technologies for removal of pfass but they were not used in all the studied municipal wwtps mccleaf et al 2017 ross et al 2018 the removal of emerging pfass is rarely studied in wwtps xiao 2017 in 11 emerging pfas classes five classes namely h pfesa cl pfca cl pfesa fts and h pfca had fold change values 1 p 0 01 suggesting that these classes could be removed through the treatment process of the wwtps the median fold change values of the above five classes were 0 23 0 33 0 40 0 47 and 0 50 respectively among the five classes class h pfca had similar concentration with legacy pfca table s6 median value of 339 ng l and 437 ng l but h pfcas were removed more than pfcas it could be attributed to the activity of carbon hydrogen bond hori et al 2011 it was also observed that class pfea had an obvious increase in wwtps p 0 01 with a median fold change value of 2 8 this indicates that pfea class may be formed by the degradation of other ether pfass through the treatment process the fold changes of other five emerging pfas classes were not significant especially pfsm had the widest range of fold change because that pfsm had a wide range of structures in its subclasses table 1 the removal efficiency of pfass in different wwtps were also different as is seen in fig 3a the pfass were removed more than a half in sh sjz cc zz heb and cq effluents pfas removal in sjz were mostly from obs and h pfesa class in cc cq and heb mostly from h pfca and h pfesa class in zz mostly from pfsm class in sh from almost all detected pfas classes including legacy and emerging classes table s6 as the treatment technology in sh was similar with other wwtps table s2 more investigation is still needed in sh wwtp besides it is worthy to note that although obs was not significantly removed in fig 3d it has a high removal rate in sjz wwtp this could be related with the extreme high concentration of obs in sjz influent 700 ng l as compared with other influents 3 ng l on average 4 conclusions in this study we identified 63 pfass from 13 pfas classes 25 subclasses above level 3 by screening wastewater samples from 17 cities in china this study is the first to report on 12 of these pfass including four pfeas six h pfesas and two other pfass four of them were new homologues of previously identified class and eight were from newly identified subclasses legacy pfass and emerging pfass were widely detected in the 17 wwtps and emerging pfass had comparable or higher concentrations than legacy pfass in wwtps h pfcas h pfesas and pfsms were the predominant emerging pfass in the wwtps we also found that developed cities such as shanghai and beijing would release more emerging pfass than less developed cities out of the identified pfas classes five classes were removed p 0 01 the highest removal was observed in h pfesas with a median fold change of 0 23 class pfea increased in the wwtps indicating that it may be formed by the degradation of other ether pfass during the treatment process these results urge us to evaluate the risk of emerging pfass to ecosystem and human declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
