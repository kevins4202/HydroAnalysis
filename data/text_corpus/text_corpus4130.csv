20650,we experimentally investigated the dynamic wake evolution of flow around a square cylinder controlled with steady jet ejecting from the rear stagnation point in a wind tunnel at reynolds number of 1 33 104 for diversified jet momentum coefficients c m modal analyses dynamic vortex shedding process time averaged turbulence kinetic energy tke and reynolds shear stress rss were obtained from high speed particle image velocimetry piv measurements proper orthogonal decomposition pod and dynamic mode decomposition dmd analyses as c m grew it was found that tke distribution was restrained and rss was shifted towards the outlet of the steady jet variations of dominant frequencies in pod and dmd modes were observed the pattern of vortex shedding from the shear layer were transferred from antisymmetric to a symmetric one the vortex sheets were also observed to be elongated downstream in the wake experimental results indicated that the dynamic wake of the square cylinder could be controlled significantly by the steady jet from the rear stagnation point keywords square cylinder active flow control steady jet wake dynamics pod 1 introduction flow around a bluff body such as a circular or square cylinder is a popular circumstance in nature and industrial applications square cylinder is a kind of typical shape in a great number of engineering structures e g offshore structures high rise buildings and pylons of long span suspension bridges derakhshandeh and alam 2019 when the reynolds number re increases up to a critical value the flow transition occurs and the vortex shedding develops in the wake this phenomenon maintains in an extensive range of the reynolds number it is unavoidable that engineering structures will be influenced by the alternating vortices and one of the most important outcome is flow induced structural vibrations choi et al 2008 engineering structures may be damaged by catastrophic wind induced large amplitude imbalances or vibrations davis and moore 1982 therefore adequate and operative control methods are urged upon engineering appliances to alleviate or completely eliminate the negative influences of vortex shedding circular and square cylinders are both typical bluff bodies however they show significantly different flow dynamics when subject to an incoming flow for a circular cylinder attributed to the continuous differentiable aerodynamic profile control methods can be utilized to adjust the boundary layer to suspend the separation of shear layers and suppress the vortex shedding process ozkan et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 whereas for a square cylinder on account of front corners of the wall separation points of the shear layer will be settled on inflexible windward corners qu et al 2017 vickery 1966 experimentally compared a square cylinder with a circular one and found that lift forces of square cylinder are larger and more intensely correlated than that of a circular one particularly the magnitude of root mean square rms coefficient of fluctuating lift forces provoked by the square cylinder is several times larger than that of the circular cylinder many flow control methods have been developed in order to make improvement on flow around bluff bodies specifically speaking to change properties of turbulence fluid transition shear layer separation drag and lift forces and restrain the process of noise production there are several principles to classify flow control methods as concluded in gad el hak 2000 one of the principles is to reflect on whether control locations are near the bluff bodies or not firstly boundary layer characteristics of a bluff body can be adjusted directly such as geometry roughness surface temperature and aperture on the other hand manipulating equipment or materials can also be established in distant locations e g supplements to intermediate shear layer large vortex splitting devices in outer layer blasting shear layer from exterior etc the other principle is to consider whether the energy consumption and control circuit are implicated passive control methods have neither energy expenditure nor control circuit supplemented predetermined active control methods need power input and the control procedure is open loop not feedforward i e without considering the development of flow characteristics relatively interactive flow control can be modified to accommodate to changing flow choi et al 2008 gad el hak 2000 passive flow control methods could be applied to square cylinders darekar and sherwin 2001 numerically investigated a square cylinder with tortuous shaped walls the experimental parameters were wavelength λ and amplitude w it was found that when λ d 5 6 d was the side length of the cylinder the drag coefficient c d and root mean square rms of the total lift coefficient c l decreased with the development of λ d when the extent of waviness i e λ d and w λ exceeded critical values the flow would be entirely stable and von kármán vortex streets terminated igarashi 1997 experimentally investigated flow around a square cylinder with a rod located upstream at re 3 2 104 the distance from the control rod to the cylinder was g the critical gap g c and the diameter of the rod d it was demonstrated that the drag coefficient c d distribution could be curtailed with proper d d and g d kumar et al 2015 experimentally investigated flow around oscillating and stationary square cylinders with various radii r of corners 0 r d 0 5 at re 5200 strouhal numbers st of the oscillating cylinder were slightly higher than those of the stationary one and st of both cases increased from around 0 13 to 0 20 when r d ranged from 0 to 0 5 moreover the introduction of corner radius could restrain the streamwise fluctuating velocity u and drag coefficients c d and elongated vortex formation lengths l f koutmos et al 2004 experimentally studied two dimensional average and turbulent characteristics of flow around a square cylinder with steady jets and the results were also compared with numerical calculation by large eddy simulation les technique the governing parameter in their study was injection ratio ir u bl u where u bl was the jet flow velocity and u the incoming free stream velocity when ir 0 75 the steady jet did not have enough momentum to penetrate into primary vortices in the wake region of the cylinder when ir grew the vortices were penetrated and vortex formation lengths l f were elongated significantly however l f would decrease at much higher ir values because of the splitting effect which could restrain the entrainment capability of the wake formation region akansu and fırat 2010 studied the splitting effect on a square cylinder by experiment at re 8000 distributions of pressure coefficient c p on the front wall of cylinder were insignificant among the baseline case and the others with different ir values notable modification of c p could be observed on the lateral and rear walls of cylinder however control effects would be attenuated when ir exceeded a critical value and it was found that the optimized ir for the modification of c p was equal to 1 68 it can be seen that active control method especially steady jet is commonly used in flow control and it is very useful for the flow control of a square cylinder steady jets may be influenced by the edge effect because of the slot aspect ratio and injection rate of flow however as concluded in amitay and cannelle 2006 the steady jets can be regarded as two dimensional and uniform in the near wake region compared with previous studies the experimental results in the present study are focused on high speed flow visualization results and dynamic modal analysis also the reynolds number is close to practical engineering applications the main objective motivation of the present study is to investigate the dynamic vortex shedding characteristics of the square cylinder controlled with various jet momentum injections 2 test model and experimental setup the experiment was conducted in the closed circuit wind tunnel at the joint laboratory of wind tunnel and wave flume in harbin institute of technology the dimension of the test section was 505 505 mm2 and side walls of the test section were made from transparent polymethyl methacrylate plastics the uniform incoming flow was generated by upstream honeycombs and mesh appurtenances and the corresponding turbulence intensity i u was about 0 30 2 1 the square cylinder test model used in the present study the sketch of the square cylinder test model and x y coordinate system is illustrated in fig 1 a and the model was made of resin the test model was fixed on end plates embedded in the walls of the test section through a steel bar in the central hole of the cylinder the center of the cylinder cross section was the origin of the coordinate system and succeeding analyses were based on normalized coordinates x d in streamwise direction and y d in vertical the cylinder side width d was 50 mm and spanwise length l was 503 mm which were acclimatized to the dimension of test section a slot was designed for the leeward central surface of cylinder the span wise length of the slot was l 0 50 mm and width of e 1 5 mm the center of the slot coincided with the midpoint of cylinder rear surface a cavity was drilled inside the model to allow a draught fan to inject steady jets into the near wake region of flow the installation draft of test model from the streamwise side was showed in fig 1 b and 1 c schematically shows the piv measurements setup for the experiment the effects of blockage ratio β 50 505 9 9 should be considered sharma and eswaran 2004 numerically investigated the influence of solid blockage ratio on a square cylinder at β 10 50 for instantaneous streamlines there was no significant difference between the case with β 10 and the unconfined one though the fluid in the gap between the test section wall and the cylinder surface was accelerated slightly there was no obvious variation in fluid velocity profiles st might have monotonic increase with the development of β however this phenomenon only obviously happened when β was quite larger than 10 as demonstrated in igarashi 1984 the effect of β on st of a square cylinder might be eliminated by introducing the corrected approaching velocity u 1 u 1 β in the experimental investigation of akansu and fırat 2010 with re 8000 and β 9 4 it was concluded that the influence of tunnel blockage on the results was expected to be negligible therefore the effects of blockage ratio are neglected in the present study in addition to the test model mentioned above the natural square cylinder model i e the cylinder without slot and steady jets input was manufactured and investigated in the present study as a baseline case to compare with those controlled cases in the present experimental study the velocity of the incoming free stream u was fixed at 4 m s the corresponding reynolds number in present experiment could be deduced from incoming flow velocity u characteristic length of cylinder d and kinetic viscosity of natural air ν i e re was equal to 1 33 104 the reynolds number effects should be considered as summarized in bai and alam 2018 as the reynolds number increased both the wake width w and mean drag coefficient c d of the square cylinder flow were magnified however these two parameters would be constant when re 1 0 104 the shear layer transition length l t would have a monotone decrease at 1 0 104 re 4 0 104 the strouhal number st was slightly raising at 1000 re 4000 and became steady st 0 134 at re 4000 as concluded in sohankar 2006 sharp edged bluff bodies were unsusceptible to the reynolds number due to the fixed points of separation furthermore after the comparison between time averaged streamlines reynolds shear stress rss and turbulence kinetic energy tke contours at re 3000 and 1 0 106 respectively it was supposed that these time averaged results had a weak re dependency therefore no significant impact of reynolds numbers is considered in the present study 2 2 steady jet configuration a draught fan was used to supply steady jets into cavity of cylinder from external air the fan and cylinder were linked together by a plastic pipe and a flow control valve was affiliated with fan to control the rate of flow to quantify the blowing rate of jet dimensionless jet momentum coefficient is introduced in the present study the jet momentum coefficient is defined as amitay et al 1997 tensi et al 2002 1 c m q b l u b l ρ a i r u 2 s r where q bl is the flow rate of blowing jet i e q bl ρ bl el 0 u bl u bl the blowing velocity ρ air the density of air u the incoming flow velocity 4 m s in the present study and s r the reference area of cylinder rear surface i e s r dl 0 because the blowing jet is same as the flow in wind tunnel i e ρ bl ρ air the definition of c m becomes as follows 2 c m e d u b l u 2 some parameters of each test case are listed in table 1 2 3 piv measurements for flow structure measurement particle image velocimetry piv is a typical quantitative visualization technique this technique consists of tracer particles illumination system a recording camera calibration procedure evaluation and post processing system as shown in fig 1 c the x y velocity components of the flow field could be measured in order to make velocity components measurements tracer particles in the laser sheet must be illuminated twice within a prescribed time interval moving length and time of tracer particles are determined directly in the piv system while the velocity field is obtained ancillarily from the results of the particles to avoid significant interaction between tracer particles and flow and get well performed optical properties the seeding tracer particles should be chosen prudently raffel et al 2018 one major principle about selecting tracer particles is that there is no notable discrepancies between particles and flow in the present study plant oil droplets with mean diameter 1 5 μm were used as tracer particles a nd yag laser machine was adapted by a second harmonic signal from a digital delay generator the time delay of the pulsed laser for flow illumination was fixed at 0 05 ms to meet the requirements of accuracy and identifiability a high speed and resolution charge coupled device ccd camera with a resolving power of 2000 2000 pixels was used to take continuous photos of tracer particles the actual visual field range was 208 208 mm i e 1 mm for every 10 px approximately the visual field is within the ambit of 0 0 x d 4 5 and 2 0 y d 2 0 a thin laser sheet was fixed to the normal plane of the camera sight line at the cylinder midspan by light sheet optics and mirrors in order to avoid laser reflection near the solid wall at the midspan of the cylinder a layer of lusterless paint was smeared around the cylinder surface the sampling frequency was 200 hz and more than 3000 pairs of images of each test cases were captured for analysis in the present study proper orthogonal decomposition pod method and interframe correlation technique were utilized as flow structure analysing approaches sirovich 1987 introduced proper orthogonal decomposition pod by means of snapshots or strobes into the analysis of turbulent coherent structures meyer et al 2007 utilized pod technique to process experimental data from piv to analyse jet velocity fields in the present study this method was applied to the post processing process of piv measurement results the computational window size was 32 32 px and the overlap ratio of adjacent windows was 50 after post processing instantaneous and time averaged velocity vectors were obtained which were u v and u v respectively other experimental results were also deduced from piv measurements spanwise instantaneous vorticity ω z was extracted from instantaneous properties of the flow field turbulence kinetic energy tke 1 2 u 2 v 2 u 2 reynolds stress rss u v and modal analysis results etc were derived from time averaged analysis outcomes 3 experimental results 3 1 dynamic wakes several typical test cases cumulative energy proportion versus first 100 pod modes is illustrated in fig 2 and it can be concluded that the trends of the energy accumulating process among test cases are similar take the baseline for example energy proportions about first four pod modes were 40 2 31 1 2 1 and 1 8 respectively i e first four modal energy occupied most of the total this phenomenon was also applied to the other test cases and in agreement with the conclusion of feng et al 2011 meyer et al 2007 and higham and brevis 2018 accordingly span wise vorticity modal coefficients and corresponding power spectral analysis of first four modes were calculated and compared in this study it should be noted that the results of the first four modes of snapshot pod identify larger physical structures and are two dimensional i e they are independent along with spanwise direction z axis as demonstrated in hilberg et al 1994 with the increase of jet momentum energy proportions of first four pod modes were declining as concluded in feng et al 2011 because of the attenuation of large coherent structures the energy proportions about the first four modes decreased when c m increased oudheusden et al 2005 as well as utilized pod method to analyse energy proportions about a square cylinder at re 1 0 104 in the present study relative energy proportion results of the first four pod modes of the baseline case are compared with those from oudheusden et al 2005 in fig 3 it should be noted that the pod modal energy proportions were calculated from the eigenvalues λ i furthermore the relationship between the first two pod modal coefficients a 1 a 2 and the corresponding eigenvalues was demonstrated in oudheusden et al 2005 that 3 a 1 2 2 λ 1 a 2 2 2 λ 2 1 and this relationship was also established in the present study the results are showed and compared in fig 4 fig 5 shows pod analysis results of baseline case modal vorticity distribution of the first four modes is illustrated in fig 5 a it is significant that results of modes 1 and 2 were symmetric and modes 3 and 4 were antisymmetric as summarized in konstantinidis et al 2007 symmetric distributions pattern of modal vorticity might indicate an antisymmetric vortex shedding process while antisymmetric distributions indicated a symmetric one the phase difference between the first two modes was about π 2 which indicates the formation of von kármán vortices street modes 3 and 4 also had phase difference about π 2 however because of their antisymmetric vorticity distribution von kármán vortices street might be suppressed as concluded in wang et al 2014 characteristics of flow structure might be identified by pod coefficients fig 5 b demonstrates the time history of modal coefficients it could be seen that the magnitudes of modes 1 and 2 were larger than those of modes 3 and 4 and had more significant periodicity furthermore with frequency domain analysis power spectral density psd versus normalized frequency f f f d u of the first four pod modes is shown in fig 5 c the dominant normalized frequencies of modes 1 and 2 were notable both were equal to 0 135 while those of modes 3 and 4 were not significant furthermore the dominant normalized frequency of the first two modes had preferable agreement with the strouhal number st st f v d u f v is the frequency of vortex shedding at re 1 33 104 in present study which was similar to experimental results in okajima 1982 although the first few pod modes occupied most of the energy proportion it can be seen from fig 2 that the general tendency among various test cases was determined by higher modes with the increase in jets input i e developing of jet momentum coefficient c m energy proportions of the first few pod modes were decreased and those of higher modes were increased it is suggested that tke is associated with higher pod modes energy proportion which indicates the development of relatively smaller vortices in wake region higham and brevis 2018 the reconstruction quality such as overall deviation should also be considered hilberg et al 1994 therefore the first 15 pod modes were selected for dynamic vortices and time averaged wakes analyses to reveal the interaction between steady jets and flow fig 6 shows subsequent vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process about baseline case within one period reconstructed by the first 15 pod modes the time interval among these moments was t 4 where t was the time period of vortex shedding evolution it is significant that vortices were stretching and shedding alternatively within one time period and instantaneous vortex shedding relationship was antisymmetric between fig 6 a and c as well as fig 6 b and d the phenomenon about alternating vortex shedding is the foundation of vortex induced vibration viv simiu and yeo 2019 and the principle of present experiment is to restrain it fig 7 shows pod analysis results of the controlled case with jet momentum coefficient c m 0 0134 by comparison between figs 7 a and fig 5 a spatial vorticity distributions of the first three pod modes were reversed while the signs between mode 4 in both cases were similar first four pod modal coefficients were illustrated in fig 7 b and slight decrease compared with the baseline in modes 1 and 2 was observed for power spectrum results as shown in fig 7 c dominant frequencies of modes 1 and 2 were similar to those of the baseline see fig 5 c while modes 3 and 4 had some more relatively dominant frequencies such as f 0 411 hz in mode 4 fig 8 shows the subsequent vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about the controlled case with c m 0 0134 and it can be observed that the general property was similar to that of the baseline because jet momentum was not large enough control effect was not significant however it is observable that a pair of slight jet vortices were injected towards the wake region fig 9 shows pod analysis results of controlled case with c m 0 1200 firstly with regard to fig 9 a significant vortices of steady jets were observed near the rear wall of the cylinder the signs of spatial vortices were generally similar to those of the baseline while the vortices were stretched and elongated to a small extent furthermore as shown in fig 9 b the pod modal coefficients declined more notably for power spectra analysis results more dominant normalized frequencies were found in mode 4 than aforementioned two test cases accordingly it could be assumed that the vortex shedding could be confined by increasing jet momentum fig 10 shows subsequently vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about the controlled case with c m 0 1200 compared with the two cases mentioned above a pair of steady jets vortices was significantly observed and the vortices shedding from the cylinder were broken into smaller ones by jets however the vorticity concentration intensity of wake flow was still larger than that of jets fig 11 shows pod analysis results of controlled case with c m 0 6536 it can be observed considerably in fig 11 a that vorticity values of steady jets were larger than wake flow for the first four pod modes which indicated that characteristics of flow field were globally under control of jets and vortices were stretched and elongated downstream and narrowed transversely in fig 11 b coefficients of modes 1 and 2 declined furtherly for power spectra analysis results as illustrated in fig 11 c it should be noted that there were more dominant normalized frequencies in mode 3 fig 12 shows subsequently vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about controlled case with c m 0 6536 it is noticeable that vorticity concentration intensity of steady jets was more enormous than wake flow which agreed with the comparison above about results of pod modal analysis see fig 11 a because of large magnitude of jet momentum vortices from shear layer were furtherly stretched even broken by steady jets fig 13 shows pod analysis results of the controlled case with c m 1 0800 by comparing fig 13 a with fig 11 a vortices were stretched downstream furtherly vorticity values of steady jets increased to a higher level and the sign of vorticity in mode 4 was reversed as demonstrated in fig 13 b pod modal coefficients were deeply restrained the disparity between different modes had become slight power spectra analysis results are illustrated in fig 13 c it can be observed that there were more dominant normalized frequencies in mode 4 than the other cases fig 14 shows subsequently vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about the controlled case with c m 1 0800 the overall pattern was similar to the result of c m 0 6536 see fig 12 nevertheless the vorticity concentration values of steady jets were larger and the vortices from wake flow were broken to smaller scale ones strouhal numbers versus jet momentum coefficients are demonstrated in fig 15 the average value st was about 0 136 which was similar to the result of okajima 1982 3 2 time averaged wakes there were 2000 pairs of instantaneous pictures used to analysis for time averaged wakes fig 16 shows time averaged characteristics of the wake region of the baseline case the averaged streamlines and tke contour were illustrated in fig 16 a a pair of counter rotating vortices and huge tke values were observed the wake flow of the baseline case tended to be turbulent because of fierce tke values it is observed that there was a strong relationship between tke values and rss distribution as shown in fig 16 a and b when rss reaches its absolute maxima at x d 1 55 tke also rises to a maximum at the same x d position fig 17 shows time averaged streamlines and distribution of tke of controlled cases with various jet momentum coefficients i e c m 0 0134 0 1200 0 6536 and 1 0800 respectively it is noticeable that tke distribution around the cylinder wake region would decrease with the development of jet momentum accordingly the vortex shedding process and nonuniformity of streamlines were restrained fig 18 shows the rss distribution of controlled cases with various jet momentum coefficients c m which were consistent with those in fig 17 as shown in fig 18 a and b when rss reached its absolute maxima at x d 1 70 and 1 85 respectively as well as tke increased to peak values at the same x d positions however for the last two c m values i e c m 0 6536 and 1 0800 the concentrated regions of rss were transferred into the closer position of the rear wall this observation is consistent with the research findings of greco et al 2020 where a circular cylinder wake was controlled by a synthetic jet located in the rear stagnation point both results in greco et al 2020 and this study showed that rss peak values transferred to near wake region and got closer to the symmetry plane in y direction i e the outlet of jets as c m increased simultaneously the distribution of tke was restrained furtherly it also can be observed that the rss peak values were declining with the increase in c m so that the turbulence was held back by the steady jets fig 19 shows profiles of time averaged streamwise velocity u y u with typical c m values at different x d stations as illustrated in fig 19 a significant cusps are existed at the center line y d 0 of the cylinder in the near wake region x d 1 0 at high c m values i e c m 0 6536 and 1 0800 furthermore the undulation of the profile in the y direction becomes more noticeable with the increase of c m as shown in fig 19 a and b in rather remote downstream locations x d 3 0 and 4 0 the difference between the baseline and controlled cases in streamwise velocity profiles is attenuated as shown in fig 19 c and d however fig 19 c illustrates that the difference and fluctuation in u y of studied cases were still noticeable at x d 3 0 lyn et al 1995 experimentally investigated wake characteristics of a square cylinder at re 2 14 104 bosch and rodi 1998 also utilized several turbulence models to numerically simulate vortex shedding properties of the cylinder at re 2 2 104 both of their studies did not have too outrageous reynolds numbers than that in the present study re 1 33 104 fig 20 shows comparisons of streamwise time averaged velocity and turbulence kinetic energy tke distributions on the symmetry plane in y direction y d 0 of the baseline case as shown in fig 20 a the recirculation zone in the present study x d 1 1 is similar to that of the others it can be seen in fig 20 b that distributions of tke in the two studies have similar tendency along the streamwise direction despite the difference between them in tke values and slight drift about extreme points distributions of normalized reynolds stress normalized rss u v u 2 are presented in fig 21 for the baseline case absolute maxima are obvious near y d 0 5 in the near wake region x d 1 0 and 2 0 as shown in fig 21 a and b when c m 0 1200 the control effects were obvious when it shifted downstream the number of the extreme points was declining and fluctuating amplitudes were curtailed the distributions of normalized rss at c m 1 0800 were optimized among the test cases and it was relatively stable at different downstream locations akansu and fırat 2010 experimentally investigated flow around a square cylinder controlled with steady jet from the rear surface at re 8000 it can be seen in fig 22 that streamwise turbulence intensity i u u y u y results in the present study had similar distribution trends with that in akansu and fırat 2010 at x d 2 5 however values of i u in the present study were somewhat larger we supposed that the reason might be the difference in reynolds numbers between the two studies 3 3 linear stability analysis the vortex evolution of flow around a stationary bluff body is associated with the instability of the wake region wang et al 2017 in order to find the occurrence of transition from the laminar flow to turbulence linear stability analysis is normally utilized as a useful method the introduction of time and space varying infinitesimal perturbations into the basic parallel flow is the philosophy of this method huerre and monkewitz 1990 the perturbation stream function is 4 ψ x y t ϕ y e i k x ω t where x is the location in streamline direction y the lateral t time k the complex wave number and ω the complex frequency schlichting and gersten 2017 furthermore the imaginary part of the complex frequency ω i indicates the growth of perturbation wave amplitude versus time i e the perturbation growth rate if ω i is positive the amplitude will be enlarged with the development of time then the flow will be absolutely unstable on the contrary if ω i is negative the perturbation will be eliminated and the flow is stable or convectively unstable huerre and monkewitz 1990 from another point of view the real part of ω presents the growth frequency of the perturbation wave i e ω r 2πf where f is the normalized frequency st schlichting and gersten 2017 the orr sommerfeld equation is the basic method for linear stability analysis about parallel flow based on the dispersion relation of perturbation wave i e δ k ω re 0 the equation can be equivalent to an eigenvalue problem of ω in orr sommerfeld equation huerre and monkewitz 1990 schmid and henningson 2001 orszag 1971 introduced the chebyshev polynomials and qr algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problem of orr sommerfeld equation numerically high precision and convergence speed were obtained through his method consequently the present study employed the method of orszag 1971 as a manner for linear stability analysis as demonstrated in kupfer et al 1987 the critical point ω r0 ω i0 can be recognized by mapping a series of constant k i values i e the imaginary part of wave numbers triantafyllou et al 1987 analysed a circular cylinder wake by linear stability analysis on the basis of the velocity profile at x d 1 0 and this methodology was referred in the present study as illustrated in fig 23 several progressively increasing k i numbers were introduced to present the convergence process of solving orr sommerfeld equation about baseline case at x d 1 0 station the results are drawn in complex ω plane the abscissa is the real part ω r and ordinate is the imaginary part ω i it is significant that the maps reached a critical point with the development of k i because of the positive sign of ω i0 it could be determined that there was absolute instability at x d 1 0 station it should be pointed out that ω r0 2π 0 159 which was in good agreement with the strouhal number st of mode 1 in pod analysis st 0 135 as shown in fig 5 after analysing linear stability of various test cases at different downstream locations the results are shown in fig 24 for baseline case at x d 0 75 i e the near wake region the positive value of ω i was the largest one among all downstream locations which indicated great vortex development rate as shown in figs 16 a and fig 24 it can be observed that the recirculation region of flow was corresponding to the absolute instability region for baseline case about x d 1 3 the variation of c m had non monotonic influence upon the region of absolute instability as shown in fig 24 the absolute instability region became narrower than baseline at c m 0 0134 while the region returned to be extended at c m 0 1200 then the regions were stabilized around a fixed range similar to the baseline case at greater c m values however when c m was equal to 1 0800 the slope of the map in fig 24 was largest which indicated the transition from absolute instability to convective instability of flow was relatively rapid because of high momentum exchange rate between the flow and steady jets 3 4 drag coefficient estimation in order to evaluate control effects on drag force reduction a mean drag coefficient estimation method which based on time averaged integral momentum balance was utilized in the present study bohl and koochesfahani 2009 introduced control volume analysis to estimate the mean drag coefficient 5 c d 2 d h h u y u 1 u y u u 2 y v 2 y u 2 1 2 u 0 u 2 d y where u y is the time averaged velocity profile in the cylinder wake region u 0 the free stream velocity which is slightly dissimilar from u because of the finite dimension of the integration domain h u y and v y the streamwise and transverse fluctuations of flow velocity in the present study h was set as 2 0d i e the interval of integration was 2 0 y d 2 0 according to this estimation equation mean drag coefficients c d of studied cases were calculated to evaluate control effects of steady jets on the square cylinder as illustrated in fig 25 mean drag coefficients c d has a downtrend with the development of jet momentum coefficients c m c d reduces by about 23 and 30 at c m 0 4800 and 1 0800 respectively 3 5 dynamic mode decomposition analysis as demonstrated in schmid 2010 and rowley et al 2009 the dynamic mode decomposition dmd method can be utilized to analyse dynamic characteristics of flow basically dmd technique is based on koopman analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems which has been used to simulate large scale structures in this way some useful dynamic information about the coherent structures of fluid flow could be derived from a given sequence of data i e the snapshots of piv measurements in the present study for dmd analysis the dynamical system mapping matrix is a and its companion matrix is s in order to calculate eigenvalues a similar matrix s is introduced to be a substitute for s after analyses dmd spectrums ritz values λ j and global energy amplitudes φ of each coherence measure modes could be obtained pan et al 2011 fig 26 illustrates the ritz values λ j and modal energy distributions of the baseline case each dot in the figure corresponds to a dmd mode there is a unit circle λ j 1 in the complex plane in fig 26 a and it is noticeable that λ j of all dmd modes were distributed on the circumference it indicates that the global flow process was stable the relationship between φ and corresponding frequency is showed in fig 26 b the normalized frequency is st j f j d u where f j ω j 2π ω j can be derived from log λ j δt where δt is the time interval between adjacent two piv snapshots δt 0 005s in the present study by comparison with the results of pod analysis fig 5 c and linear stability analysis figs 23 fig 26 b shows good agreement with them about dominant frequencies moreover higher dominant frequencies could be obtained by linear combination within the lower frequencies in dmd analysis for instance st 3 0 408 can be derived from the sum of st 1 0 135 and st 2 0 273 it should also be noted that the colormaps of fig 26 a and b are consistent i e fig 26 b concretely shows the energy distributions of dmd modes in fig 26 a dmd analysis results of the controlled case c m 1 0800 are illustrated in fig 27 it can be seen from fig 27 a that λ j of all dmd modes were as well as distributed on the circumference of the unit circle λ j 1 therefore the global flow process was also stable which was same as the baseline case as shown in fig 27 b the dominant normalized frequencies st 1 0 128 st 2 0 260 and st 3 0 375 are consistent with those of pod analyses in fig 13 c moreover the dmd modal energy distribution was significantly different from that of baseline the dominant dmd frequencies of the case with c m 1 0800 were generally lower and energy amplitude corresponding to st 1 was restrained 4 conclusion the characteristics of flow around the square cylinder with steady jets ejecting from the rear stagnation point were experimentally investigated in the present study through wind tunnel tests the variable among test cases was the jet momentum coefficient c m which has positive correlation with momentum exchange rate between the steady jets and wake flow by means of piv technique pod and dmd analysis a number of results were compared in the midst of several typical test cases i e baseline case controlled case for c m 0 0134 0 1200 0 6536 and 1 0800 the contrast among cumulative energy proportion span wise modal vorticity time history of modal coefficients and power spectra analysis for the first four pod modes were completed separately the pod modal energy proportion of test cases revealed that the modification in the cylinder wake the results of the first four pod modes identified larger physical structures with the development of c m the energy proportion of these modes decreased and it indicated that coherent structures were attenuated by the injection of steady jet therefore the vortices near the cylinder could be smashed by the steady jet so that the impact of flow on the square cylinder was curtailed in consideration of the span wise modal vorticity the vorticities from steady jets were becoming significant with the development of jet momentum coefficient in this way the modal vorticity distribution was stretched and elongated in the direction of streamline which indicated that the properties of flow were modified when the jet momentum was increasing the modification of modal coefficients was observed i e the decline in the coefficients of modes 1 and 2 in the case with maximum steady jet injection momentum c m 1 0800 pod modal coefficients of modes 1 and 2 decreased significantly which indicated that the antisymmetric vortex shedding process was restrained notably this judgment could also be demonstrated by the results about power spectra analysis the dominant normalized frequencies for modes 1 and 2 in all test cases were almost constant however more relatively dominant frequencies existed in modes 3 and 4 when c m was growing especially when c m 1 0800 there were a number of considerable frequencies and the difference between the corresponding frequencies in power spectral density became slight the dynamic vortices evolution process within one period was reconstructed by first 15 pod modes it can be demonstrated that with the expansion of jet momentum from steady jets original vortices in the wake region of flow were broken into smaller ones and the vortex shedding pattern was transferred from antisymmetric to symmetric in consequence aerodynamic forces acting on the square cylinder were curtailed the results of time averaged results also demonstrated modifications to the flow tke peak values were declined and the distribution was narrowing with the increase of c m the modification for rss distribution was also observed that absolute maximums were repressed and peak region was transformed towards the rear stagnation point i e the outlet of steady jets linear stability analysis results shown that the near wake region 0 5 x d 1 3 of all test cases was absolutely unstable which could be also demonstrated from the vortices formation in time averaged streamlines the wake flow was becoming convectively unstable and vortex growth rate was decreasing more sharply along with the progress of jet momentum estimated mean drag coefficients c d had a downtrend with the development of jet momentum coefficients c m by comparison with the baseline case the optimized drag reduction was about 30 at c m 1 0800 dmd analyses were similar to those of pod in dominant frequencies i e the normalized frequencies st of dmd and pod modes shifted than the results of baseline it indicated that the vortex shedding process and characteristics of the cylinder wake region were changed by the steady jet to conclude the dynamic wake characteristics of flow around the square cylinder would be modified and disadvantageous action effects could be curtailed with steady jet positioned at the rear stagnation point credit haiyang yu experiment data and

20650,we experimentally investigated the dynamic wake evolution of flow around a square cylinder controlled with steady jet ejecting from the rear stagnation point in a wind tunnel at reynolds number of 1 33 104 for diversified jet momentum coefficients c m modal analyses dynamic vortex shedding process time averaged turbulence kinetic energy tke and reynolds shear stress rss were obtained from high speed particle image velocimetry piv measurements proper orthogonal decomposition pod and dynamic mode decomposition dmd analyses as c m grew it was found that tke distribution was restrained and rss was shifted towards the outlet of the steady jet variations of dominant frequencies in pod and dmd modes were observed the pattern of vortex shedding from the shear layer were transferred from antisymmetric to a symmetric one the vortex sheets were also observed to be elongated downstream in the wake experimental results indicated that the dynamic wake of the square cylinder could be controlled significantly by the steady jet from the rear stagnation point keywords square cylinder active flow control steady jet wake dynamics pod 1 introduction flow around a bluff body such as a circular or square cylinder is a popular circumstance in nature and industrial applications square cylinder is a kind of typical shape in a great number of engineering structures e g offshore structures high rise buildings and pylons of long span suspension bridges derakhshandeh and alam 2019 when the reynolds number re increases up to a critical value the flow transition occurs and the vortex shedding develops in the wake this phenomenon maintains in an extensive range of the reynolds number it is unavoidable that engineering structures will be influenced by the alternating vortices and one of the most important outcome is flow induced structural vibrations choi et al 2008 engineering structures may be damaged by catastrophic wind induced large amplitude imbalances or vibrations davis and moore 1982 therefore adequate and operative control methods are urged upon engineering appliances to alleviate or completely eliminate the negative influences of vortex shedding circular and square cylinders are both typical bluff bodies however they show significantly different flow dynamics when subject to an incoming flow for a circular cylinder attributed to the continuous differentiable aerodynamic profile control methods can be utilized to adjust the boundary layer to suspend the separation of shear layers and suppress the vortex shedding process ozkan et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 whereas for a square cylinder on account of front corners of the wall separation points of the shear layer will be settled on inflexible windward corners qu et al 2017 vickery 1966 experimentally compared a square cylinder with a circular one and found that lift forces of square cylinder are larger and more intensely correlated than that of a circular one particularly the magnitude of root mean square rms coefficient of fluctuating lift forces provoked by the square cylinder is several times larger than that of the circular cylinder many flow control methods have been developed in order to make improvement on flow around bluff bodies specifically speaking to change properties of turbulence fluid transition shear layer separation drag and lift forces and restrain the process of noise production there are several principles to classify flow control methods as concluded in gad el hak 2000 one of the principles is to reflect on whether control locations are near the bluff bodies or not firstly boundary layer characteristics of a bluff body can be adjusted directly such as geometry roughness surface temperature and aperture on the other hand manipulating equipment or materials can also be established in distant locations e g supplements to intermediate shear layer large vortex splitting devices in outer layer blasting shear layer from exterior etc the other principle is to consider whether the energy consumption and control circuit are implicated passive control methods have neither energy expenditure nor control circuit supplemented predetermined active control methods need power input and the control procedure is open loop not feedforward i e without considering the development of flow characteristics relatively interactive flow control can be modified to accommodate to changing flow choi et al 2008 gad el hak 2000 passive flow control methods could be applied to square cylinders darekar and sherwin 2001 numerically investigated a square cylinder with tortuous shaped walls the experimental parameters were wavelength λ and amplitude w it was found that when λ d 5 6 d was the side length of the cylinder the drag coefficient c d and root mean square rms of the total lift coefficient c l decreased with the development of λ d when the extent of waviness i e λ d and w λ exceeded critical values the flow would be entirely stable and von kármán vortex streets terminated igarashi 1997 experimentally investigated flow around a square cylinder with a rod located upstream at re 3 2 104 the distance from the control rod to the cylinder was g the critical gap g c and the diameter of the rod d it was demonstrated that the drag coefficient c d distribution could be curtailed with proper d d and g d kumar et al 2015 experimentally investigated flow around oscillating and stationary square cylinders with various radii r of corners 0 r d 0 5 at re 5200 strouhal numbers st of the oscillating cylinder were slightly higher than those of the stationary one and st of both cases increased from around 0 13 to 0 20 when r d ranged from 0 to 0 5 moreover the introduction of corner radius could restrain the streamwise fluctuating velocity u and drag coefficients c d and elongated vortex formation lengths l f koutmos et al 2004 experimentally studied two dimensional average and turbulent characteristics of flow around a square cylinder with steady jets and the results were also compared with numerical calculation by large eddy simulation les technique the governing parameter in their study was injection ratio ir u bl u where u bl was the jet flow velocity and u the incoming free stream velocity when ir 0 75 the steady jet did not have enough momentum to penetrate into primary vortices in the wake region of the cylinder when ir grew the vortices were penetrated and vortex formation lengths l f were elongated significantly however l f would decrease at much higher ir values because of the splitting effect which could restrain the entrainment capability of the wake formation region akansu and fırat 2010 studied the splitting effect on a square cylinder by experiment at re 8000 distributions of pressure coefficient c p on the front wall of cylinder were insignificant among the baseline case and the others with different ir values notable modification of c p could be observed on the lateral and rear walls of cylinder however control effects would be attenuated when ir exceeded a critical value and it was found that the optimized ir for the modification of c p was equal to 1 68 it can be seen that active control method especially steady jet is commonly used in flow control and it is very useful for the flow control of a square cylinder steady jets may be influenced by the edge effect because of the slot aspect ratio and injection rate of flow however as concluded in amitay and cannelle 2006 the steady jets can be regarded as two dimensional and uniform in the near wake region compared with previous studies the experimental results in the present study are focused on high speed flow visualization results and dynamic modal analysis also the reynolds number is close to practical engineering applications the main objective motivation of the present study is to investigate the dynamic vortex shedding characteristics of the square cylinder controlled with various jet momentum injections 2 test model and experimental setup the experiment was conducted in the closed circuit wind tunnel at the joint laboratory of wind tunnel and wave flume in harbin institute of technology the dimension of the test section was 505 505 mm2 and side walls of the test section were made from transparent polymethyl methacrylate plastics the uniform incoming flow was generated by upstream honeycombs and mesh appurtenances and the corresponding turbulence intensity i u was about 0 30 2 1 the square cylinder test model used in the present study the sketch of the square cylinder test model and x y coordinate system is illustrated in fig 1 a and the model was made of resin the test model was fixed on end plates embedded in the walls of the test section through a steel bar in the central hole of the cylinder the center of the cylinder cross section was the origin of the coordinate system and succeeding analyses were based on normalized coordinates x d in streamwise direction and y d in vertical the cylinder side width d was 50 mm and spanwise length l was 503 mm which were acclimatized to the dimension of test section a slot was designed for the leeward central surface of cylinder the span wise length of the slot was l 0 50 mm and width of e 1 5 mm the center of the slot coincided with the midpoint of cylinder rear surface a cavity was drilled inside the model to allow a draught fan to inject steady jets into the near wake region of flow the installation draft of test model from the streamwise side was showed in fig 1 b and 1 c schematically shows the piv measurements setup for the experiment the effects of blockage ratio β 50 505 9 9 should be considered sharma and eswaran 2004 numerically investigated the influence of solid blockage ratio on a square cylinder at β 10 50 for instantaneous streamlines there was no significant difference between the case with β 10 and the unconfined one though the fluid in the gap between the test section wall and the cylinder surface was accelerated slightly there was no obvious variation in fluid velocity profiles st might have monotonic increase with the development of β however this phenomenon only obviously happened when β was quite larger than 10 as demonstrated in igarashi 1984 the effect of β on st of a square cylinder might be eliminated by introducing the corrected approaching velocity u 1 u 1 β in the experimental investigation of akansu and fırat 2010 with re 8000 and β 9 4 it was concluded that the influence of tunnel blockage on the results was expected to be negligible therefore the effects of blockage ratio are neglected in the present study in addition to the test model mentioned above the natural square cylinder model i e the cylinder without slot and steady jets input was manufactured and investigated in the present study as a baseline case to compare with those controlled cases in the present experimental study the velocity of the incoming free stream u was fixed at 4 m s the corresponding reynolds number in present experiment could be deduced from incoming flow velocity u characteristic length of cylinder d and kinetic viscosity of natural air ν i e re was equal to 1 33 104 the reynolds number effects should be considered as summarized in bai and alam 2018 as the reynolds number increased both the wake width w and mean drag coefficient c d of the square cylinder flow were magnified however these two parameters would be constant when re 1 0 104 the shear layer transition length l t would have a monotone decrease at 1 0 104 re 4 0 104 the strouhal number st was slightly raising at 1000 re 4000 and became steady st 0 134 at re 4000 as concluded in sohankar 2006 sharp edged bluff bodies were unsusceptible to the reynolds number due to the fixed points of separation furthermore after the comparison between time averaged streamlines reynolds shear stress rss and turbulence kinetic energy tke contours at re 3000 and 1 0 106 respectively it was supposed that these time averaged results had a weak re dependency therefore no significant impact of reynolds numbers is considered in the present study 2 2 steady jet configuration a draught fan was used to supply steady jets into cavity of cylinder from external air the fan and cylinder were linked together by a plastic pipe and a flow control valve was affiliated with fan to control the rate of flow to quantify the blowing rate of jet dimensionless jet momentum coefficient is introduced in the present study the jet momentum coefficient is defined as amitay et al 1997 tensi et al 2002 1 c m q b l u b l ρ a i r u 2 s r where q bl is the flow rate of blowing jet i e q bl ρ bl el 0 u bl u bl the blowing velocity ρ air the density of air u the incoming flow velocity 4 m s in the present study and s r the reference area of cylinder rear surface i e s r dl 0 because the blowing jet is same as the flow in wind tunnel i e ρ bl ρ air the definition of c m becomes as follows 2 c m e d u b l u 2 some parameters of each test case are listed in table 1 2 3 piv measurements for flow structure measurement particle image velocimetry piv is a typical quantitative visualization technique this technique consists of tracer particles illumination system a recording camera calibration procedure evaluation and post processing system as shown in fig 1 c the x y velocity components of the flow field could be measured in order to make velocity components measurements tracer particles in the laser sheet must be illuminated twice within a prescribed time interval moving length and time of tracer particles are determined directly in the piv system while the velocity field is obtained ancillarily from the results of the particles to avoid significant interaction between tracer particles and flow and get well performed optical properties the seeding tracer particles should be chosen prudently raffel et al 2018 one major principle about selecting tracer particles is that there is no notable discrepancies between particles and flow in the present study plant oil droplets with mean diameter 1 5 μm were used as tracer particles a nd yag laser machine was adapted by a second harmonic signal from a digital delay generator the time delay of the pulsed laser for flow illumination was fixed at 0 05 ms to meet the requirements of accuracy and identifiability a high speed and resolution charge coupled device ccd camera with a resolving power of 2000 2000 pixels was used to take continuous photos of tracer particles the actual visual field range was 208 208 mm i e 1 mm for every 10 px approximately the visual field is within the ambit of 0 0 x d 4 5 and 2 0 y d 2 0 a thin laser sheet was fixed to the normal plane of the camera sight line at the cylinder midspan by light sheet optics and mirrors in order to avoid laser reflection near the solid wall at the midspan of the cylinder a layer of lusterless paint was smeared around the cylinder surface the sampling frequency was 200 hz and more than 3000 pairs of images of each test cases were captured for analysis in the present study proper orthogonal decomposition pod method and interframe correlation technique were utilized as flow structure analysing approaches sirovich 1987 introduced proper orthogonal decomposition pod by means of snapshots or strobes into the analysis of turbulent coherent structures meyer et al 2007 utilized pod technique to process experimental data from piv to analyse jet velocity fields in the present study this method was applied to the post processing process of piv measurement results the computational window size was 32 32 px and the overlap ratio of adjacent windows was 50 after post processing instantaneous and time averaged velocity vectors were obtained which were u v and u v respectively other experimental results were also deduced from piv measurements spanwise instantaneous vorticity ω z was extracted from instantaneous properties of the flow field turbulence kinetic energy tke 1 2 u 2 v 2 u 2 reynolds stress rss u v and modal analysis results etc were derived from time averaged analysis outcomes 3 experimental results 3 1 dynamic wakes several typical test cases cumulative energy proportion versus first 100 pod modes is illustrated in fig 2 and it can be concluded that the trends of the energy accumulating process among test cases are similar take the baseline for example energy proportions about first four pod modes were 40 2 31 1 2 1 and 1 8 respectively i e first four modal energy occupied most of the total this phenomenon was also applied to the other test cases and in agreement with the conclusion of feng et al 2011 meyer et al 2007 and higham and brevis 2018 accordingly span wise vorticity modal coefficients and corresponding power spectral analysis of first four modes were calculated and compared in this study it should be noted that the results of the first four modes of snapshot pod identify larger physical structures and are two dimensional i e they are independent along with spanwise direction z axis as demonstrated in hilberg et al 1994 with the increase of jet momentum energy proportions of first four pod modes were declining as concluded in feng et al 2011 because of the attenuation of large coherent structures the energy proportions about the first four modes decreased when c m increased oudheusden et al 2005 as well as utilized pod method to analyse energy proportions about a square cylinder at re 1 0 104 in the present study relative energy proportion results of the first four pod modes of the baseline case are compared with those from oudheusden et al 2005 in fig 3 it should be noted that the pod modal energy proportions were calculated from the eigenvalues λ i furthermore the relationship between the first two pod modal coefficients a 1 a 2 and the corresponding eigenvalues was demonstrated in oudheusden et al 2005 that 3 a 1 2 2 λ 1 a 2 2 2 λ 2 1 and this relationship was also established in the present study the results are showed and compared in fig 4 fig 5 shows pod analysis results of baseline case modal vorticity distribution of the first four modes is illustrated in fig 5 a it is significant that results of modes 1 and 2 were symmetric and modes 3 and 4 were antisymmetric as summarized in konstantinidis et al 2007 symmetric distributions pattern of modal vorticity might indicate an antisymmetric vortex shedding process while antisymmetric distributions indicated a symmetric one the phase difference between the first two modes was about π 2 which indicates the formation of von kármán vortices street modes 3 and 4 also had phase difference about π 2 however because of their antisymmetric vorticity distribution von kármán vortices street might be suppressed as concluded in wang et al 2014 characteristics of flow structure might be identified by pod coefficients fig 5 b demonstrates the time history of modal coefficients it could be seen that the magnitudes of modes 1 and 2 were larger than those of modes 3 and 4 and had more significant periodicity furthermore with frequency domain analysis power spectral density psd versus normalized frequency f f f d u of the first four pod modes is shown in fig 5 c the dominant normalized frequencies of modes 1 and 2 were notable both were equal to 0 135 while those of modes 3 and 4 were not significant furthermore the dominant normalized frequency of the first two modes had preferable agreement with the strouhal number st st f v d u f v is the frequency of vortex shedding at re 1 33 104 in present study which was similar to experimental results in okajima 1982 although the first few pod modes occupied most of the energy proportion it can be seen from fig 2 that the general tendency among various test cases was determined by higher modes with the increase in jets input i e developing of jet momentum coefficient c m energy proportions of the first few pod modes were decreased and those of higher modes were increased it is suggested that tke is associated with higher pod modes energy proportion which indicates the development of relatively smaller vortices in wake region higham and brevis 2018 the reconstruction quality such as overall deviation should also be considered hilberg et al 1994 therefore the first 15 pod modes were selected for dynamic vortices and time averaged wakes analyses to reveal the interaction between steady jets and flow fig 6 shows subsequent vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process about baseline case within one period reconstructed by the first 15 pod modes the time interval among these moments was t 4 where t was the time period of vortex shedding evolution it is significant that vortices were stretching and shedding alternatively within one time period and instantaneous vortex shedding relationship was antisymmetric between fig 6 a and c as well as fig 6 b and d the phenomenon about alternating vortex shedding is the foundation of vortex induced vibration viv simiu and yeo 2019 and the principle of present experiment is to restrain it fig 7 shows pod analysis results of the controlled case with jet momentum coefficient c m 0 0134 by comparison between figs 7 a and fig 5 a spatial vorticity distributions of the first three pod modes were reversed while the signs between mode 4 in both cases were similar first four pod modal coefficients were illustrated in fig 7 b and slight decrease compared with the baseline in modes 1 and 2 was observed for power spectrum results as shown in fig 7 c dominant frequencies of modes 1 and 2 were similar to those of the baseline see fig 5 c while modes 3 and 4 had some more relatively dominant frequencies such as f 0 411 hz in mode 4 fig 8 shows the subsequent vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about the controlled case with c m 0 0134 and it can be observed that the general property was similar to that of the baseline because jet momentum was not large enough control effect was not significant however it is observable that a pair of slight jet vortices were injected towards the wake region fig 9 shows pod analysis results of controlled case with c m 0 1200 firstly with regard to fig 9 a significant vortices of steady jets were observed near the rear wall of the cylinder the signs of spatial vortices were generally similar to those of the baseline while the vortices were stretched and elongated to a small extent furthermore as shown in fig 9 b the pod modal coefficients declined more notably for power spectra analysis results more dominant normalized frequencies were found in mode 4 than aforementioned two test cases accordingly it could be assumed that the vortex shedding could be confined by increasing jet momentum fig 10 shows subsequently vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about the controlled case with c m 0 1200 compared with the two cases mentioned above a pair of steady jets vortices was significantly observed and the vortices shedding from the cylinder were broken into smaller ones by jets however the vorticity concentration intensity of wake flow was still larger than that of jets fig 11 shows pod analysis results of controlled case with c m 0 6536 it can be observed considerably in fig 11 a that vorticity values of steady jets were larger than wake flow for the first four pod modes which indicated that characteristics of flow field were globally under control of jets and vortices were stretched and elongated downstream and narrowed transversely in fig 11 b coefficients of modes 1 and 2 declined furtherly for power spectra analysis results as illustrated in fig 11 c it should be noted that there were more dominant normalized frequencies in mode 3 fig 12 shows subsequently vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about controlled case with c m 0 6536 it is noticeable that vorticity concentration intensity of steady jets was more enormous than wake flow which agreed with the comparison above about results of pod modal analysis see fig 11 a because of large magnitude of jet momentum vortices from shear layer were furtherly stretched even broken by steady jets fig 13 shows pod analysis results of the controlled case with c m 1 0800 by comparing fig 13 a with fig 11 a vortices were stretched downstream furtherly vorticity values of steady jets increased to a higher level and the sign of vorticity in mode 4 was reversed as demonstrated in fig 13 b pod modal coefficients were deeply restrained the disparity between different modes had become slight power spectra analysis results are illustrated in fig 13 c it can be observed that there were more dominant normalized frequencies in mode 4 than the other cases fig 14 shows subsequently vorticity development of dynamic vortices shedding process within one period about the controlled case with c m 1 0800 the overall pattern was similar to the result of c m 0 6536 see fig 12 nevertheless the vorticity concentration values of steady jets were larger and the vortices from wake flow were broken to smaller scale ones strouhal numbers versus jet momentum coefficients are demonstrated in fig 15 the average value st was about 0 136 which was similar to the result of okajima 1982 3 2 time averaged wakes there were 2000 pairs of instantaneous pictures used to analysis for time averaged wakes fig 16 shows time averaged characteristics of the wake region of the baseline case the averaged streamlines and tke contour were illustrated in fig 16 a a pair of counter rotating vortices and huge tke values were observed the wake flow of the baseline case tended to be turbulent because of fierce tke values it is observed that there was a strong relationship between tke values and rss distribution as shown in fig 16 a and b when rss reaches its absolute maxima at x d 1 55 tke also rises to a maximum at the same x d position fig 17 shows time averaged streamlines and distribution of tke of controlled cases with various jet momentum coefficients i e c m 0 0134 0 1200 0 6536 and 1 0800 respectively it is noticeable that tke distribution around the cylinder wake region would decrease with the development of jet momentum accordingly the vortex shedding process and nonuniformity of streamlines were restrained fig 18 shows the rss distribution of controlled cases with various jet momentum coefficients c m which were consistent with those in fig 17 as shown in fig 18 a and b when rss reached its absolute maxima at x d 1 70 and 1 85 respectively as well as tke increased to peak values at the same x d positions however for the last two c m values i e c m 0 6536 and 1 0800 the concentrated regions of rss were transferred into the closer position of the rear wall this observation is consistent with the research findings of greco et al 2020 where a circular cylinder wake was controlled by a synthetic jet located in the rear stagnation point both results in greco et al 2020 and this study showed that rss peak values transferred to near wake region and got closer to the symmetry plane in y direction i e the outlet of jets as c m increased simultaneously the distribution of tke was restrained furtherly it also can be observed that the rss peak values were declining with the increase in c m so that the turbulence was held back by the steady jets fig 19 shows profiles of time averaged streamwise velocity u y u with typical c m values at different x d stations as illustrated in fig 19 a significant cusps are existed at the center line y d 0 of the cylinder in the near wake region x d 1 0 at high c m values i e c m 0 6536 and 1 0800 furthermore the undulation of the profile in the y direction becomes more noticeable with the increase of c m as shown in fig 19 a and b in rather remote downstream locations x d 3 0 and 4 0 the difference between the baseline and controlled cases in streamwise velocity profiles is attenuated as shown in fig 19 c and d however fig 19 c illustrates that the difference and fluctuation in u y of studied cases were still noticeable at x d 3 0 lyn et al 1995 experimentally investigated wake characteristics of a square cylinder at re 2 14 104 bosch and rodi 1998 also utilized several turbulence models to numerically simulate vortex shedding properties of the cylinder at re 2 2 104 both of their studies did not have too outrageous reynolds numbers than that in the present study re 1 33 104 fig 20 shows comparisons of streamwise time averaged velocity and turbulence kinetic energy tke distributions on the symmetry plane in y direction y d 0 of the baseline case as shown in fig 20 a the recirculation zone in the present study x d 1 1 is similar to that of the others it can be seen in fig 20 b that distributions of tke in the two studies have similar tendency along the streamwise direction despite the difference between them in tke values and slight drift about extreme points distributions of normalized reynolds stress normalized rss u v u 2 are presented in fig 21 for the baseline case absolute maxima are obvious near y d 0 5 in the near wake region x d 1 0 and 2 0 as shown in fig 21 a and b when c m 0 1200 the control effects were obvious when it shifted downstream the number of the extreme points was declining and fluctuating amplitudes were curtailed the distributions of normalized rss at c m 1 0800 were optimized among the test cases and it was relatively stable at different downstream locations akansu and fırat 2010 experimentally investigated flow around a square cylinder controlled with steady jet from the rear surface at re 8000 it can be seen in fig 22 that streamwise turbulence intensity i u u y u y results in the present study had similar distribution trends with that in akansu and fırat 2010 at x d 2 5 however values of i u in the present study were somewhat larger we supposed that the reason might be the difference in reynolds numbers between the two studies 3 3 linear stability analysis the vortex evolution of flow around a stationary bluff body is associated with the instability of the wake region wang et al 2017 in order to find the occurrence of transition from the laminar flow to turbulence linear stability analysis is normally utilized as a useful method the introduction of time and space varying infinitesimal perturbations into the basic parallel flow is the philosophy of this method huerre and monkewitz 1990 the perturbation stream function is 4 ψ x y t ϕ y e i k x ω t where x is the location in streamline direction y the lateral t time k the complex wave number and ω the complex frequency schlichting and gersten 2017 furthermore the imaginary part of the complex frequency ω i indicates the growth of perturbation wave amplitude versus time i e the perturbation growth rate if ω i is positive the amplitude will be enlarged with the development of time then the flow will be absolutely unstable on the contrary if ω i is negative the perturbation will be eliminated and the flow is stable or convectively unstable huerre and monkewitz 1990 from another point of view the real part of ω presents the growth frequency of the perturbation wave i e ω r 2πf where f is the normalized frequency st schlichting and gersten 2017 the orr sommerfeld equation is the basic method for linear stability analysis about parallel flow based on the dispersion relation of perturbation wave i e δ k ω re 0 the equation can be equivalent to an eigenvalue problem of ω in orr sommerfeld equation huerre and monkewitz 1990 schmid and henningson 2001 orszag 1971 introduced the chebyshev polynomials and qr algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problem of orr sommerfeld equation numerically high precision and convergence speed were obtained through his method consequently the present study employed the method of orszag 1971 as a manner for linear stability analysis as demonstrated in kupfer et al 1987 the critical point ω r0 ω i0 can be recognized by mapping a series of constant k i values i e the imaginary part of wave numbers triantafyllou et al 1987 analysed a circular cylinder wake by linear stability analysis on the basis of the velocity profile at x d 1 0 and this methodology was referred in the present study as illustrated in fig 23 several progressively increasing k i numbers were introduced to present the convergence process of solving orr sommerfeld equation about baseline case at x d 1 0 station the results are drawn in complex ω plane the abscissa is the real part ω r and ordinate is the imaginary part ω i it is significant that the maps reached a critical point with the development of k i because of the positive sign of ω i0 it could be determined that there was absolute instability at x d 1 0 station it should be pointed out that ω r0 2π 0 159 which was in good agreement with the strouhal number st of mode 1 in pod analysis st 0 135 as shown in fig 5 after analysing linear stability of various test cases at different downstream locations the results are shown in fig 24 for baseline case at x d 0 75 i e the near wake region the positive value of ω i was the largest one among all downstream locations which indicated great vortex development rate as shown in figs 16 a and fig 24 it can be observed that the recirculation region of flow was corresponding to the absolute instability region for baseline case about x d 1 3 the variation of c m had non monotonic influence upon the region of absolute instability as shown in fig 24 the absolute instability region became narrower than baseline at c m 0 0134 while the region returned to be extended at c m 0 1200 then the regions were stabilized around a fixed range similar to the baseline case at greater c m values however when c m was equal to 1 0800 the slope of the map in fig 24 was largest which indicated the transition from absolute instability to convective instability of flow was relatively rapid because of high momentum exchange rate between the flow and steady jets 3 4 drag coefficient estimation in order to evaluate control effects on drag force reduction a mean drag coefficient estimation method which based on time averaged integral momentum balance was utilized in the present study bohl and koochesfahani 2009 introduced control volume analysis to estimate the mean drag coefficient 5 c d 2 d h h u y u 1 u y u u 2 y v 2 y u 2 1 2 u 0 u 2 d y where u y is the time averaged velocity profile in the cylinder wake region u 0 the free stream velocity which is slightly dissimilar from u because of the finite dimension of the integration domain h u y and v y the streamwise and transverse fluctuations of flow velocity in the present study h was set as 2 0d i e the interval of integration was 2 0 y d 2 0 according to this estimation equation mean drag coefficients c d of studied cases were calculated to evaluate control effects of steady jets on the square cylinder as illustrated in fig 25 mean drag coefficients c d has a downtrend with the development of jet momentum coefficients c m c d reduces by about 23 and 30 at c m 0 4800 and 1 0800 respectively 3 5 dynamic mode decomposition analysis as demonstrated in schmid 2010 and rowley et al 2009 the dynamic mode decomposition dmd method can be utilized to analyse dynamic characteristics of flow basically dmd technique is based on koopman analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems which has been used to simulate large scale structures in this way some useful dynamic information about the coherent structures of fluid flow could be derived from a given sequence of data i e the snapshots of piv measurements in the present study for dmd analysis the dynamical system mapping matrix is a and its companion matrix is s in order to calculate eigenvalues a similar matrix s is introduced to be a substitute for s after analyses dmd spectrums ritz values λ j and global energy amplitudes φ of each coherence measure modes could be obtained pan et al 2011 fig 26 illustrates the ritz values λ j and modal energy distributions of the baseline case each dot in the figure corresponds to a dmd mode there is a unit circle λ j 1 in the complex plane in fig 26 a and it is noticeable that λ j of all dmd modes were distributed on the circumference it indicates that the global flow process was stable the relationship between φ and corresponding frequency is showed in fig 26 b the normalized frequency is st j f j d u where f j ω j 2π ω j can be derived from log λ j δt where δt is the time interval between adjacent two piv snapshots δt 0 005s in the present study by comparison with the results of pod analysis fig 5 c and linear stability analysis figs 23 fig 26 b shows good agreement with them about dominant frequencies moreover higher dominant frequencies could be obtained by linear combination within the lower frequencies in dmd analysis for instance st 3 0 408 can be derived from the sum of st 1 0 135 and st 2 0 273 it should also be noted that the colormaps of fig 26 a and b are consistent i e fig 26 b concretely shows the energy distributions of dmd modes in fig 26 a dmd analysis results of the controlled case c m 1 0800 are illustrated in fig 27 it can be seen from fig 27 a that λ j of all dmd modes were as well as distributed on the circumference of the unit circle λ j 1 therefore the global flow process was also stable which was same as the baseline case as shown in fig 27 b the dominant normalized frequencies st 1 0 128 st 2 0 260 and st 3 0 375 are consistent with those of pod analyses in fig 13 c moreover the dmd modal energy distribution was significantly different from that of baseline the dominant dmd frequencies of the case with c m 1 0800 were generally lower and energy amplitude corresponding to st 1 was restrained 4 conclusion the characteristics of flow around the square cylinder with steady jets ejecting from the rear stagnation point were experimentally investigated in the present study through wind tunnel tests the variable among test cases was the jet momentum coefficient c m which has positive correlation with momentum exchange rate between the steady jets and wake flow by means of piv technique pod and dmd analysis a number of results were compared in the midst of several typical test cases i e baseline case controlled case for c m 0 0134 0 1200 0 6536 and 1 0800 the contrast among cumulative energy proportion span wise modal vorticity time history of modal coefficients and power spectra analysis for the first four pod modes were completed separately the pod modal energy proportion of test cases revealed that the modification in the cylinder wake the results of the first four pod modes identified larger physical structures with the development of c m the energy proportion of these modes decreased and it indicated that coherent structures were attenuated by the injection of steady jet therefore the vortices near the cylinder could be smashed by the steady jet so that the impact of flow on the square cylinder was curtailed in consideration of the span wise modal vorticity the vorticities from steady jets were becoming significant with the development of jet momentum coefficient in this way the modal vorticity distribution was stretched and elongated in the direction of streamline which indicated that the properties of flow were modified when the jet momentum was increasing the modification of modal coefficients was observed i e the decline in the coefficients of modes 1 and 2 in the case with maximum steady jet injection momentum c m 1 0800 pod modal coefficients of modes 1 and 2 decreased significantly which indicated that the antisymmetric vortex shedding process was restrained notably this judgment could also be demonstrated by the results about power spectra analysis the dominant normalized frequencies for modes 1 and 2 in all test cases were almost constant however more relatively dominant frequencies existed in modes 3 and 4 when c m was growing especially when c m 1 0800 there were a number of considerable frequencies and the difference between the corresponding frequencies in power spectral density became slight the dynamic vortices evolution process within one period was reconstructed by first 15 pod modes it can be demonstrated that with the expansion of jet momentum from steady jets original vortices in the wake region of flow were broken into smaller ones and the vortex shedding pattern was transferred from antisymmetric to symmetric in consequence aerodynamic forces acting on the square cylinder were curtailed the results of time averaged results also demonstrated modifications to the flow tke peak values were declined and the distribution was narrowing with the increase of c m the modification for rss distribution was also observed that absolute maximums were repressed and peak region was transformed towards the rear stagnation point i e the outlet of steady jets linear stability analysis results shown that the near wake region 0 5 x d 1 3 of all test cases was absolutely unstable which could be also demonstrated from the vortices formation in time averaged streamlines the wake flow was becoming convectively unstable and vortex growth rate was decreasing more sharply along with the progress of jet momentum estimated mean drag coefficients c d had a downtrend with the development of jet momentum coefficients c m by comparison with the baseline case the optimized drag reduction was about 30 at c m 1 0800 dmd analyses were similar to those of pod in dominant frequencies i e the normalized frequencies st of dmd and pod modes shifted than the results of baseline it indicated that the vortex shedding process and characteristics of the cylinder wake region were changed by the steady jet to conclude the dynamic wake characteristics of flow around the square cylinder would be modified and disadvantageous action effects could be curtailed with steady jet positioned at the rear stagnation point credit haiyang yu experiment data and

20651,there is a strong gap flow exists between the pump rotor tip and the inside of the duct of the pump jet propulsor to predict the hydrodynamic performance of a pump jet propulsor more accurately considering the influence of fluid viscosity in the gap area a gap flow model suitable for a pump jet propulsor is proposed through an analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor it is determined that it is optimal for the gap height to be 0 98 1 0 times of the complete gap height additionally it is verified that the flux coefficient c q range of 0 8 0 84 which can accurately simulate the energy loss of the fluid at the gap flow is reasonable moreover through a comparative analysis of the hydrodynamic performance pressure and circulation distribution of the pump jet propulsor it is found that when the influence of the gap flow model is considered the wall pressure and circulation distribution of the rotor blade and duct are more consistent with the calculation results of viscous flow in addition the introduction of the gap flow model only improves the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor keywords pump jet

propellers with stator ducts for example hughes et al 1991 and kawakita et al 1998 constructed a numerical model of the propeller and the corresponding wake vortex model by using the lifting surface vortex lattice method and the surface panel method respectively however there exists a gap between the rotor and the duct and the gap size is usually 1 3 of the rotor tip radius the flow in the small gap area is a real viscous flow pan et al 2013 wang tao et al 2004 fu jian et al 2016 shi yao et al 2014 lu l et al 2016a b wei j et al 2016 the use of the potential flow assumption causes the load at the tip of the rotor to be close to zero which is not in line with the actual situation because of the compact layout of the pump jet propulsor the influence of the gap flow is not only limited to the tip of the rotor gerard p et al 1997 baltazar et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 you et al 2007 su y et al 1999 but even leads to changes in the flow field of the entire system based on the above limitations a variable parameter analysis of the pump duct was conducted chao wang et al 2020 and the value range of the pump duct parameters was determined this laid the foundation for the design of the pump duct on this basis a tip leakage vortex model for simulating the gap leakage vortex of the pump jet thruster was established by using the panel method kaiqiang wang et al 2019 this model has been successfully applied to the prediction of the hydrodynamic performance of pump jets the leakage vortex model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of pump jet propulsors in particular the calculation results under a low advance speed coefficient are highly consistent with those of viscous flow however the influence of the tip leakage vortex model on the viscosity of the gap flow is not adequately addressed therefore on the basis of the existing leakage vortex model at the tip of the pump jet thruster a gap flow model is proposed considering the viscous effect of the gap flow the two piece grid extension method is adopted to expand the influence range of the gap flow model the calculation results of the panel method and computational fluid dynamics cfd are compared and analysed and the influence of the gap flow model on the prediction of the pump hydrodynamic performance is discussed 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical model of pump jet propulsor the theoretical method adopted in this study is a low order panel method based on velocity potential the discrete element of the object surface is a hyperbolic surface element and the singularities arranged on the surface are the mixed distribution of the source sink and dipole the numerical model of the pump jet propulsor can be established by using the basic equation for solving the lifting body problem and the gap flow model is included in the original model the specific numerical calculation model of the pump jet propulsor can be found elsewhere kaiqiang wang et al 2019 the model is shown in fig 1 2 2 gap flow model because of the viscous action of the boundary layer on the end face of the rotor and the inner wall of the duct the fluid velocity in the gap region attenuates thereby varying the load distribution of the blade tip and affecting the circulation distribution of the blade as a whole the permeable sheet method established by mchugh et al 1997 approximates the viscous fluid passing through the gap region as an inviscid fluid attenuating through a row of holes it regards the hole as a surface element with a closed gap and assumes that the surface element has a normal velocity that is the fluid can pass through the interstitial surface element according to the orifice flow equation the flux c q of the gap surface element can be expressed as a linear function of the pressure difference between the tip of the blade pressure surface and suction surface the equation is as follows 1 q c q a 2 δ p ρ where c q is the flux coefficient 0 c q 1 and when c q 0 the surface element is impermeable the value obtained by mchugh is 0 84 according to the experimental study of a ducted propeller a represents the area of the gap unit combined with the bernoulli equation the average penetration velocity v g a p through the interstitial unit can be obtained from the flux equation given in equation hughes and kinnas 1991 2 v g a p q a c q 2 δ p ρ c q v i n δ c p 3 δ c p δ p 0 5 ρ v i n 2 where v i n is the relative inlet velocity and δ c p is the dimensionless coefficient of the pressure jump δ p to satisfy the basic equation of the panel method the gap surface element is connected to the inner wall of the duct as a radial extension of the blade tip element as illustrated in fig 2 according to the assumption that the interstitial surface element is permeable combined with the infiltration velocity equation given in equation kawakita and hoshino 1998 and the moving boundary condition the source point strength of the interstitial surface element can be expressed as follows 4 φ n v i n n c q v i n δ c p n n c a m b e r where n is the panel vector and n c a m b e r is the normal vector of the middle surface element at the same chord position the pressure coefficient δ c p is obtained by an iterative process in the initial solution the gap surface element adopts the impenetrable wall condition formula in equation pan et al 2013 and the approximate initial solution of δ c p is obtained 3 method validation in regard to the verification of the numerical method of the pump jet propulsor the cfd numerical method has been verified kaiqiang wang et al 2019 the calculation results indicate that the cfd method has high accuracy and reliability in the numerical simulation of the propeller with a stator duct gu et al 2016 and can be used to calculate the open water performance of the pump jet propulsor and verify the potential flow method reference kaiqiang wang et al 2019 further demonstrated that the potential flow theory can accurately predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor additionally it verified the rationality of the tip leakage vortex model based on the above research the calculation results of the gap model in this study were compared and analysed and the rationality of the gap flow model was verified 3 1 numerical calculation model the pump jet propulsor model selected is the rear stator pump jet propulsor as depicted in fig 3 the model consists of 11 rotor blades and nine stator blades the maximum rotor diameter d r is 0 238 m and the rotational speed n is 2000 rpm the minimum gap between the top of the rotor and the duct is 3 mm 3 2 gap flow model feasibility analysis to analyse the influence of the gap flow model of the rear stator pump jet propulsor the calculation results of the gap flow model and non gap flow model were compared and analysed additionally the influence of the gap flow model on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet rotor stator and duct was analysed it has been verified in previous work kaiqiang wang et al 2019 that the panel method and cfd can accurately predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor model on this basis the calculation results of the gap flow model and cfd were compared to analyse the feasibility of the gap flow model in this study fig 4 depicts the thrust and torque curve of the rotor the calculation results depicted in fig 4 indicate that the introduction of the gap flow model increases the thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor as a whole and those of the rotor stator and duct individually this trend is still stable in the overall variation range the changing trend of the hydrodynamic performance of the flow model with and without a gap is consistent additionally with the introduction of the gap model the thrust and torque of the rotor stator and duct of the pump jet propulsor are closer to the calculation results of viscous flow the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of the whole pump and its various components is improved however the figure also shows that the gap model can only improve the hydrodynamic performance prediction of the entire pump jet propulsor and its components the above results show that the thrust of the pump jet rotor accounts for more than 75 of the total thrust indicating that the main thrust of the pump jet propulsor is generated by the rotor moreover the total torque of the pump jet propulsor is close to 0 implying that the stator balances the torque of the pump jet propulsor well so that the aircraft does not roll this is consistent with the conclusion obtained by cfd based on viscous flow liu et al 2010 fig 5 illustrates the efficiency curve of the pump jet propulsor the calculation results in the diagram indicate that the difference in the efficiency curve between the flow model with and without a gap becomes increasingly smaller with the increase in speed this is because when the incoming flow is low the flow at the gap is more intense and the effect of fluid viscosity is more significant therefore the efficiency increases significantly after the introduction of the gap flow model which is also in line with the theoretical results the change trend of the efficiency curve of the gap flow model is basically the same with the same highest efficiency point indicating that the introduction of the gap model is reasonable the calculation results of the hydrodynamic performance and efficiency curves of the pump jet propulsor indicate that the construction of the gap flow model is reasonable and feasible and can be used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor 4 analysis of calculation results of flux coefficient and pressure circulation the effect of the gap flow model is affected by two factors selection of the gap height and selection of the flux coefficient to compare and analyse more accurately the influence of the gap model on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor the selection of the height and flux coefficient of the gap model is analysed and discussed then the calculation results of the flow model with and without a gap are examined 4 1 influence of different gap heights to further analyse the influence of the gap flow model the selection of the gap height was analysed the calculation results under advance speed coefficients of 1 94 and 2 59 were selected the gap heights were 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 9 0 92 0 95 and 0 98 times of the complete gap height the above selection was calculated and analysed fig 6 depicts the calculation results under different gap heights with the increase of gap height the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the rotor and stator increase gradually but the increasing trend tends to be smooth the overall variation range fluctuates slightly the calculation results indicate that the change in gap height has little effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the stator and rotor blades the calculation results depicted in fig 7 indicate that the thrust coefficient of the duct increases gradually with the increase of gap height particularly when the gap height is greater than 0 98 this implies that the duct thrust is more sensitive to the change in the range of 0 98 1 times of the gap height as seen in fig 4 the complete gap height is used for the calculation and the calculated results are consistent with those of the viscous flow the result was found to be more accurate when the selected gap height was greater than 0 98 additionally the above two figures show that when the height of the gap flow model exceeds 0 98 only the thrust of the duct changes whereas the rotor and stator maintain a stable trend however the change in the thrust is considerably small therefore the gap flow model has little influence on the macro force of the pump jet propulsor and a stronger effect is reflected through its influence on the duct fig 8 depicts the pressure distribution of the rotor blade at a radius of 0 98 at different gap heights it indicates that the gap flow model only affects the pressure distribution on the blade surface the pressure on the back of the blade remains almost unchanged and the increase in pressure on the blade surface increases the differential pressure on the blade surface which is more consistent with the pressure distribution on the blade surface with the increase of gap height the pressure on the blade surface increases gradually when the gap height is more than 0 9 times of the complete gap height the pressure distribution on the blade surface remains almost unchanged in the range of 0 4 0 7 times of the chord length in the chord direction the selection range of the gap height can be further reduced to 0 9 1 0 times of the complete gap height however from the pressure change at the tangential position of 0 2 0 4 when the gap height is greater than 0 98 the pressure distribution remains almost unchanged indicating that the calculation results are nearly convergent when the gap height is greater than 0 98 fig 9 depicts the radial circulation distribution of the rotor blades under different gap heights the calculation results indicate that with the increase of gap height the circulation of the rotor blades gradually increases from the root to the tip of the blade when the gap height is greater than 0 9 times of the complete gap height the overall calculation of the rotor blade changes slightly when the gap height increases to 0 98 times of the complete gap height the circulation distribution of the rotor blade remains almost unchanged indicating that the calculation results tend to be stable when the gap height is greater than 0 98 times of the complete gap height the analysis results depicted in figs 7 and 8 are further verified and the calculated results converge when the gap height is greater than 0 98 times of the complete gap height additionally the calculation results in the figure show that the variation in the calculation value of the rotor blade at the tip of the rotor blade is the largest indicating that the influence range of the gap flow model is reflected more at the tip of the rotor blade and has little influence on the performance of the rotor blade root and the overall performance of the pump jet propulsor the introduction of the gap flow model has improved the overall rotor circulation this is because the introduction of the gap flow model makes the influencing factors of fluid viscous dissipation in the gap area considered there is dipole strength in the gap area so that the circulation at the tip of the rotor no longer tends to zero this is more in line with the working conditions of the pump jet propulsor in the actual fluid 4 2 influence of different flux coefficients the gap flow model interferes with the adjacent surface elements by dipoles and source points arranged on the surface and the intensity of the source points depends on the flux coefficient c q as shown in equation wang and zhou 2004 therefore the magnitude of the flux coefficient determines the degree of disturbance to the surrounding flow field of the gap flow model c q 0 indicates that the gap band is an impenetrable wall c q 1 indicates that there is no energy loss in the flow through the gap region and 0 c q 1 indicates that there is energy loss in the gap flow the complete gap height is used for calculation figs 10 and 11 depict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor based on different flux coefficients under the same advance speed coefficient the empirical value provided by mchugh according to the experimental study of the ducted propeller is 0 84 however there are differences in the structure and working conditions between the pump jet propulsor and the traditional ducted propeller whether the flux coefficient is reasonable is worthy of further discussion in view of the above doubtful points the value range of the flux coefficient was expanded in this study and the values of the flux coefficient selected were 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 84 and 0 9 which are suitable for the calculation model from the change trend of the overall hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor when the flux coefficient c q is in the range of 0 0 4 the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor fluctuates slightly with changes in the flux coefficient however the trend is not obvious when c q 0 4 the change trend of the hydrodynamic performance of the various components of the pump jet propulsor is increasing in particular the thrust change of the entire pump jet propulsor is more significant the preliminary results indicate that when 0 4 c q 1 its influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor is more obvious in addition with the increase of the advance speed the resistance of the duct continues to increase so that the overall thrust coefficient of the pump jet propulsor continues to decrease for further analyse the influence of the flux coefficient based on the above calculation results the selection range of the flux coefficient was reduced to 0 4 0 9 figs 12 and 13 depict the calculation results in which the flux coefficient is 0 4 0 9 under different advance speed coefficients the calculation results show that the thrust and torque coefficients of the rotor decrease gradually with the increase in the flux coefficient under a low advance speed when the flux coefficient changes from 0 6 to 0 7 the difference between the thrust and torque coefficient of the rotor increases immediately additionally when c q 0 7 the amplitude of the rotor thrust and torque affected by the flux coefficient is small and when the flux coefficient is 0 9 the variation amplitude of the rotor thrust coefficient tends to become larger the calculation results indicate that under a low advance speed when the flux coefficient is in the range of 0 7 0 84 its effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump is more significant when the pump jet propulsor is in the medium and high speed conditions the thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor increase with the increase in the flux coefficient and there is a minimum difference between the thrust and torque when the flux coefficient is selected in the range of 0 7 0 84 it is further proved that when the flux coefficient is selected in the range of 0 7 0 84 the effect of flux coefficient on the pump jet propulsor is closer to the dissipation of real fluid the above calculation results also show that when the advance speed increases the variation range of the difference between the thrust and torque of the rotor with the flux coefficient becomes increasingly small because as the advance speed increases the thickness of the fluid viscous boundary layer at the gap decreases and the effect of fluid viscosity becomes less significant the calculation results of different c q under j 3 24 and j 1 94 operating conditions are selected and the blade profile pressure coefficient of the rotor is intercepted at r r 0 98 as shown in fig 14 the results show that increasing the flux coefficient increases the pressure value of the blade surface as a whole increases the pressure value of the back of the blade near the leading edge and decreases the pressure value near the trailing edge as a result the pressure jump of the rotor in the range of 0 2 s c 1 is more obvious additionally the pressure distribution of the rotor profile shows that the pressure variation amplitude of the rotor profile decreases when the flux coefficient is between 0 8 and 0 84 when c q changes from 0 84 to 0 9 the amplitude of the pressure coefficient increases again the above calculation results indicate that when the flux coefficient is 0 8 0 84 the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor is most significantly affected by the flux coefficient change fig 15 depicts the pressure distribution of the section of the duct at θ 20 under the condition of the advance speed coefficient j 3 24 the calculation results in the figure show that the pressure distribution on the surface of the duct is not sensitive to changes in c q only the interface element between the inner surface of the duct and the gap flow model is affected however there is a fluctuation in the pressure of the duct section at the s c 0 5 this situation only in the case of flux coefficients c q 0 8 and 0 84 the results show that when the flux coefficient changes in the range of 0 8 0 84 it is the most sensitive which is consistent with the conclusions drawn in the previous sections fig 16 includes the circulation distribution of the gap flow model and the gap free model with different flux coefficients by comparison it is found that the change in the flux coefficient has little influence on the prediction results of the overall performance of the rotor however in comparison with the results of the gap free model the introduction of the gap flow model has a greater global impact on the rotor circulation the circulation value in each radial direction increases obviously indicating that the introduction of the gap flow model increases the prediction results of the rotor thrust and torque the empirical coefficient proposed by mchugh is the gap flow model established by the lift surface method and the recommended value is 0 84 however according to the above calculation results it is more suitable for the gap flow model established by the surface panel element method when it is in the range of 0 8 0 84 verification and analysis demonstrated that the range of 0 8 0 84 which is more reasonable and feasible can truly reflect the energy loss at the gap flow 4 3 pressure and circulation distribution to analyse the influence of the gap flow model the calculation results under the working conditions of j 1 94 and j 3 24 were selected for comparative analysis the flux coefficient c q was selected as 0 84 and the gap height was selected as the complete gap height the calculation results are shown below fig 17 depicts the radial circulation distribution of the rotor the introduction of the gap flow model increases the circulation value of the rotor at the tip of the blade indicating that the work range of the blade along the radial direction increases and the thrust and torque of the rotor gradually increase this is more in line with the work law of the flat top blade additionally the calculation results show that when the advance speed coefficient is low the change in the circulation quantity at the tip of the blade considering the effect of gap flow is more obvious this is because the lower the advance speed the smaller the reynolds number and the more severe the viscous effect of the fluid at the gap at the top of the rotor the gap flow model considers the influence of the viscosity at the gap making the potential flow calculation results more consistent with the real flow state of the fluid figs 18 and 19 depict the pressure distribution of the rotor blade profile under different advance speed coefficients and the pressure distributions at the 0 6 and 0 8 radius sections respectively the calculation results in the figure show that the introduction of the gap flow model increases the pressure on the blade surface and back of the rotor in the chord direction the overall pressure change trend of the blade surface and back still tends to be smooth and the differential pressure between the blade surface and the back of the blade remains almost unchanged the above calculation results indicate that the introduction of the gap model increases the pressure on the blade surface and increases the shear force of the fluid particles on the blade surface thus increasing the torque of the rotor this explains the increase in torque described in section 2 2 however the figure shows that the introduction of the gap flow model only increases the surface pressure at the low radius of the rotor blade and there is no significant change in the differential pressure and the pressure at the trailing edge the results indicate that the effect of the gap flow model on the low radius of the rotor blade is limited for further analyse the influence of the gap flow model on the top of the rotor and the tip of the rotor blade the pressure distributions at 0 98 and 0 88 radius were compared with the results of the cfd calculation fig 20 depicts the pressure distribution of the rotor profile the pressure distribution in the figure shows that the introduction of the gap flow model makes the pressure distribution of the rotor profile change significantly under the same advance speed coefficient the gap flow model obviously increases the differential pressure between the rotor blade and the back of the rotor this is because in the real fluid when the fluid flows through the gap area at the top of the rotor it is affected by the boundary layer at the top of the rotor and the inner wall boundary layer of the duct that is the viscosity of the fluid is affected however this factor is not considered in the potential flow the differential pressure between the blade surface and the back of the blade is almost zero which is unreasonable the introduction of the gap flow model compensates for this shortcoming in the potential flow making the calculation results of the pressure difference between the blade surface and the back of the blade more consistent with those of the viscous flow this explains the increase in the thrust of the rotor blade discussed in section 2 2 moreover the pressure near the tip of the blade increases gradually this is closer to the calculated result of the viscous flow the above results indicate that compared with the gap free flow model the introduction of the gap flow model has a greater influence on the rotor near the blade tip fig 21 depicts the tangential pressure distribution of the duct section the calculation results indicate that the gap flow model has little effect on the outer wall of the duct however it does affect the inner wall of the duct when the advance speed is low in particular the gap flow between the top of the rotor and the inner wall of the duct is more intense for example in the case of an advance speed coefficient of 1 94 according to the normal flow phenomenon when the fluid flows between the top end of the rotor and the inner wall surface of the duct the flow rate of the fluid increases and the pressure decreases and when the fluid flows through the gap region between the rotor and the inner wall surface of the duct the flow rate begins to decrease and the pressure on the inner wall surface of the duct begins to rise again because of the existence of the gap flow the pressure on the inner wall of the duct decreases at the tangential direction of 0 25 0 4 however in the potential flow calculation the pressure distribution on the inner wall of the duct tends to be smooth and there is no significant pressure change the introduction of the gap model makes the calculation results of the potential flow closer to that of the viscous flow 5 conclusions considering the pump jet propulsor as the research object a gap flow model considering the influence of the rotor tip gap flow was developed based on the potential flow theory and the optimal height range of the gap model was presented the flux coefficient c q was calculated and analysed and the value range was determined through a comparative study of the calculation results of the flow model with and without the gap and the calculation results of cfd the influence of the gap model on the hydrodynamic performance prediction of the pump was analysed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the verification calculation and analysis of the gap flow model indicated that the change trends of the hydrodynamic performance in the two models with and without the gap flow model were the same and the calculation results between them were in good agreement additionally it was verified that the gap flow model proposed was reasonable and feasible 2 based on the analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the entire pump and the pressure and circulation distribution of the rotor blade the selection range of the gap height was determined when the gap flow model height was within the range of 0 98 1 0 times the complete gap height the calculated value of the gap model converged 3 in previous calculations c q was usually selected based on past experience the calculation and analysis of the selection of the flux coefficient indicated that the flux coefficient selection range of 0 8 0 84 was reasonable and could truly reflect the energy attenuation at the gap flow of the pump jet propulsor 4 the gap flow model accurately simulates the energy loss of the fluid at the top gap of the pump jet propulsor rotor and fully considers the influence of fluid viscosity at the gap flow moreover it truly reflects the circulation and pressure distribution of the rotor blade as well as the pressure differential force distribution between the blade surface and back of the blade 5 the gap flow model improves the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of each part of the pump jet propulsor and as a whole however the improvement effect is limited the influence of the gap flow model is reflected more in the consideration of the viscosity at the gap flow making the calculation result of the potential flow closer to the flow state of the real fluid credit authorship

20651,there is a strong gap flow exists between the pump rotor tip and the inside of the duct of the pump jet propulsor to predict the hydrodynamic performance of a pump jet propulsor more accurately considering the influence of fluid viscosity in the gap area a gap flow model suitable for a pump jet propulsor is proposed through an analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor it is determined that it is optimal for the gap height to be 0 98 1 0 times of the complete gap height additionally it is verified that the flux coefficient c q range of 0 8 0 84 which can accurately simulate the energy loss of the fluid at the gap flow is reasonable moreover through a comparative analysis of the hydrodynamic performance pressure and circulation distribution of the pump jet propulsor it is found that when the influence of the gap flow model is considered the wall pressure and circulation distribution of the rotor blade and duct are more consistent with the calculation results of viscous flow in addition the introduction of the gap flow model only improves the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor keywords pump jet

propellers with stator ducts for example hughes et al 1991 and kawakita et al 1998 constructed a numerical model of the propeller and the corresponding wake vortex model by using the lifting surface vortex lattice method and the surface panel method respectively however there exists a gap between the rotor and the duct and the gap size is usually 1 3 of the rotor tip radius the flow in the small gap area is a real viscous flow pan et al 2013 wang tao et al 2004 fu jian et al 2016 shi yao et al 2014 lu l et al 2016a b wei j et al 2016 the use of the potential flow assumption causes the load at the tip of the rotor to be close to zero which is not in line with the actual situation because of the compact layout of the pump jet propulsor the influence of the gap flow is not only limited to the tip of the rotor gerard p et al 1997 baltazar et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 you et al 2007 su y et al 1999 but even leads to changes in the flow field of the entire system based on the above limitations a variable parameter analysis of the pump duct was conducted chao wang et al 2020 and the value range of the pump duct parameters was determined this laid the foundation for the design of the pump duct on this basis a tip leakage vortex model for simulating the gap leakage vortex of the pump jet thruster was established by using the panel method kaiqiang wang et al 2019 this model has been successfully applied to the prediction of the hydrodynamic performance of pump jets the leakage vortex model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of pump jet propulsors in particular the calculation results under a low advance speed coefficient are highly consistent with those of viscous flow however the influence of the tip leakage vortex model on the viscosity of the gap flow is not adequately addressed therefore on the basis of the existing leakage vortex model at the tip of the pump jet thruster a gap flow model is proposed considering the viscous effect of the gap flow the two piece grid extension method is adopted to expand the influence range of the gap flow model the calculation results of the panel method and computational fluid dynamics cfd are compared and analysed and the influence of the gap flow model on the prediction of the pump hydrodynamic performance is discussed 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical model of pump jet propulsor the theoretical method adopted in this study is a low order panel method based on velocity potential the discrete element of the object surface is a hyperbolic surface element and the singularities arranged on the surface are the mixed distribution of the source sink and dipole the numerical model of the pump jet propulsor can be established by using the basic equation for solving the lifting body problem and the gap flow model is included in the original model the specific numerical calculation model of the pump jet propulsor can be found elsewhere kaiqiang wang et al 2019 the model is shown in fig 1 2 2 gap flow model because of the viscous action of the boundary layer on the end face of the rotor and the inner wall of the duct the fluid velocity in the gap region attenuates thereby varying the load distribution of the blade tip and affecting the circulation distribution of the blade as a whole the permeable sheet method established by mchugh et al 1997 approximates the viscous fluid passing through the gap region as an inviscid fluid attenuating through a row of holes it regards the hole as a surface element with a closed gap and assumes that the surface element has a normal velocity that is the fluid can pass through the interstitial surface element according to the orifice flow equation the flux c q of the gap surface element can be expressed as a linear function of the pressure difference between the tip of the blade pressure surface and suction surface the equation is as follows 1 q c q a 2 δ p ρ where c q is the flux coefficient 0 c q 1 and when c q 0 the surface element is impermeable the value obtained by mchugh is 0 84 according to the experimental study of a ducted propeller a represents the area of the gap unit combined with the bernoulli equation the average penetration velocity v g a p through the interstitial unit can be obtained from the flux equation given in equation hughes and kinnas 1991 2 v g a p q a c q 2 δ p ρ c q v i n δ c p 3 δ c p δ p 0 5 ρ v i n 2 where v i n is the relative inlet velocity and δ c p is the dimensionless coefficient of the pressure jump δ p to satisfy the basic equation of the panel method the gap surface element is connected to the inner wall of the duct as a radial extension of the blade tip element as illustrated in fig 2 according to the assumption that the interstitial surface element is permeable combined with the infiltration velocity equation given in equation kawakita and hoshino 1998 and the moving boundary condition the source point strength of the interstitial surface element can be expressed as follows 4 φ n v i n n c q v i n δ c p n n c a m b e r where n is the panel vector and n c a m b e r is the normal vector of the middle surface element at the same chord position the pressure coefficient δ c p is obtained by an iterative process in the initial solution the gap surface element adopts the impenetrable wall condition formula in equation pan et al 2013 and the approximate initial solution of δ c p is obtained 3 method validation in regard to the verification of the numerical method of the pump jet propulsor the cfd numerical method has been verified kaiqiang wang et al 2019 the calculation results indicate that the cfd method has high accuracy and reliability in the numerical simulation of the propeller with a stator duct gu et al 2016 and can be used to calculate the open water performance of the pump jet propulsor and verify the potential flow method reference kaiqiang wang et al 2019 further demonstrated that the potential flow theory can accurately predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor additionally it verified the rationality of the tip leakage vortex model based on the above research the calculation results of the gap model in this study were compared and analysed and the rationality of the gap flow model was verified 3 1 numerical calculation model the pump jet propulsor model selected is the rear stator pump jet propulsor as depicted in fig 3 the model consists of 11 rotor blades and nine stator blades the maximum rotor diameter d r is 0 238 m and the rotational speed n is 2000 rpm the minimum gap between the top of the rotor and the duct is 3 mm 3 2 gap flow model feasibility analysis to analyse the influence of the gap flow model of the rear stator pump jet propulsor the calculation results of the gap flow model and non gap flow model were compared and analysed additionally the influence of the gap flow model on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet rotor stator and duct was analysed it has been verified in previous work kaiqiang wang et al 2019 that the panel method and cfd can accurately predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor model on this basis the calculation results of the gap flow model and cfd were compared to analyse the feasibility of the gap flow model in this study fig 4 depicts the thrust and torque curve of the rotor the calculation results depicted in fig 4 indicate that the introduction of the gap flow model increases the thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor as a whole and those of the rotor stator and duct individually this trend is still stable in the overall variation range the changing trend of the hydrodynamic performance of the flow model with and without a gap is consistent additionally with the introduction of the gap model the thrust and torque of the rotor stator and duct of the pump jet propulsor are closer to the calculation results of viscous flow the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of the whole pump and its various components is improved however the figure also shows that the gap model can only improve the hydrodynamic performance prediction of the entire pump jet propulsor and its components the above results show that the thrust of the pump jet rotor accounts for more than 75 of the total thrust indicating that the main thrust of the pump jet propulsor is generated by the rotor moreover the total torque of the pump jet propulsor is close to 0 implying that the stator balances the torque of the pump jet propulsor well so that the aircraft does not roll this is consistent with the conclusion obtained by cfd based on viscous flow liu et al 2010 fig 5 illustrates the efficiency curve of the pump jet propulsor the calculation results in the diagram indicate that the difference in the efficiency curve between the flow model with and without a gap becomes increasingly smaller with the increase in speed this is because when the incoming flow is low the flow at the gap is more intense and the effect of fluid viscosity is more significant therefore the efficiency increases significantly after the introduction of the gap flow model which is also in line with the theoretical results the change trend of the efficiency curve of the gap flow model is basically the same with the same highest efficiency point indicating that the introduction of the gap model is reasonable the calculation results of the hydrodynamic performance and efficiency curves of the pump jet propulsor indicate that the construction of the gap flow model is reasonable and feasible and can be used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor 4 analysis of calculation results of flux coefficient and pressure circulation the effect of the gap flow model is affected by two factors selection of the gap height and selection of the flux coefficient to compare and analyse more accurately the influence of the gap model on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor the selection of the height and flux coefficient of the gap model is analysed and discussed then the calculation results of the flow model with and without a gap are examined 4 1 influence of different gap heights to further analyse the influence of the gap flow model the selection of the gap height was analysed the calculation results under advance speed coefficients of 1 94 and 2 59 were selected the gap heights were 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 9 0 92 0 95 and 0 98 times of the complete gap height the above selection was calculated and analysed fig 6 depicts the calculation results under different gap heights with the increase of gap height the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of the rotor and stator increase gradually but the increasing trend tends to be smooth the overall variation range fluctuates slightly the calculation results indicate that the change in gap height has little effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the stator and rotor blades the calculation results depicted in fig 7 indicate that the thrust coefficient of the duct increases gradually with the increase of gap height particularly when the gap height is greater than 0 98 this implies that the duct thrust is more sensitive to the change in the range of 0 98 1 times of the gap height as seen in fig 4 the complete gap height is used for the calculation and the calculated results are consistent with those of the viscous flow the result was found to be more accurate when the selected gap height was greater than 0 98 additionally the above two figures show that when the height of the gap flow model exceeds 0 98 only the thrust of the duct changes whereas the rotor and stator maintain a stable trend however the change in the thrust is considerably small therefore the gap flow model has little influence on the macro force of the pump jet propulsor and a stronger effect is reflected through its influence on the duct fig 8 depicts the pressure distribution of the rotor blade at a radius of 0 98 at different gap heights it indicates that the gap flow model only affects the pressure distribution on the blade surface the pressure on the back of the blade remains almost unchanged and the increase in pressure on the blade surface increases the differential pressure on the blade surface which is more consistent with the pressure distribution on the blade surface with the increase of gap height the pressure on the blade surface increases gradually when the gap height is more than 0 9 times of the complete gap height the pressure distribution on the blade surface remains almost unchanged in the range of 0 4 0 7 times of the chord length in the chord direction the selection range of the gap height can be further reduced to 0 9 1 0 times of the complete gap height however from the pressure change at the tangential position of 0 2 0 4 when the gap height is greater than 0 98 the pressure distribution remains almost unchanged indicating that the calculation results are nearly convergent when the gap height is greater than 0 98 fig 9 depicts the radial circulation distribution of the rotor blades under different gap heights the calculation results indicate that with the increase of gap height the circulation of the rotor blades gradually increases from the root to the tip of the blade when the gap height is greater than 0 9 times of the complete gap height the overall calculation of the rotor blade changes slightly when the gap height increases to 0 98 times of the complete gap height the circulation distribution of the rotor blade remains almost unchanged indicating that the calculation results tend to be stable when the gap height is greater than 0 98 times of the complete gap height the analysis results depicted in figs 7 and 8 are further verified and the calculated results converge when the gap height is greater than 0 98 times of the complete gap height additionally the calculation results in the figure show that the variation in the calculation value of the rotor blade at the tip of the rotor blade is the largest indicating that the influence range of the gap flow model is reflected more at the tip of the rotor blade and has little influence on the performance of the rotor blade root and the overall performance of the pump jet propulsor the introduction of the gap flow model has improved the overall rotor circulation this is because the introduction of the gap flow model makes the influencing factors of fluid viscous dissipation in the gap area considered there is dipole strength in the gap area so that the circulation at the tip of the rotor no longer tends to zero this is more in line with the working conditions of the pump jet propulsor in the actual fluid 4 2 influence of different flux coefficients the gap flow model interferes with the adjacent surface elements by dipoles and source points arranged on the surface and the intensity of the source points depends on the flux coefficient c q as shown in equation wang and zhou 2004 therefore the magnitude of the flux coefficient determines the degree of disturbance to the surrounding flow field of the gap flow model c q 0 indicates that the gap band is an impenetrable wall c q 1 indicates that there is no energy loss in the flow through the gap region and 0 c q 1 indicates that there is energy loss in the gap flow the complete gap height is used for calculation figs 10 and 11 depict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor based on different flux coefficients under the same advance speed coefficient the empirical value provided by mchugh according to the experimental study of the ducted propeller is 0 84 however there are differences in the structure and working conditions between the pump jet propulsor and the traditional ducted propeller whether the flux coefficient is reasonable is worthy of further discussion in view of the above doubtful points the value range of the flux coefficient was expanded in this study and the values of the flux coefficient selected were 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 84 and 0 9 which are suitable for the calculation model from the change trend of the overall hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor when the flux coefficient c q is in the range of 0 0 4 the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor fluctuates slightly with changes in the flux coefficient however the trend is not obvious when c q 0 4 the change trend of the hydrodynamic performance of the various components of the pump jet propulsor is increasing in particular the thrust change of the entire pump jet propulsor is more significant the preliminary results indicate that when 0 4 c q 1 its influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor is more obvious in addition with the increase of the advance speed the resistance of the duct continues to increase so that the overall thrust coefficient of the pump jet propulsor continues to decrease for further analyse the influence of the flux coefficient based on the above calculation results the selection range of the flux coefficient was reduced to 0 4 0 9 figs 12 and 13 depict the calculation results in which the flux coefficient is 0 4 0 9 under different advance speed coefficients the calculation results show that the thrust and torque coefficients of the rotor decrease gradually with the increase in the flux coefficient under a low advance speed when the flux coefficient changes from 0 6 to 0 7 the difference between the thrust and torque coefficient of the rotor increases immediately additionally when c q 0 7 the amplitude of the rotor thrust and torque affected by the flux coefficient is small and when the flux coefficient is 0 9 the variation amplitude of the rotor thrust coefficient tends to become larger the calculation results indicate that under a low advance speed when the flux coefficient is in the range of 0 7 0 84 its effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the pump is more significant when the pump jet propulsor is in the medium and high speed conditions the thrust and torque of the pump jet propulsor increase with the increase in the flux coefficient and there is a minimum difference between the thrust and torque when the flux coefficient is selected in the range of 0 7 0 84 it is further proved that when the flux coefficient is selected in the range of 0 7 0 84 the effect of flux coefficient on the pump jet propulsor is closer to the dissipation of real fluid the above calculation results also show that when the advance speed increases the variation range of the difference between the thrust and torque of the rotor with the flux coefficient becomes increasingly small because as the advance speed increases the thickness of the fluid viscous boundary layer at the gap decreases and the effect of fluid viscosity becomes less significant the calculation results of different c q under j 3 24 and j 1 94 operating conditions are selected and the blade profile pressure coefficient of the rotor is intercepted at r r 0 98 as shown in fig 14 the results show that increasing the flux coefficient increases the pressure value of the blade surface as a whole increases the pressure value of the back of the blade near the leading edge and decreases the pressure value near the trailing edge as a result the pressure jump of the rotor in the range of 0 2 s c 1 is more obvious additionally the pressure distribution of the rotor profile shows that the pressure variation amplitude of the rotor profile decreases when the flux coefficient is between 0 8 and 0 84 when c q changes from 0 84 to 0 9 the amplitude of the pressure coefficient increases again the above calculation results indicate that when the flux coefficient is 0 8 0 84 the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsor is most significantly affected by the flux coefficient change fig 15 depicts the pressure distribution of the section of the duct at θ 20 under the condition of the advance speed coefficient j 3 24 the calculation results in the figure show that the pressure distribution on the surface of the duct is not sensitive to changes in c q only the interface element between the inner surface of the duct and the gap flow model is affected however there is a fluctuation in the pressure of the duct section at the s c 0 5 this situation only in the case of flux coefficients c q 0 8 and 0 84 the results show that when the flux coefficient changes in the range of 0 8 0 84 it is the most sensitive which is consistent with the conclusions drawn in the previous sections fig 16 includes the circulation distribution of the gap flow model and the gap free model with different flux coefficients by comparison it is found that the change in the flux coefficient has little influence on the prediction results of the overall performance of the rotor however in comparison with the results of the gap free model the introduction of the gap flow model has a greater global impact on the rotor circulation the circulation value in each radial direction increases obviously indicating that the introduction of the gap flow model increases the prediction results of the rotor thrust and torque the empirical coefficient proposed by mchugh is the gap flow model established by the lift surface method and the recommended value is 0 84 however according to the above calculation results it is more suitable for the gap flow model established by the surface panel element method when it is in the range of 0 8 0 84 verification and analysis demonstrated that the range of 0 8 0 84 which is more reasonable and feasible can truly reflect the energy loss at the gap flow 4 3 pressure and circulation distribution to analyse the influence of the gap flow model the calculation results under the working conditions of j 1 94 and j 3 24 were selected for comparative analysis the flux coefficient c q was selected as 0 84 and the gap height was selected as the complete gap height the calculation results are shown below fig 17 depicts the radial circulation distribution of the rotor the introduction of the gap flow model increases the circulation value of the rotor at the tip of the blade indicating that the work range of the blade along the radial direction increases and the thrust and torque of the rotor gradually increase this is more in line with the work law of the flat top blade additionally the calculation results show that when the advance speed coefficient is low the change in the circulation quantity at the tip of the blade considering the effect of gap flow is more obvious this is because the lower the advance speed the smaller the reynolds number and the more severe the viscous effect of the fluid at the gap at the top of the rotor the gap flow model considers the influence of the viscosity at the gap making the potential flow calculation results more consistent with the real flow state of the fluid figs 18 and 19 depict the pressure distribution of the rotor blade profile under different advance speed coefficients and the pressure distributions at the 0 6 and 0 8 radius sections respectively the calculation results in the figure show that the introduction of the gap flow model increases the pressure on the blade surface and back of the rotor in the chord direction the overall pressure change trend of the blade surface and back still tends to be smooth and the differential pressure between the blade surface and the back of the blade remains almost unchanged the above calculation results indicate that the introduction of the gap model increases the pressure on the blade surface and increases the shear force of the fluid particles on the blade surface thus increasing the torque of the rotor this explains the increase in torque described in section 2 2 however the figure shows that the introduction of the gap flow model only increases the surface pressure at the low radius of the rotor blade and there is no significant change in the differential pressure and the pressure at the trailing edge the results indicate that the effect of the gap flow model on the low radius of the rotor blade is limited for further analyse the influence of the gap flow model on the top of the rotor and the tip of the rotor blade the pressure distributions at 0 98 and 0 88 radius were compared with the results of the cfd calculation fig 20 depicts the pressure distribution of the rotor profile the pressure distribution in the figure shows that the introduction of the gap flow model makes the pressure distribution of the rotor profile change significantly under the same advance speed coefficient the gap flow model obviously increases the differential pressure between the rotor blade and the back of the rotor this is because in the real fluid when the fluid flows through the gap area at the top of the rotor it is affected by the boundary layer at the top of the rotor and the inner wall boundary layer of the duct that is the viscosity of the fluid is affected however this factor is not considered in the potential flow the differential pressure between the blade surface and the back of the blade is almost zero which is unreasonable the introduction of the gap flow model compensates for this shortcoming in the potential flow making the calculation results of the pressure difference between the blade surface and the back of the blade more consistent with those of the viscous flow this explains the increase in the thrust of the rotor blade discussed in section 2 2 moreover the pressure near the tip of the blade increases gradually this is closer to the calculated result of the viscous flow the above results indicate that compared with the gap free flow model the introduction of the gap flow model has a greater influence on the rotor near the blade tip fig 21 depicts the tangential pressure distribution of the duct section the calculation results indicate that the gap flow model has little effect on the outer wall of the duct however it does affect the inner wall of the duct when the advance speed is low in particular the gap flow between the top of the rotor and the inner wall of the duct is more intense for example in the case of an advance speed coefficient of 1 94 according to the normal flow phenomenon when the fluid flows between the top end of the rotor and the inner wall surface of the duct the flow rate of the fluid increases and the pressure decreases and when the fluid flows through the gap region between the rotor and the inner wall surface of the duct the flow rate begins to decrease and the pressure on the inner wall surface of the duct begins to rise again because of the existence of the gap flow the pressure on the inner wall of the duct decreases at the tangential direction of 0 25 0 4 however in the potential flow calculation the pressure distribution on the inner wall of the duct tends to be smooth and there is no significant pressure change the introduction of the gap model makes the calculation results of the potential flow closer to that of the viscous flow 5 conclusions considering the pump jet propulsor as the research object a gap flow model considering the influence of the rotor tip gap flow was developed based on the potential flow theory and the optimal height range of the gap model was presented the flux coefficient c q was calculated and analysed and the value range was determined through a comparative study of the calculation results of the flow model with and without the gap and the calculation results of cfd the influence of the gap model on the hydrodynamic performance prediction of the pump was analysed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the verification calculation and analysis of the gap flow model indicated that the change trends of the hydrodynamic performance in the two models with and without the gap flow model were the same and the calculation results between them were in good agreement additionally it was verified that the gap flow model proposed was reasonable and feasible 2 based on the analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of the entire pump and the pressure and circulation distribution of the rotor blade the selection range of the gap height was determined when the gap flow model height was within the range of 0 98 1 0 times the complete gap height the calculated value of the gap model converged 3 in previous calculations c q was usually selected based on past experience the calculation and analysis of the selection of the flux coefficient indicated that the flux coefficient selection range of 0 8 0 84 was reasonable and could truly reflect the energy attenuation at the gap flow of the pump jet propulsor 4 the gap flow model accurately simulates the energy loss of the fluid at the top gap of the pump jet propulsor rotor and fully considers the influence of fluid viscosity at the gap flow moreover it truly reflects the circulation and pressure distribution of the rotor blade as well as the pressure differential force distribution between the blade surface and back of the blade 5 the gap flow model improves the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic performance of each part of the pump jet propulsor and as a whole however the improvement effect is limited the influence of the gap flow model is reflected more in the consideration of the viscosity at the gap flow making the calculation result of the potential flow closer to the flow state of the real fluid credit authorship

20652,a fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphologic numerical model based on the open source cfd package openfoam is presented and utilized to simulate breaking wave induced scour around a pile on a sloping beach the hydrodynamic model is based on rans equations together with k ω turbulence closure and volume of fluid method for capturing the free surface these are then coupled with both bed load and suspended load transport descriptions which drive resultant morphology of the bed the model is validated against large scale laboratory experiments involving interaction of breaking solitary waves with a pile and induced flow and scour the flow features and hydrodynamic characteristics around the pile are described in detail and the scouring mechanism at different locations of the pile is thoroughly analyzed the simulated flow field confirms the formation of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile induced by plunging breaking wave the temporal variation of scour depth at the side of the pile is satisfactorily simulated while those at the offshore and onshore are under predicted the scour depth at the side of the pile increases twice during run up and draw down the scour at the onshore location of the pile starts to increase rapidly at the end of wave drawdown keywords numerical simulation solitary wave scour pile sloping beach cfd 1 introduction during the last decade more and more structures with pile foundations e g wind turbines bridges have been built in coastal areas as ocean waves propagate from the deep sea into coastal regions due to water becoming shallow the waves deform shoal or even break during the process of wave evolution on sloping beaches many of these offshore piles are located in this environment and are exposed to strong currents waves and breaking waves these effects cause the flow field in the vicinity of the pile to become rather complicated kamath et al 2016 chella et al 2017 2019 2019 and more severe scour around the pile tonkin et al 2003 nielsen et al 2012 which can undermine the safety of the structures therefore to ensure proper design in coastal engineering it is crucial to improve the understanding and prediction of flow and related scour process around piles subjected to waves over sloping beaches the subject of scour around vertical piles exposed to a steady current or combined waves and currents in deeper water has been extensively studied see the review of sumer et al 2001 and the book of sumer and fredsøe 2002 some related works such as the local scour around submerged vertical piles have been investigated by physical modeling yao et al 2018 or numerical modeling zhao et al 2004 2010 however the relevant studies on local scour of piles in coastal environment with wave deformation and even breaking appear to be quite limited the only related research can be found from tonkin et al 2003 who experimentally studied the scour promoted by incident solitary waves around a cylinder on a sloping beach where the cylinder was mounted near the shoreline they pointed out that the scouring mechanisms associated with a wave running up and drawing down on a slope are different from those in a steady current such as a river environment or in a consistent short wave field such as an offshore environment moreover the complex flow field during breaking wave interaction with a pile is different from the normal current or wave induced flow field around the pile chella et al 2019 hence to further explore the underlying mechanism of the scouring process on this issue a detailed understanding of the flow and hydrodynamic characteristics is presently fundamental and essential the numerical simulation of wave induced scouring process is a challenging task which needs to properly couple hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological models zhao et al 2004 developed a horizontal two dimensional 2d model based on potential flow theory to compute the wave induced local scour around a large cylinder pan and huang 2012 used the two dimensional depth averaged shallow water model to simulate the solitary wave induced scour around the pile however the above mentioned simple models are insufficient to properly simulate the complicated three dimensional 3d flow features around the pile such as vortex flow and intense turbulence with the development of modern computational fluid dynamics cfd approaches the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations based hydrodynamic model coupled with turbulence closure as well as combining the sediment transport and morphological models can be realized and applied in the simulation of wave induced scour around pile foundations liu et al 2008 afzal et al 2015 baykal et al 2017 larsen et al 2017 ahmad et al 2018 recently baykal et al 2017 numerically investigated the flow and scour backfilling around a vertical pile exposed to waves based on a 3d numerical cfd model in their study the wave motion was specified as a simplified oscillatory flow and the free surface was not resolved however this approach is not suitable for coastal conditions where wave deformation or even breaking occurs and the free surface needs to be reasonably simulated to date the cfd based modeling of morphology under wave propagation and breaking in coastal regions has been realized by jacobsen and fredsøe 2014 who developed an advanced fully coupled hydro and morpho dynamic model to simulate regular wave propagating over a sloping beach and the associated morphological change similarly ahmad et al 2019a utilized the cfd model reef3d to simulate the breaking waves over a slope and the resultant erosion they also applied the same model to simulate scour of pipeline ahmad et al 2019b and seawall ahmad et al 2019c although these numerical simulations are 2d it at least confirms that the cfd model is capable of simulating the flow and morphology in coastal environment to the best of our knowledge there is no report on the 3d cfd simulation of breaking wave induced scour around a pile mounted on a slope the motivation of the present work is two fold 1 to validate the numerical modeling of flow and scour around a vertical pile induced by a solitary wave over a sloping beach using an advanced fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphologic cfd model based on the open source cfd package openfoam jacobsen et al 2014 and 2 to investigate the underlying mechanisms during this transient scouring process by a detailed description of the flow field as well as thoroughly analyzing the temporal variation of hydrodynamic characteristics and scour around the pile the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the numerical model involving the hydrodynamic and turbulence models free surface capturing method and

and turbulence models in the present study the flow is simulated by solving the primitive incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j τ i j ρ σ t κ γ ρ γ x i where the mean strain rate tensor is 2 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i these are combined with the continuity equation 3 u i x i 0 here u i are the mean components of the velocities x i are the cartesian coordinates t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity and τ ij is the reynolds stress tensor which is expressed according to the boussinesq approximation 4 τ i j u i u j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j where δ ij is the kronecker delta ν t is the eddy viscosity 5 k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent kinetic energy and the overbar denotes time ensemble averaging the last term in eq 1 is the effect of surface tension where σ t is the surface tension coefficient κ γ is the surface curvature and γ is the indicator representing the volume fraction which takes a value 0 in air 1 in water and 0 1 in an air water mixture in terms of γ one can express the spatial variation in any fluid property such as ρ and ν through the weighting 6 ϕ γ ϕ water 1 γ ϕ air where ϕ can be any such quantity to achieve closure of the rans equations the k ω turbulence model by wilcox 2006 2008 is adopted in this model the eddy viscosity is defined by 7 ν t k ϖ ϖ max ω c l i m 2 s i j s i j β where k is again the turbulent kinetic energy density and ω denotes the specific dissipation rate this model also incorporates a stress limiting feature with c lim 7 8 this model additionally utilizes the following transport equations for k and ω 8 k t u j k x j τ i j ρ u i x j β k ω x j ν σ k ω k x j 9 ω t u j ω x j α ω k τ i j ρ u i x j β ω 2 σ d ω k x j ω x j x

the argument is negative and unity otherwise it can be noted that larsen and fuhrman 2018 have recently proved that seemingly all at least all that they analyzed including several k ω and k ε model variants standard two equation turbulence closures are unconditionally unstable in the potential flow region beneath non breaking surface waves which can lead to wide spread and unphysical over production of turbulence in such regions as a result they also produced formally stabilized versions of these turbulence models which incorporate a modified eddy viscosity and which will avoid this problem the present work was initiated prior to the publication of larsen and fuhrman 2018 this particular issue is not of great concern in the present study however which involves cfd simulations of single transient solitary waves rather than wave trains hence the standard model version presented above has been utilized 2 2 free surface model and wave generation for flow in river environments the free surface variation is small and can often be regarded as a frictionless rigid lid boundary roulund et al 2005 in coastal regions however the free surface varies significantly due to the wave deformation e g shoaling or even breaking which ideally needs to be accurately captured the free surface is simulated by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 which can be described by the following equation 11 γ t γ u j x j 0 in the present work waves are generated utilizing the waves2foam toolbox jacobsen et al 2012 and solitary waves are selected to model the process of wave transformation on a sloping beach as the shape of a solitary wave is reasonably similar to nonlinear wind generated waves near the coast it has been commonly used in studies related to coastal hydrodynamics based on the non linear finite amplitude solitary wave theory the free surface elevation η can be expressed as 12 η h sech 2 3 h 4 h 3 x c t where h is the height of the solitary wave measured from the still water level c is the wave celerity defined as 13 c g h h where h is the offshore water depth 2 3 sediment transport and morphological models the sediment transport and morphological models are described in this section the description will only include the most essential details since the implementation of the models has already been described and discussed in detail by jacobsen et al 2014 the sediment transport model consists of both bed load and suspended load sediment transport the bed load sediment transport q b is calculated by the method of roulund et al 2005 which accounts for bed slope modifications to the shields parameter the suspended load is calculated by solving the advection diffusion equation for the concentration see e g p 238 of fredsøe and deigaard 1992 14 c t γ u j w s δ j 3 c x j x j γ ν β s ν t c x j where c is the suspended sediment concentration the inverse of the schmidt number β s 1 is utilized i e the sediment diffusivity is taken as the same value of eddy viscosity w s is the sediment settling velocity determined by the approach of fredsøe and deigaard 1992 which is based on the drag coefficient of the falling sediment grains equation 14 is solved on a sub set of the main computational mesh where the near bed cells below a given reference level δ b are removed following the setting of fuhrman et al 2014 and larsen et al 2017 the reference level is set as δ b α 1 d 50 3 5d 50 in which d 50 is the mean grain size at this reference level a reference concentration c b boundary condition is imposed which is determined by the approach of engelund and fredsøe 1992 15 c b θ 0 6 1 1 λ b 3 16 λ b 2 κ 2 α 1 2 0 013 s θ θ θ c π 6 μ d p e f where α 1 is the multiplier of sediment diameter representing the height of the bed load transport as define above s ρ s ρ is the relative density of sediment and p ef is the probability of moving particles near the bed which is calculated by 17 p e f 1 π μ d 6 θ θ c 4 1 4 where θ is the shields number defined as 18 θ τ b ρ g s 1 d 50 u f 2 s 1 g d 50 where τ b is the bed shear stress and u f is the friction velocity throughout the present work the coefficient of dynamic friction is set to μ d 0 7 and the critical shields parameter θ c is calculated from a base value θ c0 0 05 accounting for bed slope effects as in roulund et al 2005 to prevent unphysical overloading conditions i e where the concentration just above the bed exceeds c b calculated from the reference concentration formula the solution suggested by justesen et al 1986 is invoked that is if the concentration close to the bed exceeds the reference concentration the value is in practice taken from the cell adjacent to the boundary the morphological change is computed based on the sediment continuity exner equation 19 h b t 1 1 n q b i x i e s d s i 1 2 where h b is the bed elevation n 0 4 is the bed porosity the right hand terms in eq 19 represent the contributions from the bed load transport q bi and suspended load transport e s and d s where e s and d s are erosion and deposition respectively calculated as 20 e s ν β s ν t c x 3 x 3 δ b 21 d s w s u 3 c b where x 3 and u 3 represent the position and velocity in vertical direction respectively here the sediment falls towards the bed which is defined as the positive direction for w s hence d s is positive base on eq 21 and e s is correspondingly negative based on eq 20 the difference between e s and d s determine the net change of bed due to suspended sediment transport the exner equation is based on instantaneous sediment transport fields and therefore the morphological and hydrodynamic times are equivalent to ensure that the bed slopes do not exceed the angle of repose a sand slide model described in detail by roulund et al 2005 is utilized in the present work this model is activated at positions where the local bed angle exceeds the angle of repose 32 and is deactivated once the local bed angle has been reduced to 31 9 the equations comprising the fully coupled model outlined above are solved numerically using the open source cfd package openfoam version 1 6 ext making use of a finite volume spatial discretization with a collocated variable arrangement in conjunction with a standard pimple algorithm the hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological models are solved separately on three different sets of mesh all of the adopted meshes are continuously synchronized to ensure that the locations of the shared vertices remain identical the coupling is achieved by mapping the necessary variables at the corresponding vertices from one mesh to another mesh the coupling at the interface between sediment and fluid is realized by the dynamic mesh method after the bed change in each time step is computed the computational mesh is updated to ensure that the bottom boundary of the mesh is conformal with the bed a laplace equation is solved for the motion of the mesh vertices again for further details the reader is referred to jacobsen et al 2014 the fully coupled model described above has been utilized on several scour related studies including pipeline scour fuhrman et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 and local scour around a monopile baykal et al 2015 2017 2017 larsen et al 2017 the previous works above involving the cfd simulation of scour with the present model made use of a rigid lid approximation and thus did not incorporate a free surface the present study extends these and hence represents the first simulations with this model to directly combine scour at the sea bed with a free surface 3 computational setup 3 1 computational cases description in the present numerical simulation the computational cases are identical to those of tonkin et al s 2003 laboratory experiments carried out in a large scale flume 135 m long 2 m wide and 5 m high a solitary wave was generated offshore approaching a sloping beach with a uniform slope of 1 20 the sediment used in the test was approximately uniform with the grain size being d 50 0 35 mm and the density being 2 643 103 kg m3 a vertical pile of diameter d 0 5 m was placed at 49 m from the toe of the slope which can be considered as about 1 10 of prototype scale two cases in tonkin et al s 2003 experiments named as case i and case iii were selected corresponding to case 1 and case 2 in the present numerical simulations and the detailed setups for the two cases are depicted in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively the offshore water depth is denoted as h and the height of the solitary wave measured from the still water level is denoted as h the origin of the coordinate system is defined at the still water surface above the slope toe with the longitudinal x axis parallel to the flume bed and pointing onshore the y axis vertical normal to the bottom of the flume and z axis normal to the side wall of the flume since the pile location is fixed the different still water depths for case 1 and case 2 correspond to the pile that is initially on the shoreline and 4 m offshore in the original experiments detailed measurements including water surface elevation velocity and scour depth were made at different locations which can be utilized to validate the present numerical model as shown in fig 1 c the stations a and b are located at the offshore side and 3 m away from the pile stations c d and e are located near the pile and specifically being offshore onshore and side of the pile respectively the test conditions for the two cases are listed in table 1 kc is the keulegan carpenter number defined by 22 k c u m t w d in which the velocity magnitude u m can be calculated based on first approximate solitary wave theory 23 u m h g h and t w is the effective wave period defined by 24 t w 2 π 4 3 g h h x b represents the horizontal position of wave breaking point which is an important information when dealing with breaking wave hydrodynamics by comparing x b with the pile location x 49 m it can be seen that the breaking wave is occurred in front of and behind the pile for case 1 and case 2 respectively 3 2 computational mesh the present numerical simulations are 3d cases the length of the computational domain i e in the x direction is 130 m from the inlet boundary at x 60 m to the outlet boundary at x 70 m the length between the inlet of wave generation to the toe of the slope is 60 m which is almost a full effective wave length this length enables initial solitary wave propagation while also maintaining reasonable computational costs also the outlet boundary is selected at a position away from the highest point of wave run up to avoid any influence of the outlet boundary the width of the computational domain i e in the z direction is 2 m which is identical to the width of the experimental flume the computational domain is discretized into finite volumes of quadrilateral blocks in varying shapes and dimensions fig 2 shows the computational mesh used in the vicinity of the pile during the computations the mesh is continuously updated to adjust to the changes of bed topography as shown in fig 2 b body fitted quadrilateral grids were used and refined close to the pile the total number of cells comprising the computational domain utilized is o 6 105 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of meshes used in the forthcoming simulation it is emphasized that considerable effort has been put into optimizing the computational mesh for convergence while at the same time keeping the computational time affordable regarding the influence of grid size on the computational results see the appendix a for the present computational cases the morphological change is very rapid especially when the incident wave arrives at the pile the scour deposition at the pile suddenly increases and the scour rate can reach 7 cm s since the dynamic mesh method was used in the simulation of morphology the rapid boundary movement can cause the first layer of cells near the bed to become highly distorted for example as shown in fig 3 a some cells can become stretched or compressed and even negative cells can arise when the bottom nodes move upward over the adjacent nodes this figure demonstrates the general difficulty of the mesh to respond to such sudden bed changes the deteriorated mesh quality made subsequent computations hard to converge eventually leading to unstable solutions this issue of mesh distortion was also pointed out by liu et al 2008 who used a mesh deformation approach to simulate moving bed to solve this problem here we propose and have used an approach of manually correcting the highly distorted meshes near the bed when such issues arise first the cells around the pile were scanned to identify the distorted ones such as the stretched or compressed cells apparent in fig 3 a subsequently the grids were redistributed in the vertical direction to guarantee that the height of the first layer of cells remains spatially consistent finally the mapfields tool existing in openfoam was utilized to map the variable data in the vertices of the old mesh to the corresponding corrected mesh thus guaranteeing the overall consistency of data before and after mesh correction fig 3 b indicates that the mesh quality is improved after correction enabling the computation to continue 3 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the computational domain are as follows the top boundary i e the top of the domain not the free surface will be modeled as a frictionless lid meaning that vertical air velocities were set to zero and horizontal velocities and scalar hydrodynamic quantities have zero vertical gradient at the sides of the computational domain zero gradient conditions are applied for all quantities except for the three components of the velocity where slip boundary conditions are applied to these at the friction wall boundary i e at the bottom and the pile surface following fuhrman et al 2014 and larsen et al 2017 a generalized wall function is utilized to determine the friction velocity as the sediment transport process will be modeled a hydraulically rough wall will be assumed and the nikuradse s equivalent sand roughness of the bed was taken as k s 2 5d 50 the surface roughness of the pile is kept sufficiently small k s 1 10 5 m such that it is effectively modeled as hydraulically smooth at the inlet left hand boundary waves2foam was used to generate a solitary wave for the right hand boundary a slip boundary condition was specified though it is emphasized that this is a sufficient distance away such that the water does not reach this boundary to maintain the stability and accuracy of the computation the courant number is set as 0 1 which is far less than 1 this value is referenced to the result proposed by larsen et al 2019 who noted that a small courant number is crucial for limiting the growth of spurious velocities in wave simulations it should be mentioned that in the morphology computation the time steps were taken to be exactly the same as in the hydrodynamic computation i e the morphological model did not make use of morphological rates averaged over any larger time scales or morphological acceleration the reason for this choice is the rapid change in the development of the bed during wave induced morphology requires close coupling between the hydrodynamics and the bed evolution to reduce the simulation time we used parallel computation with domain decomposition on six processors additionally since most of computational time is spent on the morphological simulation the morphological computation was started when the wave approaches to the pile this can be easily realized by selecting the results from rigid bed simulation at the time of wave approaching to the pile as the initial condition of the scour simulation to be consistent with the time duration of the experiment the physical time of simulation was set as 50 s for the mobile bed simulation it required approximately 20 days of cpu time for the same computational mesh and using the same computational power the rigid bed simulation for 50 s of physical time required approximately 5 days all computations were done on the clusters supported by high performance computing hpc competence center at the technical university of denmark in this study two parallel simulations were conducted 1 rigid bed simulations to investigate the flow features and hydrodynamic characteristics around the pile which will also serve to validate the hydrodynamic model and 2 sediment mobile bed simulations to validate the morphological model as well as analyze the scouring mechanism around the pile the conditions of the two kinds of simulation were exactly same in the rigid bed simulation the bottom of the computational domain was kept rigid by turning off the morphological model whereas in the sediment bed simulation the morphological model was turned on and therefore the bed was continuously updated 4 rigid bed simulations 4 1 hydrodynamic validation as shown in fig 4 the numerical results of velocity u and water surface elevation η at different stations for case 1 are compared to the experimental data to validate the hydrodynamic model the streamwise velocity corresponds to the location of 7 5 cm above the beach surface which is identical to the experiments the blue solid lines and black dots represent the computed and measured results respectively the time of t 0 is defined as the time when the incident wave just arrives at the offshore surface of the pile for stations a and b located a distance offshore from the pile see fig 1 c the computed and measured results agree quite well especially for η at station b fig 4 b the two lines almost overlap this implies that the wave propagation and transformation over the sloping bed as it advances towards the pile can be well simulated which is fundamental for the eventual simulation of wave interaction with the pile it is worth noting that the breaking solitary wave sequence over a slope including wave shoaling breaking run up draw down hydraulic jump and trailing wave has been reasonably reproduced by the present numerical model larsen and fuhrman 2019 for stations c and d located near the pile the computed results fit well with the measurements particularly during run up t 5 s however slight discrepancies can be found during wave draw down 5 s t 25 s the reason is that the pile is located at the shoreline area where the water depth is extremely small during draw down forming a thin layer flow which is difficult to be captured accurately by the present numerical model the comparisons for case 2 are also provided in fig 5 in which only the velocity at station a and water surface elevation at station b were included due to the limitation of measured data available in experiment it indicates that the computed results fit quite well with the measured results except for the peak value of η at station b table 3 presents the quantitative comparisons for the peak value of the time series of u and η the error between numerical and experimental value for all the data is less than 10 overall the simulated results are deemed satisfactory particularly considering the complexity in the physical process of a breaking solitary wave interaction with a pile in the following sections the flow features around the pile will be described in detail as well as the temporal variation of hydrodynamic characteristics during the wave interacting with the pile will be thoroughly analyzed 4 2 flow characteristics around the pile based on the reliable simulated results which have been validated above some flow characteristics around the pile will be described and discussed in detail including the water surface flow velocity and turbulence and bed shear stress the temporal variations of these hydrodynamic characteristics at different positions i e offshore side and onshore around the pile will be compared with the aim of identifying the scouring mechanism at different positions around the pile moreover the results from both case 1 and case 2 will be compared with the focus on the difference between the two cases 4 2 1 water surface to clearly and visually show the water surface features during the solitary wave interacting with the pile fig 6 provides the 3d view of free surface changes at several typical moments for case 1 and case 2 in each subplot the solitary wave propagates from the left offshore to the right onshore in fig 6 a the incident wave has already broken before arriving at the pile for case 1 when the breaking wave impinges on the pile the water surface in front of the pile rises significantly due to the blocking effect of pile fig 6 b in contrast the incident wave in case 2 does not break when it impacts on the pile fig 6 c as can be seen from fig 6 d the wave breaks behind the pile and the separation of the incident wave front by the pile meets in the shadow zone behind the pile the simulated free surface feature is consistent with the observation in experiment the breaking wave interaction with the pile in case 1 was also observed in the experiment of tonkin et al 2003 who pointed out that the breaking wave is the main reason for the formation of a horseshoe vortex in front of the pile to confirm this finding of flow feature as well as illustrate the underlying mechanism we further extracted the flow at the symmetrical plane in front of the pile figs 7 and 8 show the snapshots of flow red color represents the water and white color represents the air in front of the pile for case 1 and case 2 the streamline is also included in the figures to demonstrate the presence of vortex fig 7 a indicates that the incident wave breaks before it arrives at the pile and the breaker is a plunging type with an overturning flow occurred the plunging wave impacts on the pile resulting in the formation of downward flow and horseshoe vortex at the bed in front of the pile see the streamline plotted in fig 7 b the simulated result proves the finding of horseshoe vortex in the experiment in contrast this flow feature of horseshoe vortex is not found in case 2 fig 8 depicts the flow for case 2 at the moments of wave crest arriving at the pile and wave breaking behind the pile the streamline in front of the pile indicates no vortex formed during the process of wave impacting on the pile the difference of flow features between the two cases could be explained from the mechanism of horseshoe vortex generation for case 1 it is more like a current induced flow field around the pile in the case of current the generation of horseshoe vortex is closely related to the parameter of pile reynolds number re d the horseshoe vortex is more pronounced with the increase of re d in case 1 the plunging wave associated with high velocity overturning flow impacts on the pile which results in large value of re d consequently the horseshoe vortex in case 1 is expected to be more obvious for the flow in case 2 it is more like a wave induced flow field around the pile in wave case the horseshoe vortex is primarily governed by the kc number sumer et al 1997 small kc number means that the orbital motion of water particles is small relative to the pile diameter for very small kc number 6 the horseshoe vortex may not even be formed because the stroke of the fluid motion is not large enough for the approach boundary layer to separate hence there is no existence of horseshoe vortex in case 2 overall the pile location with respect to the breaking wave has great influences on the flow pattern around the pile and probably the resultant scour which will be discussed in the following section of scour simulation it needs to be noted that although the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile can be represented by the present numerical model the simulated horseshoe vortex is not as obvious as that observed in the experiment in fact the local flow field around the pile induced by the breaking wave is very complicated such as vortex flow and associated turbulence characteristics which is hard to be accurately simulated by the present hydrodynamic model further the scour modeling in front of the pile directly influenced by the horseshoe vortex will be correspondingly under predicted which can be seen in the following section of scour simulation to further quantify the difference of water surface between case 1 and case 2 the temporal variations of the water surface elevation η at different stations around the pile are plotted in fig 9 the stations are selected at offshore side and onshore positions close to the pile corresponding to c e and d as depicted in fig 1 c the variation tendency for both case 1 and case 2 looks similar the difference for the absolute value is due to the different initial water elevation in the two cases i e η 0 m and 0 2 m for case 1 and case 2 respectively it can be seen from both scenarios that the peak value of η occurs when the incident wave arrives at each station and the peak value at the offshore station is the largest while the peak value at the onshore station is relatively small due to energy dissipation during the process of wave impacting on the pile during the wave drawing down the value of η at the onshore station is generally higher than the other two stations because the backwater is formed at back of the pile 4 2 2 flow velocity and turbulence fig 10 presents the temporal variation of streamwise velocity u near the bed during the process of a solitary wave interacting with the pile the near bed velocity is for the location of 1 mm above the bed the results at the offshore side and onshore positions near the pile corresponding to c e and d as depicted in fig 1 c are plotted some similar features can be found for both case 1 and case 2 at the same locations it is obvious that the value of u is very low at the offshore location while it appears to fluctuate at the end of wave drawing down the velocity to the side of the pile is generally high and reaches the peak value when the wave crest arrives at the side position and subsequently decreases rapidly to zero during run up during draw down the velocity at the side position increases gradually again and this feature together with the high velocity lasts a relatively long time it implies that the long time inundation of flow with high velocity will induce the secondary increase of scour during wave drawing down for the velocity at the onshore pile position its peak value arises during draw down and the occurrence of the peak for case 2 is delayed relative to case 1 interestingly the fluctuation of the velocity at the onshore pile position is found in case 1 during run up whereas this feature is not found in case 2 this feature of velocity fluctuating for case 1 is probably due to the influence of breaking wave on the flow as described above to illustrate the variation of flow turbulence around the pile during the process of wave running up and drawing down the time series of turbulent kinetic energy k near the bed for case 1 and case 2 are plotted in fig 11 in case 1 the plunging breaker induces high turbulent flow in front of the pile which results in large value of k at the offshore or even the onshore position in contrast the value of k is comparatively smaller in case 2 because the breaker is not occurred in front of the pile this phenomenon is in agreement with the observation by tonkin et al 2003 who also noted that this is a reason for the more apparent scour occurred at the pile front in case 1 for the side point the two cases exhibit similar variation tendency and the value of k is almost quantitatively consistent in other words it seems that the breaking wave does not have a significant influence on the flow turbulence at the side of the pile combining with the results of flow velocity described above it can be seen that for the side point both the flow velocity and flow turbulence show consistent for case 1 and case 2 this implies that the scouring at the pile side for the two cases is consistent which can be seen from the following discussion on the scour results 4 2 3 bed shear stress the bed shear stress is normally regarded as a crucial quantity which directly drives sediment transport and bed scour fig 12 shows the bed shear stress magnitude τ around the pile the subplots a and c correspond to the time when the peak of τ at the pile side arises during run up subplots b and d correspond to the peak time during draw down it indicates that the area with high magnitude of bed shear stress is larger during draw down specifically during wave running up the large value of τ is located within the side area of the pile while for the wave drawing down the large value of τ occurs in both the onshore and the side areas of the pile and extends further to the separated region of the pile fig 13 presents the temporal variation of the bed shear stress τ at different locations around the pile in general the variation of bed shear stress is very similar to the flow velocity plotted in fig 10 partly due to the velocity selected near the bed in case 1 of offshore position a small peak with negative value is found at the time of incident wave impacting on the pile which is mainly due to the existence of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile this is the main mechanism for the larger scour depth at pile front in case 1 it is obvious that the value of τ at the side point is generally larger and two peaks occur at both run up and draw down stages for the onshore position the bed shear stress is amplified at the end of wave drawing down which implies that scour start to increase at this stage 5 scour simulations 5 1 general morphological change without the pile when a pile mounted on a sloping beach is exposed to waves two types of scour emerge the general morphological change of the beach as the background without the pile and scour around the pile that is the local scour before the 3d simulation of local scour around the pile the morphological change of a sloping beach that is identical to the experiment of tonkin et al 2003 was first computed based on a 2d simulation fig 14 presents the temporal variations of some quantities for both two cases at the location of x 49 m this location is exactly at the initial shoreline of case 1 which is also the pile position in the forthcoming 3d local scour simulation it shows that when the incident wave arrives at the location i e t 0 the hydrodynamic quantities i e η τ and k increase rapidly to the peak resulting in the initiation of bed erosion compared to case 1 the first peak value of bed shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy for case 2 is smaller which results in that the early erosion of case 2 is correspondingly less obvious than that of case 1 during draw down the value of τ and k increases again to the second peak which induces further bed erosion the positive bed elevation during draw down for case 2 means deposition occurred this is due to the position of x 49 m for case 2 is on the offshore side of the shoreline during drawn down for case 2 the scoured sediment is transported to the offshore forming the bed deposition at the position of x 49 m fig 15 depicts the bed profiles exposed to a solitary wave for case 1 and case 2 in which the incident wave propagates from left to right it can be seen that the general tendencies of the two profiles are similar and both profiles show that erosion occurs on the onshore side whereas deposition occurs on the offshore side as the positions of the initial shoreline for case 1 and case 2 are different the positions of erosion and deposition also correspondingly differ it is found that for case 2 the general erosion and deposition pattern shifts towards the onshore for example the maximum deposition and erosion are located at x 44 m and x 49 m for case 1 whereas these occur at x 47 m and x 52 m for case 2 additionally the maximum deposition heights for both cases are approximately 2 cm and the maximum erosion depths are no more than 1 cm we focus on the position of the pile i e x 49 m where the erosion depth is approximately 0 5 cm in both cases however from the following local scour simulation it demonstrates that the local scour depth at the pile can reach up to 10 cm therefore the general morphological change without the pile is much smaller than the local scour at the pile which further indicates that the superposition of general bed change is minimal and can be considered as negligible in the total scour prediction 5 2 local scour around the pile 5 2 1 scour validation the 3d view of local scour hole around the pile is illustrated in fig 16 in which the incident wave propagates from left offshore to the right onshore it is worth noting that the scour results presented in the figure are based on the coarse computational mesh which has been tested in the appendix of mesh convergence we can find that an obvious ridge is formed on the offshore of the pile induced by the drawing down swash which is similar to the morphology behind the pile exposed to current fig 17 presents the comparison of final scour morphology around the pile between numerical and experimental results for case 1 fig 17 b is adopted from fig 5 of tonkin et al 2003 as the scour hole is symmetrical around the center of the flume only one side is shown it can be seen that the computed and measured scour patterns are similar from the distribution of bed elevation contour lines the computed maximum scour depth is approximately 8 cm which is almost the same as the measured result the position of the maximum scour depth is also reasonably predicted however the scour morphology at the offshore of the pile shows notable difference the numerical result shows a clear ridge bed and two scoured gully at the offshore location while this scour pattern is not observed from the experiment at least from the fig 17 b with low resolution the reason for the scoured gully could be illustrated from the bed shear stress as previously discussed in fig 12 it clearly shows that during the wave drawing down the bed shear stress at the offshore side increases significantly due to flow separated downstream of the pile consequently the bed scour is occurred due to the amplified bed shear stress resulting in the formation of scoured gully to make a further quantitative comparison the temporal variations of scour depth at different positions around the pile are plotted in fig 18 the solid lines and dots represent the numerical and experimental results respectively it can be seen that the scour depth at the offshore location is under predicted as pointed previously the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile is not as accurately modeled as observed in the experiment and the horseshoe vortex is normally regarded as the main factor driving sediment erosion such that the resulting scour in front of the pile may be under predicted additionally no visible horseshoe type vortex has formed in case 2 as a result less scour occurs immediately after impact compared to case 1 in which the horseshoe vortex was formed by the plunging breaker in front of the pile the simulated results are in agreement with the experimental results for the side location near the pile the tendency of scour variation is reasonably simulated which yields two obvious peaks occurring during run up and draw down the simulated scour developments for the two cases look similar as aforementioned analysis on the hydrodynamic characteristics at the side of the pile the near bed flow velocity turbulence and bed shear stress also illustrate double peaked features due to streamline contraction and flow separation as a result the scour at the side of the pile increases twice during run up and draw down the scouring mechanism at the side position of the pile is similar to the situation exposed to a current such as a river bridge pile environment this feature is well reproduced by the present numerical model for the onshore location the rapid scour occurs at the end of wave drawdown where strong back washing flow is formed resulting in significant sediment transport considering the temporal variation of the near bed velocity as well as the bed shear stress see figs 10 and 13 we can see the backwash velocity has a similar magnitude as the uprush velocity but with much longer time duration hence the total flow intensity thus the total ability for transporting sediment during the backwash is much more significant than during the uprush stage however the computed maximum scour depth at the onshore location is smaller than the experimental result particularly for case 1 where the pile is located at the initial shoreline tonkin et al 2003 pointed out that the scouring mechanism at the onshore of the pile cannot be explained only in terms of the traditional bed shear stress but also requires inclusion of the pore pressure gradients sumer et al 2011 also found that the pore water pressure has a great impact on the sediment transport during wave drawing down this factor of pore water pressure is not taken into account in the present numerical model however in general the agreement is considered satisfactory and the results obtained from the present numerical model can be considered promising particularly considering the complexity of the coupled hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological processes involved in general the present numerical model is capable of reasonably simulating the scour around the pile mounted on a slope exposed to a solitary wave especially for the maximum scour depth and its corresponding position after encountering a solitary wave by thoroughly analyzing the temporal variations of scour depth at different locations around the pile we can see that the scouring mechanism is also different in order to improve the modeling result it is necessary to improve the modeling of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile as well as account for the influence of pore water pressure in the sediment transport model 5 2 2 discussion on the effect of pile location based on the comparison of the two cases presented above the pile location with respect to the wave breaking point plays a prominent role on the flow field around the pile as well as the associated scour depth due to the large computational expenses associated with the advanced fully coupled cfd models especially for the present cases with the complex nature of the physical processes only two scenarios were added the numerical setups for the two additional cases are the same with case 1 except for the different pile position relative to breaker point as a result in the total three cases the pile is located in front of the breaker approximately at the breaker and behind the breaker fig 19 a shows the temporal developments of scour depth at the pile side for different pile locations the distance from the breaking point to the pile δx b is normalized by the pile diameter d δx b d 0 means that the pile is located exactly at the breaking point the negative and positive values of δx b d means that the pile is located at offshore and onshore of the breaking point the results show that the general variation tendency of scour development is similar for the three cases and the scour depth increases twice during wave run up and draw down we further extracted the maximum scour depth s max during the process of run up and draw down which is plotted versus δx b d in fig 19 b the results indicate that the larger value of scour depth s max d occurs when the pile is located closer to the breaker point when the pile is located away from the breaker point in either direction onshore or offshore the maximum scour depth at the pile side reduces it is worth noting that the current discussion on the effect of pile location is a preliminary test due to the limited data in the future more numerical cases in terms of different pile location need to be further conducted and a clear relationship is expected to be identified to guide the engineering design 6 summary and conclusions a fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphologic numerical model based on the open source cfd package openfoam is presented based on jacobsen et al 2014 and utilized to simulate flow and scour around a pile mounted on a sloping beach exposed to a solitary wave the hydrodynamic model is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations together with k ω turbulence closure and volume of fluid vof method for capturing the free surface waves are generated using the waves2foam package the sediment transport consists of both bed load and suspended load descriptions and the latter is based on a turbulent diffusion equation the morphological model is based on the sediment continuity exner equation accounting for sand slide adjustments the present numerical model is validated and tested against a large scale laboratory experiment of tonkin et al 2003 the hydrodynamic characteristics and flow features around the pile are described in detail as well as the scouring mechanism at different locations of the pile is thoroughly analyzed a preliminary test on the effect of pile location is additionally discussed the rigid bed simulations show that the numerical results agree quite well with the experimental results in terms of water surface elevation and velocity around the pile particularly considering the complexity in the physical process of a breaking solitary wave interaction with a pile the simulated result confirms that the plunging breaker ahead of the pile induces the formation of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile in contrast no horseshoe vortex is formed when the wave breaks behind the pile the breaking wave also induces high flow turbulence at the offshore and onshore of the pile the temporal variation of hydrodynamic characteristics at the side of the pile shows a double peaked feature which occurred at the times during run up and draw down for the onshore location of the pile the bed shear stress is amplified at the end of wave drawing down the scour simulations show that the present numerical model can reasonably simulate the scour morphology around the pile especially for the prediction of the maximum scour depth and its position the temporal variation of scour depth at the side of the pile is reasonably simulated while those at the offshore and onshore are under predicted this is due to the underestimation of the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile and not accounting for pore water pressures the general morphological change of the beach without the pile is sufficiently small such that it can be considered as negligible in the total scour prediction the scour at the offshore of the pile is mainly induced by the horseshoe vortex the scour at the side of the pile increases twice during run up and draw down which is mainly due to the separation flow inducing high bed shear stress the scour at the onshore location of the pile starts to increase rapidly at the end of wave drawdown due to the strong back washing flow the larger scour depth occurs when the pile is located closer to the wave breaking point to the best of our knowledge this is the first three dimensional simulation investigating the scouring process around a monopile mounted on a slope subjected to free surface wave deformation and breaking based on an advanced cfd model we believe that this model can be extended to study the flow and morphology through multiple piles with

the computational results we tested two different meshes as shown in fig a 20 in which the fine mesh is refined with cells twice as small compared to the coarse mesh the coarse mesh is the present mesh used in this work it clearly shows that the computed wave surface elevations and velocity by the two meshes are quite similar especially during run up almost overlapped as a check of convergence it can be noted that further refinements in the mesh yield the same results thus to balance the computational precision and speed the coarse mesh has been adopted fig a 20 comparison of velocity and

20652,a fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphologic numerical model based on the open source cfd package openfoam is presented and utilized to simulate breaking wave induced scour around a pile on a sloping beach the hydrodynamic model is based on rans equations together with k ω turbulence closure and volume of fluid method for capturing the free surface these are then coupled with both bed load and suspended load transport descriptions which drive resultant morphology of the bed the model is validated against large scale laboratory experiments involving interaction of breaking solitary waves with a pile and induced flow and scour the flow features and hydrodynamic characteristics around the pile are described in detail and the scouring mechanism at different locations of the pile is thoroughly analyzed the simulated flow field confirms the formation of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile induced by plunging breaking wave the temporal variation of scour depth at the side of the pile is satisfactorily simulated while those at the offshore and onshore are under predicted the scour depth at the side of the pile increases twice during run up and draw down the scour at the onshore location of the pile starts to increase rapidly at the end of wave drawdown keywords numerical simulation solitary wave scour pile sloping beach cfd 1 introduction during the last decade more and more structures with pile foundations e g wind turbines bridges have been built in coastal areas as ocean waves propagate from the deep sea into coastal regions due to water becoming shallow the waves deform shoal or even break during the process of wave evolution on sloping beaches many of these offshore piles are located in this environment and are exposed to strong currents waves and breaking waves these effects cause the flow field in the vicinity of the pile to become rather complicated kamath et al 2016 chella et al 2017 2019 2019 and more severe scour around the pile tonkin et al 2003 nielsen et al 2012 which can undermine the safety of the structures therefore to ensure proper design in coastal engineering it is crucial to improve the understanding and prediction of flow and related scour process around piles subjected to waves over sloping beaches the subject of scour around vertical piles exposed to a steady current or combined waves and currents in deeper water has been extensively studied see the review of sumer et al 2001 and the book of sumer and fredsøe 2002 some related works such as the local scour around submerged vertical piles have been investigated by physical modeling yao et al 2018 or numerical modeling zhao et al 2004 2010 however the relevant studies on local scour of piles in coastal environment with wave deformation and even breaking appear to be quite limited the only related research can be found from tonkin et al 2003 who experimentally studied the scour promoted by incident solitary waves around a cylinder on a sloping beach where the cylinder was mounted near the shoreline they pointed out that the scouring mechanisms associated with a wave running up and drawing down on a slope are different from those in a steady current such as a river environment or in a consistent short wave field such as an offshore environment moreover the complex flow field during breaking wave interaction with a pile is different from the normal current or wave induced flow field around the pile chella et al 2019 hence to further explore the underlying mechanism of the scouring process on this issue a detailed understanding of the flow and hydrodynamic characteristics is presently fundamental and essential the numerical simulation of wave induced scouring process is a challenging task which needs to properly couple hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological models zhao et al 2004 developed a horizontal two dimensional 2d model based on potential flow theory to compute the wave induced local scour around a large cylinder pan and huang 2012 used the two dimensional depth averaged shallow water model to simulate the solitary wave induced scour around the pile however the above mentioned simple models are insufficient to properly simulate the complicated three dimensional 3d flow features around the pile such as vortex flow and intense turbulence with the development of modern computational fluid dynamics cfd approaches the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations based hydrodynamic model coupled with turbulence closure as well as combining the sediment transport and morphological models can be realized and applied in the simulation of wave induced scour around pile foundations liu et al 2008 afzal et al 2015 baykal et al 2017 larsen et al 2017 ahmad et al 2018 recently baykal et al 2017 numerically investigated the flow and scour backfilling around a vertical pile exposed to waves based on a 3d numerical cfd model in their study the wave motion was specified as a simplified oscillatory flow and the free surface was not resolved however this approach is not suitable for coastal conditions where wave deformation or even breaking occurs and the free surface needs to be reasonably simulated to date the cfd based modeling of morphology under wave propagation and breaking in coastal regions has been realized by jacobsen and fredsøe 2014 who developed an advanced fully coupled hydro and morpho dynamic model to simulate regular wave propagating over a sloping beach and the associated morphological change similarly ahmad et al 2019a utilized the cfd model reef3d to simulate the breaking waves over a slope and the resultant erosion they also applied the same model to simulate scour of pipeline ahmad et al 2019b and seawall ahmad et al 2019c although these numerical simulations are 2d it at least confirms that the cfd model is capable of simulating the flow and morphology in coastal environment to the best of our knowledge there is no report on the 3d cfd simulation of breaking wave induced scour around a pile mounted on a slope the motivation of the present work is two fold 1 to validate the numerical modeling of flow and scour around a vertical pile induced by a solitary wave over a sloping beach using an advanced fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphologic cfd model based on the open source cfd package openfoam jacobsen et al 2014 and 2 to investigate the underlying mechanisms during this transient scouring process by a detailed description of the flow field as well as thoroughly analyzing the temporal variation of hydrodynamic characteristics and scour around the pile the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the numerical model involving the hydrodynamic and turbulence models free surface capturing method and wave generation sediment transport and morphological models are described in section 2 the numerical setup involving the description of computational cases computational mesh and boundary conditions are presented in section 3 the numerical simulations regarding the flow features and hydrodynamic characteristics around the pile are validated and described in sections 4 the results of the scour simulations are validated as well as discussion on the effect of pile location is presented in section 5 the summary and conclusions are finally drawn in section 6 2 model description 2 1 hydrodynamic and turbulence models in the present study the flow is simulated by solving the primitive incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s i j τ i j ρ σ t κ γ ρ γ x i where the mean strain rate tensor is 2 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i these are combined with the continuity equation 3 u i x i 0 here u i are the mean components of the velocities x i are the cartesian coordinates t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity and τ ij is the reynolds stress tensor which is expressed according to the boussinesq approximation 4 τ i j u i u j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j where δ ij is the kronecker delta ν t is the eddy viscosity 5 k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulent kinetic energy and the overbar denotes time ensemble averaging the last term in eq 1 is the effect of surface tension where σ t is the surface tension coefficient κ γ is the surface curvature and γ is the indicator representing the volume fraction which takes a value 0 in air 1 in water and 0 1 in an air water mixture in terms of γ one can express the spatial variation in any fluid property such as ρ and ν through the weighting 6 ϕ γ ϕ water 1 γ ϕ air where ϕ can be any such quantity to achieve closure of the rans equations the k ω turbulence model by wilcox 2006 2008 is adopted in this model the eddy viscosity is defined by 7 ν t k ϖ ϖ max ω c l i m 2 s i j s i j β where k is again the turbulent kinetic energy density and ω denotes the specific dissipation rate this model also incorporates a stress limiting feature with c lim 7 8 this model additionally utilizes the following transport equations for k and ω 8 k t u j k x j τ i j ρ u i x j β k ω x j ν σ k ω k x j 9 ω t u j ω x j α ω k τ i j ρ u i x j β ω 2 σ d ω k x j ω x j x j ν σ k ω ω x j the following closure coefficients are used α 0 52 β 0 078 β 0 09 σ 0 5 σ 0 6 σ do 0 125 and 10 σ d h k x j ω x j σ d o where h is the heaviside step function taking a value of zero if the argument is negative and unity otherwise it can be noted that larsen and fuhrman 2018 have recently proved that seemingly all at least all that they analyzed including several k ω and k ε model variants standard two equation turbulence closures are unconditionally unstable in the potential flow region beneath non breaking surface waves which can lead to wide spread and unphysical over production of turbulence in such regions as a result they also produced formally stabilized versions of these turbulence models which incorporate a modified eddy viscosity and which will avoid this problem the present work was initiated prior to the publication of larsen and fuhrman 2018 this particular issue is not of great concern in the present study however which involves cfd simulations of single transient solitary waves rather than wave trains hence the standard model version presented above has been utilized 2 2 free surface model and wave generation for flow in river environments the free surface variation is small and can often be regarded as a frictionless rigid lid boundary roulund et al 2005 in coastal regions however the free surface varies significantly due to the wave deformation e g shoaling or even breaking which ideally needs to be accurately captured the free surface is simulated by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 which can be described by the following equation 11 γ t γ u j x j 0 in the present work waves are generated utilizing the waves2foam toolbox jacobsen et al 2012 and solitary waves are selected to model the process of wave transformation on a sloping beach as the shape of a solitary wave is reasonably similar to nonlinear wind generated waves near the coast it has been commonly used in studies related to coastal hydrodynamics based on the non linear finite amplitude solitary wave theory the free surface elevation η can be expressed as 12 η h sech 2 3 h 4 h 3 x c t where h is the height of the solitary wave measured from the still water level c is the wave celerity defined as 13 c g h h where h is the offshore water depth 2 3 sediment transport and morphological models the sediment transport and morphological models are described in this section the description will only include the most essential details since the implementation of the models has already been described and discussed in detail by jacobsen et al 2014 the sediment transport model consists of both bed load and suspended load sediment transport the bed load sediment transport q b is calculated by the method of roulund et al 2005 which accounts for bed slope modifications to the shields parameter the suspended load is calculated by solving the advection diffusion equation for the concentration see e g p 238 of fredsøe and deigaard 1992 14 c t γ u j w s δ j 3 c x j x j γ ν β s ν t c x j where c is the suspended sediment concentration the inverse of the schmidt number β s 1 is utilized i e the sediment diffusivity is taken as the same value of eddy viscosity w s is the sediment settling velocity determined by the approach of fredsøe and deigaard 1992 which is based on the drag coefficient of the falling sediment grains equation 14 is solved on a sub set of the main computational mesh where the near bed cells below a given reference level δ b are removed following the setting of fuhrman et al 2014 and larsen et al 2017 the reference level is set as δ b α 1 d 50 3 5d 50 in which d 50 is the mean grain size at this reference level a reference concentration c b boundary condition is imposed which is determined by the approach of engelund and fredsøe 1992 15 c b θ 0 6 1 1 λ b 3 16 λ b 2 κ 2 α 1 2 0 013 s θ θ θ c π 6 μ d p e f where α 1 is the multiplier of sediment diameter representing the height of the bed load transport as define above s ρ s ρ is the relative density of sediment and p ef is the probability of moving particles near the bed which is calculated by 17 p e f 1 π μ d 6 θ θ c 4 1 4 where θ is the shields number defined as 18 θ τ b ρ g s 1 d 50 u f 2 s 1 g d 50 where τ b is the bed shear stress and u f is the friction velocity throughout the present work the coefficient of dynamic friction is set to μ d 0 7 and the critical shields parameter θ c is calculated from a base value θ c0 0 05 accounting for bed slope effects as in roulund et al 2005 to prevent unphysical overloading conditions i e where the concentration just above the bed exceeds c b calculated from the reference concentration formula the solution suggested by justesen et al 1986 is invoked that is if the concentration close to the bed exceeds the reference concentration the value is in practice taken from the cell adjacent to the boundary the morphological change is computed based on the sediment continuity exner equation 19 h b t 1 1 n q b i x i e s d s i 1 2 where h b is the bed elevation n 0 4 is the bed porosity the right hand terms in eq 19 represent the contributions from the bed load transport q bi and suspended load transport e s and d s where e s and d s are erosion and deposition respectively calculated as 20 e s ν β s ν t c x 3 x 3 δ b 21 d s w s u 3 c b where x 3 and u 3 represent the position and velocity in vertical direction respectively here the sediment falls towards the bed which is defined as the positive direction for w s hence d s is positive base on eq 21 and e s is correspondingly negative based on eq 20 the difference between e s and d s determine the net change of bed due to suspended sediment transport the exner equation is based on instantaneous sediment transport fields and therefore the morphological and hydrodynamic times are equivalent to ensure that the bed slopes do not exceed the angle of repose a sand slide model described in detail by roulund et al 2005 is utilized in the present work this model is activated at positions where the local bed angle exceeds the angle of repose 32 and is deactivated once the local bed angle has been reduced to 31 9 the equations comprising the fully coupled model outlined above are solved numerically using the open source cfd package openfoam version 1 6 ext making use of a finite volume spatial discretization with a collocated variable arrangement in conjunction with a standard pimple algorithm the hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological models are solved separately on three different sets of mesh all of the adopted meshes are continuously synchronized to ensure that the locations of the shared vertices remain identical the coupling is achieved by mapping the necessary variables at the corresponding vertices from one mesh to another mesh the coupling at the interface between sediment and fluid is realized by the dynamic mesh method after the bed change in each time step is computed the computational mesh is updated to ensure that the bottom boundary of the mesh is conformal with the bed a laplace equation is solved for the motion of the mesh vertices again for further details the reader is referred to jacobsen et al 2014 the fully coupled model described above has been utilized on several scour related studies including pipeline scour fuhrman et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 and local scour around a monopile baykal et al 2015 2017 2017 larsen et al 2017 the previous works above involving the cfd simulation of scour with the present model made use of a rigid lid approximation and thus did not incorporate a free surface the present study extends these and hence represents the first simulations with this model to directly combine scour at the sea bed with a free surface 3 computational setup 3 1 computational cases description in the present numerical simulation the computational cases are identical to those of tonkin et al s 2003 laboratory experiments carried out in a large scale flume 135 m long 2 m wide and 5 m high a solitary wave was generated offshore approaching a sloping beach with a uniform slope of 1 20 the sediment used in the test was approximately uniform with the grain size being d 50 0 35 mm and the density being 2 643 103 kg m3 a vertical pile of diameter d 0 5 m was placed at 49 m from the toe of the slope which can be considered as about 1 10 of prototype scale two cases in tonkin et al s 2003 experiments named as case i and case iii were selected corresponding to case 1 and case 2 in the present numerical simulations and the detailed setups for the two cases are depicted in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively the offshore water depth is denoted as h and the height of the solitary wave measured from the still water level is denoted as h the origin of the coordinate system is defined at the still water surface above the slope toe with the longitudinal x axis parallel to the flume bed and pointing onshore the y axis vertical normal to the bottom of the flume and z axis normal to the side wall of the flume since the pile location is fixed the different still water depths for case 1 and case 2 correspond to the pile that is initially on the shoreline and 4 m offshore in the original experiments detailed measurements including water surface elevation velocity and scour depth were made at different locations which can be utilized to validate the present numerical model as shown in fig 1 c the stations a and b are located at the offshore side and 3 m away from the pile stations c d and e are located near the pile and specifically being offshore onshore and side of the pile respectively the test conditions for the two cases are listed in table 1 kc is the keulegan carpenter number defined by 22 k c u m t w d in which the velocity magnitude u m can be calculated based on first approximate solitary wave theory 23 u m h g h and t w is the effective wave period defined by 24 t w 2 π 4 3 g h h x b represents the horizontal position of wave breaking point which is an important information when dealing with breaking wave hydrodynamics by comparing x b with the pile location x 49 m it can be seen that the breaking wave is occurred in front of and behind the pile for case 1 and case 2 respectively 3 2 computational mesh the present numerical simulations are 3d cases the length of the computational domain i e in the x direction is 130 m from the inlet boundary at x 60 m to the outlet boundary at x 70 m the length between the inlet of wave generation to the toe of the slope is 60 m which is almost a full effective wave length this length enables initial solitary wave propagation while also maintaining reasonable computational costs also the outlet boundary is selected at a position away from the highest point of wave run up to avoid any influence of the outlet boundary the width of the computational domain i e in the z direction is 2 m which is identical to the width of the experimental flume the computational domain is discretized into finite volumes of quadrilateral blocks in varying shapes and dimensions fig 2 shows the computational mesh used in the vicinity of the pile during the computations the mesh is continuously updated to adjust to the changes of bed topography as shown in fig 2 b body fitted quadrilateral grids were used and refined close to the pile the total number of cells comprising the computational domain utilized is o 6 105 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of meshes used in the forthcoming simulation it is emphasized that considerable effort has been put into optimizing the computational mesh for convergence while at the same time keeping the computational time affordable regarding the influence of grid size on the computational results see the appendix a for the present computational cases the morphological change is very rapid especially when the incident wave arrives at the pile the scour deposition at the pile suddenly increases and the scour rate can reach 7 cm s since the dynamic mesh method was used in the simulation of morphology the rapid boundary movement can cause the first layer of cells near the bed to become highly distorted for example as shown in fig 3 a some cells can become stretched or compressed and even negative cells can arise when the bottom nodes move upward over the adjacent nodes this figure demonstrates the general difficulty of the mesh to respond to such sudden bed changes the deteriorated mesh quality made subsequent computations hard to converge eventually leading to unstable solutions this issue of mesh distortion was also pointed out by liu et al 2008 who used a mesh deformation approach to simulate moving bed to solve this problem here we propose and have used an approach of manually correcting the highly distorted meshes near the bed when such issues arise first the cells around the pile were scanned to identify the distorted ones such as the stretched or compressed cells apparent in fig 3 a subsequently the grids were redistributed in the vertical direction to guarantee that the height of the first layer of cells remains spatially consistent finally the mapfields tool existing in openfoam was utilized to map the variable data in the vertices of the old mesh to the corresponding corrected mesh thus guaranteeing the overall consistency of data before and after mesh correction fig 3 b indicates that the mesh quality is improved after correction enabling the computation to continue 3 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the computational domain are as follows the top boundary i e the top of the domain not the free surface will be modeled as a frictionless lid meaning that vertical air velocities were set to zero and horizontal velocities and scalar hydrodynamic quantities have zero vertical gradient at the sides of the computational domain zero gradient conditions are applied for all quantities except for the three components of the velocity where slip boundary conditions are applied to these at the friction wall boundary i e at the bottom and the pile surface following fuhrman et al 2014 and larsen et al 2017 a generalized wall function is utilized to determine the friction velocity as the sediment transport process will be modeled a hydraulically rough wall will be assumed and the nikuradse s equivalent sand roughness of the bed was taken as k s 2 5d 50 the surface roughness of the pile is kept sufficiently small k s 1 10 5 m such that it is effectively modeled as hydraulically smooth at the inlet left hand boundary waves2foam was used to generate a solitary wave for the right hand boundary a slip boundary condition was specified though it is emphasized that this is a sufficient distance away such that the water does not reach this boundary to maintain the stability and accuracy of the computation the courant number is set as 0 1 which is far less than 1 this value is referenced to the result proposed by larsen et al 2019 who noted that a small courant number is crucial for limiting the growth of spurious velocities in wave simulations it should be mentioned that in the morphology computation the time steps were taken to be exactly the same as in the hydrodynamic computation i e the morphological model did not make use of morphological rates averaged over any larger time scales or morphological acceleration the reason for this choice is the rapid change in the development of the bed during wave induced morphology requires close coupling between the hydrodynamics and the bed evolution to reduce the simulation time we used parallel computation with domain decomposition on six processors additionally since most of computational time is spent on the morphological simulation the morphological computation was started when the wave approaches to the pile this can be easily realized by selecting the results from rigid bed simulation at the time of wave approaching to the pile as the initial condition of the scour simulation to be consistent with the time duration of the experiment the physical time of simulation was set as 50 s for the mobile bed simulation it required approximately 20 days of cpu time for the same computational mesh and using the same computational power the rigid bed simulation for 50 s of physical time required approximately 5 days all computations were done on the clusters supported by high performance computing hpc competence center at the technical university of denmark in this study two parallel simulations were conducted 1 rigid bed simulations to investigate the flow features and hydrodynamic characteristics around the pile which will also serve to validate the hydrodynamic model and 2 sediment mobile bed simulations to validate the morphological model as well as analyze the scouring mechanism around the pile the conditions of the two kinds of simulation were exactly same in the rigid bed simulation the bottom of the computational domain was kept rigid by turning off the morphological model whereas in the sediment bed simulation the morphological model was turned on and therefore the bed was continuously updated 4 rigid bed simulations 4 1 hydrodynamic validation as shown in fig 4 the numerical results of velocity u and water surface elevation η at different stations for case 1 are compared to the experimental data to validate the hydrodynamic model the streamwise velocity corresponds to the location of 7 5 cm above the beach surface which is identical to the experiments the blue solid lines and black dots represent the computed and measured results respectively the time of t 0 is defined as the time when the incident wave just arrives at the offshore surface of the pile for stations a and b located a distance offshore from the pile see fig 1 c the computed and measured results agree quite well especially for η at station b fig 4 b the two lines almost overlap this implies that the wave propagation and transformation over the sloping bed as it advances towards the pile can be well simulated which is fundamental for the eventual simulation of wave interaction with the pile it is worth noting that the breaking solitary wave sequence over a slope including wave shoaling breaking run up draw down hydraulic jump and trailing wave has been reasonably reproduced by the present numerical model larsen and fuhrman 2019 for stations c and d located near the pile the computed results fit well with the measurements particularly during run up t 5 s however slight discrepancies can be found during wave draw down 5 s t 25 s the reason is that the pile is located at the shoreline area where the water depth is extremely small during draw down forming a thin layer flow which is difficult to be captured accurately by the present numerical model the comparisons for case 2 are also provided in fig 5 in which only the velocity at station a and water surface elevation at station b were included due to the limitation of measured data available in experiment it indicates that the computed results fit quite well with the measured results except for the peak value of η at station b table 3 presents the quantitative comparisons for the peak value of the time series of u and η the error between numerical and experimental value for all the data is less than 10 overall the simulated results are deemed satisfactory particularly considering the complexity in the physical process of a breaking solitary wave interaction with a pile in the following sections the flow features around the pile will be described in detail as well as the temporal variation of hydrodynamic characteristics during the wave interacting with the pile will be thoroughly analyzed 4 2 flow characteristics around the pile based on the reliable simulated results which have been validated above some flow characteristics around the pile will be described and discussed in detail including the water surface flow velocity and turbulence and bed shear stress the temporal variations of these hydrodynamic characteristics at different positions i e offshore side and onshore around the pile will be compared with the aim of identifying the scouring mechanism at different positions around the pile moreover the results from both case 1 and case 2 will be compared with the focus on the difference between the two cases 4 2 1 water surface to clearly and visually show the water surface features during the solitary wave interacting with the pile fig 6 provides the 3d view of free surface changes at several typical moments for case 1 and case 2 in each subplot the solitary wave propagates from the left offshore to the right onshore in fig 6 a the incident wave has already broken before arriving at the pile for case 1 when the breaking wave impinges on the pile the water surface in front of the pile rises significantly due to the blocking effect of pile fig 6 b in contrast the incident wave in case 2 does not break when it impacts on the pile fig 6 c as can be seen from fig 6 d the wave breaks behind the pile and the separation of the incident wave front by the pile meets in the shadow zone behind the pile the simulated free surface feature is consistent with the observation in experiment the breaking wave interaction with the pile in case 1 was also observed in the experiment of tonkin et al 2003 who pointed out that the breaking wave is the main reason for the formation of a horseshoe vortex in front of the pile to confirm this finding of flow feature as well as illustrate the underlying mechanism we further extracted the flow at the symmetrical plane in front of the pile figs 7 and 8 show the snapshots of flow red color represents the water and white color represents the air in front of the pile for case 1 and case 2 the streamline is also included in the figures to demonstrate the presence of vortex fig 7 a indicates that the incident wave breaks before it arrives at the pile and the breaker is a plunging type with an overturning flow occurred the plunging wave impacts on the pile resulting in the formation of downward flow and horseshoe vortex at the bed in front of the pile see the streamline plotted in fig 7 b the simulated result proves the finding of horseshoe vortex in the experiment in contrast this flow feature of horseshoe vortex is not found in case 2 fig 8 depicts the flow for case 2 at the moments of wave crest arriving at the pile and wave breaking behind the pile the streamline in front of the pile indicates no vortex formed during the process of wave impacting on the pile the difference of flow features between the two cases could be explained from the mechanism of horseshoe vortex generation for case 1 it is more like a current induced flow field around the pile in the case of current the generation of horseshoe vortex is closely related to the parameter of pile reynolds number re d the horseshoe vortex is more pronounced with the increase of re d in case 1 the plunging wave associated with high velocity overturning flow impacts on the pile which results in large value of re d consequently the horseshoe vortex in case 1 is expected to be more obvious for the flow in case 2 it is more like a wave induced flow field around the pile in wave case the horseshoe vortex is primarily governed by the kc number sumer et al 1997 small kc number means that the orbital motion of water particles is small relative to the pile diameter for very small kc number 6 the horseshoe vortex may not even be formed because the stroke of the fluid motion is not large enough for the approach boundary layer to separate hence there is no existence of horseshoe vortex in case 2 overall the pile location with respect to the breaking wave has great influences on the flow pattern around the pile and probably the resultant scour which will be discussed in the following section of scour simulation it needs to be noted that although the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile can be represented by the present numerical model the simulated horseshoe vortex is not as obvious as that observed in the experiment in fact the local flow field around the pile induced by the breaking wave is very complicated such as vortex flow and associated turbulence characteristics which is hard to be accurately simulated by the present hydrodynamic model further the scour modeling in front of the pile directly influenced by the horseshoe vortex will be correspondingly under predicted which can be seen in the following section of scour simulation to further quantify the difference of water surface between case 1 and case 2 the temporal variations of the water surface elevation η at different stations around the pile are plotted in fig 9 the stations are selected at offshore side and onshore positions close to the pile corresponding to c e and d as depicted in fig 1 c the variation tendency for both case 1 and case 2 looks similar the difference for the absolute value is due to the different initial water elevation in the two cases i e η 0 m and 0 2 m for case 1 and case 2 respectively it can be seen from both scenarios that the peak value of η occurs when the incident wave arrives at each station and the peak value at the offshore station is the largest while the peak value at the onshore station is relatively small due to energy dissipation during the process of wave impacting on the pile during the wave drawing down the value of η at the onshore station is generally higher than the other two stations because the backwater is formed at back of the pile 4 2 2 flow velocity and turbulence fig 10 presents the temporal variation of streamwise velocity u near the bed during the process of a solitary wave interacting with the pile the near bed velocity is for the location of 1 mm above the bed the results at the offshore side and onshore positions near the pile corresponding to c e and d as depicted in fig 1 c are plotted some similar features can be found for both case 1 and case 2 at the same locations it is obvious that the value of u is very low at the offshore location while it appears to fluctuate at the end of wave drawing down the velocity to the side of the pile is generally high and reaches the peak value when the wave crest arrives at the side position and subsequently decreases rapidly to zero during run up during draw down the velocity at the side position increases gradually again and this feature together with the high velocity lasts a relatively long time it implies that the long time inundation of flow with high velocity will induce the secondary increase of scour during wave drawing down for the velocity at the onshore pile position its peak value arises during draw down and the occurrence of the peak for case 2 is delayed relative to case 1 interestingly the fluctuation of the velocity at the onshore pile position is found in case 1 during run up whereas this feature is not found in case 2 this feature of velocity fluctuating for case 1 is probably due to the influence of breaking wave on the flow as described above to illustrate the variation of flow turbulence around the pile during the process of wave running up and drawing down the time series of turbulent kinetic energy k near the bed for case 1 and case 2 are plotted in fig 11 in case 1 the plunging breaker induces high turbulent flow in front of the pile which results in large value of k at the offshore or even the onshore position in contrast the value of k is comparatively smaller in case 2 because the breaker is not occurred in front of the pile this phenomenon is in agreement with the observation by tonkin et al 2003 who also noted that this is a reason for the more apparent scour occurred at the pile front in case 1 for the side point the two cases exhibit similar variation tendency and the value of k is almost quantitatively consistent in other words it seems that the breaking wave does not have a significant influence on the flow turbulence at the side of the pile combining with the results of flow velocity described above it can be seen that for the side point both the flow velocity and flow turbulence show consistent for case 1 and case 2 this implies that the scouring at the pile side for the two cases is consistent which can be seen from the following discussion on the scour results 4 2 3 bed shear stress the bed shear stress is normally regarded as a crucial quantity which directly drives sediment transport and bed scour fig 12 shows the bed shear stress magnitude τ around the pile the subplots a and c correspond to the time when the peak of τ at the pile side arises during run up subplots b and d correspond to the peak time during draw down it indicates that the area with high magnitude of bed shear stress is larger during draw down specifically during wave running up the large value of τ is located within the side area of the pile while for the wave drawing down the large value of τ occurs in both the onshore and the side areas of the pile and extends further to the separated region of the pile fig 13 presents the temporal variation of the bed shear stress τ at different locations around the pile in general the variation of bed shear stress is very similar to the flow velocity plotted in fig 10 partly due to the velocity selected near the bed in case 1 of offshore position a small peak with negative value is found at the time of incident wave impacting on the pile which is mainly due to the existence of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile this is the main mechanism for the larger scour depth at pile front in case 1 it is obvious that the value of τ at the side point is generally larger and two peaks occur at both run up and draw down stages for the onshore position the bed shear stress is amplified at the end of wave drawing down which implies that scour start to increase at this stage 5 scour simulations 5 1 general morphological change without the pile when a pile mounted on a sloping beach is exposed to waves two types of scour emerge the general morphological change of the beach as the background without the pile and scour around the pile that is the local scour before the 3d simulation of local scour around the pile the morphological change of a sloping beach that is identical to the experiment of tonkin et al 2003 was first computed based on a 2d simulation fig 14 presents the temporal variations of some quantities for both two cases at the location of x 49 m this location is exactly at the initial shoreline of case 1 which is also the pile position in the forthcoming 3d local scour simulation it shows that when the incident wave arrives at the location i e t 0 the hydrodynamic quantities i e η τ and k increase rapidly to the peak resulting in the initiation of bed erosion compared to case 1 the first peak value of bed shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy for case 2 is smaller which results in that the early erosion of case 2 is correspondingly less obvious than that of case 1 during draw down the value of τ and k increases again to the second peak which induces further bed erosion the positive bed elevation during draw down for case 2 means deposition occurred this is due to the position of x 49 m for case 2 is on the offshore side of the shoreline during drawn down for case 2 the scoured sediment is transported to the offshore forming the bed deposition at the position of x 49 m fig 15 depicts the bed profiles exposed to a solitary wave for case 1 and case 2 in which the incident wave propagates from left to right it can be seen that the general tendencies of the two profiles are similar and both profiles show that erosion occurs on the onshore side whereas deposition occurs on the offshore side as the positions of the initial shoreline for case 1 and case 2 are different the positions of erosion and deposition also correspondingly differ it is found that for case 2 the general erosion and deposition pattern shifts towards the onshore for example the maximum deposition and erosion are located at x 44 m and x 49 m for case 1 whereas these occur at x 47 m and x 52 m for case 2 additionally the maximum deposition heights for both cases are approximately 2 cm and the maximum erosion depths are no more than 1 cm we focus on the position of the pile i e x 49 m where the erosion depth is approximately 0 5 cm in both cases however from the following local scour simulation it demonstrates that the local scour depth at the pile can reach up to 10 cm therefore the general morphological change without the pile is much smaller than the local scour at the pile which further indicates that the superposition of general bed change is minimal and can be considered as negligible in the total scour prediction 5 2 local scour around the pile 5 2 1 scour validation the 3d view of local scour hole around the pile is illustrated in fig 16 in which the incident wave propagates from left offshore to the right onshore it is worth noting that the scour results presented in the figure are based on the coarse computational mesh which has been tested in the appendix of mesh convergence we can find that an obvious ridge is formed on the offshore of the pile induced by the drawing down swash which is similar to the morphology behind the pile exposed to current fig 17 presents the comparison of final scour morphology around the pile between numerical and experimental results for case 1 fig 17 b is adopted from fig 5 of tonkin et al 2003 as the scour hole is symmetrical around the center of the flume only one side is shown it can be seen that the computed and measured scour patterns are similar from the distribution of bed elevation contour lines the computed maximum scour depth is approximately 8 cm which is almost the same as the measured result the position of the maximum scour depth is also reasonably predicted however the scour morphology at the offshore of the pile shows notable difference the numerical result shows a clear ridge bed and two scoured gully at the offshore location while this scour pattern is not observed from the experiment at least from the fig 17 b with low resolution the reason for the scoured gully could be illustrated from the bed shear stress as previously discussed in fig 12 it clearly shows that during the wave drawing down the bed shear stress at the offshore side increases significantly due to flow separated downstream of the pile consequently the bed scour is occurred due to the amplified bed shear stress resulting in the formation of scoured gully to make a further quantitative comparison the temporal variations of scour depth at different positions around the pile are plotted in fig 18 the solid lines and dots represent the numerical and experimental results respectively it can be seen that the scour depth at the offshore location is under predicted as pointed previously the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile is not as accurately modeled as observed in the experiment and the horseshoe vortex is normally regarded as the main factor driving sediment erosion such that the resulting scour in front of the pile may be under predicted additionally no visible horseshoe type vortex has formed in case 2 as a result less scour occurs immediately after impact compared to case 1 in which the horseshoe vortex was formed by the plunging breaker in front of the pile the simulated results are in agreement with the experimental results for the side location near the pile the tendency of scour variation is reasonably simulated which yields two obvious peaks occurring during run up and draw down the simulated scour developments for the two cases look similar as aforementioned analysis on the hydrodynamic characteristics at the side of the pile the near bed flow velocity turbulence and bed shear stress also illustrate double peaked features due to streamline contraction and flow separation as a result the scour at the side of the pile increases twice during run up and draw down the scouring mechanism at the side position of the pile is similar to the situation exposed to a current such as a river bridge pile environment this feature is well reproduced by the present numerical model for the onshore location the rapid scour occurs at the end of wave drawdown where strong back washing flow is formed resulting in significant sediment transport considering the temporal variation of the near bed velocity as well as the bed shear stress see figs 10 and 13 we can see the backwash velocity has a similar magnitude as the uprush velocity but with much longer time duration hence the total flow intensity thus the total ability for transporting sediment during the backwash is much more significant than during the uprush stage however the computed maximum scour depth at the onshore location is smaller than the experimental result particularly for case 1 where the pile is located at the initial shoreline tonkin et al 2003 pointed out that the scouring mechanism at the onshore of the pile cannot be explained only in terms of the traditional bed shear stress but also requires inclusion of the pore pressure gradients sumer et al 2011 also found that the pore water pressure has a great impact on the sediment transport during wave drawing down this factor of pore water pressure is not taken into account in the present numerical model however in general the agreement is considered satisfactory and the results obtained from the present numerical model can be considered promising particularly considering the complexity of the coupled hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological processes involved in general the present numerical model is capable of reasonably simulating the scour around the pile mounted on a slope exposed to a solitary wave especially for the maximum scour depth and its corresponding position after encountering a solitary wave by thoroughly analyzing the temporal variations of scour depth at different locations around the pile we can see that the scouring mechanism is also different in order to improve the modeling result it is necessary to improve the modeling of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile as well as account for the influence of pore water pressure in the sediment transport model 5 2 2 discussion on the effect of pile location based on the comparison of the two cases presented above the pile location with respect to the wave breaking point plays a prominent role on the flow field around the pile as well as the associated scour depth due to the large computational expenses associated with the advanced fully coupled cfd models especially for the present cases with the complex nature of the physical processes only two scenarios were added the numerical setups for the two additional cases are the same with case 1 except for the different pile position relative to breaker point as a result in the total three cases the pile is located in front of the breaker approximately at the breaker and behind the breaker fig 19 a shows the temporal developments of scour depth at the pile side for different pile locations the distance from the breaking point to the pile δx b is normalized by the pile diameter d δx b d 0 means that the pile is located exactly at the breaking point the negative and positive values of δx b d means that the pile is located at offshore and onshore of the breaking point the results show that the general variation tendency of scour development is similar for the three cases and the scour depth increases twice during wave run up and draw down we further extracted the maximum scour depth s max during the process of run up and draw down which is plotted versus δx b d in fig 19 b the results indicate that the larger value of scour depth s max d occurs when the pile is located closer to the breaker point when the pile is located away from the breaker point in either direction onshore or offshore the maximum scour depth at the pile side reduces it is worth noting that the current discussion on the effect of pile location is a preliminary test due to the limited data in the future more numerical cases in terms of different pile location need to be further conducted and a clear relationship is expected to be identified to guide the engineering design 6 summary and conclusions a fully coupled hydrodynamic and morphologic numerical model based on the open source cfd package openfoam is presented based on jacobsen et al 2014 and utilized to simulate flow and scour around a pile mounted on a sloping beach exposed to a solitary wave the hydrodynamic model is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations together with k ω turbulence closure and volume of fluid vof method for capturing the free surface waves are generated using the waves2foam package the sediment transport consists of both bed load and suspended load descriptions and the latter is based on a turbulent diffusion equation the morphological model is based on the sediment continuity exner equation accounting for sand slide adjustments the present numerical model is validated and tested against a large scale laboratory experiment of tonkin et al 2003 the hydrodynamic characteristics and flow features around the pile are described in detail as well as the scouring mechanism at different locations of the pile is thoroughly analyzed a preliminary test on the effect of pile location is additionally discussed the rigid bed simulations show that the numerical results agree quite well with the experimental results in terms of water surface elevation and velocity around the pile particularly considering the complexity in the physical process of a breaking solitary wave interaction with a pile the simulated result confirms that the plunging breaker ahead of the pile induces the formation of horseshoe vortex in front of the pile in contrast no horseshoe vortex is formed when the wave breaks behind the pile the breaking wave also induces high flow turbulence at the offshore and onshore of the pile the temporal variation of hydrodynamic characteristics at the side of the pile shows a double peaked feature which occurred at the times during run up and draw down for the onshore location of the pile the bed shear stress is amplified at the end of wave drawing down the scour simulations show that the present numerical model can reasonably simulate the scour morphology around the pile especially for the prediction of the maximum scour depth and its position the temporal variation of scour depth at the side of the pile is reasonably simulated while those at the offshore and onshore are under predicted this is due to the underestimation of the horseshoe vortex in front of the pile and not accounting for pore water pressures the general morphological change of the beach without the pile is sufficiently small such that it can be considered as negligible in the total scour prediction the scour at the offshore of the pile is mainly induced by the horseshoe vortex the scour at the side of the pile increases twice during run up and draw down which is mainly due to the separation flow inducing high bed shear stress the scour at the onshore location of the pile starts to increase rapidly at the end of wave drawdown due to the strong back washing flow the larger scour depth occurs when the pile is located closer to the wave breaking point to the best of our knowledge this is the first three dimensional simulation investigating the scouring process around a monopile mounted on a slope subjected to free surface wave deformation and breaking based on an advanced cfd model we believe that this model can be extended to study the flow and morphology through multiple piles with

the computational results we tested two different meshes as shown in fig a 20 in which the fine mesh is refined with cells twice as small compared to the coarse mesh the coarse mesh is the present mesh used in this work it clearly shows that the computed wave surface elevations and velocity by the two meshes are quite similar especially during run up almost overlapped as a check of convergence it can be noted that further refinements in the mesh yield the same results thus to balance the computational precision and speed the coarse mesh has been adopted fig a 20 comparison of velocity and

20653,the performance of the three hybrid mooring systems was studied by conducting 1 40 model tests of a moored point absorber subjected to regular and irregular waves the compact hybrid mooring adopts two segments design i e a top synthetic fibre rope polyester or nylon and a bottom chain a submerged buoy is installed on the joint between these two segments another design that installs two clumped weights at the end part of the chain in the nylon mooring system is also investigated seventeen regular and three irregular wave tests were conducted heave and pitch resonance wave conditions were tested to study the system dynamics in resonance modes results show that the nylon rope is a favourable material for mooring ropes of wave energy converters in terms of energy conversion efficiency compared with nylon rope polyester restricts wec heave motion responses effectively and reduces the energy conversion efficiency of the floater studied in this work the compact compliant mooring system design that consists of nylon rope buoy chain and clumped weights is the best mooring concept for the specified floater in this work it demonstrates that when pretension is not large enough during the tests the mooring will experience slack configuration during the random waves keywords experimental study point absorber compact hybrid mooring systems polyester rope nylon rope hydrodynamic responses 1 introduction the exploitation of renewable energy has received considerable concerns in recent decades due to global warming solar wind and wave energy are the three main sustainable energy resources while wave energy owns the highest energy density falnes 2007 the history of developing wave energy converts wecs has been listed for decades a variety of wecs have been developed and these devices can be classified according to the size and direction of the device with respect to the incident wave guedes soares et al 2012 lópez et al 2013 mainly including point absorbers attenuators and terminators the development of wecs is closely associated with the installation location the first generation of wecs is shoreline stationary devices which are installed on the sea bottom or rocky cliff such as the oscillating water columns owcs falcão 2015 rezanejad and guedes soares 2018 the second generation is the nearshore devices which are generally attached to the seabed with the water depth varying between 10m and 25m the wave energy densities in the open sea are much greater than that in the shoreline and nearshore in view of this the third generation wecs which are usually installed in a water depth of more than 40m are receiving the most concerns it was pointed out that most of the wecs projects focus on floating devices while the point absorbers have become the most popular equipment due to their relatively simple technology and easy maintenance lópez et al 2013 xu et al 2019 the mooring system is an essential component of the floating system whose main role is to keep the floating structure on the station as for wecs in addition to the station keeping the mooring system may interact with energy harvesting activities the catenary taut and slack mooring systems are three common mooring concepts with different working principles the catenary chain provides restoring force to the top floating structure by the weight of the suspended segments while restoring force of the taut mooring line comes from line axial stretching however for the wecs that operate in shallow water relative to deepwater offshore oil and gas exploitation activities both of these two mooring configurations have some disadvantages for the catenary mooring line the catenary effect is weakened in shallow water since the suspended length is limited in other words the length of the segment laid down on the seabed needs to be long enough to prevent it from being fully lifted which is strictly forbidden as a consequence the catenary mooring line for wecs is extremely long and with a heavy chain which increases the mooring footprint as well as cost significantly as for the taut mooring line large tension peaks can frequently occur because a small movement could induce large stretching in shallow water as for the slack mooring it was found that the snap events can be easily triggered in the survival wave conditions which gives rise to tremendous spike tension and can endanger the system safety xu et al 2018c 2020 2018c xu and guedes soares 2020 it is seen that the mooring design for wecs is a great challenge the mooring system design needs to satisfy several requirements johanning and smith 2008 xu et al 2019 e g ensuring device survivability not adversely affecting the energy harvesting performance compliant enough to reduce mooring loads and small footprint as a consequence in the applications of wecs station keeping compliant mooring is preferable the catenary spread mooring system catenary anchor leg mooring calm system and single anchor leg mooring salm system are recommended for wecs due to their safe station keeping and moderate installation costs harris et al 2004 the performance and costs of three single point mooring systems for a large dimensional wec were studied by thomsen et al 2017 2016 including three catenary chain legs mooring system six taut synthetic fibre ropes mooring system and salm the salm is the most recommended mooring solution which exhibits high compliance and low costs in addition to the salm the hybrid mooring system concepts which were proposed for the deepwater offshore structures station keeping ji and yuan 2015 xu et al 2018a 2018b 2018b yuan et al 2014 have been successfully applied in wecs according to the experimental results it was concluded that the hybrid mooring systems demonstrate good performance in preventing snap loads xu et al 2018c 2020 2018c xu and guedes soares 2020 furthermore it has a positive effect on the energy conversion efficiency of a point absorber that utilizes heave motion response to harvest wave energy xu et al 2020 the energy harvesting performance is one of the highest concerns during wec system design in addition to the pto gaspar et al 2018 2021 2021 rodríguez et al 2019 calvario et al 2020 the mooring system may affect wecs power harvesting performance a high performance mooring system for wecs should not only have the capability to keep the wec in station in survival condition but also not to reduce the wec power capture ability cerveira et al 2013 have concluded that a realistic mooring system composed of catenary chain lines has a negligible influence on the dynamics and captured wave energy of a point absorber that takes advantage of two degrees of freedom to produce energy zanuttigh et al 2013 carried out 1 30 model scale model tests to study the effects of mooring configuration on the energy harvesting performance of the dexa wec which utilizes relative pitch motion to generate energy in contrast to cerveira et al 2013 they concluded that the mooring configuration has a certain effect on energy harvesting performance the calm mooring system always leads to greater power production than the spread catenary mooring especially when the wave direction is aligned with the device axis sergiienko et al 2016 studied the effect of mooring configuration on the performance of a three tether submerged point absorber in their study the pto system is integrated into the mooring system two configurations were studied i a wec locates close to the sea surface with a low mass ratio design ratio of wec mass to the mass of water displaced by the wec ii a heavy and deeply submerged buoy it was found that in the first configuration the optimal mooring angle is sensitive to wave frequency for the second case the produced energy is highly dependent on the inclination angle the cost of the mooring system accounts for a great part of the wec project budget which could be as much as 18 fitzgerald 2009 it is concluded that the mooring systems of wecs should be cost effective and compliant enough for most of the motion dependent wecs fortunately the synthetic fibre ropes provide a favourable solution to the wecs mooring system the axial stiffness of synthetic fibre ropes is much smaller than that of chain and wire besides synthetic fibre ropes are cheaper than wire and chain for instance the indicative costs of chain and synthetic rope in 2014 were 4140 tonne and 161 000 tonne respectively thomsen et al 2016 it has pointed out that synthetic fibre ropes have great potential in the application of marine renewable energy devices wang et al 2019 weller et al 2015 polyester and nylon ropes are the two most recommended materials for the mooring ropes of marine renewable energy devices weller et al 2015 however they point out that the polyester might be too stiff to deal with the snap loads especially for the mooring of shallow water wecs thomsen et al 2016 plenty of studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of synthetic ropes for wecs wang et al 2019 2021 however there is still no research to deal with the differences of wecs hydrodynamic responses caused by moorings using different synthetic fibre ropes because their mechanical properties are very complicated the current numerical tools are not capable to deal with these problem such as creep phenomenon viscoelastic and viscoplastic characteristics huang et al 2015 lian et al 2018 after an extensive review it is seen that the mooring rope of wecs should be flexible enough to prevent or reduce the snap load events furthermore the stiff mooring system can interfere with energy conversion performances for the motion dependent wecs whose mooring systems are not integrated into the pto systems the synthetic fibre ropes are favourable material to act as mooring ropes of wecs and the influence of synthetic fibre rope materials on wecs hydrodynamic responses and mooring dynamics need to be clarified in this study three compact and compliant mooring systems are designed for wecs a series of model tests were conducted to study the hydrodynamic responses of a point absorber moored by these three mooring systems according to the experimental data the effects of mooring rope materials and clumped weights on system hydrodynamic responses and mooring dynamics are studied finally the preferable synthetic fibre rope and hybrid mooring concept are recommended 2 research methodology 2 1 decay analysis decay tests are carried out to obtain the linear damping coefficient and the natural periods of the concerned degree of freedoms of the wec the decay motions of wecs are similar to those of a spring mass damper system and considering the decay curves the time interval between two continuous peaks is defined as the natural period the linear damping coefficient is determined by the log decrement ratio of peaks 1 γ 1 n ln x i x i n 2 ζ γ 4 π 2 γ 2 where γ is the log decrement ratio ζ is the linear damping coefficient x is the amplitude subscript i and n is the index of motion peaks 2 2 point absorber energy conversion performance analysis according to the linear wave theory the average energy flux of incident wave on point absorber is defined as falnes 2002 3 p w 1 8 d ρ g h w 2 c g where d is the diameter of point absorber ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration h w is the wave height c g is the incident wave group velocity which is given by 4 c g c 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where c is the phase velocity of incident wave k is the wave number h is the water depth the relation between c and k is given as 5 c ω k once the wave frequency ω is known the wave number can be solved by the dispersion relation 6 ω 2 g k tanh k h as for the random waves the mean incident random wave energy power p rw on wec is calculated as falnes 2002 7 p r w d ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω where s ω is the wave spectrum density theoretically the instantaneous wave power captured by the point absorber is defined as 8 p s b pto v z 2 where v z is the heave velocity of wec in this study it is calculated by the central difference scheme 9 v z z i 1 z i 1 2 t s where t s is the time step the averaged captured wave energy over a certain time can be calculated as 10 p b 1 t 0 t b pto v z 2 d t where b pto is the linear damping coefficient of the power take off pto system the energy conversion efficiency is then calculated as zang et al 2018 11 ξ p b p w 2 3 governing equation of wec motion responses the governing equation of wec motion response is written as 12 m a x c x k x 0 t h t τ x τ d τ f w a v e f c f d f m f pto where m is the body mass matrix a is the infinite added mass matrix c is the damping matrix

calculated as 14 f pto 3 3 b pto z t k pto z t where z t and z t are the displacement and velocity of the buoy in heave kpto is the stiffness of pto the other items in the matrix f pto are equal to zeros 3 model descriptions 3 1 point absorber to evaluate the performance of the compact and compliant hybrid mooring system proposed in this work a point absorber is used in the model tests at a scale of 1 40 as seen in fig 1 a point absorber was designed to harvest wave energy by taking advantage of its heave motion response and a series of model tests were carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of this wec the wec is a cylindrical conical structure and a similar design is also seen in the study of sinha et al 2016 and kamarlouei et al 2020 the computational fluid dynamic cfd method was applied by jin et al 2019 to study the hydrodynamic responses of three cylindrical point absorber with different bottoms it was found that the device with a 90 conical streamlined bottom was superior to the ones with flat bottom and hemisphere streamlined in energy capture in fig 1 a it is seen that the height of the conical bottom is 75 mm and the vertical distance between fairleads and bottom is 35 cm the main parameters of the wec model are shown in table 1 where φ is the diameter δ is the free draft of wec without mooring lines being installed δ denotes displacement and rxx ryy rzz are the gyration radius about x y and z axis respectively the origin of the coordinate system is shown in fig 1 a the height of the centre of gravity is 16 3 cm where the baseline is at the bottom of the model 3 2 pto and hybrid mooring systems the pto system is an essential component of a wec which plays the role to convert wave energy into electric power in the model tests the pto system is usually discarded due to the complexity to scaled down pto in model scale moura paredes et al 2016 sheng et al 2014 unfortunately the pto system could affect wec hydrodynamic responses due to its damping and stiffness to simulate the effect of pto system and simplify testing procedure yang et al 2020 2018 used a heave plate and a linear spring to simulate the damping and stiffness of pto system in this study the similar design was adopted as seen in fig 2 a square steel plate was used as the heave plate during the model tests the length and width of heave plate is 10 cm and the thickness is 1 mm the heave plate was rigidly fixed to a connection bar to ensure that the movement of heave plate follows the motion of the wec the connection bar was made of steel rod which was 50 cm in length the heave plate was fixed 80 cm underwater when the wec was free floating to reduce the influence of wave motion on heave plate a wire with a length of 928 6 mm including the clamps on both ends was used to connect heave plate and spring the diameter of wire is 3 5 mm and the mass per unit length in air is 0 108 kg with the clamps considered the stiffness of spring is 29 22n m which is used to simulate the stiffness of pto on the bottom of wave flume a load sensor was installed to measure the wire tension the sketch of pto system is shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows the schematics of hybrid mooring systems which consist of three mooring legs as seen in fig 3 a one concept of mooring leg is composed of synthetic fibre rope submerged buoy and chain the mass of the spherical buoy is 0 436 kg and its buoyancy is 10n as seen in fig 3 the submerged buoy is installed on the joint between these two segments the length of synthetic fibre rope and chain is 1 23m and 1 7m respectively hereafter the hybrid mooring system is denoted as the hnb when nylon rope is used and the wec hnb mooring system is generally called the nylon system in this study it is named hyb when the polyester rope is adopted and the wec hyb mooring system is called the polyester system in fig 3 b it is seen that the hnbw is designed with two additional clumped weights attached to the bottom chain of the nylon rope and the wec hnbw mooring system is called the nylon with weights system the mass of cm1 and cm2 in the air are 0 511 kg and 1 229 kg respectively the distance between these two clumped weights is 10 cm and the distance of cm2 to the anchor point is 10 cm fig 4 shows the clumped weight models used in the model tests the main parameters of mooring rope are given in table 2 where d a is the nominal diameter w is mass per unit length in air r denotes mooring radius le is the effective length of mooring rope two clamps with a length of 55 mm were used to connect the synthetic rope to the hook on the wec and mooring chain the total length of the synthetic fibre rope is 1 34m both the nylon and polyester are braided 16 strand ropes the length of the hook is 65 mm and its weight is 53g the axial stiffness ea of the chain is linear which is estimated to be 810 000n xu et al 2019 however the axial stiffness of synthetic fibre ropes shows strong nonlinearity and the sophisticated model tests are necessary the tension extension characteristics of synthetic fibre ropes were tested at tianjin university the loading elements the equipment foundation the measurement system and the water cycling system constitute the experimental system for testing fibre ropes the detailed descriptions of the experimental system can be found in lian et al 2018 liu et al 2014 the static tension elongation properties were measured after the bedding in procedure and the relations between tension and strain for these two ropes are fitted based on the experimental data 15 t n y l o n 0 025 3 719 ε 60 535 ε 2 58 341 ε 3 16 t p o l y e s t e r 0 019 10 936 ε 17 894 ε 2 883 169 ε 3 where ε is the strain and the unit of tension is kn the comparisons between measured and fitted tension elongation properties are shown in fig 5 it is observed that the tension elongation curves are well fitted by eqs 15 and 16 and the stiffness of polyester is greater than nylon as seen in fig 6 the mooring system consists of three mooring legs and the azimuth angle between each two mooring legs is 120 the pretensions of each mooring leg are listed in table 3 during the model tests it was designed to set the same pretension for each different mooring lines to exclude the differences of system dynamics caused by mooring pretension however it is difficult to implement due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties and water absorbing phenomenon of synthetic ropes 4 experimental set up a series of hydrodynamic model tests were conducted in the towing tank of etsin universidad politécnica de madrid at a scale of 1 40 the tank is 3 8m in width and 96m in length the water depth is 2 107m one may consider that the properties of synthetic fibre mooring ropes in full scale cannot be scaled down well by applying the small diameter ropes in the model tests however it should be noticed that the main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of synthetic fibre mooring material on hydrodynamic responses of wecs rather than to predict the dynamic responses of the prototype system generally the axial stiffness of prototype mooring is modelled by a linear spring during the hydrodynamic model tests however the stiffness of synthetic rope is nonlinear and the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties cannot be modelled if a linear spring is adopted as a consequence using synthetic fibre ropes directly on the wec model is the best way to study the concerned issue in this work all the experimental data are converted to full scale based on froude similitude law it should be noticed that the converted data do not represent the dynamic responses of prototype systems but to compare the responses between different systems fig 7 shows the sketch of the experimental set up the model was installed 35m away from the wave paddle to reduce the influence of the reflection wave on system dynamics as seen in fig 7 three wave probes were arranged around the wec model to measure wave elevation time series the wave gauge wp1 was installed 2 4m in front of the wec wp2 was placed 1 2 m to the starboard of wec and the wp3 was installed 1 96 m after wec an optical tracking system was applied to measure six degrees of freedoms motion responses with several optical motion markers arranged on the top deck of wec as shown in fig 8 a three load cells were installed on the top frame to record the mooring tension time series the sampling frequency of all sensors was set to be 50 hz fig 8 shows the snapshot of the polyester system during the regular wave model tests 5 decay tests surge heave and pitch decay tests were carried out to obtain the corresponding natural periods of different systems the comparisons of surge and heave decay curves between different systems are shown in fig 9 where it is seen that the differences in decay curves between different systems are limited however checking the heave decay curves carefully it is seen that the heave motion amplitude of the polyester system is dissipated more rapidly than that of the nylon system it indicates that the polyester system has greater heave damping than the nylon system based on the decay curves the natural period and linear damping coefficient ζ can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 the natural heave and surge periods of different systems as well as their linear damping coefficients in these two modes are shown in table 4 where linear damping coefficients of pitch are not given the measured motion amplitude of the pitch decay curve is not perfectly reduced with time due to the interference of other motion responses during the decay tests in other words the linear damping coefficient of pitch motion cannot be estimated accurately it is seen that the mooring material and clump weights have a limited influence on system natural periods in these three modes the natural periods of different systems are close in corresponding motion mode i e the surge natural period is around 32s and the natural period of heave and pitch is close to 7s and 8s respectively it is because the hydrostatic stiffness of wec plays the dominant role in heave and pitch motions and the mooring systems provide similar restoring stiffness to wec in surge since the mooring ropes of the different system have very close pretensions the natural surge period of the nylon system with weights is slightly greater than that of the other two systems it is explained that the nylon system with weights has the smallest mooring pretensions among these three mooring systems as seen in table 3 besides the polyester induces the greatest heave damping due to its large axial stiffness while the heave damping of the nylon system with weights is the smallest due to the installed clumped weights which play the role to prevent the line stretching and reduce mooring dynamics correspondingly xu et al 2016 2018b 6 regular wave tests a series of regular wave model tests were conducted to study the wec hydrodynamic responses and mooring dynamics in head seas and the response amplitude operators raos can then be obtained seventeen regular wave cases are tested the incident wave period varies from 0 7s to 2s model scale and the wave height is equal to 0 05m i e 2m in full scale for all the cases the three main motion raos of different systems in head seas are plotted in fig 10 in fig 10 a two peaks can be found in the surge motion the first one is near to 4 9s for all tested systems while the second one is different which is around 7 3s for the nylon systems and 8s for the polyester system it should be noticed that both of these two peak periods are not the natural surge period according to the surge decay tests and the second peak may be generated due to the coupling effect of surge with the heave motion the influence of the mooring system on surge motion response is related to the incident wave period for instance the surge motion response of the nylon system with weights is slightly greater than that of the nylon system when the incident wave period is smaller than 8s especially when t is equal to 7 3s in the case of the wave period is smaller than 5 6s or greater than 8s the wec shows larger surge motion responses when it is moored by polyester compared to the nylon with weights comparing the raos curve of surge with that of pitch it is found that the variations of surge motion response to the incident wave period is similar to the results of pitch motion when the wave period is less than 10s it indicates that the pitch motion of wec is coupled to surge response the heave motion is the most concerned one in this study since it was supposed that the wec takes advantage of heave motion to extract wave energy the wec heave raos of the different system are compared in fig 10 b the significant peaks are found in each heave motion raos curve and the peak periods are close to the natural heave periods the heave motion response of the polyester system is smaller than that of the other two systems in most of the tested cases the reason can be found in table 4 where it can be seen that the polyester system has the greatest heave damping the difference of heave responses between the nylon systems are limited when the incident wave period is less than 6 9s where the heave responses of the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights however an inverse result is seen once the t 6 9s it is understood that the wec moves slightly in heave when the incident wave period is small and in these cases the installed clumped weights could interfere with the wec heave motion when the incident wave period approaches the natural period the heave response increases dramatically which causes the mooring line stretching as a result the nylon system with weights has slightly greater heave motion responses than that of the nylon system when the t 6 9s as stated above two peaks are observed in the pitch raos curves while the most significant one occurs near the natural pitch period it is seen that the polyester system shows greater pitch motion responses than the other two systems in most of the tested wave conditions the most significant differences are found when the wave period approaches the natural pitch period it is explained that the wec adopts a large draft design and the special mooring connections the pitch moment comes from the mooring system increases wec pitch responses the stiffer mooring system will cause larger pitch responses the pitch motion is more prominent when the incident wave period approaches the natural pitch period the differences in pitch motion between the nylon systems are limited when t 8s based on the recorded mooring tension time series during the tests the tension raos of all mooring ropes are obtained and the results are shown in fig 11 it is seen that two main peaks occur on the curves and the peak tension periods are near the peak periods of surge and pitch it indicates that the surge and pitch motions are strongly associated with mooring tensions the 1m is the most loaded mooring among these three mooring lines in the head sea conditions in fig 11 a it is seen that though the 1m tension of the nylon with weights is slightly greater than that of nylon in most cases the results of the two systems are close it indicates that the attached clumped weights on the mooring line will not significantly affect the mooring dynamics the slight difference in mooring tension is due to differences in the surge and pitch motion responses between the two systems which can be seen in fig 10 the 1m tension results of polyester and nylon show that the top segment mooring material has limited influence on mooring dynamics when the incident wave period is less than 8s but its effect becomes notable when t 8s due to symmetrically arrangement the mooring dynamics of 2m and 3m are similar the tension differences between them are mainly caused by pretensions in fig 11 c it is observed that the mooring tension raos curve of nylon with weights is below that of nylon it is explained that the difference of 3m pretension between these two mooring systems is large enough to induce the obvious differences in mooring dynamics in table 3 it is seen that the 3m pretension of nylon with weights is 10 4 smaller than nylon as stated above a linear dummy damping coefficient is introduced to quantify the produced energy of wec then the energy conversion efficiency can be obtained by applying eq 11 in this study the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system in the first regular wave test t 4 43s is taken as the reference value and the energy conversion efficiency in different cases is normalized by using the ratio between efficiency in the current case and reference value the energy harvest performance of different systems is compared in fig 12 it is seen that trend of the energy conversion efficiency curve is identical to the heave motion raos the energy capturing performance increases with the incident wave period then it reduces significantly with t the influence of the mooring system on wec energy extracting activities is limited when the incident wave period less than 7s while the effects become notable in large wave period conditions it is seen that the polyester system is inferior to the other two systems in terms of wave energy harvesting when the incident wave period becomes greater overall the nylon system with weights shows the best energy harvesting performance among these three systems under most of the tested sea conditions to check the uncertainties of measured data the regular wave test with t 9 25s for hnbw system nylon with clumped weights was repeated four times and the results are shown in fig 13 since the 2m and 3m are symmetrically arranged only the results of 1m and 3m are given it is seen that the measured motion and mooring tension raos are similar in these four tests the standard deviation of heave and surge raos is close to 0 the standard deviation of pitch raos is equal to 0 38 as for the mooring tensions these four measured mooring tension raos are very close and the standard deviation of 1m and 2m tension raos is 3 3 and 1 24 respectively in addition to the incident wave period the wave height also has a significant influence on the dynamics of the floating system besides the hydrodynamic responses of wec in resonance modes need to be carefully studied in light of this the regular wave tests with incident wave period equal to heave and pitch natural periods of corresponding systems were conducted to study the effect of wave heights on system dynamics each of the resonance regular wave tests was repeated four times with different wave height the wec heave responses raos in heave resonance wave conditions are shown in fig 14 it is seen that the heave motion response of the polyester system is the smallest under all tested wave height conditions because the polyester rope is much stiffer the nylon system shows more significant heave motion responses than the nylon system with weights in small wave height tests while the heave response of the nylon system decrease with the increase of wave height it is understood that in the small wave height conditions the added clumped weights reduce wec heave motion amplitude due to additional restoring force under the cases of large wave height the additional compliance or reduced stiffness provided by the clump weights allows the wec to heave more freely increasing the rao and resulting in greater energy harvesting compared to the polyester or nylon only systems which restrict heave the mooring tension raos of 1m and 2m under heave resonance wave conditions are shown in fig 15 it is seen that the tension amplitude of polyester is the smallest because the heave motion response of the polyester system is smaller than that of the other two systems besides it is observed in fig 10 that the surge motion response of the polyester system is the smallest and the pitch motion is close to the results of the other two systems for the most loaded mooring line 1m the attached clumped weights help to limit the mooring stretching thereby reducing mooring dynamics correspondingly as for the mooring lines installed in leeward because the stretching level is low the installed clumped weights increase mooring dynamics due to the additional hydrodynamic force overall both the motion and mooring tension raos reduce with the increase of wave heights the normalized energy conversion efficiency of different systems under heave resonance wave conditions is shown in fig 16 it is observed that the energy conversion performance of wec is greatly improved in heave resonance mode owing to the large heave motion amplitude the influence of the mooring system on wec energy harvesting activities is notable in heave resonance cases the nylon systems are superior to the polyester system in energy conversion by comparing the normalized energy conversion curves of nylon systems it is seen that the nylon system exhibits better energy conversion performance in smaller amplitude waves while the nylon system with weights tends to overtake the nylon system in large amplitude waves besides the wec energy conversion efficiency is found reduced significantly as the wave height increases for instance the energy conversion efficiency in the case when the wave height is 0 4m is around three times that when the wave height is 1m the pitch resonance regular wave tests were conducted with four different wave heights unfortunately the motion response in h w 0 6m was not recorded due to the problem of the motion tracking system the pitch and heave motion response raos in pitch resonance tests are shown in fig 17 it is seen that the wec exhibits great pitch response when it is moored by polyester due to the greater pitch moments because the axial stiffness of polyester rope is much greater than that of nylon rope as a result it gives rise to the greatest pitch motion responses besides it illustrates that the nylon with weights is more flexible than nylon due to the attached clumped weights and the reason has been stated above on the contrary a more flexible mooring system always allows greater heave motion which is verified in fig 17 b it is seen that the wave height has a negative effect on the pitch motion raos a similar phenomenon is found in the heave motion raos of the polyester system while the heave motion raos of the nylon systems are not sensitive to wave height in the pitch resonance tests this indicates that the heave and pitch motion responses of the polyester system are more correlated compared to the results of the nylon systems which is due to the stronger coupling caused by the stiffer mooring the mooring tension raos of different systems are compared in fig 18 it is seen that the polyester mooring rope is the most loaded one among these three mooring systems and its tension raos reduce considerably with the increase of wave height while the tension raos of nylon are insensitive to wave height the reason is that the pitch motion exhibits the most significant influence on mooring tension in pitch resonance cases besides it is observed that the 1m tension amplitude of nylon is greater than that of the nylon with weights while an opposite result is found in 2m the reason has been stated above the normalized energy conversion efficiency of different systems is compared in fig 19 where it is seen that the nylon system with weights is superior to the other two systems in energy harvesting in consistent with other tested cases the energy conversion efficiency of wec moored by polyester is the lowest besides the energy conversion efficiency of nylon systems is insensitivity to wave height and the nylon system with weights shows better energy capture performance in all cases despite of the differences of wave heights 7 irregular wave tests in a realistic situation the wecs operate in random waves as a consequence it is necessary to study the floating system hydrodynamic responses in irregular waves in this study three random wave conditions are tested including two normal operational wave conditions and one heave resonance wave condition the random waves are simulated by jonswap spectrum and the main parameters are shown in table 5 where t p is the peak period h s denotes significant wave height and γ is the non dimensional peak enhance parameter the op denotes the operational wave conditions and hr means the heave resonance wave condition the duration of each irregular wave model test is 30 min which is longer than 3 h in full scale 7 1 motion responses the three main motion responses of wec are studied and the results of different systems under op2 wave condition are compared in figs 20 22 the motion responses of wec under op1 wave condition are similar to the results in op2 sea state in light of this only the motion responses under op2 wave condition are plotted to show the result clearly only 100s data are displayed in fig 20 a it is seen that the surge motion shows obvious wave frequency characteristic and the surge motion amplitude of the polyester system is slightly smaller than that of the other two systems the spectral analysis is then performed and the results are shown in fig 20 b two notable spectral peaks are observed in surge spectral density curves one appears in the natural surge period and the other one occurs near the wave peak period it is seen that the surge spectral peaks of the nylon system are the greatest indicating that the nylon system shows the most significant surge responses the heave and pitch motion responses and their spectral densities are plotted figs 21 and 22 it is seen that both the heave and pitch motions show wave frequency characteristics the differences of motion time series between different systems are not clear and spectral analysis is necessary a tremendous peak is found in heave spectral densities which occurs near the natural heave period it indicates that the heave response is dominated by the resonance component besides it is observed that the heave spectral densities of the polyester system are significantly lower than the results of the other two systems this implies that the energy capturing performance of the polyester system is inferior to the nylon systems two noticeable peaks are found in the pitch response spectral densities one occurs in the natural surge period and the other one is found between the natural heave and natural pitch period while the second one is the dominated one in contrast to heave motion responses the pitch motion response of the polyester system is the greatest among the discussed systems which is consistent with the results of regular wave tests the wec motion responses in heave resonance wave conditions are displayed in figs 23 25 it is observed that the surge motion amplitude of the nylon system with weights under this wave condition is much greater than that of the other two systems the observation agrees with the results of the regular wave tests indicating that the dynamic behaviour is similar under both types of excitation according to the surge spectral densities it is seen that the surge motion consists of a resonance part and a wave frequency part the wave frequency component which occurs between the heave natural period and the surge natural period is the dominating one the main surge spectral peak of the nylon system with weights is much greater than the values of the other two systems which verifies that the wecs exhibits most significant surge responses when it is moored by the nylon with weights under heave resonance wave condition it is difficult to evaluate the influence of the mooring system on heave and pitch responses by checking motion responses time series while the spectral analysis provides a better solution to this problem a significant peak that occurs in the natural heave period is seen and the value is much greater than the result in the op2 sea condition due to the heave resonance effect according to the heave spectral density curves it infers that the heave responses of wec is the smallest when it is moored by polyester in fig 25 b it is found that the pitch motion is dominated by the component that occurs between the natural heave and natural pitch period the spectral peak appearing in the surge natural period is negligible which implies that the influence of the surge motion on the pitch response is limited in this case in contrast to the heave response the pitch motion response of the polyester system is greater than that of the other two systems the motion response statistics of the wec in all tested wave conditions are listed in tables 6 8 it is seen that the polyester system shows greater pitch motion but smaller heave and surge responses than the other two systems the observation matches well with regular wave test and the reason has been given in the discussions of regular wave tests i e great axial stiffness of the polyester rope the motion responses of the nylon system are similar to the results of the nylon system with weights in all tested random waves it is seen that the wec oscillates in the range between 2m and 3m in surge and 2m 2m in heave the greatest difference is found in the heave resonance wave condition it is seen that the nylon system with weights exhibits greater surge and heave motion than that of the nylon system while an opposite result is seen in the pitch response this is because that the nylon system with weights is more compliant than the nylon system in heave resonance wave condition overall the comparisons of motion response results between different systems in random waves are in consistency with regular wave results 7 2 energy conversion performance to study the influence of the mooring system on the wec energy conversion performance in random waves the energy conversion efficiency of different systems is normalized the normalizing procedure is identical to the regular wave analysis and the result is shown in fig 26 the polyester system shows the worst energy conversion performance under all tested irregular wave conditions and the result can be verified in the heave standard deviations in tables 6 8 consistent with the regular wave tests it is seen that the influence of clumped weights on energy production depends on the incident wave period in the small wave period cases the clumped weights interfere with energy production activities it is seen that the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights in operational wave conditions with the incident wave period increasing the clumped weights start to play a positive role in improving energy production the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system with weights is greater than that of the nylon system under heave resonance wave condition and the difference is noticeable besides it is found that the wec energy conversion efficiency in operational wave conditions is greater than that in the regular wave cases with similar wave period this is because the random waves include various components with different wave periods and the component with a greater wave period close to the natural heave period always provide more favourable energy conversion efficiency which can be verified in fig 12 vice versa in the heave resonance wave conditions the energy conversion efficiency of wec in a regular wave is greater than that in random waves 7 3 mooring dynamics the mooring tension time series and corresponding tension spectral densities when the wec operates in op2 wave condition are shown in figs 27 29 it is seen that the mooring tensions of different systems vary within a similar range and no significant difference can be observed regarding tension amplitude the result is following the regular wave test results i e the mooring dynamics of the different system are similar under the wave condition when the wave period is less than 8s since the pretension of leeward moorings is greater than that of 1m it is seen that the mean tension of 1m is smaller than the results in leeward moorings in irregular wave test according to the mooring tension spectral density curves it is seen that the wec motion responses are strongly associated with the mooring tensions a tension spectral peak is found in the surge natural period however the peak due to surge motion is much smaller than the component caused by heave and pitch motion and this implies that the pitch and heave motion responses have the most significant influence on mooring dynamics the 1m is the most loaded one it is seen that its tension spectral densities are much greater than that of the other two moorings this indicates that the 1m is the most concerned one during the design process the mooring tension results in heave resonance wave conditions are shown in figs 30 32 similarly to the operational wave condition the differences between mooring tension dynamics of different systems are small by applying the spectral analysis technique it can see that the mooring tension consists of two components however the mooring tension spectral peak that occurs in the natural surge period is negligible a tremendous peak closes to the natural heave period is found due to the heave resonance effect it indicates that the heave motion response plays the dominant role in affecting mooring dynamics in the heave resonance cases the dynamics of the most loaded mooring 1m of different mooring systems are similar and the greatest difference is found in the 3m it is observed that the 3m tension spectral peak of the polyester system is much greater than that of the other two systems the reason is that the axial stiffness of polyester is much greater than nylon ropes besides the 3m pretension of polyester is the greatest among these three mooring systems in other words it is easier to induce mooring dynamics in polyester rope than in the other two moorings furthermore by comparing the mooring tension spectral densities in the heave resonance wave condition with the results in op2 wave condition it is found that the variations of mooring tension under heave resonance wave condition are greater than that in the operational wave condition this is because the heave motion response of wec increases considerably due to the heave resonance effect and the mooring dynamics increase consequently the mooring tension statistics in all tested wave conditions are listed in tables 9 11 it is seen that the mooring dynamics of different systems are similar for the corresponding mooring leg it is understood that the tested wave conditions are mild as a result the influence of mooring material and clumped weight on mooring is limited besides by applying the spectral analysis it is seen that the mooring tension is dominated by heave and pitch responses in other words only the wave conditions that cause both great heave and pitch response would give rise to great mooring dynamics the inference can be verified in fig 11 where it is seen that the greatest differences of mooring tension between different systems are found in the wave cases when the incident wave period occurs in the range between 8s and 12s furthermore it is observed that the minimum tension is equal to zero for most mooring ropes it indicates that the mooring rope becomes slack during the model tests due to large pitch motion response and it needs to be taken great care since the slack taut scenario is easy to give rise to snap loads in harsh sea conditions xu et al 2020 xu and guedes soares 2020 8 conclusions a series of model tests have been conducted to study the influence of the mooring system on wec hydrodynamic responses according to the decay tests it is seen that the natural heave period of the different systems is identical and equal to 7 39s the natural surge period is different i e the result of the nylon system the polyester system and the nylon system with weights is equal to 32 6s 32 7s and 32 8s respectively the natural pitch period of the nylon system is 8 16s and the polyester system and the nylon system with weights have the identical natural pitch period which is equal to 8 20s the polyester system is inferior to the other two systems in terms of energy production the influence of the clumped weights on the energy conversion of the wec dependent on the incident wave period the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights when the incident wave period less than 7s however the energy conversion performance of the nylon system with weights is enhanced greatly with the increase of wave period the efficiency of the nylon system with weights is greater than that of the nylon system when the wec operates in the wave condition with t varies from 7 to 9s and the difference between them is considerable the heave resonance shows significant effect in improving system energy harvesting performance and the system hydrodynamic responses and mooring tension raos are reduced with the increase of wave height in the small amplitude wave conditions the nylon system is slightly more efficient than the nylon system with weights however the nylon system with weights shows the potential in harvesting more energy in harsh wave conditions than the nylon system in the pitch resonance tests the wave height plays a negative role in increasing the motion and mooring tension raos of the polyester system however the dynamic responses of the other two systems are insensitive to wave height three irregular wave model tests were performed including two regular cases and one heave resonance case the polyester system exhibits a more significant pitch motion response than the other two systems while an inverse result is found in the pitch and heave motion responses the nylon systems are preferable in extracting wave energy and their efficiency is almost twice that of the polyester system in corresponding wave condition compared with the surge motion the heave and pitch motion responses are more closely related to mooring tensions the mooring tensions of different systems are similar in all tested wave conditions overall the polyester rope is too stiff in the application for wec which interferes with energy harvesting activities the nylon rope is a favourable material for station keeping of wec which is flexible enough however it needs to be noted that the results apply to the present wec configuration for the other wecs with different working principles further study is needed the compact compliant mooring system design which consists of nylon rope buoy chain and clumped weights hnbw is the best mooring concept for the wec although in the small amplitude or small period wave conditions the captured energy by the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights the energy production of the nylon system with weights increases considerably in large wave period especially close to the heave resonance period and large wave height conditions besides it is seen the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system with weights is greater than that of the nylon system in the wave condition with wave period varying from 7s to 13s which covers most of the energetic sea states in the portuguese islands furthermore the conclusions in this work are given in terms of the energy capturing performance while the other factors such as survivability reliability capital costs of synthetic fibre mooring ropes need to take into consideration during the mooring design

20653,the performance of the three hybrid mooring systems was studied by conducting 1 40 model tests of a moored point absorber subjected to regular and irregular waves the compact hybrid mooring adopts two segments design i e a top synthetic fibre rope polyester or nylon and a bottom chain a submerged buoy is installed on the joint between these two segments another design that installs two clumped weights at the end part of the chain in the nylon mooring system is also investigated seventeen regular and three irregular wave tests were conducted heave and pitch resonance wave conditions were tested to study the system dynamics in resonance modes results show that the nylon rope is a favourable material for mooring ropes of wave energy converters in terms of energy conversion efficiency compared with nylon rope polyester restricts wec heave motion responses effectively and reduces the energy conversion efficiency of the floater studied in this work the compact compliant mooring system design that consists of nylon rope buoy chain and clumped weights is the best mooring concept for the specified floater in this work it demonstrates that when pretension is not large enough during the tests the mooring will experience slack configuration during the random waves keywords experimental study point absorber compact hybrid mooring systems polyester rope nylon rope hydrodynamic responses 1 introduction the exploitation of renewable energy has received considerable concerns in recent decades due to global warming solar wind and wave energy are the three main sustainable energy resources while wave energy owns the highest energy density falnes 2007 the history of developing wave energy converts wecs has been listed for decades a variety of wecs have been developed and these devices can be classified according to the size and direction of the device with respect to the incident wave guedes soares et al 2012 lópez et al 2013 mainly including point absorbers attenuators and terminators the development of wecs is closely associated with the installation location the first generation of wecs is shoreline stationary devices which are installed on the sea bottom or rocky cliff such as the oscillating water columns owcs falcão 2015 rezanejad and guedes soares 2018 the second generation is the nearshore devices which are generally attached to the seabed with the water depth varying between 10m and 25m the wave energy densities in the open sea are much greater than that in the shoreline and nearshore in view of this the third generation wecs which are usually installed in a water depth of more than 40m are receiving the most concerns it was pointed out that most of the wecs projects focus on floating devices while the point absorbers have become the most popular equipment due to their relatively simple technology and easy maintenance lópez et al 2013 xu et al 2019 the mooring system is an essential component of the floating system whose main role is to keep the floating structure on the station as for wecs in addition to the station keeping the mooring system may interact with energy harvesting activities the catenary taut and slack mooring systems are three common mooring concepts with different working principles the catenary chain provides restoring force to the top floating structure by the weight of the suspended segments while restoring force of the taut mooring line comes from line axial stretching however for the wecs that operate in shallow water relative to deepwater offshore oil and gas exploitation activities both of these two mooring configurations have some disadvantages for the catenary mooring line the catenary effect is weakened in shallow water since the suspended length is limited in other words the length of the segment laid down on the seabed needs to be long enough to prevent it from being fully lifted which is strictly forbidden as a consequence the catenary mooring line for wecs is extremely long and with a heavy chain which increases the mooring footprint as well as cost significantly as for the taut mooring line large tension peaks can frequently occur because a small movement could induce large stretching in shallow water as for the slack mooring it was found that the snap events can be easily triggered in the survival wave conditions which gives rise to tremendous spike tension and can endanger the system safety xu et al 2018c 2020 2018c xu and guedes soares 2020 it is seen that the mooring design for wecs is a great challenge the mooring system design needs to satisfy several requirements johanning and smith 2008 xu et al 2019 e g ensuring device survivability not adversely affecting the energy harvesting performance compliant enough to reduce mooring loads and small footprint as a consequence in the applications of wecs station keeping compliant mooring is preferable the catenary spread mooring system catenary anchor leg mooring calm system and single anchor leg mooring salm system are recommended for wecs due to their safe station keeping and moderate installation costs harris et al 2004 the performance and costs of three single point mooring systems for a large dimensional wec were studied by thomsen et al 2017 2016 including three catenary chain legs mooring system six taut synthetic fibre ropes mooring system and salm the salm is the most recommended mooring solution which exhibits high compliance and low costs in addition to the salm the hybrid mooring system concepts which were proposed for the deepwater offshore structures station keeping ji and yuan 2015 xu et al 2018a 2018b 2018b yuan et al 2014 have been successfully applied in wecs according to the experimental results it was concluded that the hybrid mooring systems demonstrate good performance in preventing snap loads xu et al 2018c 2020 2018c xu and guedes soares 2020 furthermore it has a positive effect on the energy conversion efficiency of a point absorber that utilizes heave motion response to harvest wave energy xu et al 2020 the energy harvesting performance is one of the highest concerns during wec system design in addition to the pto gaspar et al 2018 2021 2021 rodríguez et al 2019 calvario et al 2020 the mooring system may affect wecs power harvesting performance a high performance mooring system for wecs should not only have the capability to keep the wec in station in survival condition but also not to reduce the wec power capture ability cerveira et al 2013 have concluded that a realistic mooring system composed of catenary chain lines has a negligible influence on the dynamics and captured wave energy of a point absorber that takes advantage of two degrees of freedom to produce energy zanuttigh et al 2013 carried out 1 30 model scale model tests to study the effects of mooring configuration on the energy harvesting performance of the dexa wec which utilizes relative pitch motion to generate energy in contrast to cerveira et al 2013 they concluded that the mooring configuration has a certain effect on energy harvesting performance the calm mooring system always leads to greater power production than the spread catenary mooring especially when the wave direction is aligned with the device axis sergiienko et al 2016 studied the effect of mooring configuration on the performance of a three tether submerged point absorber in their study the pto system is integrated into the mooring system two configurations were studied i a wec locates close to the sea surface with a low mass ratio design ratio of wec mass to the mass of water displaced by the wec ii a heavy and deeply submerged buoy it was found that in the first configuration the optimal mooring angle is sensitive to wave frequency for the second case the produced energy is highly dependent on the inclination angle the cost of the mooring system accounts for a great part of the wec project budget which could be as much as 18 fitzgerald 2009 it is concluded that the mooring systems of wecs should be cost effective and compliant enough for most of the motion dependent wecs fortunately the synthetic fibre ropes provide a favourable solution to the wecs mooring system the axial stiffness of synthetic fibre ropes is much smaller than that of chain and wire besides synthetic fibre ropes are cheaper than wire and chain for instance the indicative costs of chain and synthetic rope in 2014 were 4140 tonne and 161 000 tonne respectively thomsen et al 2016 it has pointed out that synthetic fibre ropes have great potential in the application of marine renewable energy devices wang et al 2019 weller et al 2015 polyester and nylon ropes are the two most recommended materials for the mooring ropes of marine renewable energy devices weller et al 2015 however they point out that the polyester might be too stiff to deal with the snap loads especially for the mooring of shallow water wecs thomsen et al 2016 plenty of studies have been conducted to investigate the performance of synthetic ropes for wecs wang et al 2019 2021 however there is still no research to deal with the differences of wecs hydrodynamic responses caused by moorings using different synthetic fibre ropes because their mechanical properties are very complicated the current numerical tools are not capable to deal with these problem such as creep phenomenon viscoelastic and viscoplastic characteristics huang et al 2015 lian et al 2018 after an extensive review it is seen that the mooring rope of wecs should be flexible enough to prevent or reduce the snap load events furthermore the stiff mooring system can interfere with energy conversion performances for the motion dependent wecs whose mooring systems are not integrated into the pto systems the synthetic fibre ropes are favourable material to act as mooring ropes of wecs and the influence of synthetic fibre rope materials on wecs hydrodynamic responses and mooring dynamics need to be clarified in this study three compact and compliant mooring systems are designed for wecs a series of model tests were conducted to study the hydrodynamic responses of a point absorber moored by these three mooring systems according to the experimental data the effects of mooring rope materials and clumped weights on system hydrodynamic responses and mooring dynamics are studied finally the preferable synthetic fibre rope and hybrid mooring concept are recommended 2 research methodology 2 1 decay analysis decay tests are carried out to obtain the linear damping coefficient and the natural periods of the concerned degree of freedoms of the wec the decay motions of wecs are similar to those of a spring mass damper system and considering the decay curves the time interval between two continuous peaks is defined as the natural period the linear damping coefficient is determined by the log decrement ratio of peaks 1 γ 1 n ln x i x i n 2 ζ γ 4 π 2 γ 2 where γ is the log decrement ratio ζ is the linear damping coefficient x is the amplitude subscript i and n is the index of motion peaks 2 2 point absorber energy conversion performance analysis according to the linear wave theory the average energy flux of incident wave on point absorber is defined as falnes 2002 3 p w 1 8 d ρ g h w 2 c g where d is the diameter of point absorber ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration h w is the wave height c g is the incident wave group velocity which is given by 4 c g c 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where c is the phase velocity of incident wave k is the wave number h is the water depth the relation between c and k is given as 5 c ω k once the wave frequency ω is known the wave number can be solved by the dispersion relation 6 ω 2 g k tanh k h as for the random waves the mean incident random wave energy power p rw on wec is calculated as falnes 2002 7 p r w d ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω where s ω is the wave spectrum density theoretically the instantaneous wave power captured by the point absorber is defined as 8 p s b pto v z 2 where v z is the heave velocity of wec in this study it is calculated by the central difference scheme 9 v z z i 1 z i 1 2 t s where t s is the time step the averaged captured wave energy over a certain time can be calculated as 10 p b 1 t 0 t b pto v z 2 d t where b pto is the linear damping coefficient of the power take off pto system the energy conversion efficiency is then calculated as zang et al 2018 11 ξ p b p w 2 3 governing equation of wec motion responses the governing equation of wec motion response is written as 12 m a x c x k x 0 t h t τ x τ d τ f w a v e f c f d f m f pto where m is the body mass matrix a is the infinite added mass matrix c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix f wave is the wave force f c is the current force does not consider in this work f d is the wave drift damping force f m is the mooring force f pto is the pto force h τ is the retardation function which is computed by the frequency dependent added mass and damping transformation 13 h τ 1 π 0 c ω cos ω τ ω a ω sin ω τ d ω where c ω and a ω are the frequency dependent damping and added mass respectively assuming that the pto system consists of linear spring and damper and the wec takes advantage of heave motion to harvest wave energy the f pto in heave is calculated as 14 f pto 3 3 b pto z t k pto z t where z t and z t are the displacement and velocity of the buoy in heave kpto is the stiffness of pto the other items in the matrix f pto are equal to zeros 3 model descriptions 3 1 point absorber to evaluate the performance of the compact and compliant hybrid mooring system proposed in this work a point absorber is used in the model tests at a scale of 1 40 as seen in fig 1 a point absorber was designed to harvest wave energy by taking advantage of its heave motion response and a series of model tests were carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of this wec the wec is a cylindrical conical structure and a similar design is also seen in the study of sinha et al 2016 and kamarlouei et al 2020 the computational fluid dynamic cfd method was applied by jin et al 2019 to study the hydrodynamic responses of three cylindrical point absorber with different bottoms it was found that the device with a 90 conical streamlined bottom was superior to the ones with flat bottom and hemisphere streamlined in energy capture in fig 1 a it is seen that the height of the conical bottom is 75 mm and the vertical distance between fairleads and bottom is 35 cm the main parameters of the wec model are shown in table 1 where φ is the diameter δ is the free draft of wec without mooring lines being installed δ denotes displacement and rxx ryy rzz are the gyration radius about x y and z axis respectively the origin of the coordinate system is shown in fig 1 a the height of the centre of gravity is 16 3 cm where the baseline is at the bottom of the model 3 2 pto and hybrid mooring systems the pto system is an essential component of a wec which plays the role to convert wave energy into electric power in the model tests the pto system is usually discarded due to the complexity to scaled down pto in model scale moura paredes et al 2016 sheng et al 2014 unfortunately the pto system could affect wec hydrodynamic responses due to its damping and stiffness to simulate the effect of pto system and simplify testing procedure yang et al 2020 2018 used a heave plate and a linear spring to simulate the damping and stiffness of pto system in this study the similar design was adopted as seen in fig 2 a square steel plate was used as the heave plate during the model tests the length and width of heave plate is 10 cm and the thickness is 1 mm the heave plate was rigidly fixed to a connection bar to ensure that the movement of heave plate follows the motion of the wec the connection bar was made of steel rod which was 50 cm in length the heave plate was fixed 80 cm underwater when the wec was free floating to reduce the influence of wave motion on heave plate a wire with a length of 928 6 mm including the clamps on both ends was used to connect heave plate and spring the diameter of wire is 3 5 mm and the mass per unit length in air is 0 108 kg with the clamps considered the stiffness of spring is 29 22n m which is used to simulate the stiffness of pto on the bottom of wave flume a load sensor was installed to measure the wire tension the sketch of pto system is shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows the schematics of hybrid mooring systems which consist of three mooring legs as seen in fig 3 a one concept of mooring leg is composed of synthetic fibre rope submerged buoy and chain the mass of the spherical buoy is 0 436 kg and its buoyancy is 10n as seen in fig 3 the submerged buoy is installed on the joint between these two segments the length of synthetic fibre rope and chain is 1 23m and 1 7m respectively hereafter the hybrid mooring system is denoted as the hnb when nylon rope is used and the wec hnb mooring system is generally called the nylon system in this study it is named hyb when the polyester rope is adopted and the wec hyb mooring system is called the polyester system in fig 3 b it is seen that the hnbw is designed with two additional clumped weights attached to the bottom chain of the nylon rope and the wec hnbw mooring system is called the nylon with weights system the mass of cm1 and cm2 in the air are 0 511 kg and 1 229 kg respectively the distance between these two clumped weights is 10 cm and the distance of cm2 to the anchor point is 10 cm fig 4 shows the clumped weight models used in the model tests the main parameters of mooring rope are given in table 2 where d a is the nominal diameter w is mass per unit length in air r denotes mooring radius le is the effective length of mooring rope two clamps with a length of 55 mm were used to connect the synthetic rope to the hook on the wec and mooring chain the total length of the synthetic fibre rope is 1 34m both the nylon and polyester are braided 16 strand ropes the length of the hook is 65 mm and its weight is 53g the axial stiffness ea of the chain is linear which is estimated to be 810 000n xu et al 2019 however the axial stiffness of synthetic fibre ropes shows strong nonlinearity and the sophisticated model tests are necessary the tension extension characteristics of synthetic fibre ropes were tested at tianjin university the loading elements the equipment foundation the measurement system and the water cycling system constitute the experimental system for testing fibre ropes the detailed descriptions of the experimental system can be found in lian et al 2018 liu et al 2014 the static tension elongation properties were measured after the bedding in procedure and the relations between tension and strain for these two ropes are fitted based on the experimental data 15 t n y l o n 0 025 3 719 ε 60 535 ε 2 58 341 ε 3 16 t p o l y e s t e r 0 019 10 936 ε 17 894 ε 2 883 169 ε 3 where ε is the strain and the unit of tension is kn the comparisons between measured and fitted tension elongation properties are shown in fig 5 it is observed that the tension elongation curves are well fitted by eqs 15 and 16 and the stiffness of polyester is greater than nylon as seen in fig 6 the mooring system consists of three mooring legs and the azimuth angle between each two mooring legs is 120 the pretensions of each mooring leg are listed in table 3 during the model tests it was designed to set the same pretension for each different mooring lines to exclude the differences of system dynamics caused by mooring pretension however it is difficult to implement due to the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties and water absorbing phenomenon of synthetic ropes 4 experimental set up a series of hydrodynamic model tests were conducted in the towing tank of etsin universidad politécnica de madrid at a scale of 1 40 the tank is 3 8m in width and 96m in length the water depth is 2 107m one may consider that the properties of synthetic fibre mooring ropes in full scale cannot be scaled down well by applying the small diameter ropes in the model tests however it should be noticed that the main objective of this study is to investigate the influence of synthetic fibre mooring material on hydrodynamic responses of wecs rather than to predict the dynamic responses of the prototype system generally the axial stiffness of prototype mooring is modelled by a linear spring during the hydrodynamic model tests however the stiffness of synthetic rope is nonlinear and the viscoelastic and viscoplastic properties cannot be modelled if a linear spring is adopted as a consequence using synthetic fibre ropes directly on the wec model is the best way to study the concerned issue in this work all the experimental data are converted to full scale based on froude similitude law it should be noticed that the converted data do not represent the dynamic responses of prototype systems but to compare the responses between different systems fig 7 shows the sketch of the experimental set up the model was installed 35m away from the wave paddle to reduce the influence of the reflection wave on system dynamics as seen in fig 7 three wave probes were arranged around the wec model to measure wave elevation time series the wave gauge wp1 was installed 2 4m in front of the wec wp2 was placed 1 2 m to the starboard of wec and the wp3 was installed 1 96 m after wec an optical tracking system was applied to measure six degrees of freedoms motion responses with several optical motion markers arranged on the top deck of wec as shown in fig 8 a three load cells were installed on the top frame to record the mooring tension time series the sampling frequency of all sensors was set to be 50 hz fig 8 shows the snapshot of the polyester system during the regular wave model tests 5 decay tests surge heave and pitch decay tests were carried out to obtain the corresponding natural periods of different systems the comparisons of surge and heave decay curves between different systems are shown in fig 9 where it is seen that the differences in decay curves between different systems are limited however checking the heave decay curves carefully it is seen that the heave motion amplitude of the polyester system is dissipated more rapidly than that of the nylon system it indicates that the polyester system has greater heave damping than the nylon system based on the decay curves the natural period and linear damping coefficient ζ can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 the natural heave and surge periods of different systems as well as their linear damping coefficients in these two modes are shown in table 4 where linear damping coefficients of pitch are not given the measured motion amplitude of the pitch decay curve is not perfectly reduced with time due to the interference of other motion responses during the decay tests in other words the linear damping coefficient of pitch motion cannot be estimated accurately it is seen that the mooring material and clump weights have a limited influence on system natural periods in these three modes the natural periods of different systems are close in corresponding motion mode i e the surge natural period is around 32s and the natural period of heave and pitch is close to 7s and 8s respectively it is because the hydrostatic stiffness of wec plays the dominant role in heave and pitch motions and the mooring systems provide similar restoring stiffness to wec in surge since the mooring ropes of the different system have very close pretensions the natural surge period of the nylon system with weights is slightly greater than that of the other two systems it is explained that the nylon system with weights has the smallest mooring pretensions among these three mooring systems as seen in table 3 besides the polyester induces the greatest heave damping due to its large axial stiffness while the heave damping of the nylon system with weights is the smallest due to the installed clumped weights which play the role to prevent the line stretching and reduce mooring dynamics correspondingly xu et al 2016 2018b 6 regular wave tests a series of regular wave model tests were conducted to study the wec hydrodynamic responses and mooring dynamics in head seas and the response amplitude operators raos can then be obtained seventeen regular wave cases are tested the incident wave period varies from 0 7s to 2s model scale and the wave height is equal to 0 05m i e 2m in full scale for all the cases the three main motion raos of different systems in head seas are plotted in fig 10 in fig 10 a two peaks can be found in the surge motion the first one is near to 4 9s for all tested systems while the second one is different which is around 7 3s for the nylon systems and 8s for the polyester system it should be noticed that both of these two peak periods are not the natural surge period according to the surge decay tests and the second peak may be generated due to the coupling effect of surge with the heave motion the influence of the mooring system on surge motion response is related to the incident wave period for instance the surge motion response of the nylon system with weights is slightly greater than that of the nylon system when the incident wave period is smaller than 8s especially when t is equal to 7 3s in the case of the wave period is smaller than 5 6s or greater than 8s the wec shows larger surge motion responses when it is moored by polyester compared to the nylon with weights comparing the raos curve of surge with that of pitch it is found that the variations of surge motion response to the incident wave period is similar to the results of pitch motion when the wave period is less than 10s it indicates that the pitch motion of wec is coupled to surge response the heave motion is the most concerned one in this study since it was supposed that the wec takes advantage of heave motion to extract wave energy the wec heave raos of the different system are compared in fig 10 b the significant peaks are found in each heave motion raos curve and the peak periods are close to the natural heave periods the heave motion response of the polyester system is smaller than that of the other two systems in most of the tested cases the reason can be found in table 4 where it can be seen that the polyester system has the greatest heave damping the difference of heave responses between the nylon systems are limited when the incident wave period is less than 6 9s where the heave responses of the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights however an inverse result is seen once the t 6 9s it is understood that the wec moves slightly in heave when the incident wave period is small and in these cases the installed clumped weights could interfere with the wec heave motion when the incident wave period approaches the natural period the heave response increases dramatically which causes the mooring line stretching as a result the nylon system with weights has slightly greater heave motion responses than that of the nylon system when the t 6 9s as stated above two peaks are observed in the pitch raos curves while the most significant one occurs near the natural pitch period it is seen that the polyester system shows greater pitch motion responses than the other two systems in most of the tested wave conditions the most significant differences are found when the wave period approaches the natural pitch period it is explained that the wec adopts a large draft design and the special mooring connections the pitch moment comes from the mooring system increases wec pitch responses the stiffer mooring system will cause larger pitch responses the pitch motion is more prominent when the incident wave period approaches the natural pitch period the differences in pitch motion between the nylon systems are limited when t 8s based on the recorded mooring tension time series during the tests the tension raos of all mooring ropes are obtained and the results are shown in fig 11 it is seen that two main peaks occur on the curves and the peak tension periods are near the peak periods of surge and pitch it indicates that the surge and pitch motions are strongly associated with mooring tensions the 1m is the most loaded mooring among these three mooring lines in the head sea conditions in fig 11 a it is seen that though the 1m tension of the nylon with weights is slightly greater than that of nylon in most cases the results of the two systems are close it indicates that the attached clumped weights on the mooring line will not significantly affect the mooring dynamics the slight difference in mooring tension is due to differences in the surge and pitch motion responses between the two systems which can be seen in fig 10 the 1m tension results of polyester and nylon show that the top segment mooring material has limited influence on mooring dynamics when the incident wave period is less than 8s but its effect becomes notable when t 8s due to symmetrically arrangement the mooring dynamics of 2m and 3m are similar the tension differences between them are mainly caused by pretensions in fig 11 c it is observed that the mooring tension raos curve of nylon with weights is below that of nylon it is explained that the difference of 3m pretension between these two mooring systems is large enough to induce the obvious differences in mooring dynamics in table 3 it is seen that the 3m pretension of nylon with weights is 10 4 smaller than nylon as stated above a linear dummy damping coefficient is introduced to quantify the produced energy of wec then the energy conversion efficiency can be obtained by applying eq 11 in this study the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system in the first regular wave test t 4 43s is taken as the reference value and the energy conversion efficiency in different cases is normalized by using the ratio between efficiency in the current case and reference value the energy harvest performance of different systems is compared in fig 12 it is seen that trend of the energy conversion efficiency curve is identical to the heave motion raos the energy capturing performance increases with the incident wave period then it reduces significantly with t the influence of the mooring system on wec energy extracting activities is limited when the incident wave period less than 7s while the effects become notable in large wave period conditions it is seen that the polyester system is inferior to the other two systems in terms of wave energy harvesting when the incident wave period becomes greater overall the nylon system with weights shows the best energy harvesting performance among these three systems under most of the tested sea conditions to check the uncertainties of measured data the regular wave test with t 9 25s for hnbw system nylon with clumped weights was repeated four times and the results are shown in fig 13 since the 2m and 3m are symmetrically arranged only the results of 1m and 3m are given it is seen that the measured motion and mooring tension raos are similar in these four tests the standard deviation of heave and surge raos is close to 0 the standard deviation of pitch raos is equal to 0 38 as for the mooring tensions these four measured mooring tension raos are very close and the standard deviation of 1m and 2m tension raos is 3 3 and 1 24 respectively in addition to the incident wave period the wave height also has a significant influence on the dynamics of the floating system besides the hydrodynamic responses of wec in resonance modes need to be carefully studied in light of this the regular wave tests with incident wave period equal to heave and pitch natural periods of corresponding systems were conducted to study the effect of wave heights on system dynamics each of the resonance regular wave tests was repeated four times with different wave height the wec heave responses raos in heave resonance wave conditions are shown in fig 14 it is seen that the heave motion response of the polyester system is the smallest under all tested wave height conditions because the polyester rope is much stiffer the nylon system shows more significant heave motion responses than the nylon system with weights in small wave height tests while the heave response of the nylon system decrease with the increase of wave height it is understood that in the small wave height conditions the added clumped weights reduce wec heave motion amplitude due to additional restoring force under the cases of large wave height the additional compliance or reduced stiffness provided by the clump weights allows the wec to heave more freely increasing the rao and resulting in greater energy harvesting compared to the polyester or nylon only systems which restrict heave the mooring tension raos of 1m and 2m under heave resonance wave conditions are shown in fig 15 it is seen that the tension amplitude of polyester is the smallest because the heave motion response of the polyester system is smaller than that of the other two systems besides it is observed in fig 10 that the surge motion response of the polyester system is the smallest and the pitch motion is close to the results of the other two systems for the most loaded mooring line 1m the attached clumped weights help to limit the mooring stretching thereby reducing mooring dynamics correspondingly as for the mooring lines installed in leeward because the stretching level is low the installed clumped weights increase mooring dynamics due to the additional hydrodynamic force overall both the motion and mooring tension raos reduce with the increase of wave heights the normalized energy conversion efficiency of different systems under heave resonance wave conditions is shown in fig 16 it is observed that the energy conversion performance of wec is greatly improved in heave resonance mode owing to the large heave motion amplitude the influence of the mooring system on wec energy harvesting activities is notable in heave resonance cases the nylon systems are superior to the polyester system in energy conversion by comparing the normalized energy conversion curves of nylon systems it is seen that the nylon system exhibits better energy conversion performance in smaller amplitude waves while the nylon system with weights tends to overtake the nylon system in large amplitude waves besides the wec energy conversion efficiency is found reduced significantly as the wave height increases for instance the energy conversion efficiency in the case when the wave height is 0 4m is around three times that when the wave height is 1m the pitch resonance regular wave tests were conducted with four different wave heights unfortunately the motion response in h w 0 6m was not recorded due to the problem of the motion tracking system the pitch and heave motion response raos in pitch resonance tests are shown in fig 17 it is seen that the wec exhibits great pitch response when it is moored by polyester due to the greater pitch moments because the axial stiffness of polyester rope is much greater than that of nylon rope as a result it gives rise to the greatest pitch motion responses besides it illustrates that the nylon with weights is more flexible than nylon due to the attached clumped weights and the reason has been stated above on the contrary a more flexible mooring system always allows greater heave motion which is verified in fig 17 b it is seen that the wave height has a negative effect on the pitch motion raos a similar phenomenon is found in the heave motion raos of the polyester system while the heave motion raos of the nylon systems are not sensitive to wave height in the pitch resonance tests this indicates that the heave and pitch motion responses of the polyester system are more correlated compared to the results of the nylon systems which is due to the stronger coupling caused by the stiffer mooring the mooring tension raos of different systems are compared in fig 18 it is seen that the polyester mooring rope is the most loaded one among these three mooring systems and its tension raos reduce considerably with the increase of wave height while the tension raos of nylon are insensitive to wave height the reason is that the pitch motion exhibits the most significant influence on mooring tension in pitch resonance cases besides it is observed that the 1m tension amplitude of nylon is greater than that of the nylon with weights while an opposite result is found in 2m the reason has been stated above the normalized energy conversion efficiency of different systems is compared in fig 19 where it is seen that the nylon system with weights is superior to the other two systems in energy harvesting in consistent with other tested cases the energy conversion efficiency of wec moored by polyester is the lowest besides the energy conversion efficiency of nylon systems is insensitivity to wave height and the nylon system with weights shows better energy capture performance in all cases despite of the differences of wave heights 7 irregular wave tests in a realistic situation the wecs operate in random waves as a consequence it is necessary to study the floating system hydrodynamic responses in irregular waves in this study three random wave conditions are tested including two normal operational wave conditions and one heave resonance wave condition the random waves are simulated by jonswap spectrum and the main parameters are shown in table 5 where t p is the peak period h s denotes significant wave height and γ is the non dimensional peak enhance parameter the op denotes the operational wave conditions and hr means the heave resonance wave condition the duration of each irregular wave model test is 30 min which is longer than 3 h in full scale 7 1 motion responses the three main motion responses of wec are studied and the results of different systems under op2 wave condition are compared in figs 20 22 the motion responses of wec under op1 wave condition are similar to the results in op2 sea state in light of this only the motion responses under op2 wave condition are plotted to show the result clearly only 100s data are displayed in fig 20 a it is seen that the surge motion shows obvious wave frequency characteristic and the surge motion amplitude of the polyester system is slightly smaller than that of the other two systems the spectral analysis is then performed and the results are shown in fig 20 b two notable spectral peaks are observed in surge spectral density curves one appears in the natural surge period and the other one occurs near the wave peak period it is seen that the surge spectral peaks of the nylon system are the greatest indicating that the nylon system shows the most significant surge responses the heave and pitch motion responses and their spectral densities are plotted figs 21 and 22 it is seen that both the heave and pitch motions show wave frequency characteristics the differences of motion time series between different systems are not clear and spectral analysis is necessary a tremendous peak is found in heave spectral densities which occurs near the natural heave period it indicates that the heave response is dominated by the resonance component besides it is observed that the heave spectral densities of the polyester system are significantly lower than the results of the other two systems this implies that the energy capturing performance of the polyester system is inferior to the nylon systems two noticeable peaks are found in the pitch response spectral densities one occurs in the natural surge period and the other one is found between the natural heave and natural pitch period while the second one is the dominated one in contrast to heave motion responses the pitch motion response of the polyester system is the greatest among the discussed systems which is consistent with the results of regular wave tests the wec motion responses in heave resonance wave conditions are displayed in figs 23 25 it is observed that the surge motion amplitude of the nylon system with weights under this wave condition is much greater than that of the other two systems the observation agrees with the results of the regular wave tests indicating that the dynamic behaviour is similar under both types of excitation according to the surge spectral densities it is seen that the surge motion consists of a resonance part and a wave frequency part the wave frequency component which occurs between the heave natural period and the surge natural period is the dominating one the main surge spectral peak of the nylon system with weights is much greater than the values of the other two systems which verifies that the wecs exhibits most significant surge responses when it is moored by the nylon with weights under heave resonance wave condition it is difficult to evaluate the influence of the mooring system on heave and pitch responses by checking motion responses time series while the spectral analysis provides a better solution to this problem a significant peak that occurs in the natural heave period is seen and the value is much greater than the result in the op2 sea condition due to the heave resonance effect according to the heave spectral density curves it infers that the heave responses of wec is the smallest when it is moored by polyester in fig 25 b it is found that the pitch motion is dominated by the component that occurs between the natural heave and natural pitch period the spectral peak appearing in the surge natural period is negligible which implies that the influence of the surge motion on the pitch response is limited in this case in contrast to the heave response the pitch motion response of the polyester system is greater than that of the other two systems the motion response statistics of the wec in all tested wave conditions are listed in tables 6 8 it is seen that the polyester system shows greater pitch motion but smaller heave and surge responses than the other two systems the observation matches well with regular wave test and the reason has been given in the discussions of regular wave tests i e great axial stiffness of the polyester rope the motion responses of the nylon system are similar to the results of the nylon system with weights in all tested random waves it is seen that the wec oscillates in the range between 2m and 3m in surge and 2m 2m in heave the greatest difference is found in the heave resonance wave condition it is seen that the nylon system with weights exhibits greater surge and heave motion than that of the nylon system while an opposite result is seen in the pitch response this is because that the nylon system with weights is more compliant than the nylon system in heave resonance wave condition overall the comparisons of motion response results between different systems in random waves are in consistency with regular wave results 7 2 energy conversion performance to study the influence of the mooring system on the wec energy conversion performance in random waves the energy conversion efficiency of different systems is normalized the normalizing procedure is identical to the regular wave analysis and the result is shown in fig 26 the polyester system shows the worst energy conversion performance under all tested irregular wave conditions and the result can be verified in the heave standard deviations in tables 6 8 consistent with the regular wave tests it is seen that the influence of clumped weights on energy production depends on the incident wave period in the small wave period cases the clumped weights interfere with energy production activities it is seen that the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights in operational wave conditions with the incident wave period increasing the clumped weights start to play a positive role in improving energy production the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system with weights is greater than that of the nylon system under heave resonance wave condition and the difference is noticeable besides it is found that the wec energy conversion efficiency in operational wave conditions is greater than that in the regular wave cases with similar wave period this is because the random waves include various components with different wave periods and the component with a greater wave period close to the natural heave period always provide more favourable energy conversion efficiency which can be verified in fig 12 vice versa in the heave resonance wave conditions the energy conversion efficiency of wec in a regular wave is greater than that in random waves 7 3 mooring dynamics the mooring tension time series and corresponding tension spectral densities when the wec operates in op2 wave condition are shown in figs 27 29 it is seen that the mooring tensions of different systems vary within a similar range and no significant difference can be observed regarding tension amplitude the result is following the regular wave test results i e the mooring dynamics of the different system are similar under the wave condition when the wave period is less than 8s since the pretension of leeward moorings is greater than that of 1m it is seen that the mean tension of 1m is smaller than the results in leeward moorings in irregular wave test according to the mooring tension spectral density curves it is seen that the wec motion responses are strongly associated with the mooring tensions a tension spectral peak is found in the surge natural period however the peak due to surge motion is much smaller than the component caused by heave and pitch motion and this implies that the pitch and heave motion responses have the most significant influence on mooring dynamics the 1m is the most loaded one it is seen that its tension spectral densities are much greater than that of the other two moorings this indicates that the 1m is the most concerned one during the design process the mooring tension results in heave resonance wave conditions are shown in figs 30 32 similarly to the operational wave condition the differences between mooring tension dynamics of different systems are small by applying the spectral analysis technique it can see that the mooring tension consists of two components however the mooring tension spectral peak that occurs in the natural surge period is negligible a tremendous peak closes to the natural heave period is found due to the heave resonance effect it indicates that the heave motion response plays the dominant role in affecting mooring dynamics in the heave resonance cases the dynamics of the most loaded mooring 1m of different mooring systems are similar and the greatest difference is found in the 3m it is observed that the 3m tension spectral peak of the polyester system is much greater than that of the other two systems the reason is that the axial stiffness of polyester is much greater than nylon ropes besides the 3m pretension of polyester is the greatest among these three mooring systems in other words it is easier to induce mooring dynamics in polyester rope than in the other two moorings furthermore by comparing the mooring tension spectral densities in the heave resonance wave condition with the results in op2 wave condition it is found that the variations of mooring tension under heave resonance wave condition are greater than that in the operational wave condition this is because the heave motion response of wec increases considerably due to the heave resonance effect and the mooring dynamics increase consequently the mooring tension statistics in all tested wave conditions are listed in tables 9 11 it is seen that the mooring dynamics of different systems are similar for the corresponding mooring leg it is understood that the tested wave conditions are mild as a result the influence of mooring material and clumped weight on mooring is limited besides by applying the spectral analysis it is seen that the mooring tension is dominated by heave and pitch responses in other words only the wave conditions that cause both great heave and pitch response would give rise to great mooring dynamics the inference can be verified in fig 11 where it is seen that the greatest differences of mooring tension between different systems are found in the wave cases when the incident wave period occurs in the range between 8s and 12s furthermore it is observed that the minimum tension is equal to zero for most mooring ropes it indicates that the mooring rope becomes slack during the model tests due to large pitch motion response and it needs to be taken great care since the slack taut scenario is easy to give rise to snap loads in harsh sea conditions xu et al 2020 xu and guedes soares 2020 8 conclusions a series of model tests have been conducted to study the influence of the mooring system on wec hydrodynamic responses according to the decay tests it is seen that the natural heave period of the different systems is identical and equal to 7 39s the natural surge period is different i e the result of the nylon system the polyester system and the nylon system with weights is equal to 32 6s 32 7s and 32 8s respectively the natural pitch period of the nylon system is 8 16s and the polyester system and the nylon system with weights have the identical natural pitch period which is equal to 8 20s the polyester system is inferior to the other two systems in terms of energy production the influence of the clumped weights on the energy conversion of the wec dependent on the incident wave period the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights when the incident wave period less than 7s however the energy conversion performance of the nylon system with weights is enhanced greatly with the increase of wave period the efficiency of the nylon system with weights is greater than that of the nylon system when the wec operates in the wave condition with t varies from 7 to 9s and the difference between them is considerable the heave resonance shows significant effect in improving system energy harvesting performance and the system hydrodynamic responses and mooring tension raos are reduced with the increase of wave height in the small amplitude wave conditions the nylon system is slightly more efficient than the nylon system with weights however the nylon system with weights shows the potential in harvesting more energy in harsh wave conditions than the nylon system in the pitch resonance tests the wave height plays a negative role in increasing the motion and mooring tension raos of the polyester system however the dynamic responses of the other two systems are insensitive to wave height three irregular wave model tests were performed including two regular cases and one heave resonance case the polyester system exhibits a more significant pitch motion response than the other two systems while an inverse result is found in the pitch and heave motion responses the nylon systems are preferable in extracting wave energy and their efficiency is almost twice that of the polyester system in corresponding wave condition compared with the surge motion the heave and pitch motion responses are more closely related to mooring tensions the mooring tensions of different systems are similar in all tested wave conditions overall the polyester rope is too stiff in the application for wec which interferes with energy harvesting activities the nylon rope is a favourable material for station keeping of wec which is flexible enough however it needs to be noted that the results apply to the present wec configuration for the other wecs with different working principles further study is needed the compact compliant mooring system design which consists of nylon rope buoy chain and clumped weights hnbw is the best mooring concept for the wec although in the small amplitude or small period wave conditions the captured energy by the nylon system is slightly greater than that of the nylon system with weights the energy production of the nylon system with weights increases considerably in large wave period especially close to the heave resonance period and large wave height conditions besides it is seen the energy conversion efficiency of the nylon system with weights is greater than that of the nylon system in the wave condition with wave period varying from 7s to 13s which covers most of the energetic sea states in the portuguese islands furthermore the conclusions in this work are given in terms of the energy capturing performance while the other factors such as survivability reliability capital costs of synthetic fibre mooring ropes need to take into consideration during the mooring design

20654,a pair of flexible cable models were fabricated to simulate the wake induced vibration wiv of two tandem stay cables the center to center separation of the two cable models was fixed to be 4d the in plane and out of plane accelerations of both upstream and downwind models were measured as the incoming wind speed increased from 3 m s to 40 m s r e 0 96 104 1 28 105 the response characteristics of wivs including the vibration amplitude power spectral density and non dimensional trajectory were investigated in detail the results show that the downstream model begin to strongly vibrate when the wind speed is above a critical value and the wiv is dominated by the in plane oscillation which is consistent with those observed from an elastic model test in previous reports however different from the previous experimental results three critical reduced speeds were observed and four reduced speed ranges were proposed according to the response characteristics of wiv the reasons for the response characteristics of wiv are qualitatively analyzed the wake stiffness and the drag force effect are the main reasons that the dominating frequency of wiv is always higher than the fundamental frequency and increases with the wind speed keywords tandem stay cables wake induced vibration response characteristics wake stiffness wind induced vibration of stay cables 1 introduction the cables are prone to wind flow induced vibration due to their low damping and large flexibility jing et al 2017 2018 according to different excitation mechanisms the wind flow induced vibration of cables or cylinders are generally classified into four types as follows vortex induced vibration viv ice galloping rain wind induced vibration and wake induced vibration wiv the wiv of cables in a group is still a concerned topic for reseachers and engineers although it had been studied for several decades carmo 2009 many researchers had investigated the response characteristics flow patterns and aerodynamic hydrodynamic forces of two parallel cables cylinders through wind tunnel tests water channel tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations zdravkovich 1977 1987 sumner 2010 and bearman 2011 had comprehensively summarized the research achievement before 2010 the direct reason of the wiv of stay cables is the aerodynamic hydrodynamic forces causing by the air water flow around the cable structures many reseachers investigated the flow patterns and aerodynamic hydrodynamic forces of the cables trying to reveal the excitation mechanism of the wiv after a series of experiments zdravkovich 1987 subdivided the flow pattern of two tandem cylinders into three basic types according to the center to center distance of the two models l when the two models are very close 1 0 l d 1 2 1 8 where d is the external diameter of the models the flow field around the two models is similar with that of a single bluff body therefore the flow pattern was defined as single bluff body when the downstream model is located in the region of 1 2 1 8 l d 3 4 3 8 the flow patten was referred to as shear layer attachment because in this region the downstream model surface touches the shear layer separated from the upstream one when the downstream model is far away from the upstream model 3 4 3 8 l d the vortex shed from the upstream model develops in the gap between the two models and then periodically hits the downstream model the flow patten was defined as vortex shedding from each model xu et al 2004 and zhou and yiu 2006 reported similar classifications and renamed the flow patterns as extended body regime 1 0 l d 2 0 reattachment regime 2 0 l d 5 0 and co shedding regime 5 0 l d respectively in addition they further subdivided the reattachment regime into after body attachment regime 2 0 l d 3 0 and fore body attachment regime 3 0 l d 5 0 in the after body attachment regime the upstream model s shear layer reattaches on the rear of the downstream model and in the fore body attachment regime and the shear layer reattaches on the front surface these flow patterns had been verified through experiments and cfd simulations by ljungkrona and sunden 1993 carmo et al 2010 2011 lin et al 2002 and zhou and yin 2006 zhang and melbourne 1992 alam et al 2003 and sumner and schenstead 2006 measured the aerodynamic hydraulic forces of two tandem circular models and found that the force coefficients of the downstream model are sensitive to l in particular the force coefficients sharply increase under the gap ratio l d of 3 5 3 8 hu et al 2019 investigated the instantaneous flow structures and force coefficients of two tandem models with the gap ratio of 2 0 5 0 wu et al 2019 simulated flow structures and the aerodynamic forces of two staggered circular models at subcritical reynolds number when gap ratio is in the range of 1 5 4 recently the machine learning techniques has become more and more popular hu and kwok 2020 predicted the wind pressures of two tandem circular models using a machine learning method the flow pattern and flow forces of two tandem models indicate that the wiv of tandem models depends on the gap ratio l d and is much more complex than the wind induced vibration of single model chen et al 2015 gao et al 2017 2018 plenty of numerical simulations and experiments have been conducted to investigate the wiv of two tandem models the response characteristics of the wiv had been studied through both wind tunnel testing and water channel testing bokaian and geoola 1984 conducted experiments in a water channel using rigid models and investigated the vibration of an elastic cylinder behind a fixed upstream cylinder they observed that the vibration of the downstream model could be a vortex resonance galloping combined vortex resonance and galloping or separated vortex resonance and galloping depending on the gap ratio and damping zdravkovich 1985 tested the vibration responses of two tandem elastic models with a gap ratio of 4 0 in a wind tunnel their experimental results showed that large vibration of the downstream model occurred when the wind speed was above a critical value hover et al 2001 and assi et al 2006 2010 2014 observed similar phenomenons in water channel tests and the dominant frequency increased when the incoming speed became higher in addition assi et al 2013 noticed that the strong vibration of the downstream cylinder disappeared when the unsteady vortices of the upsteam model were suppressed recently xu et al 2019 measured the vibration response and fluid force of the downstream model during flow induced vibration in a water channel they found that the response features of the downstream model were similar to those of viv huera huarte and gonzález 2019 tested two rigid models with unequal diameters and investigated the effect of diameter ratio on the response characteristics in the recent decade more and more researchers began to use flexible models to investigate the reponse characteristics of wiv of parallel cables li et al 2013 huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 observed that the downstream cylinder has three types of oscillation viv wiv and their combinations when the gap ratio is in the range of 2 0 4 0 when 4 0 l d 8 0 the downstream model strongly vibrates at higher incoming speed brika and laneville 1999 and huera huarte et al 2016 measured the response of a flexible downstream model behind a fixed model in a wind tunnel recently xu et al 2018 measured the multi mode vibration of the flexible downstream model in a water channel armin et al 2018 and hu et al 2019 studied the effect of the spacing gap on the response characteristics of two flexible tandem models he et al 2018 reproduced the wiv of two unparallel flexible models in a wind tunnel and successfully suppressed the wiv using crosstie measure chen et al 2018 2020 investigated the vibration of the suspenders behind a big tower and found that the rear cables always have stronger vibration than the front cables because the rear cables suffer the combined wake interferences of both tower and front cables these summaries of previous studies reveal that substantial efforts had been undertaken on the response characteristics of the wiv of tandem cable models a majority of the early studies treated the two tandem parallel cables as two ideal two dimensional rigid models and the degree of freedom of the downstream model were always restricted recently the experiments of wiv with flexible models have been becoming popular because they can respond with multiple modes in the present study a series of wind tunnel tests are conducted using two parallel flexible models and the response characteristics in terms of vibration amplitude power spectral density and non dimensional trajectory of wivs are investigated in detail different with previous studies the tandem flexible models are specially designed and fabricated and can simulate multi modes vibration in both parallel out of plane and transverse in plane to the wind direction of both upstream and downstream models in addition the simulated wivs of the flexible models are three dimensional vibration which agrees with the real wind induced vibration of stay cables 2 wind tunnel tests 2 1 wind tunnel the wivs of two tandem stay cables were simulated in the wind tunnel laboratory of central south university changsha china the experiments were conducted in the high speed test section with the length of 15 0 m the width of 3 0 m and the height of 3 0 m the wind tunnel has the maximal wind speed of 94 m s with turbulence intensity lower than 0 5 2 2 cable models two flexible cable models are designed and fabricated to model a pair of neighboring stay cables as shows in fig 1 the detailed information of the models and the support framework had been reported by he et al 2018 fig 2 shows the cross section of the cable models the steel wire inside the cable models bears the tension force eight mass blocks are uniformly installed along the model axis to adjust the linear mass the sponge fills the space among the mass blocks and covers the mass blocks to model the external diameter the material of the model surface is polyethylene same with those of real stay cables the parameters of the flexible cable models are summarized in table 1 the center to center distance is set as 4d because it had been well studied with rigid models and is easy to compare after the free vibration tests the fundamental frequency f and damping ratio ξ of the models were identified as 4 974 hz and 0 1 respectively the scruton number is calculated as s c m ξ ρ d 2 3 2 where m is the linear mass and ρ 1 225 kg m3 represents the air density the sag to span ratio s l of the cable models is calculated as 0 5 as the tandem stay cables are always twins the models are set with equal frequency however it is worth noting that when the center to center distance is relatively small eg smaller than 2 5d the frequency of the upstream model should been considered because the vibration of the downstream model might affect the response of the upstream one in turn the vibration of the upstream model will change the incoming wind flow and vibration response of the downstream model the installed of the two parallel models is shown in fig 1 the detail information has been reported by he et al 2018 the inclined angle α of the models is set as 16 same to a real stay cable in the wuhu yangtze river cable stayed bridge the wind direction is perpendicular to the cable plane and the yawing angle β is set as 90 2 3 testing and sensors to measure both in plane and out of plane vibration of the cable models eight accelerometers are installed at two test sections of the two models as shown in fig 1 the test sections of the upstream model l 1 and l 2 are located 53 cm and 120 cm away from the lower end respectively and these of downstream models are located 51 cm and 118 cm respectively the accuracy and the sampling frequency of the accelerometers are 0 001 g and 1000 hz respectively during the tests the incoming wind speed u was raised 3 40 m s when u 12 m s the wind speed was increased by increment of 1 m s in each test when 14 u 22 m s the wind speed was raised by increment of 2 m s in each test and when u 25 m s the interval of wind speed was 5 m s the corresponding reduced speed u r u df 0 where f 0 is the vibration frequency is calculated as 12 8 170 2 and the reynolds number r e u d υ where ν denotes the kinematic viscosity of air is calculated as 0 96 104 1 28 105 3 response characteristics of wivs of tandem cables the in plane and out of plane accelerations of both models were measured as the incoming wind speed was raised from 3 to 40 m s it is worth noting that only the accelerations measured at the second test section l 2 are presented and analyzed in this paper because those at the first sections are similar during the experiments the author observed that the in plane vibration of the downstream model was very strong while the out of plane vibration of the downstream model was small and the unwind model was almost static consequently the time history of the in plane and out of plane acceleration of the downstream model under different wind speeds is displayed as shown in fig 3 the others are not presented here the results show that the in plane vibration of the downstream model was steady and the acceleration amplitude increased when the wind speed became higher when the wind speed was lower than 12 m s the maximum acceleration was approximately 33 m s2 when the wind speed was above 14 m s the acceleration amplitude suddenly increased 5 times and the maximum value reached 200 m s2 the out of plane acceleration is much smaller than the in plane acceleration for example when the wind speed is 40 m s the maximum out of plane acceleration is 70 2 m s2 approximately 35 of the in plane one a video clip recording the large vibration under the wind speed of 30 m s can be downloaded from the supplementary material in the web the spectral analyses of the measured accelerations were then conducted through a short time fourier transform fig 4 shows the power spectral density psd of the in plane accelerations under different wind speeds the frequency range is set as 0 50 hz for a better exhibition the results show that when the wind speed was lower than 8 m s two obvious peaks appeared in the psd curves representing the two dominant frequencies of vibration the first dominant frequency is close to the fundamental frequency of the model while the second one is the vortex shedding frequency xu et al 2014 the red dash in the web version line represents s t 0 2 both dominant frequencies increased when the wind speed became higher the increment of the first dominant frequency was much lower than that of the second one when the wind speed was above 8 m s the second dominant frequency vortex shedding frequency disappeared in the psd curve because the energy in first dominant frequency is much higher than that in the second one the first dominant frequency continued to increase with wind speed and the power at the dominant frequency remained increasing until the wind speed reached 22 m s and then turned to decrease when the wind speed further increased to 40 m s when the wind speed is 22 25 m s the re number is 7 8 104 and in subcritical state zdravkovich 1997 in this state the transition of the shear layers of the upstream model occurs and the wake flow changes the wake flow of the upstream model is the incoming flow of the downstream model and significantly affects the wivs therefore re number has great effects on the vibration of the downstream model the decrease of the energy in the dominant frequency when the wind speed is above 22 m s is mainly caused by the re number effects however it needs further investigation in the future the root mean square rms of the measured accelerations of both models is shown in fig 5 the horizontal coordinate is the reduced speed u r u d f 0 which has been widely used to better understand the response characteristics of wivs the results show that the rms of acceleration of the upstream model was lower than 25 m s2 which verified that the upstream model did not experience strong vibrations in the entire wind speed range similar phenomenon had been reported by xu et al 2018 the downstream model experienced a strong vibration and the vibration was dominated by the in plane mode therefore the following analyses mainly focus on the rms of the in plane acceleration of the downstream model the rms of in plane acceleration of the downstream model obviously varies with the reduced speed when the reduced speed was lower than 50 8 12 0 m s the rms was very small less than 12 5 m s2 and then the rms suddenly increased to 70 m s2 at the reduced speed of 59 3 14 m s this speed had been treated as the critical speed of wiv he et al 2018 after that the rms steadily and almost linearly increased when the reduced speed became higher until the reduced speed reached 105 8 25 m s the increment of rms turned to slow down the maximum rms of the in plane acceleration of the downstream model was 105 6 m s2 at the reduced speed of 169 3 for the out of plane acceleration the rms was small and continuously increased with the reduced speed the maximum rms of the out of plane acceleration of the downstream model was 29 3 m s2 at the reduced speed of 169 3 fig 6 shows the frequency ratio r f f f 0 where f is the dominant frequency of vibration of the in plane acceleration of the downstream model under different wind speeds fig 6 a shows the first dominant frequency under different reduced speed cases the results show that the frequency ratio was equal to 1 0 when the reduced speed was lower than 17 5 u 4 m s and then increased to 1 031 at the reduced speed of 21 2 u 5 m s after that the frequency ratio linearly and steadily increases with the reduced speed in the range of 21 2 50 8 u 12 m s except for the case of 43 3 u 10 m s where the non dimensional frequency suddenly drops to 1 018 when the reduced speed reached 59 3 u 14 m s the frequency ratio suddenly increased to 1 092 and then it steadily and linearly increased with the reduced speed until the reduced speed reaching 105 8 u 25 m s when the reduced speed was above 105 8 the frequency ratio began nonlinearly increase with the reduced speed the largest frequency ratio is 1 325 at the reduced speed of 174 7 u 40 m s that means the vibration frequency increased by 32 5 compared with the original fundamental frequency of the model for the cases with a reduced speed of less than 30 the two dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder vibration are compared with those measured by assi 2010 and the vortex shedding frequency of a circular cylinder st 0 2 as shown in fig 6 b the results show that the first dominant frequency was close to those measured by assi 2010 and the second one was consistent with the vortex shedding frequency both of them linearly increased with reduced speed these two dominant frequencies had been measured in the lift force reported by assi 2010 and nguyen et al 2018 fig 7 shows the rms of the vibration displacement of the models when the wind speed rised from 3 to 40 m s the displacement was calculated through numerical integration with the cutoff frequencies of 1 0 hz and 100 0 hz the results show that the rms of in plane displacement of the downstream model is much larger than that of out of plane displacement the out of plane vibration was very small and the rms of displacement is lower than 0 93 cm 0 2d in addition the rms of both in plane and out of plane displacement of the upstream model was lower than 0 46 cm 0 1d consequently the in plane displacement of the downstream model is mainly discussed as follows when the reduced speed was lower than 33 9 u 8 m s the rms of in plane displacement of the downstream model was less than 0 33 cm 0 07d and then when the reduced speed was in the range of 33 9 u r 50 8 8 m s u 12 m s the rms of in plane displacement steadily and linearly increased with the reduced speed and reached 1 7 cm 0 36d under the reduced speed of 50 8 when the reduced speed reached 59 3 u 14 m s the rms of in plane displacement suddenly increased to 5 29 cm 1 11d after that the rms of in plane displacement steadily and linearly increased with the reduced speed until reaching the maximum value of 6 94 cm 1 46 d at the reduced speed of 105 8 u 25 m s when the reduced speed was above 105 8 the rms of in plane displacement turned to decrease it decreased to 5 08 cm 1 07d at the reduced speed of 169 3 u 40 m s the decrease in rms of displacement is caused by the re number effects the obtained displacements were non dimensionalized by dividing them by the external diameter of the cable fig 8 shows the non dimensional trajectories of the downstream model at different wind speeds when the incoming wind speed was equal to 10 m s and 12 m s the non dimensional trajectories were close to an ellipse and the out of plane amplitude was much smaller than the in plane amplitude when the wind speed was above 12 m s the non dimensional trajectories were close to a vertical line which confirmed that the downstream model was dominated by the in plane vibration the maximum displacement amplitude is 2 2 d under the wind speeds of 25 m s these non dimensional trajectories are different from those observed by he et al 2018 in the experiments of he et al 2018 the two models were not parallel arranged and the trajectories of wivs were close to circles it indicates that the included angle between the two models have significant effect on the vibration characteristics of wivs the variation of trajectory when the wind speed increases from 12 m s to 14 m s is caused by re number effects 4 discussion the above experimental results showed that the in plane vibration dominated the wiv of the downstream model therefore only the in plane vibration of the downstream model is discussed in this section the acceleration dominating frequency and displacement varied with the reduced speed there were three critical reduced speeds in the response curves according to the critical speeds the wiv of the downstream model can be classified into four ranges r1 r2 r3 and r4 as illustrated in figs 4 7 the response characteristics are different in the four ranges the first critical reduced speed was 33 9 u 8 m s below this critical speed r1 both vortex shedding frequency and wiv frequency appeared in the psd curves that means although the rms of the acceleration and displacement was small the vibration contains both vortex induced and wake induced components above this critical speed r2 vortex shedding frequency disappeared the wiv frequency became the only dominant frequency and the rms of acceleration and displacement steadily increased with the reduced speed in this range the wiv began dominating the vibration model but as the wind speed was relatively low the wind excitation was not strong enough to excite large amplitude vibration the second critical reduced speed was 59 3 u 14 m s under this critical speed both vibration frequency and amplitude suddenly increased this critical speed was treated as the onset speed of wiv of the downstream model when the reduced speed exceeds the second critical speed r3 both frequency and amplitude steadily and linearly increased with reduced speed until the speed reaching the third critical value 105 8 u 25 m s above the third critical speed r4 the frequency became to nonlinearly increase the rms of displacement turned to decrease and the rms of acceleration became constant the original reason of the third critical wind speed should be the re number effects and the transition of the shear layers of the upsteam model fig 9 shows the variation of the frequency ratio versus the rmss of acceleration and displacement the results show that the vibration frequency almost linearly increased with the vibration amplitude when the rms of acceleration was lower than 94 3 m s2 and the frequency ratio was smaller than 1 147 corresponding to the case of the third critical speed however when the rms of acceleration was higher than 94 3 m s2 and the frequency ratio was above 1 147 the frequency ratio suddenly increased and the vibration amplitude decreased these results indicate that the vibration amplitude and vibration frequency should have interaction with each other according to the experimental results of assi et al 2013 the frequency characteristics of the wiv of the flexible model should be caused by the wake stiffness and drag force effects during the wiv the wake stiffness works as an in plane distributed spring while the drag force increases the tension force both of them increase the vibration frequency of the model and both of them depend on the incoming wind speed therefore the vibration frequency increased when the wind speed became higher however as both wake stiffness and drag forces are also related to the displacement for the flexible model the effects of wake stiffness and drag forces are more complex compared with those of rigid elastic model as derived by assi et al 2013 further studies are needed to investigate how the two factors affect the dominant frequency of wiv of flexible tandem cables 5 conclusion in the present study a pair of flexible models of stay cables in the tandem arrangement was tested in a wind tunnel to investigate the response characteristics of wiv the vibration amplitude psd and displacement trajectory of the downstream model were discussed in detail the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 strong vibrations of the downstream model ocurred when the incoming wind speed exceeded 14 m s corresponding to the reduced speed of 59 3 and r e of 4 5 104 the first mode in plane vibration dominated the wiv of the downstream model 2 the wiv occurred along with vortex induced vibration when the wind speed was relatively low and the amplitude of wiv was small when the wind speed was above a critical value 14 m s the wiv suddenly dominated the vibration the vibration frequency of wiv increased when the wind speed becomes higher and jumped with the vibration amplitude at the wind speed of 14 m s 3 the wiv of the flexible model can be clarified into four ranges according to the response characteristics they are referred to as r1 to r4 with the rising of wind speed in r1 both wiv and vortex induced vibration occur in r2 the wiv dominates the vibration both amplitude and frequency steadily and linearly increase when the speed rises but the vibration amplitude is still small in r3 both vibration frequency and amplitude suddenly increases to a large level and then maintain steadily and linearly increase with the wind speed in r4 the displacement amplitude turns to decrease the acceleration amplitude becomes constant and the frequency becomes nonlinearly increase when the wind speed becomes higher from r3 to r4 the main reason of the variation of vibration characteristics of wiv is the re number effects and the transition of the shear layers of the upstream model 4 the frequency characteristics of the wiv of the flexible should be caused by the wake stiffness and drag force effects which are more complex compared with those of rigid elastic model how wake stiffness and drag force influence the dominant

20654,a pair of flexible cable models were fabricated to simulate the wake induced vibration wiv of two tandem stay cables the center to center separation of the two cable models was fixed to be 4d the in plane and out of plane accelerations of both upstream and downwind models were measured as the incoming wind speed increased from 3 m s to 40 m s r e 0 96 104 1 28 105 the response characteristics of wivs including the vibration amplitude power spectral density and non dimensional trajectory were investigated in detail the results show that the downstream model begin to strongly vibrate when the wind speed is above a critical value and the wiv is dominated by the in plane oscillation which is consistent with those observed from an elastic model test in previous reports however different from the previous experimental results three critical reduced speeds were observed and four reduced speed ranges were proposed according to the response characteristics of wiv the reasons for the response characteristics of wiv are qualitatively analyzed the wake stiffness and the drag force effect are the main reasons that the dominating frequency of wiv is always higher than the fundamental frequency and increases with the wind speed keywords tandem stay cables wake induced vibration response characteristics wake stiffness wind induced vibration of stay cables 1 introduction the cables are prone to wind flow induced vibration due to their low damping and large flexibility jing et al 2017 2018 according to different excitation mechanisms the wind flow induced vibration of cables or cylinders are generally classified into four types as follows vortex induced vibration viv ice galloping rain wind induced vibration and wake induced vibration wiv the wiv of cables in a group is still a concerned topic for reseachers and engineers although it had been studied for several decades carmo 2009 many researchers had investigated the response characteristics flow patterns and aerodynamic hydrodynamic forces of two parallel cables cylinders through wind tunnel tests water channel tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations zdravkovich 1977 1987 sumner 2010 and bearman 2011 had comprehensively summarized the research achievement before 2010 the direct reason of the wiv of stay cables is the aerodynamic hydrodynamic forces causing by the air water flow around the cable structures many reseachers investigated the flow patterns and aerodynamic hydrodynamic forces of the cables trying to reveal the excitation mechanism of the wiv after a series of experiments zdravkovich 1987 subdivided the flow pattern of two tandem cylinders into three basic types according to the center to center distance of the two models l when the two models are very close 1 0 l d 1 2 1 8 where d is the external diameter of the models the flow field around the two models is similar with that of a single bluff body therefore the flow pattern was defined as single bluff body when the downstream model is located in the region of 1 2 1 8 l d 3 4 3 8 the flow patten was referred to as shear layer attachment because in this region the downstream model surface touches the shear layer separated from the upstream one when the downstream model is far away from the upstream model 3 4 3 8 l d the vortex shed from the upstream model develops in the gap between the two models and then periodically hits the downstream model the flow patten was defined as vortex shedding from each model xu et al 2004 and zhou and yiu 2006 reported similar classifications and renamed the flow patterns as extended body regime 1 0 l d 2 0 reattachment regime 2 0 l d 5 0 and co shedding regime 5 0 l d respectively in addition they further subdivided the reattachment regime into after body attachment regime 2 0 l d 3 0 and fore body attachment regime 3 0 l d 5 0 in the after body attachment regime the upstream model s shear layer reattaches on the rear of the downstream model and in the fore body attachment regime and the shear layer reattaches on the front surface these flow patterns had been verified through experiments and cfd simulations by ljungkrona and sunden 1993 carmo et al 2010 2011 lin et al 2002 and zhou and yin 2006 zhang and melbourne 1992 alam et al 2003 and sumner and schenstead 2006 measured the aerodynamic hydraulic forces of two tandem circular models and found that the force coefficients of the downstream model are sensitive to l in particular the force coefficients sharply increase under the gap ratio l d of 3 5 3 8 hu et al 2019 investigated the instantaneous flow structures and force coefficients of two tandem models with the gap ratio of 2 0 5 0 wu et al 2019 simulated flow structures and the aerodynamic forces of two staggered circular models at subcritical reynolds number when gap ratio is in the range of 1 5 4 recently the machine learning techniques has become more and more popular hu and kwok 2020 predicted the wind pressures of two tandem circular models using a machine learning method the flow pattern and flow forces of two tandem models indicate that the wiv of tandem models depends on the gap ratio l d and is much more complex than the wind induced vibration of single model chen et al 2015 gao et al 2017 2018 plenty of numerical simulations and experiments have been conducted to investigate the wiv of two tandem models the response characteristics of the wiv had been studied through both wind tunnel testing and water channel testing bokaian and geoola 1984 conducted experiments in a water channel using rigid models and investigated the vibration of an elastic cylinder behind a fixed upstream cylinder they observed that the vibration of the downstream model could be a vortex resonance galloping combined vortex resonance and galloping or separated vortex resonance and galloping depending on the gap ratio and damping zdravkovich 1985 tested the vibration responses of two tandem elastic models with a gap ratio of 4 0 in a wind tunnel their experimental results showed that large vibration of the downstream model occurred when the wind speed was above a critical value hover et al 2001 and assi et al 2006 2010 2014 observed similar phenomenons in water channel tests and the dominant frequency increased when the incoming speed became higher in addition assi et al 2013 noticed that the strong vibration of the downstream cylinder disappeared when the unsteady vortices of the upsteam model were suppressed recently xu et al 2019 measured the vibration response and fluid force of the downstream model during flow induced vibration in a water channel they found that the response features of the downstream model were similar to those of viv huera huarte and gonzález 2019 tested two rigid models with unequal diameters and investigated the effect of diameter ratio on the response characteristics in the recent decade more and more researchers began to use flexible models to investigate the reponse characteristics of wiv of parallel cables li et al 2013 huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 observed that the downstream cylinder has three types of oscillation viv wiv and their combinations when the gap ratio is in the range of 2 0 4 0 when 4 0 l d 8 0 the downstream model strongly vibrates at higher incoming speed brika and laneville 1999 and huera huarte et al 2016 measured the response of a flexible downstream model behind a fixed model in a wind tunnel recently xu et al 2018 measured the multi mode vibration of the flexible downstream model in a water channel armin et al 2018 and hu et al 2019 studied the effect of the spacing gap on the response characteristics of two flexible tandem models he et al 2018 reproduced the wiv of two unparallel flexible models in a wind tunnel and successfully suppressed the wiv using crosstie measure chen et al 2018 2020 investigated the vibration of the suspenders behind a big tower and found that the rear cables always have stronger vibration than the front cables because the rear cables suffer the combined wake interferences of both tower and front cables these summaries of previous studies reveal that substantial efforts had been undertaken on the response characteristics of the wiv of tandem cable models a majority of the early studies treated the two tandem parallel cables as two ideal two dimensional rigid models and the degree of freedom of the downstream model were always restricted recently the experiments of wiv with flexible models have been becoming popular because they can respond with multiple modes in the present study a series of wind tunnel tests are conducted using two parallel flexible models and the response characteristics in terms of vibration amplitude power spectral density and non dimensional trajectory of wivs are investigated in detail different with previous studies the tandem flexible models are specially designed and fabricated and can simulate multi modes vibration in both parallel out of plane and transverse in plane to the wind direction of both upstream and downstream models in addition the simulated wivs of the flexible models are three dimensional vibration which agrees with the real wind induced vibration of stay cables 2 wind tunnel tests 2 1 wind tunnel the wivs of two tandem stay cables were simulated in the wind tunnel laboratory of central south university changsha china the experiments were conducted in the high speed test section with the length of 15 0 m the width of 3 0 m and the height of 3 0 m the wind tunnel has the maximal wind speed of 94 m s with turbulence intensity lower than 0 5 2 2 cable models two flexible cable models are designed and fabricated to model a pair of neighboring stay cables as shows in fig 1 the detailed information of the models and the support framework had been reported by he et al 2018 fig 2 shows the cross section of the cable models the steel wire inside the cable models bears the tension force eight mass blocks are uniformly installed along the model axis to adjust the linear mass the sponge fills the space among the mass blocks and covers the mass blocks to model the external diameter the material of the model surface is polyethylene same with those of real stay cables the parameters of the flexible cable models are summarized in table 1 the center to center distance is set as 4d because it had been well studied with rigid models and is easy to compare after the free vibration tests the fundamental frequency f and damping ratio ξ of the models were identified as 4 974 hz and 0 1 respectively the scruton number is calculated as s c m ξ ρ d 2 3 2 where m is the linear mass and ρ 1 225 kg m3 represents the air density the sag to span ratio s l of the cable models is calculated as 0 5 as the tandem stay cables are always twins the models are set with equal frequency however it is worth noting that when the center to center distance is relatively small eg smaller than 2 5d the frequency of the upstream model should been considered because the vibration of the downstream model might affect the response of the upstream one in turn the vibration of the upstream model will change the incoming wind flow and vibration response of the downstream model the installed of the two parallel models is shown in fig 1 the detail information has been reported by he et al 2018 the inclined angle α of the models is set as 16 same to a real stay cable in the wuhu yangtze river cable stayed bridge the wind direction is perpendicular to the cable plane and the yawing angle β is set as 90 2 3 testing and sensors to measure both in plane and out of plane vibration of the cable models eight accelerometers are installed at two test sections of the two models as shown in fig 1 the test sections of the upstream model l 1 and l 2 are located 53 cm and 120 cm away from the lower end respectively and these of downstream models are located 51 cm and 118 cm respectively the accuracy and the sampling frequency of the accelerometers are 0 001 g and 1000 hz respectively during the tests the incoming wind speed u was raised 3 40 m s when u 12 m s the wind speed was increased by increment of 1 m s in each test when 14 u 22 m s the wind speed was raised by increment of 2 m s in each test and when u 25 m s the interval of wind speed was 5 m s the corresponding reduced speed u r u df 0 where f 0 is the vibration frequency is calculated as 12 8 170 2 and the reynolds number r e u d υ where ν denotes the kinematic viscosity of air is calculated as 0 96 104 1 28 105 3 response characteristics of wivs of tandem cables the in plane and out of plane accelerations of both models were measured as the incoming wind speed was raised from 3 to 40 m s it is worth noting that only the accelerations measured at the second test section l 2 are presented and analyzed in this paper because those at the first sections are similar during the experiments the author observed that the in plane vibration of the downstream model was very strong while the out of plane vibration of the downstream model was small and the unwind model was almost static consequently the time history of the in plane and out of plane acceleration of the downstream model under different wind speeds is displayed as shown in fig 3 the others are not presented here the results show that the in plane vibration of the downstream model was steady and the acceleration amplitude increased when the wind speed became higher when the wind speed was lower than 12 m s the maximum acceleration was approximately 33 m s2 when the wind speed was above 14 m s the acceleration amplitude suddenly increased 5 times and the maximum value reached 200 m s2 the out of plane acceleration is much smaller than the in plane acceleration for example when the wind speed is 40 m s the maximum out of plane acceleration is 70 2 m s2 approximately 35 of the in plane one a video clip recording the large vibration under the wind speed of 30 m s can be downloaded from the supplementary material in the web the spectral analyses of the measured accelerations were then conducted through a short time fourier transform fig 4 shows the power spectral density psd of the in plane accelerations under different wind speeds the frequency range is set as 0 50 hz for a better exhibition the results show that when the wind speed was lower than 8 m s two obvious peaks appeared in the psd curves representing the two dominant frequencies of vibration the first dominant frequency is close to the fundamental frequency of the model while the second one is the vortex shedding frequency xu et al 2014 the red dash in the web version line represents s t 0 2 both dominant frequencies increased when the wind speed became higher the increment of the first dominant frequency was much lower than that of the second one when the wind speed was above 8 m s the second dominant frequency vortex shedding frequency disappeared in the psd curve because the energy in first dominant frequency is much higher than that in the second one the first dominant frequency continued to increase with wind speed and the power at the dominant frequency remained increasing until the wind speed reached 22 m s and then turned to decrease when the wind speed further increased to 40 m s when the wind speed is 22 25 m s the re number is 7 8 104 and in subcritical state zdravkovich 1997 in this state the transition of the shear layers of the upstream model occurs and the wake flow changes the wake flow of the upstream model is the incoming flow of the downstream model and significantly affects the wivs therefore re number has great effects on the vibration of the downstream model the decrease of the energy in the dominant frequency when the wind speed is above 22 m s is mainly caused by the re number effects however it needs further investigation in the future the root mean square rms of the measured accelerations of both models is shown in fig 5 the horizontal coordinate is the reduced speed u r u d f 0 which has been widely used to better understand the response characteristics of wivs the results show that the rms of acceleration of the upstream model was lower than 25 m s2 which verified that the upstream model did not experience strong vibrations in the entire wind speed range similar phenomenon had been reported by xu et al 2018 the downstream model experienced a strong vibration and the vibration was dominated by the in plane mode therefore the following analyses mainly focus on the rms of the in plane acceleration of the downstream model the rms of in plane acceleration of the downstream model obviously varies with the reduced speed when the reduced speed was lower than 50 8 12 0 m s the rms was very small less than 12 5 m s2 and then the rms suddenly increased to 70 m s2 at the reduced speed of 59 3 14 m s this speed had been treated as the critical speed of wiv he et al 2018 after that the rms steadily and almost linearly increased when the reduced speed became higher until the reduced speed reached 105 8 25 m s the increment of rms turned to slow down the maximum rms of the in plane acceleration of the downstream model was 105 6 m s2 at the reduced speed of 169 3 for the out of plane acceleration the rms was small and continuously increased with the reduced speed the maximum rms of the out of plane acceleration of the downstream model was 29 3 m s2 at the reduced speed of 169 3 fig 6 shows the frequency ratio r f f f 0 where f is the dominant frequency of vibration of the in plane acceleration of the downstream model under different wind speeds fig 6 a shows the first dominant frequency under different reduced speed cases the results show that the frequency ratio was equal to 1 0 when the reduced speed was lower than 17 5 u 4 m s and then increased to 1 031 at the reduced speed of 21 2 u 5 m s after that the frequency ratio linearly and steadily increases with the reduced speed in the range of 21 2 50 8 u 12 m s except for the case of 43 3 u 10 m s where the non dimensional frequency suddenly drops to 1 018 when the reduced speed reached 59 3 u 14 m s the frequency ratio suddenly increased to 1 092 and then it steadily and linearly increased with the reduced speed until the reduced speed reaching 105 8 u 25 m s when the reduced speed was above 105 8 the frequency ratio began nonlinearly increase with the reduced speed the largest frequency ratio is 1 325 at the reduced speed of 174 7 u 40 m s that means the vibration frequency increased by 32 5 compared with the original fundamental frequency of the model for the cases with a reduced speed of less than 30 the two dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder vibration are compared with those measured by assi 2010 and the vortex shedding frequency of a circular cylinder st 0 2 as shown in fig 6 b the results show that the first dominant frequency was close to those measured by assi 2010 and the second one was consistent with the vortex shedding frequency both of them linearly increased with reduced speed these two dominant frequencies had been measured in the lift force reported by assi 2010 and nguyen et al 2018 fig 7 shows the rms of the vibration displacement of the models when the wind speed rised from 3 to 40 m s the displacement was calculated through numerical integration with the cutoff frequencies of 1 0 hz and 100 0 hz the results show that the rms of in plane displacement of the downstream model is much larger than that of out of plane displacement the out of plane vibration was very small and the rms of displacement is lower than 0 93 cm 0 2d in addition the rms of both in plane and out of plane displacement of the upstream model was lower than 0 46 cm 0 1d consequently the in plane displacement of the downstream model is mainly discussed as follows when the reduced speed was lower than 33 9 u 8 m s the rms of in plane displacement of the downstream model was less than 0 33 cm 0 07d and then when the reduced speed was in the range of 33 9 u r 50 8 8 m s u 12 m s the rms of in plane displacement steadily and linearly increased with the reduced speed and reached 1 7 cm 0 36d under the reduced speed of 50 8 when the reduced speed reached 59 3 u 14 m s the rms of in plane displacement suddenly increased to 5 29 cm 1 11d after that the rms of in plane displacement steadily and linearly increased with the reduced speed until reaching the maximum value of 6 94 cm 1 46 d at the reduced speed of 105 8 u 25 m s when the reduced speed was above 105 8 the rms of in plane displacement turned to decrease it decreased to 5 08 cm 1 07d at the reduced speed of 169 3 u 40 m s the decrease in rms of displacement is caused by the re number effects the obtained displacements were non dimensionalized by dividing them by the external diameter of the cable fig 8 shows the non dimensional trajectories of the downstream model at different wind speeds when the incoming wind speed was equal to 10 m s and 12 m s the non dimensional trajectories were close to an ellipse and the out of plane amplitude was much smaller than the in plane amplitude when the wind speed was above 12 m s the non dimensional trajectories were close to a vertical line which confirmed that the downstream model was dominated by the in plane vibration the maximum displacement amplitude is 2 2 d under the wind speeds of 25 m s these non dimensional trajectories are different from those observed by he et al 2018 in the experiments of he et al 2018 the two models were not parallel arranged and the trajectories of wivs were close to circles it indicates that the included angle between the two models have significant effect on the vibration characteristics of wivs the variation of trajectory when the wind speed increases from 12 m s to 14 m s is caused by re number effects 4 discussion the above experimental results showed that the in plane vibration dominated the wiv of the downstream model therefore only the in plane vibration of the downstream model is
