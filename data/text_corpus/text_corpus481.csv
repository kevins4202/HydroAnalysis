2405,vegetation restoration attributed to china s grain to green program gtgp exerts noticeable impact on the ecological hydrological nexus however the vegetation restoration status associated with gtgp has been insufficiently studied and its effect on water availability remains controversial this holistic study involved investigation of long time satellite observations outputs of a land surface model and future projections to quantify the historical and future variations of gross primary productivity gpp on the loess plateau china and the associated effect on terrestrial water storage change twsc the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd model was employed to characterize the nonlinearity of interannual variability satellite derived observations revealed a trend of increase of 8 162 tgc year in gpp during 2003 2016 with the largest proportion attributable to grassland owing to its extensive coverage increased gpp is related to twsc decline as evidenced by both gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite observations and simulations from the modified noah land surface model in descending order the magnitude of such negative impact varies with coverage of grassland cropland and trees ecological restoration is manifested as a critical anthropogenic stressor altering twsc which is further reinforced by prominent inverse correlation r 0 31 after removing climatic impacts the bias corrected coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 dataset illustrates that increased gpp and reduced tws are projected in the twenty first century when considering the climate change and human interventions considering that past ecological benefits associated with revegetation measures could represent short term gains and that tws decline is most likely to continue the government and local stakeholders should reconsider the current hydrological condition from the perspective of balanced socioeconomic benefit and terrestrial water storage cost keywords gross primary productivity terrestrial water storage changes eemd noah model loess plateau bias corrected cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the grain to green program gtgp undertaken since the 2000 s is an important ecological restoration project in china this program has supported ecological sustainability on the loess plateau china which is the world s largest region of loess paleosol deposits during 1999 2013 the vegetation fractional coverage of the loess plateau increased from 32 to approximately 60 zhou et al 2012 nevertheless potential conflict remains in terms of water demand between regional natural ecosystems and humans and this issue is largely related to gtgp zhang et al 2022b zhao et al 2021 assessing the ecological conditions and the accompanying water availability is therefore critical to promoting revegetation programs while balancing water demand and socioeconomic development gtgp has resulted in substantial changes in land cover use simultaneously bringing modifications in surface green coverage and vegetation productivity such as leaf area index lai net primary productivity and gross primary productivity gpp brandt et al 2018 li et al 2023 xiao 2014 the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics attributed to climate change and anthropogenic intervention have been revealed for example by the long term satellite observations and reanalysis model outputs he et al 2015 li and yang 2014 wang et al 2018a however the ecological and related hydrological time series are inherently nonlinear and complex and generally include terms of annual seasonal and random change cunjak et al 2013 lafleur et al 2005 methods that can account for nonlinearity and dynamic terms are therefore required to investigate the variability and trends of ecological and hydrological variables wine et al 2018 despite the wide range of available analytical approaches such as empirical orthogonal function eof analysis fang et al 2015 and wavelet analysis and fourier spectral analysis duran et al 2020 ferraro et al 2020 methods that focus on interannual variations which are of particular interest when exploring hydrological response to increasing change of the ecological condition have not been thoroughly utilized this is critical for the loess plateau region that occupies a large territory and exhibits complex zonation for which the differences in regional ecological and hydrological change need elaboration wang et al 2010 vegetation restoration activities such as gtgp potentially exert various influences on the regional hydrological cycle under the compounding effects of land cover change and climatic variability gao et al 2016 measures accompanying these activities such as local vegetation conversion regulate hydrological processes by altering the allocation of precipitation and irrigation into evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture surface storage and groundwater storage li et al 2020a li et al 2009 lv et al 2019 however the response of water availability to vegetation dynamics remains controversial with regard to the loess plateau some studies feng et al 2016a ge et al 2020 shi et al 2019 wu et al 2017 demonstrated that reduction of streamflow and runoff occurred in association with increasing vegetation coverage this means that revegetation might adversely impact regional water availability conversely other studies have shown that vegetation recovery does not induce substantial reduction in regional runoff feng et al 2012 wang et al 2017 especially zhang et al 2022a and zhou et al 2022 recently pointed out revegetation did not decrease water availability in the loess plateau north china plain and other regions these studies reported that vegetation recovery and increased precipitation could enhance both soil flow and base flow by compensating for decreased runoff and moisture recycling meanwhile hydrological feedbacks related to afforestation might change the surface albedo precipitation and surface moisture further influencing water availability feng et al 2017 additionally anthropogenic water use by the agricultural industrial domestic and livestock sectors has been climbing steadily owing to ongoing regional socioeconomic development zhou et al 2020 making the terrestrial water fluxes of the loess plateau even more complex previous related studies have tended to focus on the effects of revegetation on runoff and soil moisture which is information that is readily obtained from field observations or numerical models however quantification of the response of terrestrial water storage tws to vegetation change has rarely been addressed owing to the insufficient availability of data total tws comprises of various terms such as soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage and the latter variable is generally the most critical in delineating water availability the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite and grace follow on grace fo launched in 2002 and 2018 represents an efficient source of data for studying the terrestrial water cycle from river basin to continental scales landerer and swenson 2012 studies focused on grace retrievals not only describe the spatiotemporal patterns of tws derived variables but also provide quantitative analysis of tws lv et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a nevertheless a clear scan of tws dynamics from the perspectives of ecological hydrological regimes and anthropogenic interventions e g human water use is less explored this is mostly related to the lack of a suitable high spatial resolution dataset i e grace grace follow on merely provides data with spatial resolution of approximately 100 km for appropriate study and management of water resources tws data with fine spatiotemporal resolution are required such data can be obtained from simulations using land hydrological models that physically delineate hydrological processes by controlling meteorological and hydrographic variables lazin et al 2020 mehrnegar et al 2021 the ecological hydrological nexus is sensitive to climate change anthropogenic drivers and policy interventions in recent years several ecology and water conservancy actions have been implemented in northern china therefore comprehensive knowledge of the past and future ecological hydrological regime is required some previous studies lu et al 2021 sun et al 2021b have considered the historical variations and trends of the ecological hydrological status of the loess plateau furthermore quantification of future hydrological variability and its response to vegetation dynamics is a critical issue regarding regional water resource and climate management despite such importance future regional ecological hydrological regime under the sustained effects of climate change and anthropogenic interventions remains less studied relative to heat fluxes and carbon sequestrations feng et al 2016b li et al 2012 this holistic study used long term satellite observations land surface modeling and future projections to explore the past and future gpp dynamics under gtgp and the associated impacts on regional water availability across the loess plateau an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method that can account for nonlinearity was used to delineate interannual gpp and terrestrial water storage change twsc the primary research steps involved the following i investigation of past gpp dynamics during 2003 2016 ii quantification of the response of twsc to gpp dynamics and iii analysis of the projected dynamics and trends of gpp and tws by the end of twenty first century it is expected that current and future water management practices will be guided by the findings of this study 2 dataset and method 2 1 study region the loess plateau that is located in northwestern china fig 1 roughly covers the area of 640 000 squarekilometers this region is characterized by a semiarid and arid monsoon climate zone the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to 750 mm mostly occurring during june september 70 the loess plateau includes seven provinces i e qinghai gansu ningxia neimenggu shanxi shannxi and henan it is a critical region that has provided food production and energy sources for chinese national economic development loess plateau provides 40 of the water yield to the yellow river basin since the 2000 s the water yield in loess plateau has been reduced owing to the increased et fig s1 meanwhile the water use i e surface and groundwater withdrawn by agricultural industrial and domestic sectors is increasingly in demand with rapid socio economic development fig s2 the water resource shortages inevitably hinder regional ecological hydrological and socio economic sustainability 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 ecological dataset this study used the gpp to explore the effects of ecological restoration on tws compared with greenness indexes such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lai gpp is more conducive to capturing physiological activity in addition to describing canopy grown and therefore is suitable for studying the surface process changes responding to ecological restoration especially over arid and semi arid regions gebremichael and barros 2006 we collected moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis gpp products collection 6 during the period of 2003 2016 this satellite derived dataset has one high resolution of 500 m and is considered as one reliable observation here we used the average mean of mod17a2 and myd17a2 and found this gpp had the root mean square error rmse of 13 7 gc m2 8 day and mean absolute error mae of 11 2 gc m2 8 day when validating against by four flux tower observations collected from fluxnet2015 https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset all these selected flux towers are in or near the loess plateau enabling their participation in gpp evaluation is reasonable due to the same climatic and surface conditions this accuracy is in line with previous studies deng et al 2021 turner et al 2006 demonstrating the capacity of satellite based gpp in ecology applications in addition considering the uncertainties in existing gpp products the 500 m vpm xiao et al 2004 and pml zhang et al 2019b gpp dataset were collected to verify our results we collected the annual land cover map at 500 m resolution and the percent cover map of each land type at each pixel at 5 km resolution for the period 2003 2016 from mcd12q1 and mcd12c1 respectively the primary vegetation covers i e grassland forest i e trees and cropland were identified in land cover maps to quantify the patterns of gpp and twsc we also collected the monthly leaf area index lai from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr during 1981 2016 for analyzing the response of twsc to natural recovery 2 2 2 hydrologic dataset we obtained gridded monthly tws anomalies from the average of two grace mascon based products i e the center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl with the final spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 after the mascon solution was implemented on grace level 1 dataset since grace monthly dataset is nonconsecutive we interpolated the missing data using one linear interpolation solution based on the values of the previous and the following months the interpolation method is effective and extensively used in handling the missing values in the grace dataset ramillien et al 2006 wang et al 2020 the twsc is calculated with eq 1 1 t w s c t t w s a t 1 t w s a t 1 2 where t w s c t is the value at a specific month t and t w s a t 1 and t w s a t 1 is the tws anomaly of the next month and the prior month respectively to obtain a high resolution twsc based on the water balance method as illustrated in eq 2 we collected precipitation p air temperature and wind speed from the china meteorological administration the 500 m grid evapotranspiration et for the period of 2003 2016 is obtained averagely from two modis products mod16a2 and myd16a2 we also collected 0 25 global land evaporation and amsterdam model gleam et products for the long term twsc calculation the runoff r i e the sum of surface runoff and subsurface runoff is simulated with the noah land surface model that will be described in section 2 3 2 considering the uncertainty in modeled high spatial resolution runoff we collected gauged runoff https loess geodata cn to validate its accuracy eight hydrology control stations located in the yellow river channel including lanzhou xiaheyan shizuishan longmen hejin huaxian sanmenxia and huayuankou are selected in this study 2 t w s c p e t r 2 2 3 cmip6 projections dataset we collected cmip6 simulations from four models i e cesm2 cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 1 and ipsl cm6a lr table s1 the ensemble member of each model is r1i1p1f these models are selected because they provide the monthly gpp and tws we also collected precipitation and evapotranspiration in cmip6 for further analysis the historical 1850 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods are covered in these models here we only selected the historical period from 2003 to 2014 during which the satellite dataset i e grace is available we used ssp1 2 6 low forcing sustainability pathway ssp2 4 5 medium forcing sustainability pathway ssp3 7 0 medium to high end forcing sustainability pathway and ssp5 8 5 high end forcing sustainability pathway in cmip6 for future emission and land use scenarios which represent radiative forcings stabilized at 2 6 4 5 7 0 and 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 respectively 2 3 method this study used the eemd method to decompose the interannual satellite derived gpp and twsc data and the twsc simulated by the land surface model on this basis the variations and trends of twsc and gpp were investigated and the responses of twsc to gpp were quantified we also calculated the human driven twsc and explored its response to gpp finally we examined the future dynamics of gpp and tws on the basis of cmip6 simulations the framework of our work is presented in fig 2 2 3 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd considering time series gpp and twsc are generally nonlinear here we used the eemd model to capture their dynamic trend over the study region eemd is one adaptive time series analysis model that is extensively used in delineating nonstationary processes wang et al 2015 wei et al 2020 zhang and jia 2020 this method enhances the robustness of the decomposition performance by eliminating the chance of mode mixing specifically it decomposes the time series variable d t into several here denoted as n intrinsic mode functions imf i t depicting the frequency information and one trend term r t 3 d t i 1 n imf i t r t in practice an amount of gaussian white noise is added to the time series for obtaining the ensemble means for balancing the robustness of decomposition and the computation complexity we set the number of added gaussian white noise as 100 and set the corresponding amplitude of additional noises as the 20 of the standard deviations of the raw dataset hawinkel et al 2015 wei et al 2020 2 3 2 noah land surface model we used noah land surface model niu et al 2011 for calculating high spatial resolution runoff the noah simulation with high spatial resolution will be complemented with grace based twsc for eco hydrology analysis across northern china the noah model has been used in describing water and energy flux exchanges that are substantially controlled by eco hydrological processes liu et al 2020c zheng et al 2016 a set of models e g a physical parameterization of frozen soil a crank nicolson time stepping scheme and a finite difference spatial subdiffusion method is adopted in the noah model particularly the infiltration rate is calculated by subtracting the surface runoff from the fall rate for this model the runoff is calculated with one simple water balance calibration scheme which accounts for the variability in rainfall soil moisture and soil ice based on probability density functions more specifically surface and subsurface runoffare both parameterized as functions of water table depth which can be computed primarily based on the depth of the soil column niu et al 2005 a four level soil layer configuration with the depth of 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m total depth 2 m is adopted in the noah model the noah model was first implemented at 6 km 0 05 spatial resolution from 2003 to 2016 the meteorological forcing input was obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset this dataset is stored with a temporal resolution of 3 h and the spatial resolution of 0 1 it includes seven forcing parameters i e 2 m air temperature 10 m wind speed air pressure specific humidity accumulated precipitation and downward shortwave and longwave radiations more details about noah model implementation can be found in previous studies liu et al 2021c liu et al 2020a to simulate long term tws anomaly and further extract human driven twsc we also implement the noah model at the spatial resolution of 0 25 during 1981 2016 considering the default noah model has potentially underestimated the magnitude of peak flows for runoff zheng et al 2016 surface dynamic variability is used to replace the constant surface parameters which are traditionally nested in noah model the constant parameters including leaf area index and green vegetation fraction and surface albedo are updated with seasonally varying satellite observations i e modis and avhrr the land cover map is combined with the soil texture map available from the state soil geographic database food and agriculture organization to assign the vegetation and soil types 2 3 3 time series analysis in this study the sen s slope calculation and mann kendall test were employed to analyze time series trends both of these two methods have been extensively used in previous ecohydrological research li et al 2020b tabari et al 2011 wang et al 2019 we used sen s slope method to calculate the trend of the gpp and twsc series the underlying principle of sen s slope model is that the true slope i e trend can be estimated with a simple non parametric procedure in the condition that a linear trend occurs in the time series sen 1968 specifically the trend magnitude t i in the n pair samples is calculated following eq 4 4 t i d j d k j k f o r i 1 2 n a n d j k where d j and d k are the data values at time j and k respectively for our wo that only has one datum in each period time n n n 1 2 where n is the length of the time series after arranging thenvalues of t i from smallest to largest the final sen s slope t m e d i a n can be computed based on the medium value 5 t median t n 1 2 n i s o d d t n 2 t n 2 2 2 n i s e v e n a positive value of t median represent one increasing trend while a negative value of t median represent one decreasing trend the significance level of the estimated trend is calculated using the nonparametric mann kendall test which is a non parametric test not requiring the dataset with the normal distribution liu et al 2021c on a pixel basis the trends were further categorized into four types primarily based on their statistical significance levels and extreme points wei et al 2020 more specifically the trend can be assigned to monotonic increase class when it is statistically increasing while it is considered as monotonic decrease class when it is statistically decreasing the trend is assigned to the increase to decrease class provided that two conditions are satisfied i one maximum value occurs in the time series and ii at least one derivative is significant above all else the trend can be categorized as another class we investigated the response of twsc to gpp dynamics primarily through pearson correlation analysis investigation of the trends and correlations were conducted using the eemd interannual components rather than the raw dataset our analyses were performed based on both annual and seasonal scales three vegetation growth seasons were studied mam march april may jja june july august and son september october november we also analyzed the trend and variation of gpp and twsc regarding different vegetation types here the analysis conducted for tree grass and crop vegetation coverage focused on 6 km resolution noah simulations 2 3 4 human driven twsc calculation considering that twsc is impacted by both climatic and anthropogenic factors we investigated the influences of gtgp driven twsc on gpp for the period 2003 2016 the gtgp human driven twsc htwsc was calculated by subtracting the climate induced twsc ctwsc from the total grace twsc as follows 6 htwsc t w s c c t w s c referring to the studies of huang et al 2015 liu et al 2021a noah derived twsc can be used as climate induced twsc because it primarily considers climatic influences while ignoring the effects associated with human activities because the divergences between the outputs of the noah simulations and the actual twsc can result from human activities and hydrometeorological conditions other than gptp the noah simulations were calibrated to include these non gtgp human effects this calibration process was implemented for one stationary period e g 1981 2002 during which phased revegetation was minimal and grace derived twsc could be considered largely unimpacted by gtgp specifically the random forest regression machine learning method was first used to establish the correlation between the noah simulations and the corresponding grace based twsc during 1981 2002 wu et al 2020 zhu et al n d the established regression was then applied to the noah simulations during 2003 2016 and the calibrated value was considered the twsc unimpacted by gtgp but incorporating other human effects fig 3 a shows the flowchart of htwsc calculation since the grace only provides the dataset after 2003 the twsc during 1981 2002 was reconstructed following the studies of sun et al 2021a sun et al 2020 and jing et al 2020 we used three approaches i e multiple linear regression deep neural networks and random forest to delineate the correlation between tws anomaly and explanatory factors specifically the grace tws anomaly is used as a reference value while the precipitation temperature and noah derived tws anomaly are used as explanatory factors evaluation analysis demonstrates that the reconstructed tws anomaly is credible and descriptions of the used reconstruction method and accuracy evaluation are exhibited in text s1 and fig s3 the time series of twsc ctwsc and htwsc are illustrated in fig 3 b it can be seen that twsc was relatively stable on the loess plateau except in 1997 during the pre gtgp period nevertheless twsc decreased noticeably during 2003 2016 owing more to anthropogenic interventions than to climatic variations 2 3 5 bias corrected cmip6 simulations the multi model mean cmip6 simulations gpp twsc precipitation and et were used for projection analysis these ensemble mean values were calculated by weighting the four selected model members based on the rmse and independence scores of each cmip6 simulation relative to the observations following the studies of pokhrel et al 2021 sanderson et al 2017 the weights are computed as the normalization of rmse and independence scores i e the sum of weights is one because ecohydrological variability is generally subject to both natural and anthropic forcing cmip6 simulations might be inadequate for delineating its future dynamics and trends therefore we applied a projecting relationship using satellite or field observations to conduct bias corrections on the cmip6 simulations following the studies of huang et al 2016 specifically both the cmip6 simulations and the observed dataset were first decomposed into eigenvectors and principal components a relationship was then established between each principal component of the cmip6 simulations and the observed dataset this relationship revealed the potential physical mechanisms underlying each principal component although it might not indicate causality feddersen et al 1999 finally we applied the established correlations to the cmip6 simulated principal components in the future to predict the bias corrected values here the random forest regression was used to establish and apply the relationships mainly because of its merits in modeling complex relationships we also evaluated the projected simulations through comparison with satellite derived observations during 2015 2020 the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 88 and 0 83 for gpp and tws respectively indicating the applicability of the calibrated cmip6 simulations for further analysis 3 results 3 1 assessment of high resolution simulations we first evaluated the accuracy of noah modeled runoff that is critical for calculating high resolution twsc based on the water balance principle fig 4 a shows the hydrograph of noah modeled runoff versus the corresponding station observations the nse metric illustrates that noah simulations coincide with observed runoff which is further corroborated with the rmse and mae metrics our result is fairly in line with earlier studies that suggested noah simulation could be available for hydrology research across the loess plateau liu et al 2020c notice that the noah model produces an underestimate of total runoff despite capturing the rough curves this divergence between noah simulations and gauge observations has to do with the mismatches between model scale 6 km 6 km and station measurements which can be additionally attributed to the inherent inadequateability of current numerical simulations in delineating regional eco hydrological process cai et al 2014 overgaard et al 2006 the annual simulated runoff was further compared against the annual observed runoff at the gauge sites as illustrated in fig 4b quite consistent is found between simulations and observations indicated by rmse of 14 3 mm annual and mae of 8 1 mm annual this consistency is further observed in the accuracy of annual twsc fig 4c which is quite better when compared against the water balance based values on this level presented results imply that the twsc variable calculating based on noah simulation is worth further studies 3 2 pattern of gpp dynamics fig 5 illustrates the total gpp dynamics across the entire study area one positive trend is found in annual gpp i e 8 162 tgc year a consistent pattern of a trend of increasing is observed on the seasonal scale and this pattern is obvious in jja and son but relatively weak in mam we observe that approximately 65 of the increase in gpp occurs during jja in terms of vegetation type the largest trend of increase is evident for grassland which is related to the vast amount of grassland in the study region it can be seen that the trend of increase is more remarkable after 2010 especially annually and in jja this pattern is captured better by eemd decomposition in comparison with the raw dataset the larger gpp increment during 2010 2016 is probably associated with the higher lai and other climatic factors such as precipitation and temperature cao et al 2019 cao et al 2020 to corroborate the modis derived gpp we also checked the trends of gpp from the vpm and pml models consistency was found in the trend and accuracy of gpp derived from the three gpp sources fig s4 despite slight differences attributable to model uncertainty this agreement further indicates the feasibility and reasonableness of using the modis gpp product to explore vegetation productivity of the loess plateau the spatiotemporal variations of gpp were checked on a pixel basis and the eemd derived gpp trends were further classified based on the derivation information as illustrated in fig 6 fig s5 it can be seen that the study region is dominated by a trend of increase specifically a monotonic trend of increase is found over approximately 40 60 of the study region the trend of increase occurs mostly in central and southern parts of the region that are dominated by grassland this positive trend in gpp largely occurs during jja and son conversely a monotonic trend of decrease in gpp is concentrated in the area of croplands in the north of the region and sporadically observed in other areas the area with a negative trend accounts for approximately 9 of the entire study region cropland accounts for the greatest proportion of the area with a monotonic trends of decrease which implies that agricultural management relating to water abstraction potentially induces negative impact on gpp wang et al 2021 further corroborated results were found for the case in which a fraction of the region experiences gpp increase which is then converted to a trend of decrease earlier studies attributed this increase to decrease trend to regional water deficit cao et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a 3 3 response of twsc to gpp fig 7 illustrates the average twsc series across the study area a downward trend of 0 92 mm year exists for grace based twsc this trend of decrease is further supported by the results from the high resolution noah simulations which exhibit a trend of 0 54 mm year the lower trend in noah simulated twsc probably relates to the inadequate capacity of land surface models for describing water storage components such as surface water and groundwater sun et al 2019 the interannual variations in twsc contrast those in gpp implying a counteractive role between vegetation productivity and water availability in particular a trend of decrease in twsc of 0 84 and 0 86 mm year is evident in mam and jja respectively a greater decrease in twsc is evident for grassland whereas the lowest decrease in twsc is related to trees which reflects water use efficiency zhao et al 2009 detailed patterns in twsc dynamics are further reflected in the spatial distributions of twsc fig s6 and fig s7 which show that a negative trend dominates the study region across the loess plateau more than 70 of the area experiences a trend of decrease in twsc the response of twsc to gpp dynamics was investigated using two twsc datasets as illustrated in fig 8 annual gpp substantially correlates with grace based twsc in the study region with a correlation coefficient of 0 32 p value 0 05 furthermore similar correlation is also evident for the noah simulations with a correlation coefficient of 0 44 p value 0 05 the divergence in the correlations between the grace observations and the noah simulations can be attributed to disparity in spatial resolution in addition to the model uncertainty of the noah simulations and the data uncertainty of the grace product higher correlations are found in jja and son owing to the greater demand for water during the season of vegetation growth no obvious correlation is observed in mam except for grassland specifically grassland has the strongest correlation between gpp and twsc followed by cropland and trees the results indicate that gpp dynamics might exhibit adverse influences on twsc variation over the loess plateau we further analyzed the response of twsc to gpp by checking the twsc trends that accompany the monotonic change in gpp a trend of decrease in twsc is found in association with regions that exhibit either monotonic increase or decrease in gpp as illustrated in fig 9 a considering vegetation productivity could be modified by the constraints of water and energy components as well as atmospheric co2 and soil nitrogen fertilization we used the monotonic decreasing gpp as one reference condition enabling our analysis to be more focused on tws dynamics a larger twsc decline occurs in association with increasing gpp i e approximately 30 higher than that in areas with decreasing gpp this implies that greater water depletion could result from the revegetation process the divergent trend in twsc between the two monotonic phases holds for all three vegetation types but it is more evident for grassland this is in accord with previous studies chen et al 2008 guo et al 2017 that suggested that grassland requires more water resources in semi arid and arid regions we also checked the twsc trend before and after the change point of the increase to decrease gpp region fig 9b this is critical because a considerable fraction of the region of the loess plateau first exhibits a trend of increase in gpp which and then converts to a trend of decrease results demonstrate that decreasing twsc occurs throughout the entire period but that this trend obviously weakens or even declines in the phase of gpp decrease it indicates that less water depletion occurs when the gpp process declines i e increasing gpp resulting from vegetation recovery demands an amount of water consumption that would bring further gpp decrease that needs less water availability the presented cases described for the annual scale fig s8 provide temporal evidence of the divergence in twsc trends among gpp phases we observe that the twsc in the period of the decreasing trend of gpp accounts for only approximately 63 of that in the period of the increasing trend of gpp 3 4 gpp twsc correlation at catchment scale across the loess plateau region approximately 80 of catchments experienced gpp increase during 2003 2016 i e in the time of gtpt and most experienced overall decrease in twsc fig s5 s7 this finding allowed us to further examine the gpp twsc correlations averaged across the catchments here we focus on those catchments that experienced gpp increase as illustrated in fig 10 the increasing gpp is negatively correlated with the grace based twsc trend a similar pattern is found for the noah simulations but with smaller correlation coefficients in comparison with those of the grace observation higher correlations are found in jja probably because of plant water use and climatic water availability in a changed climate brouder and volenec 2008 the influence of increasing gpp on twsc variables appears to be relatively small probably owing to interventions of other factors such as soil water holding capacity and vegetation water efficiency feng et al 2016b we observe obvious correlations for all types of vegetation cover with the correlation coefficients of 0 14 0 534 and 0 316 for tree grass and crop vegetation respectively this implies that revegetation has adverse impact on regional water availability despite the decrease in twsc in a substantial portion of the catchments some catchments show a trend of increase in twsc this might be connected to additional water supplies provided by artificial irrigation systems the derived negative influence is reasonably in accord with that at the pixel based scale fig 8 additionally the divergent correlations among the seasonal bases are relatively small at the catchment scale this finding is related to the connectivity of groundwater storage systems and additional human intervention such as artificial drainage ma et al 2020 3 5 response of htwsc to gpp despite variations in the available datasets and analytical approaches used previous studies lin et al 2019 xie et al 2019 attributed the decline in tws on the loess plateau primarily to anthropogenic interventions we further investigated the response of gtgp driven twsc to gpp dynamics fig 11 a shows that htwsc accounts for a considerable fraction 70 of the total twsc implying a substantial effect of gtgp in terms of water resource consumption i e gtgp driven ecological restoration is one critical anthropogenic contributor to twsc this is plausible because twsc is strongly correlated with surface water abstraction and groundwater pumping lv et al 2021 nair and indu 2021 the anthropogenic contributions presented in this study are in accord with the increasing usage of water by humans fig s2 the spatial pattern of twsc related to gtgp fig 11b broadly matches that of the grace based twsc for most regions gtgp results in decreasing twsc however a positive trend of twsc exists in some cropland regions mostly relating to irrigation flow exceeding groundwater abstraction lv et al 2019 it should be noted that a ratio of htwsc to total twsc exceeding one occurs on a small fraction of the study region which is mainly related to irrigation water sources for regions in which irrigation water use stems from surface water irrigation return flows could exceed groundwater withdrawals thereby increasing regional tws through groundwater gains huang et al 2015 as shown in fig 11c htwsc is correlated negatively with gpp dynamics at the pixel scale and a higher correlation is found in jja and son these correlations regarding htwsc appear to be lower in comparison with those regarding twsc fig 8 owing to the exclusion of climatic contributions which could account for approximately 30 of the entire twsc for certain specific regions the negative influence on twsc from vegetation recovery is further illustrated by the negative correlation between htwsc and gpp at the catchment scale fig 11c the higher correlation coefficients presented in jja and son across the catchment scale indicate that gtgp plays a vital role in twsc as might be expected at the catchment scale the correlations based on htwsc are slightly lower in comparison with those based on total twsc fig 10 this might be connected to the contractions of human activities and connectivity of water storage on tws in addition to the effects of climate 3 6 future projection of gpp and twsc using the bias corrected cmip6 simulations we further investigated the dynamics and trends of gpp and tws in the twenty first century which could support sustainable management of the ecohydrological status under the impact of climate change and human interventions fig 12 shows time series of annual gpp and twsc during both the historical period 2003 2014 and the future period 2015 2100 it can be seen that gpp increases continuously especially during the second half of the twenty first century 2050 with a trend of 0 025 0 125 gc m2 year this pattern of increase can be attributed to increase in precipitation carbon dioxide and human activities li et al 2021 conversely a trend of decrease is projected to occur in twsc on the loess plateau during 2015 2100 with the maximum trend of 0 066 mm year noticeable greening is projected to amplify terrestrial water shortage depletion mostly because the water supply will be exceeded by total water consumption specifically despite increase in projected precipitation water yield will decline owing to increased et fig s9 the resulting trends in gpp and twsc under four ssp scenarios are fairly consistent indicating high confidence in the bias corrected cmip6 projections this confidence is also verified by the agreement between the simulated and observed gpp and twsc for the historical period 2003 2014 overall our work describes the future hydrological regime expected under ecological restoration on the loess plateau and indicates that gpp increase is likely to result in tws decline in the future 4 discussions 4 1 eemd noticeable interannual variations occur in gpp and twsc and their identification is crucial for quantification of the long term effects of vegetation restoration on water availability hawinkel et al 2015 accordingly the eemd method which can account for nonlinearity was used in this study to characterize the interannual variations in gpp and twsc it was found that the eemd based dataset is more suitable for detecting and even reversing the trend changes in comparison with raw data and those processed using simple linear analysis chen et al 2017 specifically a considerable fraction of gpp originally exhibited as an increase decrease is described as a decrease increase over the period when using the eemd method to decompose the observations this cannot be captured by linear trends especially during the period after 2010 in which lai and gpp became larger results conducted using eemd were further compared with those obtained using the raw dataset and a sliding mean dataset the trends obtained from the raw dataset and the sliding mean dataset table s2 illustrate a trend of increase in gpp and a trend of decrease in twsc during 2003 2016 consistent with the results derived from the eemd based dataset nevertheless noticeable disparities were found among these changes on this level our study extends earlier work that demonstrated that eemd decomposed series could potentially facilitate understanding of ecological hydrological patterns liu et al 2021b rezaie balf et al 2019 4 2 gpp trend and its effects on twsc revegetation increased gpp at a rate of 8 162 tgc year during 2003 2016 this pattern of increase obtained from the modis product is consistent with the gpp results derived using the vpm and pml models fig s4 in particular grassland has the highest gpp change although a considerable fraction has been converted to forest and farmland table s3 despite the influences of changing precipitation patterns and the increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit on vegetation restoration liu et al 2020b piao et al 2006 we consider that increasing gpp is primarily associated with land cover change to verify this the time series of satellite lai during 1982 2016 was analyzed and one positive trend in annual lai was found during this period fig s10 this increasing trend is more intensive during the post gtgp period owing to human intervention we further checked the gpp variations of those regions that experienced a trend of increase in lai and those that had no trend of increase in lai it was found that the trend of increase in gpp in regions without vegetation recovery was less significant in comparison with that in regions that experienced vegetation recovery a study regarding the 6 km spatial resolution noah simulation illustrates that the response of twsc to gpp varies among vegetation types this divergence in twsc response is evident at both pixel and catchment scales and it is related to the species specific water use efficiency of vegetation types zhang et al 2016a zheng et al 2019 particularly the twsc of the three vegetation types considered in this study decreased most noticeably for grassland which indicates that grassland tends to be influenced more by water deficit in comparison with trees generally grassland on the loess plateau has less capacity for absorbing dense root network moisture which means that it is more sensitive to variations in available water zhang et al 2016b accordingly greater attention should be focused on grassland especially considering its vast coverage in the study region as well as its ecology and water response in association with gtgp despite the overall increase in gpp a considerable fraction of the loess plateau shows a trend of decrease 24 and even a trend of increase to decrease 4 during 2003 2016 revegetation has the capacity to conserve soil and water in the short term i e before 2006 also see fig s8 nevertheless vegetation growth is inhibited to some extent when the available water resources become limited by the amount of vegetation restoration wang et al 2018b this case is obvious for grassland and cropland i e gpp cannot always exhibit monotonic increase owing to the complex responses to water stress our work corroborates the findings of several previous studies liu et al 2015 lu and zhuang 2010 zhang et al 2016a which reported a single nonlinear pattern of water use efficiency when responding to water stress we also notice that gpp decline in certain areas represents a slightly favorable impact on grassland and cropland when water stress is alleviated on this level our study provides a reference for ecological construction especially in relation to coping with desertification of oasis the correlations between twsc and gpp appear to be relatively low which implies an unrecognized connection between ecological restoration and water availability especially considering the divergent trend of twsc among vegetation types and on the seasonal scale we attribute these small correlations to the following two aspects first tws mainly includes components of soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage and the final term is considered the primary water resource for vegetation growth in arid and semi arid regions han et al 2020 accordingly groundwater storage can be related more closely to vegetation productivity which is higher by 26 than the correlation with twsc text s2 and fig s11 second the response of tws to vegetation productivity is impacted by a variety of factors that involve the climatic variations i e precipitation and arid index and human activities both of which could make the response more complex feng et al 2016b poulter et al 2009 4 3 noah simulation given that tws is a critical component not readily retrieved from satellite observations at fine spatial scale noah simulations modified with continuous satellite forcing were further employed to analyze the effects of ecological restoration on water availability some studies liu et al 2020c syed et al 2008 demonstrated that a tws anomaly simulated by a land surface model could be consistent with a grace based tws anomaly at global and regional scales wefound that noah derived twsc broadly coincides with the grace product for the loess plateau fig 7 and fig 8 despite differences in their magnitude specifically the pearson correlation and nash coefficient between grace based and noah based twsc is 0 91 0 17 and 0 73 0 28 at the annual scale respectively fig s12 both datasets well illustrate that twsc decline substantially accompanies gpp increase however clear spatial patterns of twsc can be depicted when using high resolution data and the detailed twsc response regarding different vegetation cover can be captured by noah simulations this is particularly critical for the loess plateau region that has an intense mixture of grassland and trees given the topographical complexity of the loess plateau region concerns regarding mismatches between noah simulations and land cover data cannot be neglected although this is beyond the scope of our study because our focus was the qualitative hydrological response of vegetation types we evaluated the associated uncertainty by checking those pixels for which a single land cover type occupied more than 80 consistent patterns in the correlations and trends fig s13 were found between those based on the 6 km land cover classification and those based on pure pixels i e the larger trends of decrease in twsc and the higher correlations between twsc and gpp were found in relation to grassland this implies that the derived pattern at 6 km spatial resolution is credible despite the biases in magnitude this is considered plausible because the region specific hydrological response can be captured at the interannual level by land surface models meanwhile to examine the applicability of the 6 km noah simulation to analysis of eco hydrological response we ran the noah model to simulate runoff at 2 and 1 km spatial resolution for the period 2003 2016 text s3 differences among the results at the three scales fig s14 imply sensitivity to the spatial resolution of the land surface model however one consistent pattern observed that is thought sensible indicates contraction of the connectivity between terrestrial and fluvial systemsvia eco hydrological interactions liu et al 2022 4 4 implications and further consideration climate change and human interventions have impact on regional ecological hydrological interactions bias corrected cmip6 simulations demonstrate that gpp increase is most likely at the expense of tws decline by the end of the 2100 s despite a trend of increase in projected precipitation tws might continue to diminish on the loess plateau region because water abstraction could exceed precipitation past and future eco hydrological regimes indicate that the ecological benefits of revegetation measures could represent only short term gains and that effective conservation and restoration measures should be evaluated critically in particular given that decline in tws is very likely to be ongoing in the future the government and local stakeholders should change the current hydrological condition by balancing the socioeconomic benefits and the twsc costs and some specific technical measures are encouraged to regulate water resource consumption i e improving vegetation water use efficiency and growing areas of dense vegetation with consideration of the implications derived from this work several caveats should be noted first only one vegetation productivity index was checked in this study additional satellite derived observations such as solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence and vegetation optical depth could be used to elaborate the characterization of vegetation in future work second this study investigated the hydrological response to vegetation dynamics from a general perspective more in depth studies of such interactions are needed additionally critical analysis leveraging the coupled ecological hydrological model is encouraged to accurately disentangle the effects from anthropogenic interventions 5 conclusions understanding the status of ecological restoration is vital for ecological and hydrological sustainability thus holistic analysis that involves long term satellite observations noah land surface hydrological modeling and cmip6 projections was performed in this study to investigate the historical and future hydrologic regime associated with ecological restoration on the loess plateau in china we used one satellite gpp product to quantify gtgp driven ecological restoration on the loess plateau and two twsc datasets were employed to analyze the effects of ecological restoration on water availability the eemd method which can account for nonlinearity was leveraged to characterize the interannual series of gpp and twsc this study also used the noah model modified with continuous satellite observations to retrieve 6 km twsc we found that gpp increased obviously during 2003 2016 in association with gtgp despite decrease in its overall area grassland showed the largest increase in gpp in the study region because of its vast areal coverage increase in gpp results in substantial decline of twsc however this pattern diverges among the various types of vegetation cover negative correlation between gpp and twsc holds true at both pixel and catchment scales on this level ecological restoration is one major anthropogenic contributor to tws which can be corroborated by a prominent inverse correlation between gpp and human driven twsc with climatic impacts removed on the basis of cmip6 simulations we found that gpp is projected to increase in the twenty first century and that this is likely to result in substantial decline in twsc overall the findings of this study indicate that past and future vegetation greening is at the expense of water availability and provide insight regarding synthesis of ecological restoration planning and water resource

2405,vegetation restoration attributed to china s grain to green program gtgp exerts noticeable impact on the ecological hydrological nexus however the vegetation restoration status associated with gtgp has been insufficiently studied and its effect on water availability remains controversial this holistic study involved investigation of long time satellite observations outputs of a land surface model and future projections to quantify the historical and future variations of gross primary productivity gpp on the loess plateau china and the associated effect on terrestrial water storage change twsc the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd model was employed to characterize the nonlinearity of interannual variability satellite derived observations revealed a trend of increase of 8 162 tgc year in gpp during 2003 2016 with the largest proportion attributable to grassland owing to its extensive coverage increased gpp is related to twsc decline as evidenced by both gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite observations and simulations from the modified noah land surface model in descending order the magnitude of such negative impact varies with coverage of grassland cropland and trees ecological restoration is manifested as a critical anthropogenic stressor altering twsc which is further reinforced by prominent inverse correlation r 0 31 after removing climatic impacts the bias corrected coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 dataset illustrates that increased gpp and reduced tws are projected in the twenty first century when considering the climate change and human interventions considering that past ecological benefits associated with revegetation measures could represent short term gains and that tws decline is most likely to continue the government and local stakeholders should reconsider the current hydrological condition from the perspective of balanced socioeconomic benefit and terrestrial water storage cost keywords gross primary productivity terrestrial water storage changes eemd noah model loess plateau bias corrected cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the grain to green program gtgp undertaken since the 2000 s is an important ecological restoration project in china this program has supported ecological sustainability on the loess plateau china which is the world s largest region of loess paleosol deposits during 1999 2013 the vegetation fractional coverage of the loess plateau increased from 32 to approximately 60 zhou et al 2012 nevertheless potential conflict remains in terms of water demand between regional natural ecosystems and humans and this issue is largely related to gtgp zhang et al 2022b zhao et al 2021 assessing the ecological conditions and the accompanying water availability is therefore critical to promoting revegetation programs while balancing water demand and socioeconomic development gtgp has resulted in substantial changes in land cover use simultaneously bringing modifications in surface green coverage and vegetation productivity such as leaf area index lai net primary productivity and gross primary productivity gpp brandt et al 2018 li et al 2023 xiao 2014 the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics attributed to climate change and anthropogenic intervention have been revealed for example by the long term satellite observations and reanalysis model outputs he et al 2015 li and yang 2014 wang et al 2018a however the ecological and related hydrological time series are inherently nonlinear and complex and generally include terms of annual seasonal and random change cunjak et al 2013 lafleur et al 2005 methods that can account for nonlinearity and dynamic terms are therefore required to investigate the variability and trends of ecological and hydrological variables wine et al 2018 despite the wide range of available analytical approaches such as empirical orthogonal function eof analysis fang et al 2015 and wavelet analysis and fourier spectral analysis duran et al 2020 ferraro et al 2020 methods that focus on interannual variations which are of particular interest when exploring hydrological response to increasing change of the ecological condition have not been thoroughly utilized this is critical for the loess plateau region that occupies a large territory and exhibits complex zonation for which the differences in regional ecological and hydrological change need elaboration wang et al 2010 vegetation restoration activities such as gtgp potentially exert various influences on the regional hydrological cycle under the compounding effects of land cover change and climatic variability gao et al 2016 measures accompanying these activities such as local vegetation conversion regulate hydrological processes by altering the allocation of precipitation and irrigation into evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture surface storage and groundwater storage li et al 2020a li et al 2009 lv et al 2019 however the response of water availability to vegetation dynamics remains controversial with regard to the loess plateau some studies feng et al 2016a ge et al 2020 shi et al 2019 wu et al 2017 demonstrated that reduction of streamflow and runoff occurred in association with increasing vegetation coverage this means that revegetation might adversely impact regional water availability conversely other studies have shown that vegetation recovery does not induce substantial reduction in regional runoff feng et al 2012 wang et al 2017 especially zhang et al 2022a and zhou et al 2022 recently pointed out revegetation did not decrease water availability in the loess plateau north china plain and other regions these studies reported that vegetation recovery and increased precipitation could enhance both soil flow and base flow by compensating for decreased runoff and moisture recycling meanwhile hydrological feedbacks related to afforestation might change the surface albedo precipitation and surface moisture further influencing water availability feng et al 2017 additionally anthropogenic water use by the agricultural industrial domestic and livestock sectors has been climbing steadily owing to ongoing regional socioeconomic development zhou et al 2020 making the terrestrial water fluxes of the loess plateau even more complex previous related studies have tended to focus on the effects of revegetation on runoff and soil moisture which is information that is readily obtained from field observations or numerical models however quantification of the response of terrestrial water storage tws to vegetation change has rarely been addressed owing to the insufficient availability of data total tws comprises of various terms such as soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage and the latter variable is generally the most critical in delineating water availability the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite and grace follow on grace fo launched in 2002 and 2018 represents an efficient source of data for studying the terrestrial water cycle from river basin to continental scales landerer and swenson 2012 studies focused on grace retrievals not only describe the spatiotemporal patterns of tws derived variables but also provide quantitative analysis of tws lv et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a nevertheless a clear scan of tws dynamics from the perspectives of ecological hydrological regimes and anthropogenic interventions e g human water use is less explored this is mostly related to the lack of a suitable high spatial resolution dataset i e grace grace follow on merely provides data with spatial resolution of approximately 100 km for appropriate study and management of water resources tws data with fine spatiotemporal resolution are required such data can be obtained from simulations using land hydrological models that physically delineate hydrological processes by controlling meteorological and hydrographic variables lazin et al 2020 mehrnegar et al 2021 the ecological hydrological nexus is sensitive to climate change anthropogenic drivers and policy interventions in recent years several ecology and water conservancy actions have been implemented in northern china therefore comprehensive knowledge of the past and future ecological hydrological regime is required some previous studies lu et al 2021 sun et al 2021b have considered the historical variations and trends of the ecological hydrological status of the loess plateau furthermore quantification of future hydrological variability and its response to vegetation dynamics is a critical issue regarding regional water resource and climate management despite such importance future regional ecological hydrological regime under the sustained effects of climate change and anthropogenic interventions remains less studied relative to heat fluxes and carbon sequestrations feng et al 2016b li et al 2012 this holistic study used long term satellite observations land surface modeling and future projections to explore the past and future gpp dynamics under gtgp and the associated impacts on regional water availability across the loess plateau an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method that can account for nonlinearity was used to delineate interannual gpp and terrestrial water storage change twsc the primary research steps involved the following i investigation of past gpp dynamics during 2003 2016 ii quantification of the response of twsc to gpp dynamics and iii analysis of the projected dynamics and trends of gpp and tws by the end of twenty first century it is expected that current and future water management practices will be guided by the findings of this study 2 dataset and method 2 1 study region the loess plateau that is located in northwestern china fig 1 roughly covers the area of 640 000 squarekilometers this region is characterized by a semiarid and arid monsoon climate zone the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to 750 mm mostly occurring during june september 70 the loess plateau includes seven provinces i e qinghai gansu ningxia neimenggu shanxi shannxi and henan it is a critical region that has provided food production and energy sources for chinese national economic development loess plateau provides 40 of the water yield to the yellow river basin since the 2000 s the water yield in loess plateau has been reduced owing to the increased et fig s1 meanwhile the water use i e surface and groundwater withdrawn by agricultural industrial and domestic sectors is increasingly in demand with rapid socio economic development fig s2 the water resource shortages inevitably hinder regional ecological hydrological and socio economic sustainability 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 ecological dataset this study used the gpp to explore the effects of ecological restoration on tws compared with greenness indexes such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lai gpp is more conducive to capturing physiological activity in addition to describing canopy grown and therefore is suitable for studying the surface process changes responding to ecological restoration especially over arid and semi arid regions gebremichael and barros 2006 we collected moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis gpp products collection 6 during the period of 2003 2016 this satellite derived dataset has one high resolution of 500 m and is considered as one reliable observation here we used the average mean of mod17a2 and myd17a2 and found this gpp had the root mean square error rmse of 13 7 gc m2 8 day and mean absolute error mae of 11 2 gc m2 8 day when validating against by four flux tower observations collected from fluxnet2015 https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset all these selected flux towers are in or near the loess plateau enabling their participation in gpp evaluation is reasonable due to the same climatic and surface conditions this accuracy is in line with previous studies deng et al 2021 turner et al 2006 demonstrating the capacity of satellite based gpp in ecology applications in addition considering the uncertainties in existing gpp products the 500 m vpm xiao et al 2004 and pml zhang et al 2019b gpp dataset were collected to verify our results we collected the annual land cover map at 500 m resolution and the percent cover map of each land type at each pixel at 5 km resolution for the period 2003 2016 from mcd12q1 and mcd12c1 respectively the primary vegetation covers i e grassland forest i e trees and cropland were identified in land cover maps to quantify the patterns of gpp and twsc we also collected the monthly leaf area index lai from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr during 1981 2016 for analyzing the response of twsc to natural recovery 2 2 2 hydrologic dataset we obtained gridded monthly tws anomalies from the average of two grace mascon based products i e the center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl with the final spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 after the mascon solution was implemented on grace level 1 dataset since grace monthly dataset is nonconsecutive we interpolated the missing data using one linear interpolation solution based on the values of the previous and the following months the interpolation method is effective and extensively used in handling the missing values in the grace dataset ramillien et al 2006 wang et al 2020 the twsc is calculated with eq 1 1 t w s c t t w s a t 1 t w s a t 1 2 where t w s c t is the value at a specific month t and t w s a t 1 and t w s a t 1 is the tws anomaly of the next month and the prior month respectively to obtain a high resolution twsc based on the water balance method as illustrated in eq 2 we collected precipitation p air temperature and wind speed from the china meteorological administration the 500 m grid evapotranspiration et for the period of 2003 2016 is obtained averagely from two modis products mod16a2 and myd16a2 we also collected 0 25 global land evaporation and amsterdam model gleam et products for the long term twsc calculation the runoff r i e the sum of surface runoff and subsurface runoff is simulated with the noah land surface model that will be described in section 2 3 2 considering the uncertainty in modeled high spatial resolution runoff we collected gauged runoff https loess geodata cn to validate its accuracy eight hydrology control stations located in the yellow river channel including lanzhou xiaheyan shizuishan longmen hejin huaxian sanmenxia and huayuankou are selected in this study 2 t w s c p e t r 2 2 3 cmip6 projections dataset we collected cmip6 simulations from four models i e cesm2 cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 1 and ipsl cm6a lr table s1 the ensemble member of each model is r1i1p1f these models are selected because they provide the monthly gpp and tws we also collected precipitation and evapotranspiration in cmip6 for further analysis the historical 1850 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods are covered in these models here we only selected the historical period from 2003 to 2014 during which the satellite dataset i e grace is available we used ssp1 2 6 low forcing sustainability pathway ssp2 4 5 medium forcing sustainability pathway ssp3 7 0 medium to high end forcing sustainability pathway and ssp5 8 5 high end forcing sustainability pathway in cmip6 for future emission and land use scenarios which represent radiative forcings stabilized at 2 6 4 5 7 0 and 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 respectively 2 3 method this study used the eemd method to decompose the interannual satellite derived gpp and twsc data and the twsc simulated by the land surface model on this basis the variations and trends of twsc and gpp were investigated and the responses of twsc to gpp were quantified we also calculated the human driven twsc and explored its response to gpp finally we examined the future dynamics of gpp and tws on the basis of cmip6 simulations the framework of our work is presented in fig 2 2 3 1 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd considering time series gpp and twsc are generally nonlinear here we used the eemd model to capture their dynamic trend over the study region eemd is one adaptive time series analysis model that is extensively used in delineating nonstationary processes wang et al 2015 wei et al 2020 zhang and jia 2020 this method enhances the robustness of the decomposition performance by eliminating the chance of mode mixing specifically it decomposes the time series variable d t into several here denoted as n intrinsic mode functions imf i t depicting the frequency information and one trend term r t 3 d t i 1 n imf i t r t in practice an amount of gaussian white noise is added to the time series for obtaining the ensemble means for balancing the robustness of decomposition and the computation complexity we set the number of added gaussian white noise as 100 and set the corresponding amplitude of additional noises as the 20 of the standard deviations of the raw dataset hawinkel et al 2015 wei et al 2020 2 3 2 noah land surface model we used noah land surface model niu et al 2011 for calculating high spatial resolution runoff the noah simulation with high spatial resolution will be complemented with grace based twsc for eco hydrology analysis across northern china the noah model has been used in describing water and energy flux exchanges that are substantially controlled by eco hydrological processes liu et al 2020c zheng et al 2016 a set of models e g a physical parameterization of frozen soil a crank nicolson time stepping scheme and a finite difference spatial subdiffusion method is adopted in the noah model particularly the infiltration rate is calculated by subtracting the surface runoff from the fall rate for this model the runoff is calculated with one simple water balance calibration scheme which accounts for the variability in rainfall soil moisture and soil ice based on probability density functions more specifically surface and subsurface runoffare both parameterized as functions of water table depth which can be computed primarily based on the depth of the soil column niu et al 2005 a four level soil layer configuration with the depth of 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m total depth 2 m is adopted in the noah model the noah model was first implemented at 6 km 0 05 spatial resolution from 2003 to 2016 the meteorological forcing input was obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset this dataset is stored with a temporal resolution of 3 h and the spatial resolution of 0 1 it includes seven forcing parameters i e 2 m air temperature 10 m wind speed air pressure specific humidity accumulated precipitation and downward shortwave and longwave radiations more details about noah model implementation can be found in previous studies liu et al 2021c liu et al 2020a to simulate long term tws anomaly and further extract human driven twsc we also implement the noah model at the spatial resolution of 0 25 during 1981 2016 considering the default noah model has potentially underestimated the magnitude of peak flows for runoff zheng et al 2016 surface dynamic variability is used to replace the constant surface parameters which are traditionally nested in noah model the constant parameters including leaf area index and green vegetation fraction and surface albedo are updated with seasonally varying satellite observations i e modis and avhrr the land cover map is combined with the soil texture map available from the state soil geographic database food and agriculture organization to assign the vegetation and soil types 2 3 3 time series analysis in this study the sen s slope calculation and mann kendall test were employed to analyze time series trends both of these two methods have been extensively used in previous ecohydrological research li et al 2020b tabari et al 2011 wang et al 2019 we used sen s slope method to calculate the trend of the gpp and twsc series the underlying principle of sen s slope model is that the true slope i e trend can be estimated with a simple non parametric procedure in the condition that a linear trend occurs in the time series sen 1968 specifically the trend magnitude t i in the n pair samples is calculated following eq 4 4 t i d j d k j k f o r i 1 2 n a n d j k where d j and d k are the data values at time j and k respectively for our wo that only has one datum in each period time n n n 1 2 where n is the length of the time series after arranging thenvalues of t i from smallest to largest the final sen s slope t m e d i a n can be computed based on the medium value 5 t median t n 1 2 n i s o d d t n 2 t n 2 2 2 n i s e v e n a positive value of t median represent one increasing trend while a negative value of t median represent one decreasing trend the significance level of the estimated trend is calculated using the nonparametric mann kendall test which is a non parametric test not requiring the dataset with the normal distribution liu et al 2021c on a pixel basis the trends were further categorized into four types primarily based on their statistical significance levels and extreme points wei et al 2020 more specifically the trend can be assigned to monotonic increase class when it is statistically increasing while it is considered as monotonic decrease class when it is statistically decreasing the trend is assigned to the increase to decrease class provided that two conditions are satisfied i one maximum value occurs in the time series and ii at least one derivative is significant above all else the trend can be categorized as another class we investigated the response of twsc to gpp dynamics primarily through pearson correlation analysis investigation of the trends and correlations were conducted using the eemd interannual components rather than the raw dataset our analyses were performed based on both annual and seasonal scales three vegetation growth seasons were studied mam march april may jja june july august and son september october november we also analyzed the trend and variation of gpp and twsc regarding different vegetation types here the analysis conducted for tree grass and crop vegetation coverage focused on 6 km resolution noah simulations 2 3 4 human driven twsc calculation considering that twsc is impacted by both climatic and anthropogenic factors we investigated the influences of gtgp driven twsc on gpp for the period 2003 2016 the gtgp human driven twsc htwsc was calculated by subtracting the climate induced twsc ctwsc from the total grace twsc as follows 6 htwsc t w s c c t w s c referring to the studies of huang et al 2015 liu et al 2021a noah derived twsc can be used as climate induced twsc because it primarily considers climatic influences while ignoring the effects associated with human activities because the divergences between the outputs of the noah simulations and the actual twsc can result from human activities and hydrometeorological conditions other than gptp the noah simulations were calibrated to include these non gtgp human effects this calibration process was implemented for one stationary period e g 1981 2002 during which phased revegetation was minimal and grace derived twsc could be considered largely unimpacted by gtgp specifically the random forest regression machine learning method was first used to establish the correlation between the noah simulations and the corresponding grace based twsc during 1981 2002 wu et al 2020 zhu et al n d the established regression was then applied to the noah simulations during 2003 2016 and the calibrated value was considered the twsc unimpacted by gtgp but incorporating other human effects fig 3 a shows the flowchart of htwsc calculation since the grace only provides the dataset after 2003 the twsc during 1981 2002 was reconstructed following the studies of sun et al 2021a sun et al 2020 and jing et al 2020 we used three approaches i e multiple linear regression deep neural networks and random forest to delineate the correlation between tws anomaly and explanatory factors specifically the grace tws anomaly is used as a reference value while the precipitation temperature and noah derived tws anomaly are used as explanatory factors evaluation analysis demonstrates that the reconstructed tws anomaly is credible and descriptions of the used reconstruction method and accuracy evaluation are exhibited in text s1 and fig s3 the time series of twsc ctwsc and htwsc are illustrated in fig 3 b it can be seen that twsc was relatively stable on the loess plateau except in 1997 during the pre gtgp period nevertheless twsc decreased noticeably during 2003 2016 owing more to anthropogenic interventions than to climatic variations 2 3 5 bias corrected cmip6 simulations the multi model mean cmip6 simulations gpp twsc precipitation and et were used for projection analysis these ensemble mean values were calculated by weighting the four selected model members based on the rmse and independence scores of each cmip6 simulation relative to the observations following the studies of pokhrel et al 2021 sanderson et al 2017 the weights are computed as the normalization of rmse and independence scores i e the sum of weights is one because ecohydrological variability is generally subject to both natural and anthropic forcing cmip6 simulations might be inadequate for delineating its future dynamics and trends therefore we applied a projecting relationship using satellite or field observations to conduct bias corrections on the cmip6 simulations following the studies of huang et al 2016 specifically both the cmip6 simulations and the observed dataset were first decomposed into eigenvectors and principal components a relationship was then established between each principal component of the cmip6 simulations and the observed dataset this relationship revealed the potential physical mechanisms underlying each principal component although it might not indicate causality feddersen et al 1999 finally we applied the established correlations to the cmip6 simulated principal components in the future to predict the bias corrected values here the random forest regression was used to establish and apply the relationships mainly because of its merits in modeling complex relationships we also evaluated the projected simulations through comparison with satellite derived observations during 2015 2020 the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 88 and 0 83 for gpp and tws respectively indicating the applicability of the calibrated cmip6 simulations for further analysis 3 results 3 1 assessment of high resolution simulations we first evaluated the accuracy of noah modeled runoff that is critical for calculating high resolution twsc based on the water balance principle fig 4 a shows the hydrograph of noah modeled runoff versus the corresponding station observations the nse metric illustrates that noah simulations coincide with observed runoff which is further corroborated with the rmse and mae metrics our result is fairly in line with earlier studies that suggested noah simulation could be available for hydrology research across the loess plateau liu et al 2020c notice that the noah model produces an underestimate of total runoff despite capturing the rough curves this divergence between noah simulations and gauge observations has to do with the mismatches between model scale 6 km 6 km and station measurements which can be additionally attributed to the inherent inadequateability of current numerical simulations in delineating regional eco hydrological process cai et al 2014 overgaard et al 2006 the annual simulated runoff was further compared against the annual observed runoff at the gauge sites as illustrated in fig 4b quite consistent is found between simulations and observations indicated by rmse of 14 3 mm annual and mae of 8 1 mm annual this consistency is further observed in the accuracy of annual twsc fig 4c which is quite better when compared against the water balance based values on this level presented results imply that the twsc variable calculating based on noah simulation is worth further studies 3 2 pattern of gpp dynamics fig 5 illustrates the total gpp dynamics across the entire study area one positive trend is found in annual gpp i e 8 162 tgc year a consistent pattern of a trend of increasing is observed on the seasonal scale and this pattern is obvious in jja and son but relatively weak in mam we observe that approximately 65 of the increase in gpp occurs during jja in terms of vegetation type the largest trend of increase is evident for grassland which is related to the vast amount of grassland in the study region it can be seen that the trend of increase is more remarkable after 2010 especially annually and in jja this pattern is captured better by eemd decomposition in comparison with the raw dataset the larger gpp increment during 2010 2016 is probably associated with the higher lai and other climatic factors such as precipitation and temperature cao et al 2019 cao et al 2020 to corroborate the modis derived gpp we also checked the trends of gpp from the vpm and pml models consistency was found in the trend and accuracy of gpp derived from the three gpp sources fig s4 despite slight differences attributable to model uncertainty this agreement further indicates the feasibility and reasonableness of using the modis gpp product to explore vegetation productivity of the loess plateau the spatiotemporal variations of gpp were checked on a pixel basis and the eemd derived gpp trends were further classified based on the derivation information as illustrated in fig 6 fig s5 it can be seen that the study region is dominated by a trend of increase specifically a monotonic trend of increase is found over approximately 40 60 of the study region the trend of increase occurs mostly in central and southern parts of the region that are dominated by grassland this positive trend in gpp largely occurs during jja and son conversely a monotonic trend of decrease in gpp is concentrated in the area of croplands in the north of the region and sporadically observed in other areas the area with a negative trend accounts for approximately 9 of the entire study region cropland accounts for the greatest proportion of the area with a monotonic trends of decrease which implies that agricultural management relating to water abstraction potentially induces negative impact on gpp wang et al 2021 further corroborated results were found for the case in which a fraction of the region experiences gpp increase which is then converted to a trend of decrease earlier studies attributed this increase to decrease trend to regional water deficit cao et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a 3 3 response of twsc to gpp fig 7 illustrates the average twsc series across the study area a downward trend of 0 92 mm year exists for grace based twsc this trend of decrease is further supported by the results from the high resolution noah simulations which exhibit a trend of 0 54 mm year the lower trend in noah simulated twsc probably relates to the inadequate capacity of land surface models for describing water storage components such as surface water and groundwater sun et al 2019 the interannual variations in twsc contrast those in gpp implying a counteractive role between vegetation productivity and water availability in particular a trend of decrease in twsc of 0 84 and 0 86 mm year is evident in mam and jja respectively a greater decrease in twsc is evident for grassland whereas the lowest decrease in twsc is related to trees which reflects water use efficiency zhao et al 2009 detailed patterns in twsc dynamics are further reflected in the spatial distributions of twsc fig s6 and fig s7 which show that a negative trend dominates the study region across the loess plateau more than 70 of the area experiences a trend of decrease in twsc the response of twsc to gpp dynamics was investigated using two twsc datasets as illustrated in fig 8 annual gpp substantially correlates with grace based twsc in the study region with a correlation coefficient of 0 32 p value 0 05 furthermore similar correlation is also evident for the noah simulations with a correlation coefficient of 0 44 p value 0 05 the divergence in the correlations between the grace observations and the noah simulations can be attributed to disparity in spatial resolution in addition to the model uncertainty of the noah simulations and the data uncertainty of the grace product higher correlations are found in jja and son owing to the greater demand for water during the season of vegetation growth no obvious correlation is observed in mam except for grassland specifically grassland has the strongest correlation between gpp and twsc followed by cropland and trees the results indicate that gpp dynamics might exhibit adverse influences on twsc variation over the loess plateau we further analyzed the response of twsc to gpp by checking the twsc trends that accompany the monotonic change in gpp a trend of decrease in twsc is found in association with regions that exhibit either monotonic increase or decrease in gpp as illustrated in fig 9 a considering vegetation productivity could be modified by the constraints of water and energy components as well as atmospheric co2 and soil nitrogen fertilization we used the monotonic decreasing gpp as one reference condition enabling our analysis to be more focused on tws dynamics a larger twsc decline occurs in association with increasing gpp i e approximately 30 higher than that in areas with decreasing gpp this implies that greater water depletion could result from the revegetation process the divergent trend in twsc between the two monotonic phases holds for all three vegetation types but it is more evident for grassland this is in accord with previous studies chen et al 2008 guo et al 2017 that suggested that grassland requires more water resources in semi arid and arid regions we also checked the twsc trend before and after the change point of the increase to decrease gpp region fig 9b this is critical because a considerable fraction of the region of the loess plateau first exhibits a trend of increase in gpp which and then converts to a trend of decrease results demonstrate that decreasing twsc occurs throughout the entire period but that this trend obviously weakens or even declines in the phase of gpp decrease it indicates that less water depletion occurs when the gpp process declines i e increasing gpp resulting from vegetation recovery demands an amount of water consumption that would bring further gpp decrease that needs less water availability the presented cases described for the annual scale fig s8 provide temporal evidence of the divergence in twsc trends among gpp phases we observe that the twsc in the period of the decreasing trend of gpp accounts for only approximately 63 of that in the period of the increasing trend of gpp 3 4 gpp twsc correlation at catchment scale across the loess plateau region approximately 80 of catchments experienced gpp increase during 2003 2016 i e in the time of gtpt and most experienced overall decrease in twsc fig s5 s7 this finding allowed us to further examine the gpp twsc correlations averaged across the catchments here we focus on those catchments that experienced gpp increase as illustrated in fig 10 the increasing gpp is negatively correlated with the grace based twsc trend a similar pattern is found for the noah simulations but with smaller correlation coefficients in comparison with those of the grace observation higher correlations are found in jja probably because of plant water use and climatic water availability in a changed climate brouder and volenec 2008 the influence of increasing gpp on twsc variables appears to be relatively small probably owing to interventions of other factors such as soil water holding capacity and vegetation water efficiency feng et al 2016b we observe obvious correlations for all types of vegetation cover with the correlation coefficients of 0 14 0 534 and 0 316 for tree grass and crop vegetation respectively this implies that revegetation has adverse impact on regional water availability despite the decrease in twsc in a substantial portion of the catchments some catchments show a trend of increase in twsc this might be connected to additional water supplies provided by artificial irrigation systems the derived negative influence is reasonably in accord with that at the pixel based scale fig 8 additionally the divergent correlations among the seasonal bases are relatively small at the catchment scale this finding is related to the connectivity of groundwater storage systems and additional human intervention such as artificial drainage ma et al 2020 3 5 response of htwsc to gpp despite variations in the available datasets and analytical approaches used previous studies lin et al 2019 xie et al 2019 attributed the decline in tws on the loess plateau primarily to anthropogenic interventions we further investigated the response of gtgp driven twsc to gpp dynamics fig 11 a shows that htwsc accounts for a considerable fraction 70 of the total twsc implying a substantial effect of gtgp in terms of water resource consumption i e gtgp driven ecological restoration is one critical anthropogenic contributor to twsc this is plausible because twsc is strongly correlated with surface water abstraction and groundwater pumping lv et al 2021 nair and indu 2021 the anthropogenic contributions presented in this study are in accord with the increasing usage of water by humans fig s2 the spatial pattern of twsc related to gtgp fig 11b broadly matches that of the grace based twsc for most regions gtgp results in decreasing twsc however a positive trend of twsc exists in some cropland regions mostly relating to irrigation flow exceeding groundwater abstraction lv et al 2019 it should be noted that a ratio of htwsc to total twsc exceeding one occurs on a small fraction of the study region which is mainly related to irrigation water sources for regions in which irrigation water use stems from surface water irrigation return flows could exceed groundwater withdrawals thereby increasing regional tws through groundwater gains huang et al 2015 as shown in fig 11c htwsc is correlated negatively with gpp dynamics at the pixel scale and a higher correlation is found in jja and son these correlations regarding htwsc appear to be lower in comparison with those regarding twsc fig 8 owing to the exclusion of climatic contributions which could account for approximately 30 of the entire twsc for certain specific regions the negative influence on twsc from vegetation recovery is further illustrated by the negative correlation between htwsc and gpp at the catchment scale fig 11c the higher correlation coefficients presented in jja and son across the catchment scale indicate that gtgp plays a vital role in twsc as might be expected at the catchment scale the correlations based on htwsc are slightly lower in comparison with those based on total twsc fig 10 this might be connected to the contractions of human activities and connectivity of water storage on tws in addition to the effects of climate 3 6 future projection of gpp and twsc using the bias corrected cmip6 simulations we further investigated the dynamics and trends of gpp and tws in the twenty first century which could support sustainable management of the ecohydrological status under the impact of climate change and human interventions fig 12 shows time series of annual gpp and twsc during both the historical period 2003 2014 and the future period 2015 2100 it can be seen that gpp increases continuously especially during the second half of the twenty first century 2050 with a trend of 0 025 0 125 gc m2 year this pattern of increase can be attributed to increase in precipitation carbon dioxide and human activities li et al 2021 conversely a trend of decrease is projected to occur in twsc on the loess plateau during 2015 2100 with the maximum trend of 0 066 mm year noticeable greening is projected to amplify terrestrial water shortage depletion mostly because the water supply will be exceeded by total water consumption specifically despite increase in projected precipitation water yield will decline owing to increased et fig s9 the resulting trends in gpp and twsc under four ssp scenarios are fairly consistent indicating high confidence in the bias corrected cmip6 projections this confidence is also verified by the agreement between the simulated and observed gpp and twsc for the historical period 2003 2014 overall our work describes the future hydrological regime expected under ecological restoration on the loess plateau and indicates that gpp increase is likely to result in tws decline in the future 4 discussions 4 1 eemd noticeable interannual variations occur in gpp and twsc and their identification is crucial for quantification of the long term effects of vegetation restoration on water availability hawinkel et al 2015 accordingly the eemd method which can account for nonlinearity was used in this study to characterize the interannual variations in gpp and twsc it was found that the eemd based dataset is more suitable for detecting and even reversing the trend changes in comparison with raw data and those processed using simple linear analysis chen et al 2017 specifically a considerable fraction of gpp originally exhibited as an increase decrease is described as a decrease increase over the period when using the eemd method to decompose the observations this cannot be captured by linear trends especially during the period after 2010 in which lai and gpp became larger results conducted using eemd were further compared with those obtained using the raw dataset and a sliding mean dataset the trends obtained from the raw dataset and the sliding mean dataset table s2 illustrate a trend of increase in gpp and a trend of decrease in twsc during 2003 2016 consistent with the results derived from the eemd based dataset nevertheless noticeable disparities were found among these changes on this level our study extends earlier work that demonstrated that eemd decomposed series could potentially facilitate understanding of ecological hydrological patterns liu et al 2021b rezaie balf et al 2019 4 2 gpp trend and its effects on twsc revegetation increased gpp at a rate of 8 162 tgc year during 2003 2016 this pattern of increase obtained from the modis product is consistent with the gpp results derived using the vpm and pml models fig s4 in particular grassland has the highest gpp change although a considerable fraction has been converted to forest and farmland table s3 despite the influences of changing precipitation patterns and the increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit on vegetation restoration liu et al 2020b piao et al 2006 we consider that increasing gpp is primarily associated with land cover change to verify this the time series of satellite lai during 1982 2016 was analyzed and one positive trend in annual lai was found during this period fig s10 this increasing trend is more intensive during the post gtgp period owing to human intervention we further checked the gpp variations of those regions that experienced a trend of increase in lai and those that had no trend of increase in lai it was found that the trend of increase in gpp in regions without vegetation recovery was less significant in comparison with that in regions that experienced vegetation recovery a study regarding the 6 km spatial resolution noah simulation illustrates that the response of twsc to gpp varies among vegetation types this divergence in twsc response is evident at both pixel and catchment scales and it is related to the species specific water use efficiency of vegetation types zhang et al 2016a zheng et al 2019 particularly the twsc of the three vegetation types considered in this study decreased most noticeably for grassland which indicates that grassland tends to be influenced more by water deficit in comparison with trees generally grassland on the loess plateau has less capacity for absorbing dense root network moisture which means that it is more sensitive to variations in available water zhang et al 2016b accordingly greater attention should be focused on grassland especially considering its vast coverage in the study region as well as its ecology and water response in association with gtgp despite the overall increase in gpp a considerable fraction of the loess plateau shows a trend of decrease 24 and even a trend of increase to decrease 4 during 2003 2016 revegetation has the capacity to conserve soil and water in the short term i e before 2006 also see fig s8 nevertheless vegetation growth is inhibited to some extent when the available water resources become limited by the amount of vegetation restoration wang et al 2018b this case is obvious for grassland and cropland i e gpp cannot always exhibit monotonic increase owing to the complex responses to water stress our work corroborates the findings of several previous studies liu et al 2015 lu and zhuang 2010 zhang et al 2016a which reported a single nonlinear pattern of water use efficiency when responding to water stress we also notice that gpp decline in certain areas represents a slightly favorable impact on grassland and cropland when water stress is alleviated on this level our study provides a reference for ecological construction especially in relation to coping with desertification of oasis the correlations between twsc and gpp appear to be relatively low which implies an unrecognized connection between ecological restoration and water availability especially considering the divergent trend of twsc among vegetation types and on the seasonal scale we attribute these small correlations to the following two aspects first tws mainly includes components of soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage and the final term is considered the primary water resource for vegetation growth in arid and semi arid regions han et al 2020 accordingly groundwater storage can be related more closely to vegetation productivity which is higher by 26 than the correlation with twsc text s2 and fig s11 second the response of tws to vegetation productivity is impacted by a variety of factors that involve the climatic variations i e precipitation and arid index and human activities both of which could make the response more complex feng et al 2016b poulter et al 2009 4 3 noah simulation given that tws is a critical component not readily retrieved from satellite observations at fine spatial scale noah simulations modified with continuous satellite forcing were further employed to analyze the effects of ecological restoration on water availability some studies liu et al 2020c syed et al 2008 demonstrated that a tws anomaly simulated by a land surface model could be consistent with a grace based tws anomaly at global and regional scales wefound that noah derived twsc broadly coincides with the grace product for the loess plateau fig 7 and fig 8 despite differences in their magnitude specifically the pearson correlation and nash coefficient between grace based and noah based twsc is 0 91 0 17 and 0 73 0 28 at the annual scale respectively fig s12 both datasets well illustrate that twsc decline substantially accompanies gpp increase however clear spatial patterns of twsc can be depicted when using high resolution data and the detailed twsc response regarding different vegetation cover can be captured by noah simulations this is particularly critical for the loess plateau region that has an intense mixture of grassland and trees given the topographical complexity of the loess plateau region concerns regarding mismatches between noah simulations and land cover data cannot be neglected although this is beyond the scope of our study because our focus was the qualitative hydrological response of vegetation types we evaluated the associated uncertainty by checking those pixels for which a single land cover type occupied more than 80 consistent patterns in the correlations and trends fig s13 were found between those based on the 6 km land cover classification and those based on pure pixels i e the larger trends of decrease in twsc and the higher correlations between twsc and gpp were found in relation to grassland this implies that the derived pattern at 6 km spatial resolution is credible despite the biases in magnitude this is considered plausible because the region specific hydrological response can be captured at the interannual level by land surface models meanwhile to examine the applicability of the 6 km noah simulation to analysis of eco hydrological response we ran the noah model to simulate runoff at 2 and 1 km spatial resolution for the period 2003 2016 text s3 differences among the results at the three scales fig s14 imply sensitivity to the spatial resolution of the land surface model however one consistent pattern observed that is thought sensible indicates contraction of the connectivity between terrestrial and fluvial systemsvia eco hydrological interactions liu et al 2022 4 4 implications and further consideration climate change and human interventions have impact on regional ecological hydrological interactions bias corrected cmip6 simulations demonstrate that gpp increase is most likely at the expense of tws decline by the end of the 2100 s despite a trend of increase in projected precipitation tws might continue to diminish on the loess plateau region because water abstraction could exceed precipitation past and future eco hydrological regimes indicate that the ecological benefits of revegetation measures could represent only short term gains and that effective conservation and restoration measures should be evaluated critically in particular given that decline in tws is very likely to be ongoing in the future the government and local stakeholders should change the current hydrological condition by balancing the socioeconomic benefits and the twsc costs and some specific technical measures are encouraged to regulate water resource consumption i e improving vegetation water use efficiency and growing areas of dense vegetation with consideration of the implications derived from this work several caveats should be noted first only one vegetation productivity index was checked in this study additional satellite derived observations such as solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence and vegetation optical depth could be used to elaborate the characterization of vegetation in future work second this study investigated the hydrological response to vegetation dynamics from a general perspective more in depth studies of such interactions are needed additionally critical analysis leveraging the coupled ecological hydrological model is encouraged to accurately disentangle the effects from anthropogenic interventions 5 conclusions understanding the status of ecological restoration is vital for ecological and hydrological sustainability thus holistic analysis that involves long term satellite observations noah land surface hydrological modeling and cmip6 projections was performed in this study to investigate the historical and future hydrologic regime associated with ecological restoration on the loess plateau in china we used one satellite gpp product to quantify gtgp driven ecological restoration on the loess plateau and two twsc datasets were employed to analyze the effects of ecological restoration on water availability the eemd method which can account for nonlinearity was leveraged to characterize the interannual series of gpp and twsc this study also used the noah model modified with continuous satellite observations to retrieve 6 km twsc we found that gpp increased obviously during 2003 2016 in association with gtgp despite decrease in its overall area grassland showed the largest increase in gpp in the study region because of its vast areal coverage increase in gpp results in substantial decline of twsc however this pattern diverges among the various types of vegetation cover negative correlation between gpp and twsc holds true at both pixel and catchment scales on this level ecological restoration is one major anthropogenic contributor to tws which can be corroborated by a prominent inverse correlation between gpp and human driven twsc with climatic impacts removed on the basis of cmip6 simulations we found that gpp is projected to increase in the twenty first century and that this is likely to result in substantial decline in twsc overall the findings of this study indicate that past and future vegetation greening is at the expense of water availability and provide insight regarding synthesis of ecological restoration planning and water resource management when implementing programs such as gtgp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2406,with the depletion of globally available water resources and the rapid development of cities helping managers of urban water departments formulate management plans and accurately forecast urban daily water supply udws is important in this paper to improve the ability of the model to process complex feature information we proposed a new udws forecasting model that adopts the idea of sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction and integration forecasting first the udws sequence was decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions imfs using time varying filtering based temporal mode decomposition tvfemd method second fast fourier transform fft and sample entropy se approaches were utilized to reconstruct the decomposed imfs to obtain new granularity features the fft for the first granularity reconstruction and the se for the second granularity reconstruction third an attention mechanism was combined with a long short term memory model to further mine the local features in each granularity and improve the forecasting accuracy finally the simulated values of all of the granularity were integrated to obtain the udws forecast we applied the proposed model to the actual case of a water plant in nan an district chongqing china and the results had a mean absolute error mae of 2680 m3 d a root mean square error rmse of 3597 m3 d and a mean absolute percentage error mape of 1 461 compared with other models these results showed that the proposed model had better reliability and accuracy in a practical application udws forecasting scenario keywords sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting attention mechanism based deep model daily water supply data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years driven by population growth improvement of living standards urbanization industrialization and modernization urban water consumption has increased sharply bai et al 2014 du et al 2022 therefore meeting the water demand of the city is a top priority of the water supply system accurate forecasting of the urban daily water supply udws is one of the most effective ways to solve this issue and it can provide data reference for the reliability of water supply dispatching decisions du et al 2021 in reality many factors affect the changes in the udws such as the date e g workdays weekends and holidays climate e g temperature humidity and rainfall public policies e g water prices water resource protection plans and education and social and economic factors e g population household income and industrial structure brentan et al 2018 lan et al 2020 rezaali et al 2021 as a key feature of udws forecasting researchers have added the above exogenous variables to improve the forecast accuracy wong et al 2010 however adding too many exogenous variables increases the complexity of the model and the computational burden and may affect the performance of the forecasting model brooks and tobias 1996 orth et al 2015 in addition taking into account the daily forecast scale the udws fluctuates significantly with the date therefore in this study we considered only the date factor including weekdays and holidays in the past few decades scientists have proposed various methods for udws forecasting which can be divided into traditional statistical methods and machine learning methods gustavo et al 2019 traditional statistical methods use the linear relationship between the variables with some distribution assumptions in historical time series to establish models such as the autoregressive ar model smith 1988 autoregressive integrated moving average arima model sarah and heejun 2009 and nonlinear autoregressive nar model bata et al 2020 with the development of computer techniques researchers have found that traditional statistical methods have certain limitations in mapping highly complex historical time series and thus machine learning has become an effective candidate to address this issue machine learning models achieve a higher forecasting accuracy through repeated training learning simulation processes he et al 2022 such as the backpropagation neural network xue 2017 support vector machine lu et al 2020 gradient boosting machine xenochristou et al 2020 random forest villarin and rodriguez galiano 2019 and bayesian network magiera and froelich 2017 however these traditional machine learning models can only extract the shallow features from the original data and they have insufficient learning ability regarding the deep features du et al 2021 yu et al 2022a leading to low forecasting accuracy to resolve this issue deep learning has become a popular research topic in this field zhang et al 2022a deep learning combines low level features to form more abstract high level features to discover the distributed feature representation of the data bai et al 2018 pu et al 2022 typical deep learning models include the deep neural network sezen et al 2019 deep belief network dbn bai et al 2016 chu et al 2021 convolutional neural network tu et al 2021 stack autoencoder model li et al 2016 and the recurrent neural network rnn the latter of which is a network specially designed to deal with time dependent sequence information its core idea is to connect the previous information to the current task to solve the problem of gradient explosion or disappearance of the rnn researchers introduced the cell state based on the rnn and developed the long short term memory lstm model this model has since become the mainstream model in the field of time series forecasting such as forecasting runoff zuo et al 2020 wind speeds memarzadeh and keynia 2020 loads hu et al 2022 and stock prices lin et al 2022b inspired by human vision the attention mechanism am has become an important and effective means of improving the performance of neural networks its initial idea is to allocate more computing resources to the most significant information in the data yang et al 2021 and it was initially applied to machine translation luong et al 2015 in recent years it has been widely applied in fields such as fault diagnosis zhang et al 2022c image classification zhang et al 2021 and time series analysis niu et al 2022 kara 2022 lin et al 2022a however few relevant studies have used a combination of the am and lstm for udws forecasting in addition to improve the reliability performance and accuracy of data driven techniques composite models which integrate two or more approaches to exceed the performance of a single model zubaidi et al 2020 have gradually become a popular trend in time series analysis among them the idea of combined models based on decomposition reconstruction has become a popular research topic in the field of time series forecasting some of the more popular decomposition techniques are empirical mode decomposition emd zhang et al 2022d and various deformations huan et al 2018 prasad et al 2018 wang et al 2022 to effectively solve the problems of modal aliasing and the endpoint effect in emd li et al 2017 introduced time varying filtering tvf into emd to improve it they named this technique time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvfemd after decomposition the original data are further decomposed into multiple levels of information when there are too many decomposition levels the data features are completely decomposed but the modeling cost increases rapidly when the decomposition level is too small the data features are still fused which is not conducive to the feature learning of the forecasting model currently some scholars have focused on feature learning and direct modeling at each decomposition level pandey et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b but this method directly affects the modeling cost other scholars to balance the modeling cost and the demand for feature learning reconstruct the granularity of the feature information at each decomposition level before the modeling sun and wang 2018 yu et al 2022b this method can integrate the features of multiple decomposition levels and convert them into a new granularity resulting in an

time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition empirical mode decomposition emd is an adaptive decomposition method developed by huang et al 1998 which decomposes the signal according to the time scale characteristics of the data without setting any basis function in advance it can adaptively divide the given non stationary and nonlinear original signal x t into several intrinsic mode functions however due to the shortcomings of separation and intermittency the effect of separating similar frequencies is restricted and modal overlap is easily caused by noise interference both of which restrict the forecasting performance the tvfemd makes full use of the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency information adaptively designs the local cut off frequency performs time varying filtering of the given sequence and divides it into local high frequency components and local low frequency components to obtain imfs the execution process of the tvfemd is as follows step 1 conduct the hilbert transform on the udws data x t and record it as x t compute the momentary amplitude a t and momentary phase φ t of the udws data x t 1 a t x t 2 x t 2 2 φ t arctan x t x t step 2 determine the local maximum a t max and local minimum a t min of the momentary amplitude a t then interpolate the maximum point set and the minimum point set to obtain the curve of η 1 t versus η 2 t using eq 3 and eq 4 calculate instantaneous mean value σ 1 t and instantaneous envelope σ 2 t 3 σ 1 t η 1 t η 2 t 2 4 σ 2 t η 1 t η 2 t 2 step 3 compute the momentary frequency λ 1 t and λ 2 t among them μ 1 t can be estimated by interpolating a set of points λ t min a 2 t min while μ 2 t can be estimated by interpolating λ t max a 2 t max the corresponding mathematical expressions are as follows 5 λ 1 t μ 1 t 2 σ 1 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t μ 2 t 2 σ 1 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t 6 λ 2 t μ 1 t 2 σ 2 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t μ 2 t 2 σ 2 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t step 4 calculate the local cut off frequency λ bis t 7 λ bis t λ 1 t λ 2 t 2 step 5 readjust the local cut off frequency λ bis t to eliminate the intermittence problem step 6 calculate the signal h t using eq 8 take the extrema timings of h t as the knots to construct the time varying filter and perform b spline approximation filtering of x t the approximate result of which is m t 8 h t cos λ bis t d t step 7 when the stopping criterion θ t is met and θ t ξ x t is denoted as an intrinsic mode function otherwise let x t x t m t and repeat steps 1 6 the calculation formula for the stopping criterion θ t is as follows 9 θ t b loughlin t λ avg t where b loughlin t is the loughlin instantaneous bandwidth and λ avg t is the weighted average of the momentary frequencies the threshold ξ is set as 0 1 2 2 secondary granularity reconstruction method for the first granularity reconstruction the fft is used to transform each imf from the time domain to the frequency domain and the granularity reconstruction is carried out according to the frequency domain information of the imf reconstruction into high medium and low frequency because the high frequency information fluctuates dynamically and has a high degree of randomness imf features overlap so it is necessary to reconstruct the granularity of imfs contained in the high frequency information the secondary granularity reconstruction measures the time series complexity of the imf in the high frequency by calculating the se value and then it carries out granularity reconstruction after two correlation analysis steps the secondary granularity reconstruction proposed in this paper is realized the specific method is as follows 2 2 1 fast fourier transformation the fourier transform is a basic signal processing tool which can determine the frequency components of data the fast fourier transform is a fast algorithm of the discrete fourier transform dft the dft is improved by using periodicity and symmetry which greatly reduces the number of multiplications required for computer processing of the discrete fourier transform the fft reduces the time complexity of the dft from o n 2 to o n log n greatly improving the operation speed the fft algorithm is used to convert the data from the time domain to the frequency domain for analysis to extract the frequency domain information of the original signal and then to analyze the spectrum structure and changes in the signal which is conducive to the in depth analysis of the data assuming the acquired signal sequence f t the mathematical expression of the dft is as follows 10 f k t 0 t 1 f t e j 2 π t k t where f k is the frequency domain value f t is the time domain value t is the number of sampling points during the time frequency conversion and k 0 1 2 t 1 when t is an even number the dft calculation can be divided into odd and even parts eq 1 can be converted into the following formula 11 f k t t 2 1 f 2 t e j 4 π t k t e j 2 π t k t t 2 1 f 2 t 1 e j 4 π t k t the frequency domain information f k obtained through the dft can be inverted to obtain the original signal f t and its formula is as follows 12 f t 1 t t 0 t 1 f k e j 2 π t k t 2 2 2 sample entropy sample entropy is a time series complexity characterization parameter proposed by richman et al 2000 which can measure the probability of generating new patterns in the signal the greater the probability of generating a new pattern is the greater the complexity of the sequence is the advantage of the se method is that the calculation does not depend on the data length and has better consistency the method s calculation steps are as follows step i assuming that there is a time series x x 1 x 2 x n with length n construct x into an m dimensional vector 13 x i x i x i 1 x i m 1 i 1 2 n m 1 step ii define the distance between x i and x j as d x i x j which is the largest difference between their corresponding elements 14 d x i x j max k 0 m 1 x i k x j k i j step iii given the threshold r calculate the ratio of the number of d x i x j r to the total number of vectors n m and calculate its average value 15 b i m r n u m d x i x j r n m 16 b m r i 1 n m 1 b i m r n m 1 step iv increase the dimension to m 1 and repeat steps i iv to obtain b m 1 r in theory the se value of this sequence is calculated as follows 17 sampen m r lim n ln b m 1 r b m r when n is a finite value it can be estimated using the following formula 18 sampen m r n ln b m 1 r b m r where m is the embedded dimension r is the similarity tolerance and its selection range is 0 1 s t d 0 25 s t d std represents the standard deviation of the time series n is the length of the time series 2 3 integrated forecasting model 2 3 1 attention mechanism in cognitive science due to the bottleneck in information processing human beings selectively focus on only a part of the available information while ignoring other visible information by introducing the concept of the human brain into the field of computer science only some of the key information input is selected for processing to improve the processing efficiency this is called the attention mechanism am xiong et al 2022 to improve the regression performance of models and the interpretability of neural networks the am has developed rapidly in the field of neural network modeling especially in applications of the rnn and its variants the am helps to overcome shortcomings such as the performance degradation caused by the increase in the input length and the low computational efficiency caused by unreasonable input sequences in the deep learning model different weights are assigned to the extracted feature information through the am to highlight the important information the traditional am considers the previous state h h 1 h 2 h t and extracts the context vector v t from h where v t is the relevant information in the current time step luong et al 2015 v t is further integrated with the present state h t to yield the forecast 19 score h i h t f h i h t 20 α i softmax f h i h t exp f h i h t j 1 t exp f h j h t 21 v t i 1 t a i h i finally the udws forecast results in the next time step are obtained by inputting the key feature v t into the fully connected layer 2 3 2 long short term memory the deep learning algorithm based on the recurrent neural network rnn provides a new method for udws forecasting the long short term memory lstm as a special rnn introduces a gate mechanism to control the flow and loss of features to solve the problem of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion during long sequence training hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 due to its unique design structure the lstm is more sensitive to time series data and has a higher processing efficiency than the rnn liu et al 2021 the topological structure of the lstm network is shown in fig 1 the gated memory module unit is the core component of the lstm system s structure the gated memory module is used to replace the ordinary input neuron which is mainly realized through three gate logic namely a forget gate unit an input gate unit and an output gate unit the forget gate unit is used to control whether the historical information is forgotten the input gate unit is used to control whether the input information is valid and the output gate unit determines the specific output of the unit state to achieve dynamic memory the state information update equation of lstm network can be expressed as follows 22 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 23 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 24 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 25 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 26 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 27 h t o t tanh c t where f t i t and o t are the calculation results of forget gate unit input gate unit and output gate unit respectively c t is the cell state update value w and b are the weights and offsets corresponding to each control gate unit respectively σ and tanh represent sigmoid activation function and tanh activation function respectively h t is the state vector of the hidden layer at time t 2 3 3 am lstm model the am is added to the lstm model to enhance the ability to focus on the critical features in the long input sequences liu et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2021 to improve the forecasting ability of the lstm the structure of the am lstm is shown in fig 2 after the lstm extracts the long term dependency from the features its output is used as the input of the attention layer and the added attention layer automatically learns the importance of each hidden state yang et al 2021 the input vector x 1 x 2 x t is the characteristic vector of the udws the lstm model processes the input vector in the time steps and obtains the hidden layer state h 1 h 2 h t the am uses the neural network with softmax activation function to calculate the attention weight α i and then it assigns the attention weight α i to the corresponding hidden state h k and extracts the key feature vector v t via summation finally the key feature v t is input into the full connection layer to obtain the udws forecast results 2 4 proposed forecasting method to better forecast the udws we proposed a new deep learning forecast framework the framework includes seven stages fig 3 intuitively illustrates the overall workflow of the udws forecasting based on the sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting framework the modeling steps are summarized as follows stage a data acquisition the historical daily water supply data are collected from the waterworks in this paper the monitoring data from one water plant in chongqing china are investigated stage b sequence decomposition the tvfemd is used to decompose the original udws data to obtain imfs which are regarded as the abstract feature information of the udws stage c secondary granularity reconstruction in this stage all imfs are reconstructed to obtain a new feature expression in the first step the time frequency conversion of each imf is carried out according to the fft the main frequency value of each imf is calculated and it is reconstructed to obtain the high medium and low frequency granularities in the second step since the high frequency information fluctuates dynamically and has a high degree of randomness imf features overlap so it is necessary to reconstruct the granularity of imfs contained in the high frequency information the complexity of the time series is measured by calculating the se value of each imf the interval size of the complexity according to the formula calculated as follows δ s e max s e min n 2 where s e max and s e min are the maximum and minimum values of the calculated sample entropy respectively which are reconstructed into high1 high2 and high3 granularities in summary all imfs are reconstructed into high1 high2 high3 medium and low granularities in this stage stage d feature selection to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model in this paper we consider two date related factors that affect the changes in the uwds and we introduce them into the dataset as the input of the forecasting model in the next stage stage e input variable determination before inputting the data into the forecasting model first we divide the training set and testing set for each granularity and then we normalize the data finally we sample the data as the input variable of the forecasting model stage f construction of forecasting models five am lstm forecasting models are established for the high1 high2 high3 medium and low granularities stage g integration of forecasting results of different granularities the data for each granularity are input into the established am lstm model to obtain the forecast value and then the forecast value of each granularity is integrated to obtain the final forecast udws value 3 case study and data processing 3 1 research data description to verify the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper nan an district in the central urban area of chongqing china is taken as an example the time scale of the collected data is daily covering the period from 1 1 2018 to 12 31 2020 and including 1096 sample data the data are presented in fig 4 in this paper the date factor is further refined into holidays weekends workdays and each individual day of the week in the factors the holidays weekends holidays and weekends are represented by the number 0 and the workdays are represented by the number 1 the factor of each day of the week is represented by the numbers 1 7 and an example is shown in table 1 3 2 sampling process before inputting the characteristic data into the forecasting model it is necessary to sample the data to facilitate the learning of the forecasting model in the sampling process the time window method is used to process the time series and a fixed size window is used to slide on the time series data fig 5 the value in the window is the input vector of the model every time which points to the target value to be forecast in this paper one step forecasting is used and the target value is the real value that needs to be forecasted in the next time step the traditional sample processing method does not divide the training set and the testing set in advance and the sliding time window is directly placed on the entire time series for sampling this leads to a boundary effect in the samples that is the samples at the end of the training set and at the beginning of the testing set contain the same data to solve this problem we first divide the time series into a training set and testing set and then we use the sliding time windows for them to obtain the input and output samples for further explanation assuming that the length of the training set is m the length of the test set is n and the size of the sliding time window is t the numbers of forecastable samples in the training set and the test set are m t and n t respectively in this paper the size of the sliding time window is t 7 because the main exogenous variable considered in this paper is the date factor the weekly water supply fluctuates periodically over a short period and the number 7 represents the seven days of the week in addition when calculating the se in this paper the embedding dimension of its main parameters is also7 3 3 data normalization the standardized value is between 0 1 in this paper after dividing the dataset the data normalization of the training set and the testing set is conducted using the maximum and minimum values of the training set the data are normalized using the following formula 28 x i x x min x max x min where x i is the value of a single data point x min is the minimum value and x max is the maximum value 3 4 criteria for performance evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the model the following indicators are used to compare the models the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape the mae is used to measure the average absolute error between the forecast value and the real value which can better reflect the actual situation of the error of the forecast value the smaller the mae is the better the model is the mae is defined as follows 29 e mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where n is the length of the evaluated dataset and y i and y i are the i th forecast value and the observed value respectively the rmse is a typical evaluation indicator for regression models and it is used to measure the deviation between the forecast value and the observed value it describes the degree of dispersion and it is defined as follows 30 e rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 the mape can avoid the problem of error offset so it can accurately reflect the size of the actual error of the forecast the smaller the mape value is the better the forecast effect of the forecast model is and the better its accuracy is it is calculated as follows 31 e mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 4 results and discussion 4 1 sequence decomposition in this paper the tvfemd is used to decompose the original time series of the udws into imfs a total of 18 modes i e imf1 imf17 and the residual the decomposition results are shown in fig 6 the parameter settings are as follows bandwidth threshold 0 1 and b spline order 26 the results show that the data for imf1 imf5 change more violently than those for other modes with the strongest volatility and high frequency characteristics the fluctuation frequency of imf6 imf12 is lower than that of the high frequency but its fluctuation has certain periodic characteristics the frequency changes of imf13 imf17 and the residual are the weakest reflecting the trend of the udws during this period 4 2 secondary granularity reconstruction in the first granularity reconstruction the fft is used to conduct the time frequency conversion for each imf and then modal reconstruction is conducted according to the main frequency value of each imf the frequency domain diagram is presented in fig 7 the red circle in fig 7 denotes the target point the main frequency calculated according to the abscissa value is shown in table 2 the imfs are reconstructed into granularities using the main frequency value i e the high medium and low frequency it is noted that the interval division is determined according to the order of magnitude of the time frequency conversion value of each mode shown in table 2 the imfs contained in the combined granularities are presented in table 3 after the first granularity reconstruction the fluctuation frequency of the high frequency is significantly increased which means that imf features overlap in the fused high frequency therefore a secondary granularity reconstruction is required for the high frequency the se value is used to measure the complexity of the imf time series in the high frequency during the second granularity reconstruction with the main parameter settings presented in table 4 where std imf n is the standard deviation of the calculated imf data the se value of each imf after the calculation is presented in table 5 based on the proposed reconstruction method its interval is δ s e max s e min n 2 0 167 and the new granularity after the high frequency reconstruction is presented in table 6 in summary the granularity obtained from the original data after the secondary reconstruction of the data is presented in fig 8 in this part the number of imfs is reduced from 18 modes to five modes i e high1 high2 high3 medium and low which greatly improves the efficiency of the forecast modeling 4 3 performance of the proposed model after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the original data each granularity is divided into a training set and a testing set in which the training set accounts for 80 and the testing set accounts for 20 to train the model and output the forecast value the main hyper parameters of the am lstm forecasting model established for each set of granularity data are presented in table 7 the forecast performance of the am lstm for the five granularities is shown in fig 9 and the integrated results are shown in fig 10 the evaluation indices for each granularity forecasting result are presented in table 8 first based on the forecast curve in fig 9 a and b and the evaluation indicators in table 8 it can be seen that the secondary reconstruction data resulted in the am lstm having a strong forecasting performance and it could track the changes in the granularity with time second because the data in the high frequency including the high1 high2 and high3 granularities after the secondary reconstruction change dramatically the frequency is high there is less high frequency data than medium frequency data resulting in a higher mape in the high frequency data however based on the mae and rmse the forecast results are relatively ideal and their consistency with the real value curve is high finally by integrating the forecasting results of the granularity testing set in fig 10 to reflect the forecasting results of each granularity we found that the forecasting effect is sufficient with low error accumulation effect table 8 it is noted that the order of magnitude of testing set 10 5 is much higher than that of the error evaluation value maximum mae and rmse 103 combined consideration of mape 1 461 thereby the forecasting performance is ideal and acceptable based on the above analysis the model proposed in this paper has an excellent udws forecasting performance and has a strong description ability in detail in addition it is consistent with the real value curve of the udws in this region 4 4 comparative study to verify the superiority of the method proposed in this paper it is compared with other models table 9 describes the input data for each model in detail 4 4 1 superiority of attention mechanism to demonstrate that the am can improve the forecast ability of the lstm a single am lstm and a single lstm without tvfemd the original data and two date characteristics are used as the input characteristics of the forecasting model are designed in this section to forecast the udws the forecasting performances of the am lstm and lstm are tested using the testing dataset to demonstrate the improvement in the forecasting accuracy obtained using the am the main parameters of the two models are presented in table 10 and the forecasting results are presented in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 a that the forecast value curve obtained using the am lstm model plots above the forecast value curve obtained using the lstm model overall the two models can describe the changing trend of the udws in the testing set however in terms of the details the am lstm describes the variation range of the water supply better based on the scatter plots shown in fig 11 b and c and the absolute error shown in fig 11 d the forecast values of the am lstm are more concentrated than those of the lstm that is the am does improve the forecasting accuracy of the lstm model this is because the am makes up for the deficiency of the lstm s feature learning ability and enhances the regression ability of the lstm the forecasting performances of the models were evaluated using the evaluation indicators the results are as follows the mae rmse and mape of the am lstm forecasting model were 7437 m3 d 9402 m3 d and 4 105 respectively the mae rmse and mape of the lstm forecast model were 7667 m3 d 9598 m3 d and 4 154 respectively to further reflect the excellence of the am lstm model s forecasting performance radar charts of the forecasting performance evaluation indicators of the two models were drawn for visual comparison fig 12 the two models were used for modeling and forecasting and the calculated evaluation indicators were enclosed into two triangles the area of the triangle enclosed by the am lstm was smaller which shows that the am could mine the implicit relationship between the input features and the data to be forecasted and it reduced the forecasting error of the lstm the above findings demonstrate that combining the am with the lstm framework can improve the ability of the lstm to process input sequences therefore the am lstm is used as the backbone forecasting model in this paper 4 4 2 advantages of secondary granularity reconstruction of the original sequence in this paper the original data are decomposed using the tvfemd and the decomposed imfs are reconstructed to obtain the multi granularity characteristics of the water supply data regarding the effect of the secondary granularity reconstruction fig 8 a shows the time series curve after the first granularity reconstruction of the udws sequence via fft and fig 8 b shows the time series curve after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the high frequency granularity we compared the time series data forecast using the am lstm after the first granularity reconstruction and the secondary granularity reconstruction to confirm that the secondary reconstruction of the data can improve the forecasting performance of the model the main hyper parameters of each model are presented in table 11 the main hyper parameters of the tvfemd fft se am lstm are not repeated here and the specific conditions are presented in table 7 the forecasting results obtained are presented in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 a that in the forecasting model that uses the am lstm as the backbone the combined model without secondary granularity reconstruction tvfemd fft am lstm can only restore the trend of the udws and its ability to describe the details is weak the combined model tvfemd fft se am lstm after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the data improves the degree of reduction of the detailed changes in the udws to illustrate the forecasting performance of the two models more clearly the scatter plots in fig 13 b and 13 c and the absolute error plot in fig 13 e were drawn it can be seen that the values forecast by the combined forecasting model after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the original data are more concentrated while the values forecast by the combined model after the first granularity reconstruction of the data are more scattered this indicates that the original data after the secondary reconstruction have a significant impact on the regression ability of the model to further demonstrate the superiority of the secondary granularity reconstruction we use the lstm to forecast the testing dataset after the secondary granularity reconstruction fig 13 a d and e present the forecast value curve scatter plot and absolute error plot respectively as can be seen from these figures the secondary granularity reconstruction method has the same effect on the lstm that is it significantly improves the learning ability of the model and causes the model to learn more effectively to quantify the forecasting ability of each model the forecasting ability of each model was analyzed quantitatively and a radar chart of the error evaluation indices of the forecasting results of each model was drawn fig 14 the specific error evaluation indices of each model are presented in table 12 in fig 14 the forecasting accuracy of the model is determined according to the area of the triangle overall it can be seen that the area of the triangle of the model proposed in this paper is the smallest and it has a stronger regression ability the results of the comparative analysis are as follows 1 by comparing the forecasting results after the first granularity reconstruction and the secondary granularity reconstruction it was found that the area of the triangle enclosed by the combined model tvfemd fft am lstm after the first granularity reconstruction was the largest while the area of the triangle enclosed by the combined model tvfemd fft se am lstm after the secondary granularity reconstruction was the smallest it can be seen that the secondary granularity reconstruction method proposed in this paper can further explore the feature information of the udws and enhance the learning ability of the forecasting model 2 regarding the addition of the am for forecasting after the granularity reconstruction the area of the triangle enclosed by the combined model without the am tvfemd fft se lstm was larger than that enclosed by the combined model with am tvfemd fft se am lstm which confirms that the model with the am can still improve the forecasting accuracy after the granularity reconstruction it can be seen from table 12 that when the am lstm is used as the forecasting model the mape of the secondary reconstruction data of the forecasting model is 51 766 higher than that of the first granularity reconstruction data of the forecasting model after the secondary granularity reconstruction when using the am lstm and lstm for the forecasting the mapes of the two combined models are only 1 461 and 1 918 respectively and they are reduced by 64 409 and 53 828 respectively compared with the single am lstm and single lstm see section 4 4 1 therefore the granularity reconstruction method secondary granularity reconstruction proposed in this paper can reconstruct the data from the imf feature information better and make it easier for the forecasting model to learn improving the forecasting performance of the model after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the original udws data the lstm with the am has the strongest forecasting ability 5 conclusions accurate forecasting of the udws can enable the managers of urban water departments to forecast the future water supply information this paper proposed a new udws deep learning combined forecasting model with a sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting framework the proposed model couples the tvfemd for sequence decomposition the fft time frequency transform in the first granularity reconstruction and se entropy domain probability estimation in the second granularity reconstruction for secondary granularity reconstruction and the am and lstm for integration forecasting the proposed model was used to successfully forecast the real udws in chongqing china all of the results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits the best forecasting performance and it is a powerful tool for the implementation of water management the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 through sequence decomposition the global features of the udws are represented locally and the important component information of the nonlinear time series is effectively extracted which reduces the complexity of the feature learning of subsequent forecasting models 2 through the secondary granularity reconstruction based on identifying the time frequency domain characteristics of each imf and the entropy domain probability estimation characteristics of each imf in the high frequency granularity the proposed model can fully extract the multi granularity feature data from the complex data this solves the problem of overlapping imf features in the high frequency improves the modeling efficiency makes it easier for the forecasting model to learn the implicit relationship between the data and reduces the calculation cost and cumulative forecasting error 3 the improved lstm with the am am lstm enables the am to optimize the weights of important features again in the model regression stage which can better capture the internal features of the input sequence and improve the model s forecasting performance in summary in this study the temporal modal features in the decomposition stage the time frequency features and entropy probability features in the secondary granularity reconstruction stage and the significant features of the limited information in the integration forecasting stage were comprehensively considered thus the proposed model achieved the best performance for udws forecasting in the future we will focus on the model s universality credit authorship

2406,with the depletion of globally available water resources and the rapid development of cities helping managers of urban water departments formulate management plans and accurately forecast urban daily water supply udws is important in this paper to improve the ability of the model to process complex feature information we proposed a new udws forecasting model that adopts the idea of sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction and integration forecasting first the udws sequence was decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions imfs using time varying filtering based temporal mode decomposition tvfemd method second fast fourier transform fft and sample entropy se approaches were utilized to reconstruct the decomposed imfs to obtain new granularity features the fft for the first granularity reconstruction and the se for the second granularity reconstruction third an attention mechanism was combined with a long short term memory model to further mine the local features in each granularity and improve the forecasting accuracy finally the simulated values of all of the granularity were integrated to obtain the udws forecast we applied the proposed model to the actual case of a water plant in nan an district chongqing china and the results had a mean absolute error mae of 2680 m3 d a root mean square error rmse of 3597 m3 d and a mean absolute percentage error mape of 1 461 compared with other models these results showed that the proposed model had better reliability and accuracy in a practical application udws forecasting scenario keywords sequence

du et al 2022 therefore meeting the water demand of the city is a top priority of the water supply system accurate forecasting of the urban daily water supply udws is one of the most effective ways to solve this issue and it can provide data reference for the reliability of water supply dispatching decisions du et al 2021 in reality many factors affect the changes in the udws such as the date e g workdays weekends and holidays climate e g temperature humidity and rainfall public policies e g water prices water resource protection plans and education and social and economic factors e g population household income and industrial structure brentan et al 2018 lan et al 2020 rezaali et al 2021 as a key feature of udws forecasting researchers have added the above exogenous variables to improve the forecast accuracy wong et al 2010 however adding too many exogenous variables increases the complexity of the model and the computational burden and may affect the performance of the forecasting model brooks and tobias 1996 orth et al 2015 in addition taking into account the daily forecast scale the udws fluctuates significantly with the date therefore in this study we considered only the date factor including weekdays and holidays in the past few decades scientists have proposed various methods for udws forecasting which can be divided into traditional statistical methods and machine learning methods gustavo et al 2019 traditional statistical methods use the linear relationship between the variables with some distribution assumptions in historical time series to establish models such as the autoregressive ar model smith 1988 autoregressive integrated moving average arima model sarah and heejun 2009 and nonlinear autoregressive nar model bata et al 2020 with the development of computer techniques researchers have found that traditional statistical methods have certain limitations in mapping highly complex historical time series and thus machine learning has become an effective candidate to address this issue machine learning models achieve a higher forecasting accuracy through repeated training learning simulation processes he et al 2022 such as the backpropagation neural network xue 2017 support vector machine lu et al 2020 gradient boosting machine xenochristou et al 2020 random forest villarin and rodriguez galiano 2019 and bayesian network magiera and froelich 2017 however these traditional machine learning models can only extract the shallow features from the original data and they have insufficient learning ability regarding the deep features du et al 2021 yu et al 2022a leading to low forecasting accuracy to resolve this issue deep learning has become a popular research topic in this field zhang et al 2022a deep learning combines low level features to form more abstract high level features to discover the distributed feature representation of the data bai et al 2018 pu et al 2022 typical deep learning models include the deep neural network sezen et al 2019 deep belief network dbn bai et al 2016 chu et al 2021 convolutional neural network tu et al 2021 stack autoencoder model li et al 2016 and the recurrent neural network rnn the latter of which is a network specially designed to deal with time dependent sequence information its core idea is to connect the previous information to the current task to solve the problem of gradient explosion or disappearance of the rnn researchers introduced the cell state based on the rnn and developed the long short term memory lstm model this model has since become the mainstream model in the field of time series forecasting such as forecasting runoff zuo et al 2020 wind speeds memarzadeh and keynia 2020 loads hu et al 2022 and stock prices lin et al 2022b inspired by human vision the attention mechanism am has become an important and effective means of improving the performance of neural networks its initial idea is to allocate more computing resources to the most significant information in the data yang et al 2021 and it was initially applied to machine translation luong et al 2015 in recent years it has been widely applied in fields such as fault diagnosis zhang et al 2022c image classification zhang et al 2021 and time series analysis niu et al 2022 kara 2022 lin et al 2022a however few relevant studies have used a combination of the am and lstm for udws forecasting in addition to improve the reliability performance and accuracy of data driven techniques composite models which integrate two or more approaches to exceed the performance of a single model zubaidi et al 2020 have gradually become a popular trend in time series analysis among them the idea of combined models based on decomposition reconstruction has become a popular research topic in the field of time series forecasting some of the more popular decomposition techniques are empirical mode decomposition emd zhang et al 2022d and various deformations huan et al 2018 prasad et al 2018 wang et al 2022 to effectively solve the problems of modal aliasing and the endpoint effect in emd li et al 2017 introduced time varying filtering tvf into emd to improve it they named this technique time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition tvfemd after decomposition the original data are further decomposed into multiple levels of information when there are too many decomposition levels the data features are completely decomposed but the modeling cost increases rapidly when the decomposition level is too small the data features are still fused which is not conducive to the feature learning of the forecasting model currently some scholars have focused on feature learning and direct modeling at each decomposition level pandey et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b but this method directly affects the modeling cost other scholars to balance the modeling cost and the demand for feature learning reconstruct the granularity of the feature information at each decomposition level before the modeling sun and wang 2018 yu et al 2022b this method can integrate the features of multiple decomposition levels and convert them into a new granularity resulting in an excellent feature learning performance in actual modeling operations inspired by the above research methods and applications in this study a new udws forecasting model with a sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting framework was developed first the tvfemd was used to decompose the original udws time series into multiple intrinsic mode functions imfs then fast fourier transformation fft and sample entropy se were applied for the secondary granularity reconstruction of imfs the fft was used for the first granularity reconstruction and the se was used for the second granularity reconstruction and various am improved lstms were established for different granularity forecasts which were integrated into the final udws forecasting results the main contributions of this paper are as follows a sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting framework is proposed for udws forecasting to improve the learning performance of the model on the fused features at a single scale the tvfemd method is applied for udws decomposition and a secondary granularity reconstruction model is designed for imf reconstruction

method for the first granularity reconstruction in the time frequency domain and the se method for the secondary granularity reconstruction in the entropy domain subsection 2 3 introduces the am lstm model for the time series regression subsection 2 4 summarizes the sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting framework and produces the proposed model 2 1 time varying filtering based empirical mode decomposition empirical mode decomposition emd is an adaptive decomposition method developed by huang et al 1998 which decomposes the signal according to the time scale characteristics of the data without setting any basis function in advance it can adaptively divide the given non stationary and nonlinear original signal x t into several intrinsic mode functions however due to the shortcomings of separation and intermittency the effect of separating similar frequencies is restricted and modal overlap is easily caused by noise interference both of which restrict the forecasting performance the tvfemd makes full use of the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency information adaptively designs the local cut off frequency performs time varying filtering of the given sequence and divides it into local high frequency components and local low frequency components to obtain imfs the execution process of the tvfemd is as follows step 1 conduct the hilbert transform on the udws data x t and record it as x t compute the momentary amplitude a t and momentary phase φ t of the udws data x t 1 a t x t 2 x t 2 2 φ t arctan x t x t step 2 determine the local maximum a t max and local minimum a t min of the momentary amplitude a t then interpolate the maximum point set and the minimum point set to obtain the curve of η 1 t versus η 2 t using eq 3 and eq 4 calculate instantaneous mean value σ 1 t and instantaneous envelope σ 2 t 3 σ 1 t η 1 t η 2 t 2 4 σ 2 t η 1 t η 2 t 2 step 3 compute the momentary frequency λ 1 t and λ 2 t among them μ 1 t can be estimated by interpolating a set of points λ t min a 2 t min while μ 2 t can be estimated by interpolating λ t max a 2 t max the corresponding mathematical expressions are as follows 5 λ 1 t μ 1 t 2 σ 1 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t μ 2 t 2 σ 1 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t 6 λ 2 t μ 1 t 2 σ 2 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t μ 2 t 2 σ 2 2 t 2 σ 1 t σ 2 t step 4 calculate the local cut off frequency λ bis t 7 λ bis t λ 1 t λ 2 t 2 step 5 readjust the local cut off frequency λ bis t to eliminate the intermittence problem step 6 calculate the signal h t using eq 8 take the extrema timings of h t as the knots to construct the time varying filter and perform b spline approximation filtering of x t the approximate result of which is m t 8 h t cos λ bis t d t step 7 when the stopping criterion θ t is met and θ t ξ x t is denoted as an intrinsic mode function otherwise let x t x t m t and repeat steps 1 6 the calculation formula for the stopping criterion θ t is as follows 9 θ t b loughlin t λ avg t where b loughlin t is the loughlin instantaneous bandwidth and λ avg t is the weighted average of the momentary frequencies the threshold ξ is set as 0 1 2 2 secondary granularity reconstruction method for the first granularity reconstruction the fft is used to transform each imf from the time domain to the frequency domain and the granularity reconstruction is carried out according to the frequency domain information of the imf reconstruction into high medium and low frequency because the high frequency information fluctuates dynamically and has a high degree of randomness imf features overlap so it is necessary to reconstruct the granularity of imfs contained in the high frequency information the secondary granularity reconstruction measures the time series complexity of the imf in the high frequency by calculating the se value and then it carries out granularity reconstruction after two correlation analysis steps the secondary granularity reconstruction proposed in this paper is realized the specific method is as follows 2 2 1 fast fourier transformation the fourier transform is a basic signal processing tool which can determine the frequency components of data the fast fourier transform is a fast algorithm of the discrete fourier transform dft the dft is improved by using periodicity and symmetry which greatly reduces the number of multiplications required for computer processing of the discrete fourier transform the fft reduces the time complexity of the dft from o n 2 to o n log n greatly improving the operation speed the fft algorithm is used to convert the data from the time domain to the frequency domain for analysis to extract the frequency domain information of the original signal and then to analyze the spectrum structure and changes in the signal which is conducive to the in depth analysis of the data assuming the acquired signal sequence f t the mathematical expression of the dft is as follows 10 f k t 0 t 1 f t e j 2 π t k t where f k is the frequency domain value f t is the time domain value t is the number of sampling points during the time frequency conversion and k 0 1 2 t 1 when t is an even number the dft calculation can be divided into odd and even parts eq 1 can be converted into the following formula 11 f k t t 2 1 f 2 t e j 4 π t k t e j 2 π t k t t 2 1 f 2 t 1 e j 4 π t k t the frequency domain information f k obtained through the dft can be inverted to obtain the original signal f t and its formula is as follows 12 f t 1 t t 0 t 1 f k e j 2 π t k t 2 2 2 sample entropy sample entropy is a time series complexity characterization parameter proposed by richman et al 2000 which can measure the probability of generating new patterns in the signal the greater the probability of generating a new pattern is the greater the complexity of the sequence is the advantage of the se method is that the calculation does not depend on the data length and has better consistency the method s calculation steps are as follows step i assuming that there is a time series x x 1 x 2 x n with length n construct x into an m dimensional vector 13 x i x i x i 1 x i m 1 i 1 2 n m 1 step ii define the distance between x i and x j as d x i x j which is the largest difference between their corresponding elements 14 d x i x j max k 0 m 1 x i k x j k i j step iii given the threshold r calculate the ratio of the number of d x i x j r to the total number of vectors n m and calculate its average value 15 b i m r n u m d x i x j r n m 16 b m r i 1 n m 1 b i m r n m 1 step iv increase the dimension to m 1 and repeat steps i iv to obtain b m 1 r in theory the se value of this sequence is calculated as follows 17 sampen m r lim n ln b m 1 r b m r when n is a finite value it can be estimated using the following formula 18 sampen m r n ln b m 1 r b m r where m is the embedded dimension r is the similarity tolerance and its selection range is 0 1 s t d 0 25 s t d std represents the standard deviation of the time series n is the length of the time series 2 3 integrated forecasting model 2 3 1 attention mechanism in cognitive science due to the bottleneck in information processing human beings selectively focus on only a part of the available information while ignoring other visible information by introducing the concept of the human brain into the field of computer science only some of the key information input is selected for processing to improve the processing efficiency this is called the attention mechanism am xiong et al 2022 to improve the regression performance of models and the interpretability of neural networks the am has developed rapidly in the field of neural network modeling especially in applications of the rnn and its variants the am helps to overcome shortcomings such as the performance degradation caused by the increase in the input length and the low computational efficiency caused by unreasonable input sequences in the deep learning model different weights are assigned to the extracted feature information through the am to highlight the important information the traditional am considers the previous state h h 1 h 2 h t and extracts the context vector v t from h where v t is the relevant information in the current time step luong et al 2015 v t is further integrated with the present state h t to yield the forecast 19 score h i h t f h i h t 20 α i softmax f h i h t exp f h i h t j 1 t exp f h j h t 21 v t i 1 t a i h i finally the udws forecast results in the next time step are obtained by inputting the key feature v t into the fully connected layer 2 3 2 long short term memory the deep learning algorithm based on the recurrent neural network rnn provides a new method for udws forecasting the long short term memory lstm as a special rnn introduces a gate mechanism to control the flow and loss of features to solve the problem of gradient disappearance or gradient explosion during long sequence training hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 due to its unique design structure the lstm is more sensitive to time series data and has a higher processing efficiency than the rnn liu et al 2021 the topological structure of the lstm network is shown in fig 1 the gated memory module unit is the core component of the lstm system s structure the gated memory module is used to replace the ordinary input neuron which is mainly realized through three gate logic namely a forget gate unit an input gate unit and an output gate unit the forget gate unit is used to control whether the historical information is forgotten the input gate unit is used to control whether the input information is valid and the output gate unit determines the specific output of the unit state to achieve dynamic memory the state information update equation of lstm network can be expressed as follows 22 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 23 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 24 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 25 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 26 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 27 h t o t tanh c t where f t i t and o t are the calculation results of forget gate unit input gate unit and output gate unit respectively c t is the cell state update value w and b are the weights and offsets corresponding to each control gate unit respectively σ and tanh represent sigmoid activation function and tanh activation function respectively h t is the state vector of the hidden layer at time t 2 3 3 am lstm model the am is added to the lstm model to enhance the ability to focus on the critical features in the long input sequences liu et al 2019 alizadeh et al 2021 to improve the forecasting ability of the lstm the structure of the am lstm is shown in fig 2 after the lstm extracts the long term dependency from the features its output is used as the input of the attention layer and the added attention layer automatically learns the importance of each hidden state yang et al 2021 the input vector x 1 x 2 x t is the characteristic vector of the udws the lstm model processes the input vector in the time steps and obtains the hidden layer state h 1 h 2 h t the am uses the neural network with softmax activation function to calculate the attention weight α i and then it assigns the attention weight α i to the corresponding hidden state h k and extracts the key feature vector v t via summation finally the key feature v t is input into the full connection layer to obtain the udws forecast results 2 4 proposed forecasting method to better forecast the udws we proposed a new deep learning forecast framework the framework includes seven stages fig 3 intuitively illustrates the overall workflow of the udws forecasting based on the sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting framework the modeling steps are summarized as follows stage a data acquisition the historical daily water supply data are collected from the waterworks in this paper the monitoring data from one water plant in chongqing china are investigated stage b sequence decomposition the tvfemd is used to decompose the original udws data to obtain imfs which are regarded as the abstract feature information of the udws stage c secondary granularity reconstruction in this stage all imfs are reconstructed to obtain a new feature expression in the first step the time frequency conversion of each imf is carried out according to the fft the main frequency value of each imf is calculated and it is reconstructed to obtain the high medium and low frequency granularities in the second step since the high frequency information fluctuates dynamically and has a high degree of randomness imf features overlap so it is necessary to reconstruct the granularity of imfs contained in the high frequency information the complexity of the time series is measured by calculating the se value of each imf the interval size of the complexity according to the formula calculated as follows δ s e max s e min n 2 where s e max and s e min are the maximum and minimum values of the calculated sample entropy respectively which are reconstructed into high1 high2 and high3 granularities in summary all imfs are reconstructed into high1 high2 high3 medium and low granularities in this stage stage d feature selection to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model in this paper we consider two date related factors that affect the changes in the uwds and we introduce them into the dataset as the input of the forecasting model in the next stage stage e input variable determination before inputting the data into the forecasting model first we divide the training set and testing set for each granularity and then we normalize the data finally we sample the data as the input variable of the forecasting model stage f construction of forecasting models five am lstm forecasting models are established for the high1 high2 high3 medium and low granularities stage g integration of forecasting results of different granularities the data for each granularity are input into the established am lstm model to obtain the forecast value and then the forecast value of each granularity is integrated to obtain the final forecast udws value 3 case study and data processing 3 1 research data description to verify the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper nan an district in the central urban area of chongqing china is taken as an example the time scale of the collected data is daily covering the period from 1 1 2018 to 12 31 2020 and including 1096 sample data the data are presented in fig 4 in this paper the date factor is further refined into holidays weekends workdays and each individual day of the week in the factors the holidays weekends holidays and weekends are represented by the number 0 and the workdays are represented by the number 1 the factor of each day of the week is represented by the numbers 1 7 and an example is shown in table 1 3 2 sampling process before inputting the characteristic data into the forecasting model it is necessary to sample the data to facilitate the learning of the forecasting model in the sampling process the time window method is used to process the time series and a fixed size window is used to slide on the time series data fig 5 the value in the window is the input vector of the model every time which points to the target value to be forecast in this paper one step forecasting is used and the target value is the real value that needs to be forecasted in the next time step the traditional sample processing method does not divide the training set and the testing set in advance and the sliding time window is directly placed on the entire time series for sampling this leads to a boundary effect in the samples that is the samples at the end of the training set and at the beginning of the testing set contain the same data to solve this problem we first divide the time series into a training set and testing set and then we use the sliding time windows for them to obtain the input and output samples for further explanation assuming that the length of the training set is m the length of the test set is n and the size of the sliding time window is t the numbers of forecastable samples in the training set and the test set are m t and n t respectively in this paper the size of the sliding time window is t 7 because the main exogenous variable considered in this paper is the date factor the weekly water supply fluctuates periodically over a short period and the number 7 represents the seven days of the week in addition when calculating the se in this paper the embedding dimension of its main parameters is also7 3 3 data normalization the standardized value is between 0 1 in this paper after dividing the dataset the data normalization of the training set and the testing set is conducted using the maximum and minimum values of the training set the data are normalized using the following formula 28 x i x x min x max x min where x i is the value of a single data point x min is the minimum value and x max is the maximum value 3 4 criteria for performance evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the model the following indicators are used to compare the models the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape the mae is used to measure the average absolute error between the forecast value and the real value which can better reflect the actual situation of the error of the forecast value the smaller the mae is the better the model is the mae is defined as follows 29 e mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where n is the length of the evaluated dataset and y i and y i are the i th forecast value and the observed value respectively the rmse is a typical evaluation indicator for regression models and it is used to measure the deviation between the forecast value and the observed value it describes the degree of dispersion and it is defined as follows 30 e rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 the mape can avoid the problem of error offset so it can accurately reflect the size of the actual error of the forecast the smaller the mape value is the better the forecast effect of the forecast model is and the better its accuracy is it is calculated as follows 31 e mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 4 results and discussion 4 1 sequence decomposition in this paper the tvfemd is used to decompose the original time series of the udws into imfs a total of 18 modes i e imf1 imf17 and the residual the decomposition results are shown in fig 6 the parameter settings are as follows bandwidth threshold 0 1 and b spline order 26 the results show that the data for imf1 imf5 change more violently than those for other modes with the strongest volatility and high frequency characteristics the fluctuation frequency of imf6 imf12 is lower than that of the high frequency but its fluctuation has certain periodic characteristics the frequency changes of imf13 imf17 and the residual are the weakest reflecting the trend of the udws during this period 4 2 secondary granularity reconstruction in the first granularity reconstruction the fft is used to conduct the time frequency conversion for each imf and then modal reconstruction is conducted according to the main frequency value of each imf the frequency domain diagram is presented in fig 7 the red circle in fig 7 denotes the target point the main frequency calculated according to the abscissa value is shown in table 2 the imfs are reconstructed into granularities using the main frequency value i e the high medium and low frequency it is noted that the interval division is determined according to the order of magnitude of the time frequency conversion value of each mode shown in table 2 the imfs contained in the combined granularities are presented in table 3 after the first granularity reconstruction the fluctuation frequency of the high frequency is significantly increased which means that imf features overlap in the fused high frequency therefore a secondary granularity reconstruction is required for the high frequency the se value is used to measure the complexity of the imf time series in the high frequency during the second granularity reconstruction with the main parameter settings presented in table 4 where std imf n is the standard deviation of the calculated imf data the se value of each imf after the calculation is presented in table 5 based on the proposed reconstruction method its interval is δ s e max s e min n 2 0 167 and the new granularity after the high frequency reconstruction is presented in table 6 in summary the granularity obtained from the original data after the secondary reconstruction of the data is presented in fig 8 in this part the number of imfs is reduced from 18 modes to five modes i e high1 high2 high3 medium and low which greatly improves the efficiency of the forecast modeling 4 3 performance of the proposed model after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the original data each granularity is divided into a training set and a testing set in which the training set accounts for 80 and the testing set accounts for 20 to train the model and output the forecast value the main hyper parameters of the am lstm forecasting model established for each set of granularity data are presented in table 7 the forecast performance of the am lstm for the five granularities is shown in fig 9 and the integrated results are shown in fig 10 the evaluation indices for each granularity forecasting result are presented in table 8 first based on the forecast curve in fig 9 a and b and the evaluation indicators in table 8 it can be seen that the secondary reconstruction data resulted in the am lstm having a strong forecasting performance and it could track the changes in the granularity with time second because the data in the high frequency including the high1 high2 and high3 granularities after the secondary reconstruction change dramatically the frequency is high there is less high frequency data than medium frequency data resulting in a higher mape in the high frequency data however based on the mae and rmse the forecast results are relatively ideal and their consistency with the real value curve is high finally by integrating the forecasting results of the granularity testing set in fig 10 to reflect the forecasting results of each granularity we found that the forecasting effect is sufficient with low error accumulation effect table 8 it is noted that the order of magnitude of testing set 10 5 is much higher than that of the error evaluation value maximum mae and rmse 103 combined consideration of mape 1 461 thereby the forecasting performance is ideal and acceptable based on the above analysis the model proposed in this paper has an excellent udws forecasting performance and has a strong description ability in detail in addition it is consistent with the real value curve of the udws in this region 4 4 comparative study to verify the superiority of the method proposed in this paper it is compared with other models table 9 describes the input data for each model in detail 4 4 1 superiority of attention mechanism to demonstrate that the am can improve the forecast ability of the lstm a single am lstm and a single lstm without tvfemd the original data and two date characteristics are used as the input characteristics of the forecasting model are designed in this section to forecast the udws the forecasting performances of the am lstm and lstm are tested using the testing dataset to demonstrate the improvement in the forecasting accuracy obtained using the am the main parameters of the two models are presented in table 10 and the forecasting results are presented in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 a that the forecast value curve obtained using the am lstm model plots above the forecast value curve obtained using the lstm model overall the two models can describe the changing trend of the udws in the testing set however in terms of the details the am lstm describes the variation range of the water supply better based on the scatter plots shown in fig 11 b and c and the absolute error shown in fig 11 d the forecast values of the am lstm are more concentrated than those of the lstm that is the am does improve the forecasting accuracy of the lstm model this is because the am makes up for the deficiency of the lstm s feature learning ability and enhances the regression ability of the lstm the forecasting performances of the models were evaluated using the evaluation indicators the results are as follows the mae rmse and mape of the am lstm forecasting model were 7437 m3 d 9402 m3 d and 4 105 respectively the mae rmse and mape of the lstm forecast model were 7667 m3 d 9598 m3 d and 4 154 respectively to further reflect the excellence of the am lstm model s forecasting performance radar charts of the forecasting performance evaluation indicators of the two models were drawn for visual comparison fig 12 the two models were used for modeling and forecasting and the calculated evaluation indicators were enclosed into two triangles the area of the triangle enclosed by the am lstm was smaller which shows that the am could mine the implicit relationship between the input features and the data to be forecasted and it reduced the forecasting error of the lstm the above findings demonstrate that combining the am with the lstm framework can improve the ability of the lstm to process input sequences therefore the am lstm is used as the backbone forecasting model in this paper 4 4 2 advantages of secondary granularity reconstruction of the original sequence in this paper the original data are decomposed using the tvfemd and the decomposed imfs are reconstructed to obtain the multi granularity characteristics of the water supply data regarding the effect of the secondary granularity reconstruction fig 8 a shows the time series curve after the first granularity reconstruction of the udws sequence via fft and fig 8 b shows the time series curve after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the high frequency granularity we compared the time series data forecast using the am lstm after the first granularity reconstruction and the secondary granularity reconstruction to confirm that the secondary reconstruction of the data can improve the forecasting performance of the model the main hyper parameters of each model are presented in table 11 the main hyper parameters of the tvfemd fft se am lstm are not repeated here and the specific conditions are presented in table 7 the forecasting results obtained are presented in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 a that in the forecasting model that uses the am lstm as the backbone the combined model without secondary granularity reconstruction tvfemd fft am lstm can only restore the trend of the udws and its ability to describe the details is weak the combined model tvfemd fft se am lstm after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the data improves the degree of reduction of the detailed changes in the udws to illustrate the forecasting performance of the two models more clearly the scatter plots in fig 13 b and 13 c and the absolute error plot in fig 13 e were drawn it can be seen that the values forecast by the combined forecasting model after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the original data are more concentrated while the values forecast by the combined model after the first granularity reconstruction of the data are more scattered this indicates that the original data after the secondary reconstruction have a significant impact on the regression ability of the model to further demonstrate the superiority of the secondary granularity reconstruction we use the lstm to forecast the testing dataset after the secondary granularity reconstruction fig 13 a d and e present the forecast value curve scatter plot and absolute error plot respectively as can be seen from these figures the secondary granularity reconstruction method has the same effect on the lstm that is it significantly improves the learning ability of the model and causes the model to learn more effectively to quantify the forecasting ability of each model the forecasting ability of each model was analyzed quantitatively and a radar chart of the error evaluation indices of the forecasting results of each model was drawn fig 14 the specific error evaluation indices of each model are presented in table 12 in fig 14 the forecasting accuracy of the model is determined according to the area of the triangle overall it can be seen that the area of the triangle of the model proposed in this paper is the smallest and it has a stronger regression ability the results of the comparative analysis are as follows 1 by comparing the forecasting results after the first granularity reconstruction and the secondary granularity reconstruction it was found that the area of the triangle enclosed by the combined model tvfemd fft am lstm after the first granularity reconstruction was the largest while the area of the triangle enclosed by the combined model tvfemd fft se am lstm after the secondary granularity reconstruction was the smallest it can be seen that the secondary granularity reconstruction method proposed in this paper can further explore the feature information of the udws and enhance the learning ability of the forecasting model 2 regarding the addition of the am for forecasting after the granularity reconstruction the area of the triangle enclosed by the combined model without the am tvfemd fft se lstm was larger than that enclosed by the combined model with am tvfemd fft se am lstm which confirms that the model with the am can still improve the forecasting accuracy after the granularity reconstruction it can be seen from table 12 that when the am lstm is used as the forecasting model the mape of the secondary reconstruction data of the forecasting model is 51 766 higher than that of the first granularity reconstruction data of the forecasting model after the secondary granularity reconstruction when using the am lstm and lstm for the forecasting the mapes of the two combined models are only 1 461 and 1 918 respectively and they are reduced by 64 409 and 53 828 respectively compared with the single am lstm and single lstm see section 4 4 1 therefore the granularity reconstruction method secondary granularity reconstruction proposed in this paper can reconstruct the data from the imf feature information better and make it easier for the forecasting model to learn improving the forecasting performance of the model after the secondary granularity reconstruction of the original udws data the lstm with the am has the strongest forecasting ability 5 conclusions accurate forecasting of the udws can enable the managers of urban water departments to forecast the future water supply information this paper proposed a new udws deep learning combined forecasting model with a sequence decomposition secondary granularity reconstruction integration forecasting framework the proposed model couples the tvfemd for sequence decomposition the fft time frequency transform in the first granularity reconstruction and se entropy domain probability estimation in the second granularity reconstruction for secondary granularity reconstruction and the am and lstm for integration forecasting the proposed model was used to successfully forecast the real udws in chongqing china all of the results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits the best forecasting performance and it is a powerful tool for the implementation of water management the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 through sequence decomposition the global features of the udws are represented locally and the important component information of the nonlinear time series is effectively extracted which reduces the complexity of the feature learning of subsequent forecasting models 2 through the secondary granularity reconstruction based on identifying the time frequency domain characteristics of each imf and the entropy domain probability estimation characteristics of each imf in the high frequency granularity the proposed model can fully extract the multi granularity feature data from the complex data this solves the problem of overlapping imf features in the high frequency improves the modeling efficiency makes it easier for the forecasting model to learn the implicit relationship between the data and reduces the calculation cost and cumulative forecasting error 3 the improved lstm with the am am lstm enables the am to optimize the weights of important features again in the model regression stage which can better capture the internal features of the input sequence and improve the model s forecasting performance in summary in this study the temporal modal features in the decomposition stage the time frequency features and entropy probability features in the secondary granularity reconstruction stage and the significant features of the limited information in the integration forecasting stage were comprehensively considered thus the proposed model achieved the best performance for udws forecasting in the future we will focus on the model s universality credit authorship

2407,unmanned aerial vehicle uav lidar has emerged as a viable approach to generate high resolution snow depth sd maps however implementing this technology in high elevation mountains is difficult and few studies have examined the sd on mountains in asia until now here we used uav lidar to estimate the sd on the maxian mountains along the eastern edge of high mountain asia to assess the reliability of this technology for obtaining sd distributions on a typical alpine periglacial geomorphology using lidar data from different periods i e 2020 10 19 2020 11 25 and 2021 04 08 and evenly distributed in situ measurements we obtained and validated sds for both shallow mean sd less than 15 cm and deep mean sd 15 cm snow conditions our results indicated that the quality of the lidar point cloud data met the requirements of the relevant specifications and the sd distribution map captured the spatial heterogeneity caused by the hummocks the multitemporal sds derived from lidar were all overestimated but the accuracy for shallow snow was better than that for deep snow the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae are 2 23 cm and 1 57 cm respectively for deep snow which were almost three times those of shallow snow the seasonal deformation of the hummock and manual sampling errors caused by the ice layer over the soil were the main factors affecting accuracy in contrast snow surface conditions played a minor role in the error estimators this study helps refine the use of uav lidar for sd estimation in similar environments keywords snow depth high elevation mountains uav lidar periglacial geomorphology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal snowmelt is the main supplement for regional runoff which is important for the water cycle agricultural development and water resource management barnett et al 2005 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 as one of the physical properties of snowpack snow depth sd is a critical parameter for quantitatively estimating the water storage in snowpack fattahi nafchi et al 2022 jonas et al 2009 traditional sd measurements heavily rely on in situ observations but a large portion of the global snowpack is located on inaccessible mountainous ranges making observations difficult conduct lievens et al 2019 in addition there is spatial variability in the snow distribution in high elevation mountain areas hence improving the observation accuracy of sd is of great significance for hydrological and meteorological studies at the watershed scale harder et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2020 remote sensing technology is usually used as an alternative way to obtain sd data passive microwave active microwave and light detection and ranging lidar technologies are the most widely used techniques for sd estimation nevertheless passive microwave technology suffers from coarse resolutions as well as signal saturation problems and is nearly unavailable in mountain areas active microwave technology can achieve high resolution retrieval but rugged mountainous terrain can cause geometric and radiometric distortions in the images moreover the penetrability of microwaves makes it difficult for existing methods to quantitatively distinguish soil and snow cover signals to achieve stable sd retrieval feng et al 2021 lidar as an emerging active sensor is widely used in sd estimation due to its flexible platform deployment capabilities i e terrestrial airborne and satellite lidar bhardwaj et al 2016a by measuring the travel time of a pulse that is transmitted back to the sensor lidar can directly obtain the high precision elevation information of a target the earliest research on this began in the early 21st century several researchers validated the accuracy of sd estimation under canopy cover using airborne lidar hopkinson et al 2001 currently studies have mostly focused on analyzing the sources of errors in sd estimation including the position and oriented system pos of the aircraft deems et al 2008 interpolation method and sampling resolution of digital surface models dsms bühler et al 2011 characteristics of snow deems et al 2013 and density of the canopy trujillo et al 2007 in addition some studies have used airborne lidar to measure sd and apply it to other fields such as hydrological exploration and avalanche prediction debeer and pomeroy 2009 jaboyedoff et al 2012 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 schöber et al 2014 on the ground based platforms lidar has made great progress in the sd estimation especially in improving complex terrain and subcanopy sd mapping hojatimalekshah et al 2021 schirmer et al 2011 on the satellite based platforms lidar has been preliminarily applied in sd estimation such as in estimating fresh snow thickness on sea ice and mountain glaciers bindschadler et al 2005 neuenschwander and pitts 2019 as the new generation of altimetry satellite icesat 2 has been launched its applicability for sd estimation and accuracy under different surface types have also been evaluated hu et al 2022 kwok and markus 2018 the above studies have contributed insightful knowledge and understanding of the estimation capability of lidar for sd on different platforms with the rapid development of inertial measurement units imu and global navigation satellite systems gnsss unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have been widely used to achieve sd estimation over small areas in recent years most studies have used the structure from motion sfm algorithm based on uav platforms to obtain sd distributions with high spatial resolution avanzi et al 2018 revuelto et al 2021a however the accuracy of this technique still relies on ground control points gcps with known coordinates even with the real time kinematics rtk module gaffey and bhardwaj 2020 a recent study by revuelto et al 2021b showed that the error in sd estimation increased threefold under poor lighting conditions when gcps were not used in contrast uav based lidar can generate high precision point clouds in real time regardless of lighting conditions and does not require gcps to solve registration problems between images bandini et al 2020 to date only a few studies have explored the application of uav lidar for sd estimation they have explored the effectiveness of lidar in mapping sd in open and forested terrain harder et al 2020 evaluated the ability of low cost lidar to estimate sd under forest and field land environments jacobs et al 2021 assessed its pre processing accuracy dharmadasa et al 2022 and explored its performance on steep forested slopes koutantou et al 2022 nevertheless the reliability of uav lidar for sd estimation over the alpine periglacial geomorphology in high mountain asia has not been systematically evaluated as a focus region for cryosphere science high mountain asia has the largest distribution of periglacial geomorphology outside of the polar regions cheng et al 2019 in fact some studies have been carried out with uav lidar for sd estimation in mountain regions for example koutantou et al 2021 compared the performance of uav lidar for mapping sd on flat and sloped forested terrain the current challenges in implementing this technique over mountain regions are summarized as follows first uav lidar requires a larger payload platform with additional battery packs compared to the simple flight configuration of uav sfm harder et al 2020 second national border restrictions inaccessibility in mountainous regions and adverse weather conditions make these surveys difficult to conduct bhardwaj et al 2016b finally there is a lack of in situ sd measurements with centimeter level accuracy to validate the accuracy jacobs et al 2021 this paper reports on a study in high mountain asia which to our knowledge is the first study that uses uav lidar technology for multitemporal sd estimation and validation in this region the objective of this study was twofold 1 to evaluate the quality of uav lidar point clouds on typical alpine periglacial geomorphology and 2 to validate the accuracy of multitemporal sd data and identify the sources of uncertainties in estimation more specifically we validated the data quality following the lidar point clouds specifications in addition we compared the sd distribution maps for different periods with varying sd conditions and used in situ sd measurements for validation according to well established accuracy metrics specifically we evenly established many fixed gcps in the study area before snowfall which reduced the manual error caused by repeated sampling finally comparisons and analyses of the agreement of the lidar derived products with the rtk measurements allowed us to explain various factors related to accuracy this study helps refine the use of uav lidar for sd estimation in similar environments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in the maxian mountain range 35 74 n 103 97 e in the eastern edge of high mountain asia fig 1 its altitude ranges from 1480 m to 3670 m wu et al 2021 in contrast to the surrounding landscape the environment of maxian mountain is similar to that of the qinghai tibet plateau xie et al 2013 according to continuous records of the observation sites from 2010 to 2020 the annual average temperature is 2 0 c to 0 7 c and the average annual precipitation is approximately 318 6 54 3 mm most of which is concentrated between may and september wu et al 2021 the orthomosaic and elevation of the study area are shown in fig 1 and the relatively flat terrain is an ideal test site for uav based lidar in addition the surface of the study area is covered with many perennial hummocks which is a typical periglacial geomorphology in high mountain asia these oddly shaped grass hills that are caused by freezing and expanding are a challenge for sd estimation 2 2 uav platforms data three flight tests were conducted in the study area on 2020 10 19 2020 11 25 and 2021 04 08 representing bare land shallow snow average sd less than 15 cm and deep snow average sd 15 cm conditions respectively fig 1a b and c notably the snowpack on maxian mountain is instantaneous with the snow season containing multiple periods of accumulation and melt therefore we surveyed the site immediately after each snow event occurred on 2020 11 25 and 2021 04 08 to avoid ground deformation caused by snowmelt in addition the flight and meteorological conditions were similar for each survey to ensure the same image acquisition conditions uav lidar data were collected through a rigel minivux 1uav laser scanner with a near infrared wavelength of 905 nm which is suitable for snow and ice terrain measurements we equipped the scanner on the dji matrice 600 pro uav platform with an applanix apx 15 inertial navigation system ins to provide integrated gnss imu data in addition we corrected the uav position using the coordinates provided by a unistrong g 990 base station uav orthomosaic was acquired by a cmos rgb camera sensor 1 in 20 mpx resolution equipped on the phantom 4 rtk uav platform in this study we used the orthomosaic as auxiliary data to further compare the sd maps obtained from lidar data at different periods at a flight altitude of 100 m from the surface the ground sampling distance gsd of the imagery was 0 25 m 2 3 rtk and in situ snow depth measurements due to the lack of identifiable features in seasonal snow covered environments 16 fixed gcps were evenly established in the study area before the snowfall event 2020 10 19 to achieve consistent geolocation and accuracy validation of the multitemporal uav data the artificial gcp consisted of a 0 5 0 5 m red mesh with a fixed metal pole in the middle to avoid positional changes during the winter surveys however many of these points were difficult to identify after the snowfall so the mesh at each metal pole was changed before each uav survey to minimize difficulties in interpreting the gcps in the imagery during the data processing phase a chcnav rtk was used to measure the three dimensional coordinates of the gcps and the precise location of the in situ sd sampling points with a horizontal accuracy in the range of 2 cm and a vertical accuracy in the range of 4 cm before each measurement we set up a reference station at the same location because the high quality signal in the study area was unavailable the geographic center coordinates of the gcps were obtained through the mobile station by constituting the carrier phase finally we used these points as ground truth to register multitemporal orthomosaic and validate the accuracy of the dsm generated from the lidar to validate the accuracy of the sd retrieval the sd was manually measured using a stainless metal ruler in the vicinity of the gcps the sd data were recorded at the most precise centimeter level at least five samples at each site were arranged in a cross pattern including a central point and four sampling points located approximately 40 cm from the center in ordinal directions additional samples were collected at gcps with undulating terrain to minimize error these measurements were carried out after each uav survey to avoid affecting the snow surface as much as possible we avoided creating footprints by walking on the snow during the measurements since that would attribute unnatural features to the snow and could bias the sd data obtained from the retrieval 3 methodology this section elaborates on the steps used to estimate and validate the sd from the uav lidar data the overall workflow of this study shown in fig 2 consists of four modules a data processing of uav image b quality assessment of lidar points c acquisition of sd maps and d validation based on in situ measurements 3 1 data processing of uav images 3 1 1 lidar processing associated geographic position and orientation data from the gnss imu module and several original data were processed using regel riprocess software first due to the lack of continuously operating reference stations cors we used gnss data from a manually erected base station within 3 km of the field sites in addition we processed the applanix apx 15 ins data into a smoothed best estimate of trajectory sbet file through the pospac software note that we performed the boresight calibration in the software which was essential for the accuracy of the sd estimation dharmadasa et al 2022 finally we synchronized the timing of the lidar return data with the ins data and obtained a geo referenced lidar point cloud in las format by coordinate conversion specifically the point cloud for the three flight surveys relied only on the processing capability of the ins we did not use gcps to register the multitemporal data which is more significant for the sd estimation of uav based lidar data jacobs et al 2021 lidar systems are often affected by low flying objects and scanner errors during data acquisition therefore we selected appropriate parameters in the commercial lidar360 software to remove noise and thus improve data quality subsequently we classified the lidar data into ground points and nonground points through an improved filtering algorithm finally we interpolated the lidar point cloud with the inverse distance weighting idw method to generate a dsm containing the surface snow information the raster sampling spacing was set to 0 25 0 25 m and the projection coordinate system was wgs84 utm zone 48 n epsg 32648 3 1 2 orthomosaic processing orthomosaics were processed with pix4dmapper which allows for fast processing of aerial images and provides an accurate assessment of the processing the processing involved four steps first we imported uav photographs and pos data from the study area and optimized the camera parameters indeed the pos data were obtained by postprocessing the antenna phase center apc position and imu of the phantom 4 rtk uav the second step was to check the quality of images and the third step was to import the gcps and align them to the tie points of the photographs specifically although the device supports rtk positioning we still used the gcps to correct the images due to the poor internet connection in these mountainous areas finally we obtained the aligned orthomosaic of the study area 3 2 quality assessment of lidar point cloud data high density lidar data usually have higher quality and accuracy than low density data asprs 2015 therefore the number distribution of the lidar point cloud density was used as a metric for data quality assessment in this study in addition a histogram of the original data was fitted with a gaussian model to analyze the dataset characteristics the closest registration between multitemporal images is fundamental for generating sd maps therefore we used the profile analysis function in the commercial lidar 360 software to verify the registration results regular artificial buildings were chosen as validation areas which allowed for a visual indication of the registration 3 3 acquisition of snow depth maps in this study we subtracted the dsm of the first flight from the dsm of flights 2 and 3 to obtain shallow and deep sd maps respectively specifically we used the commercial software arcgis to obtain sd distributions from two aligned georeferenced grids grid values of less than 0 m were masked as outliers since negative sds cannot occur in the study area furthermore to visually compare the shallow and deep sd distributions we used the same classification interval within the symbol system and compared the produced sd maps with the orthomosaic of the study area 3 4 validation based on in situ measurements the manually measured sds near the gcps were used as reference data for comparison with the lidar derived sds to assess the estimation accuracy the inevitable problem was that point scale snow conditions at the field sites did not always correspond to the raster scale conditions represented by the lidar data this phenomenon was pronounced in our study area which is dominated by hummocks to eliminate this deviation we collected multiple sd data around each gcp in addition to match the point values with the pixel values of the 0 25 0 25 m area we overlapped the dsm with the orthomosaic and extracted the raster values of the dsm based on the positions of the gcps in the orthomosaic the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae bias and normalized median absolute deviation nmad were calculated as the assessment metrics eberhard et al 2021 harder et al 2016 revuelto et al 2021b first we generated scatter plots of all the sample points of shallow and deep snow to reflect the dispersion in sd from the uav platform compared to the measured sd and used r2 to assess the correlation rmse mae and bias which reflect the distance between the expected values and true values are often used as metrics for uav based sd accuracy validation but these metrics may be too sensitive to a few measurement outliers therefore the nmad is calculated to provide a reliably accuracy measurement with a better robustness than the standard deviation höhle and höhle 2009 second we divided the sampled data based on the gcps 16 gcps acquired in section 2 3 to obtain accuracy metrics for each gcp this validation allowed us to examine the differences in accuracy at the different gcps 4 results 4 1 assessment of lidar point cloud quality a comparison of the surface density points count histograms derived from the lidar point cloud data at different periods is presented in fig 3 the histogram of individual lidar point clouds followed a gaussian distribution furthermore the mean surface density µ for the three data periods gradually decreased as the sd increased µ 224 32 210 82 and 129 10 points m2 however the minimum surface density among the obtained data still met the density requirements suggested by the u s geological survey usgs lidar specification heidemann 2012 as shown in fig 4 a the regular buildings in the study area were chosen for testing fig 4c shows a profile of a building we can observe the outline and height of a building acquired in different periods in addition good registration between lidar point clouds in different periods can be seen by overlapping the profiles it should be noted that the height of the ground point echoes sequentially decreased for deep snow shallow snow and bare land but the tops of the buildings were always at the same height this was because the snow was cleared from the roof immediately after each snowfall event fig 4b 4 2 snow depth distribution we separately produced shallow and deep sd maps for the entire study area along with the patch scale maps and the corresponding orthomosaic fig 5 the same symbol system same colors for division intervals was used to indicate sd values the entire study area was almost completely covered by snow with mean sd values of 12 7 cm and 26 2 cm for the shallow and deep snow maps respectively which are clearly contrasted in the figure fig 5a b although we excluded outliers there were almost no data gaps seen in the landscape scale sd map which indicated a good image sampling quality in addition the sd distribution had prominent spatial distribution characteristics clusters of high sd values corresponded to locations of ground collapse in the middle of the study area or depressions in the microtopography these locations spatially overlapped in the shallow and deep sd maps in particular some artificial features were visible in the sd map such as buildings roads and meteorological observation fields the patch scale maps exemplified new insights into the spatial heterogeneity of sd from high resolution maps the generated sd maps revealed a high degree of spatial heterogeneity at a short distance and the effect of hummocks were clearly observed fig 5c d comparison of the orthomosaic with the patch scale maps obtained during the same period could further explain the phenomenon of heterogeneity in the sd distribution a notable example was the black hummocks protruding from the surface in the orthomosaic fig 5e f which can be seen in the sd map 4 3 accuracy validation of snow depth based on in situ measurements linear regression method was performed to validate the accuracy of the sd that was calculated from the lidar data the results showed good agreement between the calculated and measured sd for both shallow and deep snow with r2 values of 0 90 and 0 85 respectively fig 6 however the validation metric indicated that the error was lower in the shallow snow than in the deep snow as shown in fig 6 the results of the assessment metrics for shallow snow were as follows rmse 0 68 mae 0 53 bias 0 33 and nmad 0 47 those for deep snow were as follows rmse 2 23 mae 1 57 bias 0 85 and nmad 1 48 in addition the 1 1 line showed that some of the sd data acquired by lidar were slightly higher than the measured values for both shallow and deep snow conditions fig 7 shows the boxplots of the assessment metrics generated from each gcp which revealed the spatial variability of the sampling points the assessment metrics of shallow snow had concentrated distributions compared to those for deep snow the rmse for deep snow showed a dispersed distribution with values ranging from 0 63 to 3 71 similarly the mae varied between 0 46 and 3 16 the bias varied between 0 64 and 3 16 and the nmad was between 0 31 and 3 68 these results are understandable because they can be influenced by many factors such as the weather conditions during the flight and manual observation errors for mountain areas observation tests in deep snow conditions presented more uncertainties relative to those in shallow snow 5 discussion 5 1 outlier distribution although the uav based multitemporal lidar sd estimation has good applicability and accuracy in high altitude mountains some outliers remained in the sd maps we marked the occurrence and location of these outliers in fig 8 a the value of the outliers was calculated on a 0 25 m resolution grid yellow and red represent the density of the outliers in shallow and deep snow distribution maps the darker the color the more outliers occur in that area the building facades and the edges of the point cloud data had a high number of outliers fig 8b c which was related to human activity and poor data at the edges furthermore as some researchers have pointed out data outliers are caused by objects that are greatly offset from the terrain whether through laser scanning or photogrammetry adams et al 2018 similar to our results there were significantly fewer outliers in the deep snow distribution than in the shallow snow because hummocks partially protrude above the surface in the shallow snow areas which caused many negative sd values fig 8d 5 2 uncertainties related to the accuracy 5 2 1 effect of snow surface on lidar lidar mainly uses the emitted and returned lidar beams to determine the three dimensional information of the target object hence the scattering properties of different features are important factors affecting the echoes when the lidar beam interacts with the snow surface the snow absorbs and reflects the laser beam therefore understanding the impact of the snow surface on lidar is critical to the accuracy of sd estimates while the effect of the snow surface on the estimation has been reported in several studies of lidar datasets e g deems et al 2013 perovich 2007 quantitative studies of its impact are still lacking in this study the surface elevation of gcps measured by rtk in snow free and snowy conditions were compared to dsms derived from the rigel minivux 1 uav lidar at the corresponding locations in particular we used rtk to measure as closely as possible to the snow surface to reduce the manual errors in snow conditions fig 9 shows the locations of the gcps and the scatter plots of their elevations generated from the rtk and lidar note that the data we used were collected only a month apart and the sampling environments were similar in geographic conditions except for snow cover the lidar product under snowy conditions still agreed well with the rtk derived data with rmse 0 271 mae 0 184 bias 0 083 and nmad 0 185 they were 1 5 cm 0 8 cm 2 4 cm and 3 cm higher respectively than the corresponding indicators under snow free conditions therefore we can conclude that snow has less of impact on the accuracy for the 905 nm wavelength lidar product the physical mechanism for this result is that snow has a high reflectance rate near the ir wavelength of 905 nm making it difficult for lasers to penetrate kokhanovsky 2022 kokhanovsky and zege 2004 an accurate measurement of the transmission distance of a laser beam through the snow is difficult to achieve giddings and lachapelle 1961 varsa et al 2021 most current studies assume that 80 of the reflected signal λ 905 nm is reflected away before it reaches snow at a depth of 2 cm thus the recorded data come from up to 1 cm from the top of snow surface perovich 2007 in agreement with our results the elevation generated from lidar was underestimated due to the beam penetrating only part of the snow surface 5 2 2 effect of soil surface freeze thaw cycles many perennial hummocks in the study area are formed by the local displacement of surface soil material due to seasonal frost penetration grab 2005a some studies have shown that there is seasonal deformation of hummocks with the soil freezing and forming an ice layer in the upper soil horizon during the winter months kim 2008 as shown in section 4 3 the positive bias indicates that the sd derived from the lidar is higher than the manual measurements in both shallow and deep snow conditions we attribute this phenomenon to the ice layer over the upper soil of the hummocks in the study area which makes it difficult to reach the soil surface with the metal ruler during manual measurements and thus underestimates the measured values a similar phenomenon was also recorded by dharmadasa et al 2022 who found a basal ice layer was present in the study area in contrast other studies found that the sd generated by lidar was underestimated compared to the observed values but the presence of an ice layer was not mentioned in those studies harder et al 2020 jacobs et al 2021 in addition the soil volume on the surface of a mound gradually expands as the freeze deepens freezing starts at the top of the hummock in early winter and the rate of freezing depends on the aspect of the mound according to the monitoring data the soil began to freeze in early october and thawed in the middle of april in our study area wu et al 2021 however thick snow has an insulating thermal effect and slows down the melting process grab 2005b therefore the deep snow estimates sampled on 2021 04 08 were more influenced by the seasonal deformation of the hummocks than were the shallow snow estimates sampled on 2020 11 25 5 3 implications for the snow depth estimation using lidar the major strength of this study is that we carried out this technique under representative periglacial geomorphology conditions and obtained multitemporal high resolution sd maps the snow distribution in the high mountains asia is distinct from that at high latitudes is dominated by high elevation features and has a clear vertical zonality smith and bookhagen 2018 our study will allow us to take the next step to achieve fine scale sd estimates in more alpine regions dominated by seasonal snow the sd data acquired by lidar not only serve as validation data for matched scale data e g sentinel 1 but also for basin scale hydrological modeling and natural hazard prediction the quality of the multitemporal point cloud is systematically evaluated at the same flight configuration our study showed that the point cloud density decreased with increasing snow depth thickness fig 3 this result was in agreement with those of harwin and lucieer 2012 and deems et al 2013 who found a high topographic variability and the absorption of the near infrared laser by the liquid water of the snow surface significantly reduced the return energy of the lidar thereby decreasing the point cloud density the dense point cloud allows the mapping of the sd distribution at a finer scale in our dataset the deep snow data were obtained under warmer conditions 2021 04 08 that is a small amount of liquid water was already present on its surface however the average point cloud density was still 129 10 points m2 this means that the quality of the point cloud satisfies the sd estimation in a periglacial geomorphologic area under wet snow conditions in addition the registration between multitemporal datasets was the basis for estimation due to the poor signal in the study area we completed the calibration and postprocessing of the data using a physical base station gnss receiver working during the flight in agreement with previous studies multitemporal point cloud data were still well aligned without using gcps currier et al 2019 harder et al 2020 different from previous studies we verified the accuracy of multitemporal sd data using in situ measurements at fixed locations which is very difficult to implement in alpine regions koutantou et al 2022 not only is it difficult to ensure that the metal pole used to fix the gcp does not shift during repeating surveys but it is also challenging to make each sampling point correspond as closely as possible to the centimeter level sd distribution map therefore we permanently installed a large number of gcps evenly over the study area to minimize geolocation errors meanwhile we used rtk devices and orthophotos acquired during the same period to obtain the precise locations of the artificial sampling points the mae of the estimated sd compared with the in situ measured sd was 0 53 and 1 57 cm for shallow and deep snow conditions respectively and the rmse was 0 68 and 2 23 cm respectively this result is similar to that of jacobs et al 2021 who measured a mae of 0 96 cm and a rmse of 1 22 cm in fields with sds of less than 20 cm verifying the accuracy in different periods within the same area contributes to an understanding of the continuous mapping of alpine regions thereby enabling the entire process of snow accumulation to be tracked at the basin scale 5 4 challenges several factors make the application of uav based lidar techniques in alpine regions challenging first the high wind speed and low temperature conditions shorten the endurance of the uav resulting in a limited spatial coverage in this study we spent nearly 1 h mapping an area of 0 3 km2 many studies emphasize that increasing the flight altitude helps to extend the survey coverage of lidar clark et al 2011 therefore developing the most reasonable flight plan while maintaining the point cloud density required for snow mapping is an important consideration for future research in addition we maintained a relatively constant flight altitude due to the small height differences in the study area nevertheless using this technology in areas with huge differences in altitude requires a flight at variable altitudes which is undoubtedly a huge challenge surveys such as those conducted by koutantou et al 2022 have shown that the point cloud data still have strip misalignment even after post processed kinematic ppk correction when changing the flight altitude based on the above results additional studies are needed to explore the capability of uav based lidar in areas with high altitude differences 6 conclusions this study is the first attempt to estimate and validate multitemporal sd using uav lidar in a representative region of high mountain asia with the aim of evaluating the reliability of this technique to obtain the sd distribution in a periglacial geomorphology this study helps refine our strategy for experimental deployments in similar environments based on these experimental results the main conclusions can be summarized as follows first the uav lidar point clouds obtained on an alpine periglacial geomorphology with varying periods have a good quality and meet the requirements of the relevant specifications on the one hand the average surface density decreased with increasing sd due to the absorption of the near infrared laser by liquid water on the snow surface but the lowest density 129 10 points m2 still allowed for high precision sd estimation on the other hand multitemporal lidar point clouds still achieved good registration without using gcps second the spatial heterogeneity caused by the hummocks could be captured in the high resolution sd map compared to the in situ measurements obtained near the gcps at the fixed locations we found that the sd derived from lidar was slightly overestimated finally the snow surface conditions played a minor role in the error estimators which caused the results to be slightly underestimated due to partial penetration of the laser beam in contrast landform conditions especially hummock seasonal deformation and manual sampling errors caused by the ice layer over the soil were the main factors affecting accuracy specifically the rmse and mae in deep snow conditions were 2 23 cm and 1 57 cm respectively which were almost three times higher than those in shallow snow in general our study will allow us to take the next step to achieve fine scale sd estimates in more alpine regions that are dominated by seasonal snow further research should be undertaken to explore how to develop the most reasonable flight plan while maintaining the point cloud density required for snow mapping in addition the application of this technique in areas with large altitude differences should be considered for example the terrain follow mode of uavs can be used to perform sd estimation for valleys or mountain peaks funding this

2407,unmanned aerial vehicle uav lidar has emerged as a viable approach to generate high resolution snow depth sd maps however implementing this technology in high elevation mountains is difficult and few studies have examined the sd on mountains in asia until now here we used uav lidar to estimate the sd on the maxian mountains along the eastern edge of high mountain asia to assess the reliability of this technology for obtaining sd distributions on a typical alpine periglacial geomorphology using lidar data from different periods i e 2020 10 19 2020 11 25 and 2021 04 08 and evenly distributed in situ measurements we obtained and validated sds for both shallow mean sd less than 15 cm and deep mean sd 15 cm snow conditions our results indicated that the quality of the lidar point cloud data met the requirements of the relevant specifications and the sd distribution map captured the spatial heterogeneity caused by the hummocks the multitemporal sds derived from lidar were all overestimated but the accuracy for shallow snow was better than that for deep snow the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae are 2 23 cm and 1 57 cm respectively for deep snow which were almost three times those of shallow snow the seasonal deformation of the hummock and manual sampling errors caused by the ice layer over the soil were the main factors affecting accuracy in contrast snow surface conditions played a minor role in the error estimators this study helps refine the use of uav lidar for sd estimation in similar environments keywords snow depth high elevation mountains uav lidar periglacial geomorphology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal snowmelt is the main supplement for regional runoff which is important for the water cycle agricultural development and water resource management barnett et al 2005 fatahi nafchi et al 2021 as one of the physical properties of snowpack snow depth sd is a critical parameter for quantitatively estimating the water storage in snowpack fattahi nafchi et al 2022 jonas et al 2009 traditional sd measurements heavily rely on in situ observations but a large portion of the global snowpack is located on inaccessible mountainous ranges making observations difficult conduct lievens et al 2019 in addition there is spatial variability in the snow distribution in high elevation mountain areas hence improving the observation accuracy of sd is of great significance for hydrological and meteorological studies at the watershed scale harder et al 2020 talebmorad et al 2020 remote sensing technology is usually used as an alternative way to obtain sd data passive microwave active microwave and light detection and ranging lidar technologies are the most widely used techniques for sd estimation nevertheless passive microwave technology suffers from coarse resolutions as well as signal saturation problems and is nearly unavailable in mountain areas active microwave technology can achieve high resolution retrieval but rugged mountainous terrain can cause geometric and radiometric distortions in the images moreover the penetrability of microwaves makes it difficult for existing methods to quantitatively distinguish soil and snow cover signals to achieve stable sd retrieval feng et al 2021 lidar as an emerging active sensor is widely used in sd estimation due to its flexible platform deployment capabilities i e terrestrial airborne and satellite lidar bhardwaj et al 2016a by measuring the travel time of a pulse that is transmitted back to the sensor lidar can directly obtain the high precision elevation information of a target the earliest research on this began in the early 21st century several researchers validated the accuracy of sd estimation under canopy cover using airborne lidar hopkinson et al 2001 currently studies have mostly focused on analyzing the sources of errors in sd estimation including the position and oriented system pos of the aircraft deems et al 2008 interpolation method and sampling resolution of digital surface models dsms bühler et al 2011 characteristics of snow deems et al 2013 and density of the canopy trujillo et al 2007 in addition some studies have used airborne lidar to measure sd and apply it to other fields such as hydrological exploration and avalanche prediction debeer and pomeroy 2009 jaboyedoff et al 2012 ostad ali askari and shayan 2021 schöber et al 2014 on the ground based platforms lidar has made great progress in the sd estimation especially in improving complex terrain and subcanopy sd mapping hojatimalekshah et al 2021 schirmer et al 2011 on the satellite based platforms lidar has been preliminarily applied in sd estimation such as in estimating fresh snow thickness on sea ice and mountain glaciers bindschadler et al 2005 neuenschwander and pitts 2019 as the new generation of altimetry satellite icesat 2 has been launched its applicability for sd estimation and accuracy under different surface types have also been evaluated hu et al 2022 kwok and markus 2018 the above studies have contributed insightful knowledge and understanding of the estimation capability of lidar for sd on different platforms with the rapid development of inertial measurement units imu and global navigation satellite systems gnsss unmanned aerial vehicles uavs have been widely used to achieve sd estimation over small areas in recent years most studies have used the structure from motion sfm algorithm based on uav platforms to obtain sd distributions with high spatial resolution avanzi et al 2018 revuelto et al 2021a however the accuracy of this technique still relies on ground control points gcps with known coordinates even with the real time kinematics rtk module gaffey and bhardwaj 2020 a recent study by revuelto et al 2021b showed that the error in sd estimation increased threefold under poor lighting conditions when gcps were not used in contrast uav based lidar can generate high precision point clouds in real time regardless of lighting conditions and does not require gcps to solve registration problems between images bandini et al 2020 to date only a few studies have explored the application of uav lidar for sd estimation they have explored the effectiveness of lidar in mapping sd in open and forested terrain harder et al 2020 evaluated the ability of low cost lidar to estimate sd under forest and field land environments jacobs et al 2021 assessed its pre processing accuracy dharmadasa et al 2022 and explored its performance on steep forested slopes koutantou et al 2022 nevertheless the reliability of uav lidar for sd estimation over the alpine periglacial geomorphology in high mountain asia has not been systematically evaluated as a focus region for cryosphere science high mountain asia has the largest distribution of periglacial geomorphology outside of the polar regions cheng et al 2019 in fact some studies have been carried out with uav lidar for sd estimation in mountain regions for example koutantou et al 2021 compared the performance of uav lidar for mapping sd on flat and sloped forested terrain the current challenges in implementing this technique over mountain regions are summarized as follows first uav lidar requires a larger payload platform with additional battery packs compared to the simple flight configuration of uav sfm harder et al 2020 second national border restrictions inaccessibility in mountainous regions and adverse weather conditions make these surveys difficult to conduct bhardwaj et al 2016b finally there is a lack of in situ sd measurements with centimeter level accuracy to validate the accuracy jacobs et al 2021 this paper reports on a study in high mountain asia which to our knowledge is the first study that uses uav lidar technology for multitemporal sd estimation and validation in this region the objective of this study was twofold 1 to evaluate the quality of uav lidar point clouds on typical alpine periglacial geomorphology and 2 to validate the accuracy of multitemporal sd data and identify the sources of uncertainties in estimation more specifically we validated the data quality following the lidar point clouds specifications in addition we compared the sd distribution maps for different periods with varying sd conditions and used in situ sd measurements for validation according to well established accuracy metrics specifically we evenly established many fixed gcps in the study area before snowfall which reduced the manual error caused by repeated sampling finally comparisons and analyses of the agreement of the lidar derived products with the rtk measurements allowed us to explain various factors related to accuracy this study helps refine the use of uav lidar for sd estimation in similar environments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is located in the maxian mountain range 35 74 n 103 97 e in the eastern edge of high mountain asia fig 1 its altitude ranges from 1480 m to 3670 m wu et al 2021 in contrast to the surrounding landscape the environment of maxian mountain is similar to that of the qinghai tibet plateau xie et al 2013 according to continuous records of the observation sites from 2010 to 2020 the annual average temperature is 2 0 c to 0 7 c and the average annual precipitation is approximately 318 6 54 3 mm most of which is concentrated between may and september wu et al 2021 the orthomosaic and elevation of the study area are shown in fig 1 and the relatively flat terrain is an ideal test site for uav based lidar in addition the surface of the study area is covered with many perennial hummocks which is a typical periglacial geomorphology in high mountain asia these oddly shaped grass hills that are caused by freezing and expanding are a challenge for sd estimation 2 2 uav platforms data three flight tests were conducted in the study area on 2020 10 19 2020 11 25 and 2021 04 08 representing bare land shallow snow average sd less than 15 cm and deep snow average sd 15 cm conditions respectively fig 1a b and c notably the snowpack on maxian mountain is instantaneous with the snow season containing multiple periods of accumulation and melt therefore we surveyed the site immediately after each snow event occurred on 2020 11 25 and 2021 04 08 to avoid ground deformation caused by snowmelt in addition the flight and meteorological conditions were similar for each survey to ensure the same image acquisition conditions uav lidar data were collected through a rigel minivux 1uav laser scanner with a near infrared wavelength of 905 nm which is suitable for snow and ice terrain measurements we equipped the scanner on the dji matrice 600 pro uav platform with an applanix apx 15 inertial navigation system ins to provide integrated gnss imu data in addition we corrected the uav position using the coordinates provided by a unistrong g 990 base station uav orthomosaic was acquired by a cmos rgb camera sensor 1 in 20 mpx resolution equipped on the phantom 4 rtk uav platform in this study we used the orthomosaic as auxiliary data to further compare the sd maps obtained from lidar data at different periods at a flight altitude of 100 m from the surface the ground sampling distance gsd of the imagery was 0 25 m 2 3 rtk and in situ snow depth measurements due to the lack of identifiable features in seasonal snow covered environments 16 fixed gcps were evenly established in the study area before the snowfall event 2020 10 19 to achieve consistent geolocation and accuracy validation of the multitemporal uav data the artificial gcp consisted of a 0 5 0 5 m red mesh with a fixed metal pole in the middle to avoid positional changes during the winter surveys however many of these points were difficult to identify after the snowfall so the mesh at each metal pole was changed before each uav survey to minimize difficulties in interpreting the gcps in the imagery during the data processing phase a chcnav rtk was used to measure the three dimensional coordinates of the gcps and the precise location of the in situ sd sampling points with a horizontal accuracy in the range of 2 cm and a vertical accuracy in the range of 4 cm before each measurement we set up a reference station at the same location because the high quality signal in the study area was unavailable the geographic center coordinates of the gcps were obtained through the mobile station by constituting the carrier phase finally we used these points as ground truth to register multitemporal orthomosaic and validate the accuracy of the dsm generated from the lidar to validate the accuracy of the sd retrieval the sd was manually measured using a stainless metal ruler in the vicinity of the gcps the sd data were recorded at the most precise centimeter level at least five samples at each site were arranged in a cross pattern including a central point and four sampling points located approximately 40 cm from the center in ordinal directions additional samples were collected at gcps with undulating terrain to minimize error these measurements were carried out after each uav survey to avoid affecting the snow surface as much as possible we avoided creating footprints by walking on the snow during the measurements since that would attribute unnatural features to the snow and could bias the sd data obtained from the retrieval 3 methodology this section elaborates on the steps used to estimate and validate the sd from the uav lidar data the overall workflow of this study shown in fig 2 consists of four modules a data processing of uav image b quality assessment of lidar points c acquisition of sd maps and d validation based on in situ measurements 3 1 data processing of uav images 3 1 1 lidar processing associated geographic position and orientation data from the gnss imu module and several original data were processed using regel riprocess software first due to the lack of continuously operating reference stations cors we used gnss data from a manually erected base station within 3 km of the field sites in addition we processed the applanix apx 15 ins data into a smoothed best estimate of trajectory sbet file through the pospac software note that we performed the boresight calibration in the software which was essential for the accuracy of the sd estimation dharmadasa et al 2022 finally we synchronized the timing of the lidar return data with the ins data and obtained a geo referenced lidar point cloud in las format by coordinate conversion specifically the point cloud for the three flight surveys relied only on the processing capability of the ins we did not use gcps to register the multitemporal data which is more significant for the sd estimation of uav based lidar data jacobs et al 2021 lidar systems are often affected by low flying objects and scanner errors during data acquisition therefore we selected appropriate parameters in the commercial lidar360 software to remove noise and thus improve data quality subsequently we classified the lidar data into ground points and nonground points through an improved filtering algorithm finally we interpolated the lidar point cloud with the inverse distance weighting idw method to generate a dsm containing the surface snow information the raster sampling spacing was set to 0 25 0 25 m and the projection coordinate system was wgs84 utm zone 48 n epsg 32648 3 1 2 orthomosaic processing orthomosaics were processed with pix4dmapper which allows for fast processing of aerial images and provides an accurate assessment of the processing the processing involved four steps first we imported uav photographs and pos data from the study area and optimized the camera parameters indeed the pos data were obtained by postprocessing the antenna phase center apc position and imu of the phantom 4 rtk uav the second step was to check the quality of images and the third step was to import the gcps and align them to the tie points of the photographs specifically although the device supports rtk positioning we still used the gcps to correct the images due to the poor internet connection in these mountainous areas finally we obtained the aligned orthomosaic of the study area 3 2 quality assessment of lidar point cloud data high density lidar data usually have higher quality and accuracy than low density data asprs 2015 therefore the number distribution of the lidar point cloud density was used as a metric for data quality assessment in this study in addition a histogram of the original data was fitted with a gaussian model to analyze the dataset characteristics the closest registration between multitemporal images is fundamental for generating sd maps therefore we used the profile analysis function in the commercial lidar 360 software to verify the registration results regular artificial buildings were chosen as validation areas which allowed for a visual indication of the registration 3 3 acquisition of snow depth maps in this study we subtracted the dsm of the first flight from the dsm of flights 2 and 3 to obtain shallow and deep sd maps respectively specifically we used the commercial software arcgis to obtain sd distributions from two aligned georeferenced grids grid values of less than 0 m were masked as outliers since negative sds cannot occur in the study area furthermore to visually compare the shallow and deep sd distributions we used the same classification interval within the symbol system and compared the produced sd maps with the orthomosaic of the study area 3 4 validation based on in situ measurements the manually measured sds near the gcps were used as reference data for comparison with the lidar derived sds to assess the estimation accuracy the inevitable problem was that point scale snow conditions at the field sites did not always correspond to the raster scale conditions represented by the lidar data this phenomenon was pronounced in our study area which is dominated by hummocks to eliminate this deviation we collected multiple sd data around each gcp in addition to match the point values with the pixel values of the 0 25 0 25 m area we overlapped the dsm with the orthomosaic and extracted the raster values of the dsm based on the positions of the gcps in the orthomosaic the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae bias and normalized median absolute deviation nmad were calculated as the assessment metrics eberhard et al 2021 harder et al 2016 revuelto et al 2021b first we generated scatter plots of all the sample points of shallow and deep snow to reflect the dispersion in sd from the uav platform compared to the measured sd and used r2 to assess the correlation rmse mae and bias which reflect the distance between the expected values and true values are often used as metrics for uav based sd accuracy validation but these metrics may be too sensitive to a few measurement outliers therefore the nmad is calculated to provide a reliably accuracy measurement with a better robustness than the standard deviation höhle and höhle 2009 second we divided the sampled data based on the gcps 16 gcps acquired in section 2 3 to obtain accuracy metrics for each gcp this validation allowed us to examine the differences in accuracy at the different gcps 4 results 4 1 assessment of lidar point cloud quality a comparison of the surface density points count histograms derived from the lidar point cloud data at different periods is presented in fig 3 the histogram of individual lidar point clouds followed a gaussian distribution furthermore the mean surface density µ for the three data periods gradually decreased as the sd increased µ 224 32 210 82 and 129 10 points m2 however the minimum surface density among the obtained data still met the density requirements suggested by the u s geological survey usgs lidar specification heidemann 2012 as shown in fig 4 a the regular buildings in the study area were chosen for testing fig 4c shows a profile of a building we can observe the outline and height of a building acquired in different periods in addition good registration between lidar point clouds in different periods can be seen by overlapping the profiles it should be noted that the height of the ground point echoes sequentially decreased for deep snow shallow snow and bare land but the tops of the buildings were always at the same height this was because the snow was cleared from the roof immediately after each snowfall event fig 4b 4 2 snow depth distribution we separately produced shallow and deep sd maps for the entire study area along with the patch scale maps and the corresponding orthomosaic fig 5 the same symbol system same colors for division intervals was used to indicate sd values the entire study area was almost completely covered by snow with mean sd values of 12 7 cm and 26 2 cm for the shallow and deep snow maps respectively which are clearly contrasted in the figure fig 5a b although we excluded outliers there were almost no data gaps seen in the landscape scale sd map which indicated a good image sampling quality in addition the sd distribution had prominent spatial distribution characteristics clusters of high sd values corresponded to locations of ground collapse in the middle of the study area or depressions in the microtopography these locations spatially overlapped in the shallow and deep sd maps in particular some artificial features were visible in the sd map such as buildings roads and meteorological observation fields the patch scale maps exemplified new insights into the spatial heterogeneity of sd from high resolution maps the generated sd maps revealed a high degree of spatial heterogeneity at a short distance and the effect of hummocks were clearly observed fig 5c d comparison of the orthomosaic with the patch scale maps obtained during the same period could further explain the phenomenon of heterogeneity in the sd distribution a notable example was the black hummocks protruding from the surface in the orthomosaic fig 5e f which can be seen in the sd map 4 3 accuracy validation of snow depth based on in situ measurements linear regression method was performed to validate the accuracy of the sd that was calculated from the lidar data the results showed good agreement between the calculated and measured sd for both shallow and deep snow with r2 values of 0 90 and 0 85 respectively fig 6 however the validation metric indicated that the error was lower in the shallow snow than in the deep snow as shown in fig 6 the results of the assessment metrics for shallow snow were as follows rmse 0 68 mae 0 53 bias 0 33 and nmad 0 47 those for deep snow were as follows rmse 2 23 mae 1 57 bias 0 85 and nmad 1 48 in addition the 1 1 line showed that some of the sd data acquired by lidar were slightly higher than the measured values for both shallow and deep snow conditions fig 7 shows the boxplots of the assessment metrics generated from each gcp which revealed the spatial variability of the sampling points the assessment metrics of shallow snow had concentrated distributions compared to those for deep snow the rmse for deep snow showed a dispersed distribution with values ranging from 0 63 to 3 71 similarly the mae varied between 0 46 and 3 16 the bias varied between 0 64 and 3 16 and the nmad was between 0 31 and 3 68 these results are understandable because they can be influenced by many factors such as the weather conditions during the flight and manual observation errors for mountain areas observation tests in deep snow conditions presented more uncertainties relative to those in shallow snow 5 discussion 5 1 outlier distribution although the uav based multitemporal lidar sd estimation has good applicability and accuracy in high altitude mountains some outliers remained in the sd maps we marked the occurrence and location of these outliers in fig 8 a the value of the outliers was calculated on a 0 25 m resolution grid yellow and red represent the density of the outliers in shallow and deep snow distribution maps the darker the color the more outliers occur in that area the building facades and the edges of the point cloud data had a high number of outliers fig 8b c which was related to human activity and poor data at the edges furthermore as some researchers have pointed out data outliers are caused by objects that are greatly offset from the terrain whether through laser scanning or photogrammetry adams et al 2018 similar to our results there were significantly fewer outliers in the deep snow distribution than in the shallow snow because hummocks partially protrude above the surface in the shallow snow areas which caused many negative sd values fig 8d 5 2 uncertainties related to the accuracy 5 2 1 effect of snow surface on lidar lidar mainly uses the emitted and returned lidar beams to determine the three dimensional information of the target object hence the scattering properties of different features are important factors affecting the echoes when the lidar beam interacts with the snow surface the snow absorbs and reflects the laser beam therefore understanding the impact of the snow surface on lidar is critical to the accuracy of sd estimates while the effect of the snow surface on the estimation has been reported in several studies of lidar datasets e g deems et al 2013 perovich 2007 quantitative studies of its impact are still lacking in this study the surface elevation of gcps measured by rtk in snow free and snowy conditions were compared to dsms derived from the rigel minivux 1 uav lidar at the corresponding locations in particular we used rtk to measure as closely as possible to the snow surface to reduce the manual errors in snow conditions fig 9 shows the locations of the gcps and the scatter plots of their elevations generated from the rtk and lidar note that the data we used were collected only a month apart and the sampling environments were similar in geographic conditions except for snow cover the lidar product under snowy conditions still agreed well with the rtk derived data with rmse 0 271 mae 0 184 bias 0 083 and nmad 0 185 they were 1 5 cm 0 8 cm 2 4 cm and 3 cm higher respectively than the corresponding indicators under snow free conditions therefore we can conclude that snow has less of impact on the accuracy for the 905 nm wavelength lidar product the physical mechanism for this result is that snow has a high reflectance rate near the ir wavelength of 905 nm making it difficult for lasers to penetrate kokhanovsky 2022 kokhanovsky and zege 2004 an accurate measurement of the transmission distance of a laser beam through the snow is difficult to achieve giddings and lachapelle 1961 varsa et al 2021 most current studies assume that 80 of the reflected signal λ 905 nm is reflected away before it reaches snow at a depth of 2 cm thus the recorded data come from up to 1 cm from the top of snow surface perovich 2007 in agreement with our results the elevation generated from lidar was underestimated due to the beam penetrating only part of the snow surface 5 2 2 effect of soil surface freeze thaw cycles many perennial hummocks in the study area are formed by the local displacement of surface soil material due to seasonal frost penetration grab 2005a some studies have shown that there is seasonal deformation of hummocks with the soil freezing and forming an ice layer in the upper soil horizon during the winter months kim 2008 as shown in section 4 3 the positive bias indicates that the sd derived from the lidar is higher than the manual measurements in both shallow and deep snow conditions we attribute this phenomenon to the ice layer over the upper soil of the hummocks in the study area which makes it difficult to reach the soil surface with the metal ruler during manual measurements and thus underestimates the measured values a similar phenomenon was also recorded by dharmadasa et al 2022 who found a basal ice layer was present in the study area in contrast other studies found that the sd generated by lidar was underestimated compared to the observed values but the presence of an ice layer was not mentioned in those studies harder et al 2020 jacobs et al 2021 in addition the soil volume on the surface of a mound gradually expands as the freeze deepens freezing starts at the top of the hummock in early winter and the rate of freezing depends on the aspect of the mound according to the monitoring data the soil began to freeze in early october and thawed in the middle of april in our study area wu et al 2021 however thick snow has an insulating thermal effect and slows down the melting process grab 2005b therefore the deep snow estimates sampled on 2021 04 08 were more influenced by the seasonal deformation of the hummocks than were the shallow snow estimates sampled on 2020 11 25 5 3 implications for the snow depth estimation using lidar the major strength of this study is that we carried out this technique under representative periglacial geomorphology conditions and obtained multitemporal high resolution sd maps the snow distribution in the high mountains asia is distinct from that at high latitudes is dominated by high elevation features and has a clear vertical zonality smith and bookhagen 2018 our study will allow us to take the next step to achieve fine scale sd estimates in more alpine regions dominated by seasonal snow the sd data acquired by lidar not only serve as validation data for matched scale data e g sentinel 1 but also for basin scale hydrological modeling and natural hazard prediction the quality of the multitemporal point cloud is systematically evaluated at the same flight configuration our study showed that the point cloud density decreased with increasing snow depth thickness fig 3 this result was in agreement with those of harwin and lucieer 2012 and deems et al 2013 who found a high topographic variability and the absorption of the near infrared laser by the liquid water of the snow surface significantly reduced the return energy of the lidar thereby decreasing the point cloud density the dense point cloud allows the mapping of the sd distribution at a finer scale in our dataset the deep snow data were obtained under warmer conditions 2021 04 08 that is a small amount of liquid water was already present on its surface however the average point cloud density was still 129 10 points m2 this means that the quality of the point cloud satisfies the sd estimation in a periglacial geomorphologic area under wet snow conditions in addition the registration between multitemporal datasets was the basis for estimation due to the poor signal in the study area we completed the calibration and postprocessing of the data using a physical base station gnss receiver working during the flight in agreement with previous studies multitemporal point cloud data were still well aligned without using gcps currier et al 2019 harder et al 2020 different from previous studies we verified the accuracy of multitemporal sd data using in situ measurements at fixed locations which is very difficult to implement in alpine regions koutantou et al 2022 not only is it difficult to ensure that the metal pole used to fix the gcp does not shift during repeating surveys but it is also challenging to make each sampling point correspond as closely as possible to the centimeter level sd distribution map therefore we permanently installed a large number of gcps evenly over the study area to minimize geolocation errors meanwhile we used rtk devices and orthophotos acquired during the same period to obtain the precise locations of the artificial sampling points the mae of the estimated sd compared with the in situ measured sd was 0 53 and 1 57 cm for shallow and deep snow conditions respectively and the rmse was 0 68 and 2 23 cm respectively this result is similar to that of jacobs et al 2021 who measured a mae of 0 96 cm and a rmse of 1 22 cm in fields with sds of less than 20 cm verifying the accuracy in different periods within the same area contributes to an understanding of the continuous mapping of alpine regions thereby enabling the entire process of snow accumulation to be tracked at the basin scale 5 4 challenges several factors make the application of uav based lidar techniques in alpine regions challenging first the high wind speed and low temperature conditions shorten the endurance of the uav resulting in a limited spatial coverage in this study we spent nearly 1 h mapping an area of 0 3 km2 many studies emphasize that increasing the flight altitude helps to extend the survey coverage of lidar clark et al 2011 therefore developing the most reasonable flight plan while maintaining the point cloud density required for snow mapping is an important consideration for future research in addition we maintained a relatively constant flight altitude due to the small height differences in the study area nevertheless using this technology in areas with huge differences in altitude requires a flight at variable altitudes which is undoubtedly a huge challenge surveys such as those conducted by koutantou et al 2022 have shown that the point cloud data still have strip misalignment even after post processed kinematic ppk correction when changing the flight altitude based on the above results additional studies are needed to explore the capability of uav based lidar in areas with high altitude differences 6 conclusions this study is the first attempt to estimate and validate multitemporal sd using uav lidar in a representative region of high mountain asia with the aim of evaluating the reliability of this technique to obtain the sd distribution in a periglacial geomorphology this study helps refine our strategy for experimental deployments in similar environments based on these experimental results the main conclusions can be summarized as follows first the uav lidar point clouds obtained on an alpine periglacial geomorphology with varying periods have a good quality and meet the requirements of the relevant specifications on the one hand the average surface density decreased with increasing sd due to the absorption of the near infrared laser by liquid water on the snow surface but the lowest density 129 10 points m2 still allowed for high precision sd estimation on the other hand multitemporal lidar point clouds still achieved good registration without using gcps second the spatial heterogeneity caused by the hummocks could be captured in the high resolution sd map compared to the in situ measurements obtained near the gcps at the fixed locations we found that the sd derived from lidar was slightly overestimated finally the snow surface conditions played a minor role in the error estimators which caused the results to be slightly underestimated due to partial penetration of the laser beam in contrast landform conditions especially hummock seasonal deformation and manual sampling errors caused by the ice layer over the soil were the main factors affecting accuracy specifically the rmse and mae in deep snow conditions were 2 23 cm and 1 57 cm respectively which were almost three times higher than those in shallow snow in general our study will allow us to take the next step to achieve fine scale sd estimates in more alpine regions that are dominated by seasonal snow further research should be undertaken to explore how to develop the most reasonable flight plan while maintaining the point cloud density required for snow mapping in addition the application of this technique in areas with large altitude differences should be considered for example the terrain follow mode of uavs can be used to perform sd estimation for valleys or mountain peaks funding this

2408,investigating the porosity permeability evolution in carbonate rocks during long term infiltration is a challenging hydrodynamic problem in rock engineering hydroelectric engineering co2 geological storage and oil gas development in general we consider the evolution of porosity and permeability to be positively correlated however the complex pore structures in carbonate rocks include multiscale pore fracture structures such as intergranular pores dissolution pores and even fractures although the permeability levels of carbonate rocks are similar the evolution of the pore structure is highly variable here we use the rock seepage coupled nuclear magnetic resonance nmr online analysis and imaging system platform to conduct a long term penetration test in carbonate rocks under the coupling of stress and reactive fluid the variation in the multiscale pore volume was quantitatively characterized by the inversion of the t2 spectrum subsequently in combination with permeability measurement the permeability porosity evolution during long term infiltration can be roughly divided into three stages the experimental results show that the evolution of permeability exhibits noticeable stress sensitivity at the initial stage of the test 0 156 h since the compression of the pore volume is the dominant mechanism the permeability decreases with porosity at this stage a negative correlation between the evolution of porosity and permeability was observed during the subsequent stage of the test 156 400 h this phenomenon may be attributed to mineral dissolution at this stage causing the cementation to be exfoliated from the pore surface and to re precipitate at the pore throat locally blocking the seepage channels as the test continued 400 720 h mineral dissolution transitioned from micropores to mesopores and macropores with a synergistic increase in porosity and permeability these results revealed the competing mechanism of stress compression and mineral dissolution during long term infiltration providing an accurate prediction of the seepage properties in carbonate rocks keywords carbonate rocks porosity permeability evolution online nmr multiscale pores mineral dissolution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the seepage characteristics of carbonate rocks are crucial for the evaluation of hydraulic properties relevant in many rock engineering fields such as water and hydropower engineering co2 capture and geological storage nuclear waste storage and unconventional oil gas resource development okazaki et al 2014 permeability is generally used as an intrinsic characteristic parameter on the representative element volume rev scale which is influenced by physical tang et al 2022 wang et al 2019a mechanical wang et al 2019b and chemical processes zhao et al 2016 mecchia et al 2019 it has been studied by many researchers over the years mostly by fitting permeability to porosity using traditional relationships such as the kozeny carman relationship power law relationship or logarithmic relationship as listed in table 1 costa 2006 tan et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 safari et al 2021 bernabé et al 2003 suggested that there are different patterns of porosity permeability evolution in complex rock water environments determined by the interaction of reaction dynamics and mass transport processes the seepage characteristics of carbonate rocks are closely related to their structural parameters such as pore shape pore size inter pore connectivity particle surface roughness and pore throat size rostamzadeh et al 2018 xia et al 2019 meanwhile external disturbances may cause various physicochemical processes e g changes in effective stress chemical dissolution or precipitation and filtration of suspended particles and alter the internal pore structure formation expansion or closure of seepage channels which is ultimately attributed to the seepage properties of carbonate rocks tan et al 2020 hu et al 2022 consequently it is difficult to fit the evolution of rev permeability to porosity using established relationships during long term infiltration even if a traditional relationship between permeability and porosity can be fitted the results may obscure significant constraints failing to reveal the porosity permeability evolutionary mechanism the pore structure of carbonate reservoirs typically consists of intergranular pores dissolution pores and microfractures huang et al 2016 intergranular pores are formed by dolomitization and are typically smaller than 1 μm sun et al 2015 whereas dissolution pores are produced by the chemical erosion of minerals microfractures on the other hand are associated with large scale geological activities such as folding and faulting thus the multiscale pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is complicated resulting in poor correlation between their porosity and permeability for similar porosities the permeability can vary by three orders of magnitude or more lv et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 pointed out that narrowly shaped pores can connect to isolated pores there is a robust linear relationship between the pore connectivity and permeability lv et al 2022 quantitatively analyzed the pore structure of 417 carbonate samples using mercury pressure tests the prediction accuracy of permeability was improved by distinguishing different patterns of pore throat duan et al 2021 characterized the pore structure of carbonate rocks by introducing multiple fractal dimensions however they still could not accurately evaluate the relationship between the porosity and permeability furthermore carbonate reservoirs are permanently in a hydro mechanical chemical coupling environment during the penetration of reactive fluids groundwater acidic solutions or hot water there is a non equilibrium state between minerals and the aqueous solution luquot and gouze 2009 mineral dissolution migration crystallization and precipitation lead to complex changes in the pore structure luquot et al 2014 ultimately affecting the spatio temporal distribution of critical parameters such as mechanical properties and seepage characteristics porosity and permeability hommel et al 2018 there is extensive experimental evidence that the increase in permeability during reactive fluid injection is usually associated with a dissolution induced increase in porosity specifically the dissolution of minerals resulting from the water rock reaction extends the seepage channels by increasing the original pores or creating new pores egermann et al 2005 conducted a penetration test to investigate the variation in pore size distribution during co2 dissolution the results show that the permeability evolution due to increased porosity depends on the initial pore structure of the carbonate rocks tan et al 2020 experimentally found that salt dissolution of carbonate rocks mainly affects the pore structure with pore sizes between 0 01 and 10 μm while the effect on nanopores smaller than 0 01 μm is almost negligible they also suggested that permeability was related to porosity as a power function during the dissolution process shedid and salem 2013 studied the effect of co2 soak duration on permeability and porosity of carbonate rocks at a pressure of 2400 psi and a temperature of 200 c it is found that both porosity and permeability decreased at shorter soak times 7 days while an increase in porosity and permeability occured due to mineral dissolution at longer soak times 150 days smith et al 2013 conducted permeability tests on two different carbonate rocks dolomite and limestone at a temperature of 60 c and ambient pressure of 24 8 mpa their experiments showed that the non homogeneity of carbonate rocks significantly affects the mechanism of mineral dissolution resulting in different patterns of porosity and permeability evolution homogenous dissolution of dolomite occurred leading to the slow advance of the dissolution front the porosity continued to increase while the permeability remained almost constant however the non homogenous of dissolution in limestone allows for the rapid development of a pressure breakthrough creating a dominant seepage channel which can lead to a significant increase in permeability however some scholars have experimentally found that the permeability of carbonate rocks does not always increase with increasing porosity during the injection of reactive fluids mangane et al 2013 carried out co2 brine penetration tests on carbonate rocks under in situ conditions 12 mpa and 100 c to investigate the mechanism of mineral dissolution the tests reveal a gradual increase in porosity and a continuous decrease in permeability the pore structure of the cores before and after the test was obtained by high precision x ray microtomography it is concluded that the decrease in permeability is due to the redeposition of the stripped undissolved particles causing partial blockage of the seepage channel garing et al 2015 conducted penetration tests using deionized water and aqueous solutions containing co2 injected into carbonate rocks such minerals are soluble when the co2 water solution is used as the penetration fluid and the porosity and permeability increase simultaneously however the minerals were not easily dissolved when deionized water was used as the penetration fluid this phenomenon suggests that the increase or decrease in the permeability of carbonate rocks is controlled by the dissolution strength of the injected solution although the above studies have been conducted on the porosity permeability relationships and mineral dissolution of carbonate rocks during the penetration process some critical mechanisms still need to be further clarified i evolutionary relationships between porosity and permeability at different stages ii quantitative characterization of multiscale pore volumes at different stages of porosity permeability evolution iii stress sensitivity of multiscale pores at the initial stage and its influence on the evolution of permeability iv mechanisms of mineral dissolution at different stages and formation of the dominant seepage channel here we aim to investigate the stress sensitivity and mineral dissolution in carbonate rocks during long term infiltration which primarily change the multiscale pore structure analyzing the competing hydro mechanical chemical mechanisms can improve our understanding of the porosity permeability evolution in this study we used the rock seepage coupled nuclear magnetic resonance nmr online analysis and imaging system to conduct a long term penetration test of carbonate rocks under the coupling of stress and reactive fluid first the changes in the mineral composition and surface morphologies of the carbonate rocks before and after the penetration test were analyzed by sem and xrd online nmr was then used to quantitatively characterize the porosity pore size distribution and multiscale pore volume in combination with permeability measurements the evolution of porosity permeability during long term infiltration was divided into different stages finally based on the variation of the multiscale pore structure characterized by nmr the dominant mechanisms at different stages of long term infiltration were revealed providing an accurate understanding of the seepage properties for carbonate rocks 2 materials and methodology 2 1 preparation of carbonate samples the carbonate samples selected for this study were limestone from jiaxiang county shandong province china limestone in this area has distinct chemical and mechanical properties and it is formed in the sea and lake wave activity zones where calcium carbonate is supersaturated the carbonate samples were processed into cylindrical samples with a diameter of 2 5 cm and height of 5 cm as shown in fig 1 before the penetration test carbonate rocks were analyzed via x ray diffraction and the main mineral components were obtained according to the diffraction criterion of crystal plane spacing and diffraction intensity as shown in table 2 the main compositions of the carbonate sample are 88 99 calcite 7 58 quartz and 3 17 dolomite 2 2 experimental setup and schemes the self developed rock seepage coupled nmr online analysis and imaging system including computer servo control system nmr system core holder confining pressure control system axial compression control system osmotic pressure control system and strain measurement system is shown in fig 2 this experimental system combines a triaxial seepage instrument with the nuclear magnetic resonance compared to conventional instruments it may have two advantages 1 the use of haar alloy for all permeation which is resistant to acidic corrosion 2 the layered t2 spectrum during permeation process thus the evolution of the multiscale pore structure during the hydro mechanical chemical coupling process can be characterized by the t2 spectrum in previous research work wang and wang 2018 the authors have discussed supercritical co2 leakage into shallow caprock in this study the experimental parameters were set as follows ph 5 acidic solution of distilled water mixed with sulfuric acid the injection pressure is 9 mpa and the confining pressure is 10 mpa nmr used in this study will be affected by temperature therefore we need to maintain an external ambient temperature of 25 c throughout the test the specific steps of the experiments were as follows 1 the carbonate sample was vacuumed to 0 1 mpa using a pressure saturation device for 6 h before the test and then saturated for 24 h at 9 5 mpa 2 after the carbonate sample was saturated it was connected to the upper and lower percolation heads the heat shrink tube was heated with a hot air gun to ensure that there was no gap between the carbonate sample and the heat shrink tube the carbonate sample was fixed in the core holder and installed in the magnet chamber 3 the confining pressure was loaded gradually according to the target pressure after stabilizing the confining pressure permeation pressure was gradually applied to the target value 4 the nmr analysis system was debugged to determine the parameters used in the test the center frequency is 12 33 mhz the echo interval is 0 1 ms the number of echoes is 12000 and the waiting time is 3000 ms during the test the sampling interval is set as 0 5 h to monitor the nmr signal of carbonate samples in real time 2 3 the principle of nmr 2 3 1 measurement of porosity nmr technology detects fluid properties using the resonance characteristics of protons in a magnetic field the basic principle is that the nmr signal intensity of hydrogen atoms in the pore fluid of porous media is proportional to the pore size used to analyze the microstructure the nmr signal measured by the saturated samples was converted into porosity by using standard calibration samples the conversion formula is as follows brownstein and tarr 1977 1 ϕ ϕ s sg s g b n s s ns 10 1 20 r g 1 s r g 1 2 r g 2 s r g 2 where ϕ is the porosity of the carbonate sample to be tested ns represents cumulative times r g 1 and r g 2 are the magnification in the test sg is the signal of nmr the index s indicates the standard calibration sample from the above formula the signal ratio of the carbonate sample to the standard sample is the ratio of porosity when the sampling parameters are kept constant during the test when the porosity of the standard sample is constant the porosity of the target sample can be calculated by the signal ratio as shown in fig 3 2 3 2 measurement of pore size distribution the sirt simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique inversion algorithm was used for mathematical inversion of the echo attenuation signal collected by the saturated sample to calculate the spectrum of the carbonate sample there are three different relaxation mechanisms for fluids in pores 1 free relaxation 2 surface relaxation and 3 diffusion relaxation 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 f r e e 1 t 2 s u r f a c e 1 t 2 d i f f u s i o n where t 2 denotes the total relaxation time of the pore fluid collected by the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg sequence t 2 f r e e t 2 s u r f a c e and t 2 d i f f u s i o n represent the free relaxation time surface relaxation time and diffusion relaxation time respectively the dominant positions of the three relaxation mechanisms depend on the fluid type pore size surface relaxation strength and wettability of the rock surface brownstein and tarr 1977 in this study surface relaxation played a vital role when the pores were only water bearing thus when the effects of bulk relaxation and diffusion were negligible the pore size was directly proportional to the surface relaxation time 3 1 t 2 1 t 2 s u r f a c e ρ 2 s v ρ 2 f s r where ρ 2 is the ability of t 2 surface relaxation s v represents the specific surface area of the pores which is affected by the shape factor and radius of the pores 3 experimental results 3 1 mineral composition and apparent morphology of carbonated samples the pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is more complex than that of conventional clastic reservoirs owing to the comprehensive effects of deposition geology and epigenetic alteration the pore structure of carbonated rocks possesses strong heterogeneity the pores formed in the original carbonate particle sediments were primary pores including intergranular pores intragranular pores biological skeleton pores and shelter pores secondary pores are produced by reformation in the diagenetic and epigenetic stages which are characterized by the destruction of the original sedimentary structure the main types of secondary pores were intergranular and intragranular dissolved pores intergranular pores and fractured pores the complexity of the pore structure of carbonate rocks leads to an unclear porosity permeability evolutionary mechanism during long term infiltration therefore the pore structure of carbonate rocks was first qualitatively understood through mineral composition and surface morphology x ray diffraction analysis of the carbonate samples before and after the penetration test was conducted to semi quantitatively characterize the variation in mineral composition as shown in fig 4 this carbonated sample is mainly composed of calcite dolomite and quartz from the peak value corresponding to minerals calcite content was the highest reaching 88 99 dolomite content was 3 17 and quartz content was 7 58 after the penetration test the peak value of calcite decreased significantly to 79 61 dolomite content was 9 68 and quartz content was 9 27 this variation in the mineral composition suggests that calcite in the carbonate samples reacted during the penetration test this finding is related to the chemical reaction equations that will be considered in the mineral dissolution model of this study compared with conventional clastic reservoirs the pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is complex because of the combined effects of sedimentation geology and alteration this complex pore structure can be divided into four types according to its morphology pores caves throats and fractures in other words they are usually classified as primary or secondary pores of geological origin the pores formed in the original carbonate particle sediments were primary pores including intergranular pores intragranular pores and biological skeleton pores secondary pores are characterized by the destruction of the original sedimentary structure at the diagenetic epigenetic and epigenetic stages the main types of secondary pores were intergranular and intragranular dissolved pores intergranular pores and fractured pores fig 5 shows the surface morphologies of the carbonate samples before and after the penetration test there are no noticeable dissolved pores before the penetration test which are mainly fractured pores intergranular pores and intragranular pores fig 5 a shows that the salt minerals were bonded to the rock skeleton by clay minerals creating a micron scale rough surface on a smaller scale stress compaction leads to localized particle rupture which results in the formation of intergranular pores as shown in fig 5 b before penetration by the reactive fluid the intragranular pores exhibited a smoother surface instead of voids fig 5 c overall a higher roughness and uneven surface were the most apparent morphological characteristics before the penetration test however noticeable dissolved pores are produced by the coupling effect of the stress and reactive fluid ranging from several microns to hundreds of microns fig 5 d f apparent dissolution voids were created with the penetration of the reactive fluid as shown in fig 5 f meanwhile the exfoliation and migration of cementation also develop significant flow channels between the pores of the grains fig 5 e finally the increased dissolved pores lead to the rupture of the internal structure the higher connectivity between intergranular pores generates larger scale fractured pores fig 5 d 3 2 evolutionary porosity permeability relationship during long term infiltration the prepared solution was injected into the core holder through a pressure control system during an online nmr coupling penetration test the nmr signal of the carbonate sample was then collected during the continuous injection of the solution the porosity of the carbonate sample can be obtained from the relationship between the unit volume signal and the porosity eq 1 as shown in fig 6 in the first period 0 156 h of the test the carbonate sample was gradually compressed resulting in a decrease in porosity from 1 27 to 1 11 after 156 h with the continuous injection of the reactive fluid the porosity of the rock sample gradually increased under the dissolution of the acidic solution to 1 63 different from the evolution of porosity the permeability of carbonate samples decreased continuously within the initial 400 h especially to 48 08 of the initial permeability at 156 h after 400 h with the continuous injection of the reactive fluid the permeability of the carbonate sample increased gradually fig 6 shows that the evolutionary relationship between porosity and permeability varies at different stages of the infiltration process 1 1 0 156 h in the initial stage of the test the permeability of the carbonate sample decreased with decreasing porosity this was because the carbonate sample was gradually compressed under stress at this stage although mineral dissolution also contributes to the increase in porosity the higher permeability at this stage results in a shorter retention time of the reactive fluid with the carbonate sample as a result the dissolution effect is not significant compared to pore compression this initial stage is referred to as the compression stage for the long term infiltration process 2 2 156 400 h the permeability of the carbonate samples still decreased but at a slower rate than in the initial stage however the porosity gradually increased and showed a negative correlation with permeability this is because as the permeability of the carbonate sample decreases the contact time between the reactive fluid and carbonate sample increases the mineral dissolution of the carbonate sample caused an increase in porosity however dissolution of the carbonate samples during this stage occured mainly in the micropores within the grains the exfoliation of the cement with seepage activation and re sedimentation causes local blockage of the seepage channels resulting in a decrease in permeability therefore there is a negative correlation between the porosity and permeability of the carbonate sample at this stage which is called the negative pore permeability correlation stage 3 3 400 720 h in the later stages of the long term penetration test the permeability of the carbonate sample increased in coordination with porosity as the reactive fluid continued to be injected the mineral dissolution mechanism gradually dominated seepage channels are formed within the carbonate sample which causes an increase in permeability this stage was considered to be the mineral dissolution stage in this study 3 3 variation of multiscale pore volume in carbonate samples by the online nmr the above experimental results suggest that the evolutionary relationship between permeability and porosity in carbonate samples may be positively or negatively correlated during long term infiltration therefore the seepage characteristics of carbonate samples cannot be analyzed from the perspective of porosity alone but the variation in the multiscale pore structure also needs to be considered the pores in the carbonate samples used in this study were mainly nano pores according to the classification of pore sizes by hodot 1966 the pore sizes of the carbonate samples are classified into the following three types of pores micropores 10 nm mesopores 10 nm pore size 0 1 um and macropores 0 1 um figs 7 9 show the variation in the multiscale pore volume of the carbonate samples at different stages of the penetration test 1 compression stage as shown in fig 7 a the pore size distribution psd of the carbonate samples is bimodal at the initial moment then develops into multimodal at 156 h relevant experimental results indicate that carbonate samples with bimodal psd have better seepage characteristics than those with multimodal psd this is because the multimodal pore structure is extremely inhomogeneous the frequency of pore distribution varies significantly between different sizes and the proportion of large pores is smaller than that of the bimodal pore structure as the psd curve gradually became multimodal at 156 h the permeability of the carbonate sample was lower than that at the initial moment fig 7 b shows the variation in multiscale pore volume from the initial moment to 156 h macropores mesopores and micropores decreased from 0 34 to 0 30 from 0 48 to 0 45 and from 0 45 to 0 36 respectively the total pore volume in the carbonate sample was significantly reduced indicating that the multiscale pores were compressed at this stage 2 negative porosity permeability correlation stage as shown in fig 8 a the psd of the carbonate samples remained multimodal from the nmr t2 patterns this suggests that the heterogeneity of carbonate samples did not change significantly during this stage however from the different scales of pore volume fractions illustrated in fig 8 b the volumes of macropores mesopores and micropores all increased which is the opposite trend to that of the previous stage macropores mesopores and micropores increased from 0 30 to 0 35 from 0 45 to 0 51 and from 0 36 to 0 49 respectively this also verifies that mineral dissolution at this stage occurred mainly in the micropores exfoliated cementation leads to local blockage of the seepage channels causing a decrease in permeability which is negatively correlated with the total porosity of the carbonate samples 3 mineral dissolution stage as shown in fig 9 a from 400 to 720 h the shape of the psd in the carbonate samples was still multimodal the psd curves of the micropores coincided with the variations reflected in the mesopores and macropores fig 9 b shows the variation in the pore volume fraction at different scales notably the volume increase of micropores was not significant at this stage but the growth of mesopores and macropores was more pronounced mesopores and macropores increase from 0 51 to 0 65 and from 0 35 to 0 48 respectively this indicates that mineral dissolution of the carbonate sample at this moment no longer occurs mainly in micropores but transitions to mesopores and macropores mineral dissolution is not confined to local areas but rather holistic dissolution pores begin to connect and form dominant seepage channels 4 discussions 4 1 stress sensitivity of multiscale pore structure at the compression stage a compression effect was evident in the initial stage of the penetration test however as the pores of the carbonate samples are gradually compacted the effect of stress creep gradually diminishes and the decline in the pores of the carbonate samples tends to slow the permeability of the carbonate sample at this stage is relatively high therefore the contact time with the rock sample is short owing to the fast flow rate the effect of mineral dissolution was not evident and the permeability of the carbonate sample was mainly affected by stress sensitivity therefore in this section the nmr coupled seepage test platform is used to obtain the degree of closure of multiscale pores of carbonate samples during infiltration in response to the characteristics of carbonate samples with high stress sensitivity at the initial stage furthermore a prediction model for the permeability of carbonate samples considering multiscale pore compression sensitivity was proposed to explore the microscopic mechanism of porosity permeability evolution at the stress dominated stage fig 10 illustrates the deformation mechanism of the multiscale pores during the compression stage first the narrow macropore functioned as the main flow channel during the infiltration process there will be significant shrinkage at the throat or even a transition from macropores to mesopores under compression which also leads to a corresponding reduction in permeability the compression of the mesopores causes a loss of connectivity between the dispersed pores around the main flow channel although this loss of connectivity does not significantly affect porosity as macropore compression the effect on permeability may still be of the same magnitude the compression of micropores causes local disappearance of the isolated pores table 3 shows the variation in multiscale pore volume during the compression stage the total porosity of the carbonate sample decreases from 1 27 at 17 37 h to 1 11 at 156 45 h although the multiscale pore volume shows a consistent decreasing trend the degree of compression indicates a non uniformity due to the pore structure with macropores decreasing by 11 83 mesopores by 6 31 and micropores by 20 36 according to the definition of volumetric strain the degree of compression of the pores can be expressed as 4 ε d v b v b 0 d ϕ v ϕ 0 v d ϕ ϕ 0 where v b 0 and v b are the pore volumes of the carbonate samples at the initial stage and after compression respectively v is the total pore volume of the carbonate samples ϕ and ϕ 0 represent the porosity of the carbonate samples at the initial moment and after compression respectively the variation rate of the volumetric strain of the carbonate samples indicates the stress sensitivity of the pore volume expressed as 5 c f d ε dt 1 ϕ 0 d ϕ dt based on the compressed degree of carbonate samples seidle et al 1992 used a matchstick model to give the permeability as a function of the volumetric strain rate as follows 6 k k 0 e α c f t where k 0 and k are the initial permeability and the permeability of the carbonate samples after compression respectively α is the deformation factor of porous media the above equation describes the relationship between porosity and permeability at the macroscopic scale but still does not consider the effect of differences in stress sensitivity on permeability at different scales of pore structure macropores mesopores and micropores therefore according to the classification of the pore structure in this study the multiscale pore volumes can be further subdivided as 7 v bi v spi v mpi v lpi where v spi v mpi and v lpi are the volumes of the micropores mesopores and macropores at moment i respectively taking the derivative of eq 7 to time gives 8 d v bi dt d v spi dt d v mpi dt d v lpi dt according to the definition of pore compression coefficient eq 8 divided by v bi yields 9 1 v bi d v bi dt v spi v bi 1 v spi d v spi dt v mpi v bi 1 v mpi d v mpi dt v lpi v bi 1 v lpi d v lpi dt depending on the expression of the pore volume strain rate this can be simplified to 10 c ei v spi v bi c spi v mpi v bi c mpi v lpi v bi c lpi where c ei is the strain rate of multiscale pore volumes at moment i c spi c mpi and c lpi are the stress induced pore volume strain rates for micropores mesopores and macropores in the carbonate samples respectively therefore the variation in the pore volume strain rate at different scales during the compression stage can be calculated according to the above equation as shown in fig 11 the multiscale pores of carbonate samples are compressed to different degrees the strain rate in the micropores of the carbonate samples was the highest followed by those in the mesopores and macropores the time effect of stress creep reveals that the pore volume strain rate decreases gradually for micropores and mesopores whereas the strain rate increases gradually for macropores after obtaining the multiscale pore compression coefficients and substituting them into the permeability model in eqs 6 the permeability of the carbonate sample during the compression stage can be expressed as follows 11 k i k 0 e α v spi v bi c spi v mpi v bi c mpi v lpi v bi c lpi δ σ i fig 12 compares the calculated values of permeability considering the multiscale pore volume strain rates with the experimental data in the compression stage stress dominates the evolution of the pore structure therefore a model for calculating permeability that considers the strain rate of multiscale pore volumes can better predict the evolution of permeability based on current 1d nmr methods it is still not possible to determine whether the micropores are obtained from macropores or mesopores at compression stage thus besides the pore size distribution the capillary pressure needs to be added to better distinguish the pore throat relationship the authors will continue to work towards quantitative characterization of pore connectivity by 2d nmr 4 2 mechanism of localized mineral dissolution at negative pore permeability correlation stage the mechanism of mineral dissolution on the pore scale can be decomposed into three steps a hydrodynamic transport of reactants to the reaction surface b reaction processes on the mineral surface and c transport processes in which reaction products are carried off the reaction surface the effective chemical reaction kinetic process was controlled by the slowest of the three steps mentioned above steps a and c are generally considered to exhibit similar characteristic times as the pore structure gradually compacted under stress creep there was a significant drop in the flow rate the time required for the reactive fluid to be retained on the surface of the porous medium increases so that more pore space is available for dissolution there is apparent competition between mineral dissolution and stress compression at this stage in addition mineral composition analysis showed that the carbonate samples selected for this study were limestone in contrast to the more homogeneous dolomite cores the dissolution in the non homogeneous cores limestone was non homogeneous and dominated by local dissolution as shown in fig 13 the variation in pore volume caused by the dissolution mechanism is reflected in two ways i the reactive fluid causes the cement to exfoliate from the surface of the narrow macropores the dissolved particles migrate with the reactive fluid until they are redeposited at the throat of the pores obviously this behavior is harmful to the permeability of the carbonate samples ii the dissolution of isolated pores causes an increase in pore volume but does not significantly contribute to permeability thus these results lead to an increase in porosity and a slight decrease in permeability a negative porosity permeability correlation specifically the change in porosity of carbonate samples due to mineral dissolution can be calculated using chemical reaction equations when the reactive fluid was injected the carbonate samples reacted as follows 12 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 camg co 3 2 2h mg 2 ca 2 2 hco 3 cahco 3 h ca 2 h 2 o co 2 mghco 3 h mg 2 h 2 o co 2 the volume of mineral dissolution during the infiltration process can be expressed as 13 v d i s s l o v e ν m i q t δ c i t d t where m i represents the weighting of mineral i to the carbonate samples ν is the molar mass of the carbonate samples where δ c i is the ionic concentration of mineral i in the permeation inlet and outlet solutions notably the ion concentration in this study is still used as an indicator to calculate the pore volume of mineral dissolution in fact a higher temperature increases the ionic activity which ultimately determines the chemical reaction energy yasuhara et al 2016 the equilibrium constants of chemical reaction equations are widely proven to be a function of temperature and their empirical formulae can be found in the literature zhang et al 2016 in this study temperature is assumed to remain constant throughout the permeation test thus allowing the above mentioned effects of temperature on fluid rock reaction to be ignored since the mineral components of the carbonate samples that react with the reactive fluid are calcite and dolomite the above equation can be rewritten as 14 v d i s s l o v e ν q t m calcite δ c calcite m dolomite δ c dolomite d t the change in the porosity of the carbonate samples can be expressed by the dissolved volume 15 ϕ t t 1 v v d i s s l o v e t therefore the porosity of carbonate samples at moment t can be deduced as 16 ϕ t ϕ 0 1 v ν q t m calcite δ c calcite m dolomite δ c dolomite d t the evolution of porosity at the negative pore permeability correlation stage due to mineral dissolution was obtained by incorporating the experimentally measured ionic concentrations into the above equation as shown in fig 14 comparison with experimental data verified that the mineral dissolution model could predict the evolution of porosity at this stage this also indicates that the mechanism of pore structure evolution transitioned from stress sensitivity in the previous stage to localized mineral dissolution in this stage this study has not yet been able to develop a blockage model to evaluate permeability evolution at this stage a polynomial fit of the experimental data on porosity and permeability at this stage was used to broadly evaluate the porosity permeability evolution as shown in fig 15 the permeability decreased significantly with increasing porosity the permeability continued to decrease until the porosity increased to 1 4 at this point the permeability started to increase slightly this finding again suggests that in tight carbonates localized dissolution may not cause an increase in permeability but rather blockage of the pore throat by exfoliating cementation this interesting experimental phenomenon requires further investigation 4 3 formation of a dominant seepage channel at the mineral dissolution stage the carbonate samples were gradually dissolved as the reactive fluid was injected with a simultaneous increase in porosity and permeability at the later stages of the penetration test the mechanism of mineral dissolution is dominant mainly occurring in macropores mesopores and micropores fig 16 represents the formation mechanism of the dominant seepage channel i firstly the cementation exfoliated from the narrow macropores does not block up at the throat of pores due to the higher degree of dissolution in the seepage channels ii secondly the dissolution of isolated pores are gradually interconnected to form a dominant seepage channel eventually creating a fracture network with the main channel thus in contrast to the dissolution mechanism at the negatively correlated porosity permeability stage the mineral dissolution at this stage is no longer confined to a local area but the overall dissolution pore starts to form and gradually develops into a dominant seepage channel fig 17 illustrates the variation of pore volume fractions with different scales at the mineral dissolution stage it can be found that the mesopores have the highest growth rate which increases from 0 48 to 0 64 the following is macropores increased from 0 34 to 0 43 however the micropores only increased slightly from 0 48 to 0 51 these results verify that the mineral dissolution no longer occurs primarily in micropores but transitions to mesopores and macropores the effect of mineral dissolution at this stage does not only cause an increase in porosity but a synergistic increase in porosity and permeability therefore the relationship between permeability and porosity at this stage follows the description of the kozeny carman equation fig 18 verifies the correctness of this positively correlated relationship 5 conclusions in this study we used the rock seepage coupled nmr online analysis and imaging system platform to conduct an online experimental study on the pore structure evolution and seepage characteristics of carbonate rocks under the coupling effects of stress and reactive fluids the evolutionary relationship between porosity and permeability in carbonate rocks during the long term infiltration process is discussed based on the obtained porosity pore size distribution and permeability from a microscopic perspective the quantitative characterization of multiscale pore volumes revealed the dominant mechanisms of stress sensitivity and mineral dissolution at different evolutionary stages 1 during the initial stage of the test 0 156 h the pore volume of the carbonate samples was significantly compressed the permeability evolution showed strong stress sensitivity with a simultaneous decrease in porosity and permeability the inversion analysis of the t2 spectrum revealed that the most significant decrease in pore volume was the micropores which had a more pronounced stress sensitivity resulting in poor pore connectivity the evolution of permeability with pore structure at this stage is more accurately predicted by developing a permeability model that considers multiscale pore compression coefficients 2 in the middle stage of the test 156 400 h the carbonate samples gradually dissolved as the reactive fluid was continuously injected inversion analysis of the t2 profile revealed that mineral dissolution occurs mainly in the micropores within the grain the exfoliation of minerals with seepage initiation and re precipitation causes local blockage of seepage channels resulting in a decrease in permeability there was a negative correlation between porosity and permeability 3 in the later stage of the test 400 720 h the mineral dissolution of the carbonate samples transitioned from micropores to mesopores and macropores a synergistic increase in the permeability and porosity was observed owing to the progressive dominance of

2408,investigating the porosity permeability evolution in carbonate rocks during long term infiltration is a challenging hydrodynamic problem in rock engineering hydroelectric engineering co2 geological storage and oil gas development in general we consider the evolution of porosity and permeability to be positively correlated however the complex pore structures in carbonate rocks include multiscale pore fracture structures such as intergranular pores dissolution pores and even fractures although the permeability levels of carbonate rocks are similar the evolution of the pore structure is highly variable here we use the rock seepage coupled nuclear magnetic resonance nmr online analysis and imaging system platform to conduct a long term penetration test in carbonate rocks under the coupling of stress and reactive fluid the variation in the multiscale pore volume was quantitatively characterized by the inversion of the t2 spectrum subsequently in combination with permeability measurement the permeability porosity evolution during long term infiltration can be roughly divided into three stages the experimental results show that the evolution of permeability exhibits noticeable stress sensitivity at the initial stage of the test 0 156 h since the compression of the pore volume is the dominant mechanism the permeability decreases with porosity at this stage a negative correlation between the evolution of porosity and permeability was observed during the subsequent stage of the test 156 400 h this phenomenon may be attributed to mineral dissolution at this stage causing the cementation to be exfoliated from the pore surface and to re precipitate at the pore throat locally blocking the seepage channels as the test continued 400 720 h mineral dissolution transitioned from micropores to mesopores and macropores with a synergistic increase in porosity and permeability these results revealed the competing mechanism of stress compression and mineral dissolution during long term infiltration providing an accurate prediction of the seepage properties in carbonate rocks keywords carbonate rocks porosity permeability evolution online nmr multiscale pores mineral dissolution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the seepage characteristics of carbonate rocks are crucial for the evaluation of hydraulic properties relevant in many rock engineering fields such as water and hydropower engineering co2 capture and geological storage nuclear waste storage and unconventional oil gas resource development okazaki et al 2014 permeability is generally used as an intrinsic characteristic parameter on the representative element volume rev scale which is influenced by physical tang et al 2022 wang et al 2019a mechanical wang et al 2019b and chemical processes zhao et al 2016 mecchia et al 2019 it has been studied by many researchers over the years mostly by fitting permeability to porosity using traditional relationships such as the kozeny carman relationship power law relationship or logarithmic relationship as listed in table 1 costa 2006 tan et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 safari et al 2021 bernabé et al 2003 suggested that there are different patterns of porosity permeability evolution in complex rock water environments determined by the interaction of reaction dynamics and mass transport processes the seepage characteristics of carbonate rocks are closely related to their structural parameters such as pore shape pore size inter pore connectivity particle surface roughness and pore throat size rostamzadeh et al 2018 xia et al 2019 meanwhile external disturbances may cause various physicochemical processes e g changes in effective stress chemical dissolution or precipitation and filtration of suspended particles and alter the internal pore structure formation expansion or closure of seepage channels which is ultimately attributed to the seepage properties of carbonate rocks tan et al 2020 hu et al 2022 consequently it is difficult to fit the evolution of rev permeability to porosity using established relationships during long term infiltration even if a traditional relationship between permeability and porosity can be fitted the results may obscure significant constraints failing to reveal the porosity permeability evolutionary mechanism the pore structure of carbonate reservoirs typically consists of intergranular pores dissolution pores and microfractures huang et al 2016 intergranular pores are formed by dolomitization and are typically smaller than 1 μm sun et al 2015 whereas dissolution pores are produced by the chemical erosion of minerals microfractures on the other hand are associated with large scale geological activities such as folding and faulting thus the multiscale pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is complicated resulting in poor correlation between their porosity and permeability for similar porosities the permeability can vary by three orders of magnitude or more lv et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 pointed out that narrowly shaped pores can connect to isolated pores there is a robust linear relationship between the pore connectivity and permeability lv et al 2022 quantitatively analyzed the pore structure of 417 carbonate samples using mercury pressure tests the prediction accuracy of permeability was improved by distinguishing different patterns of pore throat duan et al 2021 characterized the pore structure of carbonate rocks by introducing multiple fractal dimensions however they still could not accurately evaluate the relationship between the porosity and permeability furthermore carbonate reservoirs are permanently in a hydro mechanical chemical coupling environment during the penetration of reactive fluids groundwater acidic solutions or hot water there is a non equilibrium state between minerals and the aqueous solution luquot and gouze 2009 mineral dissolution migration crystallization and precipitation lead to complex changes in the pore structure luquot et al 2014 ultimately affecting the spatio temporal distribution of critical parameters such as mechanical properties and seepage characteristics porosity and permeability hommel et al 2018 there is extensive experimental evidence that the increase in permeability during reactive fluid injection is usually associated with a dissolution induced increase in porosity specifically the dissolution of minerals resulting from the water rock reaction extends the seepage channels by increasing the original pores or creating new pores egermann et al 2005 conducted a penetration test to investigate the variation in pore size distribution during co2 dissolution the results show that the permeability evolution due to increased porosity depends on the initial pore structure of the carbonate rocks tan et al 2020 experimentally found that salt dissolution of carbonate rocks mainly affects the pore structure with pore sizes between 0 01 and 10 μm while the effect on nanopores smaller than 0 01 μm is almost negligible they also suggested that permeability was related to porosity as a power function during the dissolution process shedid and salem 2013 studied the effect of co2 soak duration on permeability and porosity of carbonate rocks at a pressure of 2400 psi and a temperature of 200 c it is found that both porosity and permeability decreased at shorter soak times 7 days while an increase in porosity and permeability occured due to mineral dissolution at longer soak times 150 days smith et al 2013 conducted permeability tests on two different carbonate rocks dolomite and limestone at a temperature of 60 c and ambient pressure of 24 8 mpa their experiments showed that the non homogeneity of carbonate rocks significantly affects the mechanism of mineral dissolution resulting in different patterns of porosity and permeability evolution homogenous dissolution of dolomite occurred leading to the slow advance of the dissolution front the porosity continued to increase while the permeability remained almost constant however the non homogenous of dissolution in limestone allows for the rapid development of a pressure breakthrough creating a dominant seepage channel which can lead to a significant increase in permeability however some scholars have experimentally found that the permeability of carbonate rocks does not always increase with increasing porosity during the injection of reactive fluids mangane et al 2013 carried out co2 brine penetration tests on carbonate rocks under in situ conditions 12 mpa and 100 c to investigate the mechanism of mineral dissolution the tests reveal a gradual increase in porosity and a continuous decrease in permeability the pore structure of the cores before and after the test was obtained by high precision x ray microtomography it is concluded that the decrease in permeability is due to the redeposition of the stripped undissolved particles causing partial blockage of the seepage channel garing et al 2015 conducted penetration tests using deionized water and aqueous solutions containing co2 injected into carbonate rocks such minerals are soluble when the co2 water solution is used as the penetration fluid and the porosity and permeability increase simultaneously however the minerals were not easily dissolved when deionized water was used as the penetration fluid this phenomenon suggests that the increase or decrease in the permeability of carbonate rocks is controlled by the dissolution strength of the injected solution although the above studies have been conducted on the porosity permeability relationships and mineral dissolution of carbonate rocks during the penetration process some critical mechanisms still need to be further clarified i evolutionary relationships between porosity and permeability at different stages ii quantitative characterization of multiscale pore volumes at different stages of porosity permeability evolution iii stress sensitivity of multiscale pores at the initial stage and its influence on the evolution of permeability iv mechanisms of mineral dissolution at different stages and formation of the dominant seepage channel here we aim to investigate the stress sensitivity and mineral dissolution in carbonate rocks during long term infiltration which primarily change the multiscale pore structure analyzing the competing hydro mechanical chemical mechanisms can improve our understanding of the porosity permeability evolution in this study we used the rock seepage coupled nuclear magnetic resonance nmr online analysis and imaging system to conduct a long term penetration test of carbonate rocks under the coupling of stress and reactive fluid first the changes in the mineral composition and surface morphologies of the carbonate rocks before and after the penetration test were analyzed by sem and xrd online nmr was then used to quantitatively characterize the porosity pore size distribution and multiscale pore volume in combination with permeability measurements the evolution of porosity permeability during long term infiltration was divided into different stages finally based on the variation of the multiscale pore structure characterized by nmr the dominant mechanisms at different stages of long term infiltration were revealed providing an accurate understanding of the seepage properties for carbonate rocks 2 materials and methodology 2 1 preparation of carbonate samples the carbonate samples selected for this study were limestone from jiaxiang county shandong province china limestone in this area has distinct chemical and mechanical properties and it is formed in the sea and lake wave activity zones where calcium carbonate is supersaturated the carbonate samples were processed into cylindrical samples with a diameter of 2 5 cm and height of 5 cm as shown in fig 1 before the penetration test carbonate rocks were analyzed via x ray diffraction and the main mineral components were obtained according to the diffraction criterion of crystal plane spacing and diffraction intensity as shown in table 2 the main compositions of the carbonate sample are 88 99 calcite 7 58 quartz and 3 17 dolomite 2 2 experimental setup and schemes the self developed rock seepage coupled nmr online analysis and imaging system including computer servo control system nmr system core holder confining pressure control system axial compression control system osmotic pressure control system and strain measurement system is shown in fig 2 this experimental system combines a triaxial seepage instrument with the nuclear magnetic resonance compared to conventional instruments it may have two advantages 1 the use of haar alloy for all permeation which is resistant to acidic corrosion 2 the layered t2 spectrum during permeation process thus the evolution of the multiscale pore structure during the hydro mechanical chemical coupling process can be characterized by the t2 spectrum in previous research work wang and wang 2018 the authors have discussed supercritical co2 leakage into shallow caprock in this study the experimental parameters were set as follows ph 5 acidic solution of distilled water mixed with sulfuric acid the injection pressure is 9 mpa and the confining pressure is 10 mpa nmr used in this study will be affected by temperature therefore we need to maintain an external ambient temperature of 25 c throughout the test the specific steps of the experiments were as follows 1 the carbonate sample was vacuumed to 0 1 mpa using a pressure saturation device for 6 h before the test and then saturated for 24 h at 9 5 mpa 2 after the carbonate sample was saturated it was connected to the upper and lower percolation heads the heat shrink tube was heated with a hot air gun to ensure that there was no gap between the carbonate sample and the heat shrink tube the carbonate sample was fixed in the core holder and installed in the magnet chamber 3 the confining pressure was loaded gradually according to the target pressure after stabilizing the confining pressure permeation pressure was gradually applied to the target value 4 the nmr analysis system was debugged to determine the parameters used in the test the center frequency is 12 33 mhz the echo interval is 0 1 ms the number of echoes is 12000 and the waiting time is 3000 ms during the test the sampling interval is set as 0 5 h to monitor the nmr signal of carbonate samples in real time 2 3 the principle of nmr 2 3 1 measurement of porosity nmr technology detects fluid properties using the resonance characteristics of protons in a magnetic field the basic principle is that the nmr signal intensity of hydrogen atoms in the pore fluid of porous media is proportional to the pore size used to analyze the microstructure the nmr signal measured by the saturated samples was converted into porosity by using standard calibration samples the conversion formula is as follows brownstein and tarr 1977 1 ϕ ϕ s sg s g b n s s ns 10 1 20 r g 1 s r g 1 2 r g 2 s r g 2 where ϕ is the porosity of the carbonate sample to be tested ns represents cumulative times r g 1 and r g 2 are the magnification in the test sg is the signal of nmr the index s indicates the standard calibration sample from the above formula the signal ratio of the carbonate sample to the standard sample is the ratio of porosity when the sampling parameters are kept constant during the test when the porosity of the standard sample is constant the porosity of the target sample can be calculated by the signal ratio as shown in fig 3 2 3 2 measurement of pore size distribution the sirt simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique inversion algorithm was used for mathematical inversion of the echo attenuation signal collected by the saturated sample to calculate the spectrum of the carbonate sample there are three different relaxation mechanisms for fluids in pores 1 free relaxation 2 surface relaxation and 3 diffusion relaxation 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 f r e e 1 t 2 s u r f a c e 1 t 2 d i f f u s i o n where t 2 denotes the total relaxation time of the pore fluid collected by the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg sequence t 2 f r e e t 2 s u r f a c e and t 2 d i f f u s i o n represent the free relaxation time surface relaxation time and diffusion relaxation time respectively the dominant positions of the three relaxation mechanisms depend on the fluid type pore size surface relaxation strength and wettability of the rock surface brownstein and tarr 1977 in this study surface relaxation played a vital role when the pores were only water bearing thus when the effects of bulk relaxation and diffusion were negligible the pore size was directly proportional to the surface relaxation time 3 1 t 2 1 t 2 s u r f a c e ρ 2 s v ρ 2 f s r where ρ 2 is the ability of t 2 surface relaxation s v represents the specific surface area of the pores which is affected by the shape factor and radius of the pores 3 experimental results 3 1 mineral composition and apparent morphology of carbonated samples the pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is more complex than that of conventional clastic reservoirs owing to the comprehensive effects of deposition geology and epigenetic alteration the pore structure of carbonated rocks possesses strong heterogeneity the pores formed in the original carbonate particle sediments were primary pores including intergranular pores intragranular pores biological skeleton pores and shelter pores secondary pores are produced by reformation in the diagenetic and epigenetic stages which are characterized by the destruction of the original sedimentary structure the main types of secondary pores were intergranular and intragranular dissolved pores intergranular pores and fractured pores the complexity of the pore structure of carbonate rocks leads to an unclear porosity permeability evolutionary mechanism during long term infiltration therefore the pore structure of carbonate rocks was first qualitatively understood through mineral composition and surface morphology x ray diffraction analysis of the carbonate samples before and after the penetration test was conducted to semi quantitatively characterize the variation in mineral composition as shown in fig 4 this carbonated sample is mainly composed of calcite dolomite and quartz from the peak value corresponding to minerals calcite content was the highest reaching 88 99 dolomite content was 3 17 and quartz content was 7 58 after the penetration test the peak value of calcite decreased significantly to 79 61 dolomite content was 9 68 and quartz content was 9 27 this variation in the mineral composition suggests that calcite in the carbonate samples reacted during the penetration test this finding is related to the chemical reaction equations that will be considered in the mineral dissolution model of this study compared with conventional clastic reservoirs the pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is complex because of the combined effects of sedimentation geology and alteration this complex pore structure can be divided into four types according to its morphology pores caves throats and fractures in other words they are usually classified as primary or secondary pores of geological origin the pores formed in the original carbonate particle sediments were primary pores including intergranular pores intragranular pores and biological skeleton pores secondary pores are characterized by the destruction of the original sedimentary structure at the diagenetic epigenetic and epigenetic stages the main types of secondary pores were intergranular and intragranular dissolved pores intergranular pores and fractured pores fig 5 shows the surface morphologies of the carbonate samples before and after the penetration test there are no noticeable dissolved pores before the penetration test which are mainly fractured pores intergranular pores and intragranular pores fig 5 a shows that the salt minerals were bonded to the rock skeleton by clay minerals creating a micron scale rough surface on a smaller scale stress compaction leads to localized particle rupture which results in the formation of intergranular pores as shown in fig 5 b before penetration by the reactive fluid the intragranular pores exhibited a smoother surface instead of voids fig 5 c overall a higher roughness and uneven surface were the most apparent morphological characteristics before the penetration test however noticeable dissolved pores are produced by the coupling effect of the stress and reactive fluid ranging from several microns to hundreds of microns fig 5 d f apparent dissolution voids were created with the penetration of the reactive fluid as shown in fig 5 f meanwhile the exfoliation and migration of cementation also develop significant flow channels between the pores of the grains fig 5 e finally the increased dissolved pores lead to the rupture of the internal structure the higher connectivity between intergranular pores generates larger scale fractured pores fig 5 d 3 2 evolutionary porosity permeability relationship during long term infiltration the prepared solution was injected into the core holder through a pressure control system during an online nmr coupling penetration test the nmr signal of the carbonate sample was then collected during the continuous injection of the solution the porosity of the carbonate sample can be obtained from the relationship between the unit volume signal and the porosity eq 1 as shown in fig 6 in the first period 0 156 h of the test the carbonate sample was gradually compressed resulting in a decrease in porosity from 1 27 to 1 11 after 156 h with the continuous injection of the reactive fluid the porosity of the rock sample gradually increased under the dissolution of the acidic solution to 1 63 different from the evolution of porosity the permeability of carbonate samples decreased continuously within the initial 400 h especially to 48 08 of the initial permeability at 156 h after 400 h with the continuous injection of the reactive fluid the permeability of the carbonate sample increased gradually fig 6 shows that the evolutionary relationship between porosity and permeability varies at different stages of the infiltration process 1 1 0 156 h in the initial stage of the test the permeability of the carbonate sample decreased with decreasing porosity this was because the carbonate sample was gradually compressed under stress at this stage although mineral dissolution also contributes to the increase in porosity the higher permeability at this stage results in a shorter retention time of the reactive fluid with the carbonate sample as a result the dissolution effect is not significant compared to pore compression this initial stage is referred to as the compression stage for the long term infiltration process 2 2 156 400 h the permeability of the carbonate samples still decreased but at a slower rate than in the initial stage however the porosity gradually increased and showed a negative correlation with permeability this is because as the permeability of the carbonate sample decreases the contact time between the reactive fluid and carbonate sample increases the mineral dissolution of the carbonate sample caused an increase in porosity however dissolution of the carbonate samples during this stage occured mainly in the micropores within the grains the exfoliation of the cement with seepage activation and re sedimentation causes local blockage of the seepage channels resulting in a decrease in permeability therefore there is a negative correlation between the porosity and permeability of the carbonate sample at this stage which is called the negative pore permeability correlation stage 3 3 400 720 h in the later stages of the long term penetration test the permeability of the carbonate sample increased in coordination with porosity as the reactive fluid continued to be injected the mineral dissolution mechanism gradually dominated seepage channels are formed within the carbonate sample which causes an increase in permeability this stage was considered to be the mineral dissolution stage in this study 3 3 variation of multiscale pore volume in carbonate samples by the online nmr the above experimental results suggest that the evolutionary relationship between permeability and porosity in carbonate samples may be positively or negatively correlated during long term infiltration therefore the seepage characteristics of carbonate samples cannot be analyzed from the perspective of porosity alone but the variation in the multiscale pore structure also needs to be considered the pores in the carbonate samples used in this study were mainly nano pores according to the classification of pore sizes by hodot 1966 the pore sizes of the carbonate samples are classified into the following three types of pores micropores 10 nm mesopores 10 nm pore size 0 1 um and macropores 0 1 um figs 7 9 show the variation in the multiscale pore volume of the carbonate samples at different stages of the penetration test 1 compression stage as shown in fig 7 a the pore size distribution psd of the carbonate samples is bimodal at the initial moment then develops into multimodal at 156 h relevant experimental results indicate that carbonate samples with bimodal psd have better seepage characteristics than those with multimodal psd this is because the multimodal pore structure is extremely inhomogeneous the frequency of pore distribution varies significantly between different sizes and the proportion of large pores is smaller than that of the bimodal pore structure as the psd curve gradually became multimodal at 156 h the permeability of the carbonate sample was lower than that at the initial moment fig 7 b shows the variation in multiscale pore volume from the initial moment to 156 h macropores mesopores and micropores decreased from 0 34 to 0 30 from 0 48 to 0 45 and from 0 45 to 0 36 respectively the total pore volume in the carbonate sample was significantly reduced indicating that the multiscale pores were compressed at this stage 2 negative porosity permeability correlation stage as shown in fig 8 a the psd of the carbonate samples remained multimodal from the nmr t2 patterns this suggests that the heterogeneity of carbonate samples did not change significantly during this stage however from the different scales of pore volume fractions illustrated in fig 8 b the volumes of macropores mesopores and micropores all increased which is the opposite trend to that of the previous stage macropores mesopores and micropores increased from 0 30 to 0 35 from 0 45 to 0 51 and from 0 36 to 0 49 respectively this also verifies that mineral dissolution at this stage occurred mainly in the micropores exfoliated cementation leads to local blockage of the seepage channels causing a decrease in permeability which is negatively correlated with the total porosity of the carbonate samples 3 mineral dissolution stage as shown in fig 9 a from 400 to 720 h the shape of the psd in the carbonate samples was still multimodal the psd curves of the micropores coincided with the variations reflected in the mesopores and macropores fig 9 b shows the variation in the pore volume fraction at different scales notably the volume increase of micropores was not significant at this stage but the growth of mesopores and macropores was more pronounced mesopores and macropores increase from 0 51 to 0 65 and from 0 35 to 0 48 respectively this indicates that mineral dissolution of the carbonate sample at this moment no longer occurs mainly in micropores but transitions to mesopores and macropores mineral dissolution is not confined to local areas but rather holistic dissolution pores begin to connect and form dominant seepage channels 4 discussions 4 1 stress sensitivity of multiscale pore structure at the compression stage a compression effect was evident in the initial stage of the penetration test however as the pores of the carbonate samples are gradually compacted the effect of stress creep gradually diminishes and the decline in the pores of the carbonate samples tends to slow the permeability of the carbonate sample at this stage is relatively high therefore the contact time with the rock sample is short owing to the fast flow rate the effect of mineral dissolution was not evident and the permeability of the carbonate sample was mainly affected by stress sensitivity therefore in this section the nmr coupled seepage test platform is used to obtain the degree of closure of multiscale pores of carbonate samples during infiltration in response to the characteristics of carbonate samples with high stress sensitivity at the initial stage furthermore a prediction model for the permeability of carbonate samples considering multiscale pore compression sensitivity was proposed to explore the microscopic mechanism of porosity permeability evolution at the stress dominated stage fig 10 illustrates the deformation mechanism of the multiscale pores during the compression stage first the narrow macropore functioned as the main flow channel during the infiltration process there will be significant shrinkage at the throat or even a transition from macropores to mesopores under compression which also leads to a corresponding reduction in permeability the compression of the mesopores causes a loss of connectivity between the dispersed pores around the main flow channel although this loss of connectivity does not significantly affect porosity as macropore compression the effect on permeability may still be of the same magnitude the compression of micropores causes local disappearance of the isolated pores table 3 shows the variation in multiscale pore volume during the compression stage the total porosity of the carbonate sample decreases from 1 27 at 17 37 h to 1 11 at 156 45 h although the multiscale pore volume shows a consistent decreasing trend the degree of compression indicates a non uniformity due to the pore structure with macropores decreasing by 11 83 mesopores by 6 31 and micropores by 20 36 according to the definition of volumetric strain the degree of compression of the pores can be expressed as 4 ε d v b v b 0 d ϕ v ϕ 0 v d ϕ ϕ 0 where v b 0 and v b are the pore volumes of the carbonate samples at the initial stage and after compression respectively v is the total pore volume of the carbonate samples ϕ and ϕ 0 represent the porosity of the carbonate samples at the initial moment and after compression respectively the variation rate of the volumetric strain of the carbonate samples indicates the stress sensitivity of the pore volume expressed as 5 c f d ε dt 1 ϕ 0 d ϕ dt based on the compressed degree of carbonate samples seidle et al 1992 used a matchstick model to give the permeability as a function of the volumetric strain rate as follows 6 k k 0 e α c f t where k 0 and k are the initial permeability and the permeability of the carbonate samples after compression respectively α is the deformation factor of porous media the above equation describes the relationship between porosity and permeability at the macroscopic scale but still does not consider the effect of differences in stress sensitivity on permeability at different scales of pore structure macropores mesopores and micropores therefore according to the classification of the pore structure in this study the multiscale pore volumes can be further subdivided as 7 v bi v spi v mpi v lpi where v spi v mpi and v lpi are the volumes of the micropores mesopores and macropores at moment i respectively taking the derivative of eq 7 to time gives 8 d v bi dt d v spi dt d v mpi dt d v lpi dt according to the definition of pore compression coefficient eq 8 divided by v bi yields 9 1 v bi d v bi dt v spi v bi 1 v spi d v spi dt v mpi v bi 1 v mpi d v mpi dt v lpi v bi 1 v lpi d v lpi dt depending on the expression of the pore volume strain rate this can be simplified to 10 c ei v spi v bi c spi v mpi v bi c mpi v lpi v bi c lpi where c ei is the strain rate of multiscale pore volumes at moment i c spi c mpi and c lpi are the stress induced pore volume strain rates for micropores mesopores and macropores in the carbonate samples respectively therefore the variation in the pore volume strain rate at different scales during the compression stage can be calculated according to the above equation as shown in fig 11 the multiscale pores of carbonate samples are compressed to different degrees the strain rate in the micropores of the carbonate samples was the highest followed by those in the mesopores and macropores the time effect of stress creep reveals that the pore volume strain rate decreases gradually for micropores and mesopores whereas the strain rate increases gradually for macropores after obtaining the multiscale pore compression coefficients and substituting them into the permeability model in eqs 6 the permeability of the carbonate sample during the compression stage can be expressed as follows 11 k i k 0 e α v spi v bi c spi v mpi v bi c mpi v lpi v bi c lpi δ σ i fig 12 compares the calculated values of permeability considering the multiscale pore volume strain rates with the experimental data in the compression stage stress dominates the evolution of the pore structure therefore a model for calculating permeability that considers the strain rate of multiscale pore volumes can better predict the evolution of permeability based on current 1d nmr methods it is still not possible to determine whether the micropores are obtained from macropores or mesopores at compression stage thus besides the pore size distribution the capillary pressure needs to be added to better distinguish the pore throat relationship the authors will continue to work towards quantitative characterization of pore connectivity by 2d nmr 4 2 mechanism of localized mineral dissolution at negative pore permeability correlation stage the mechanism of mineral dissolution on the pore scale can be decomposed into three steps a hydrodynamic transport of reactants to the reaction surface b reaction processes on the mineral surface and c transport processes in which reaction products are carried off the reaction surface the effective chemical reaction kinetic process was controlled by the slowest of the three steps mentioned above steps a and c are generally considered to exhibit similar characteristic times as the pore structure gradually compacted under stress creep there was a significant drop in the flow rate the time required for the reactive fluid to be retained on the surface of the porous medium increases so that more pore space is available for dissolution there is apparent competition between mineral dissolution and stress compression at this stage in addition mineral composition analysis showed that the carbonate samples selected for this study were limestone in contrast to the more homogeneous dolomite cores the dissolution in the non homogeneous cores limestone was non homogeneous and dominated by local dissolution as shown in fig 13 the variation in pore volume caused by the dissolution mechanism is reflected in two ways i the reactive fluid causes the cement to exfoliate from the surface of the narrow macropores the dissolved particles migrate with the reactive fluid until they are redeposited at the throat of the pores obviously this behavior is harmful to the permeability of the carbonate samples ii the dissolution of isolated pores causes an increase in pore volume but does not significantly contribute to permeability thus these results lead to an increase in porosity and a slight decrease in permeability a negative porosity permeability correlation specifically the change in porosity of carbonate samples due to mineral dissolution can be calculated using chemical reaction equations when the reactive fluid was injected the carbonate samples reacted as follows 12 caco 3 h ca 2 hco 3 camg co 3 2 2h mg 2 ca 2 2 hco 3 cahco 3 h ca 2 h 2 o co 2 mghco 3 h mg 2 h 2 o co 2 the volume of mineral dissolution during the infiltration process can be expressed as 13 v d i s s l o v e ν m i q t δ c i t d t where m i represents the weighting of mineral i to the carbonate samples ν is the molar mass of the carbonate samples where δ c i is the ionic concentration of mineral i in the permeation inlet and outlet solutions notably the ion concentration in this study is still used as an indicator to calculate the pore volume of mineral dissolution in fact a higher temperature increases the ionic activity which ultimately determines the chemical reaction energy yasuhara et al 2016 the equilibrium constants of chemical reaction equations are widely proven to be a function of temperature and their empirical formulae can be found in the literature zhang et al 2016 in this study temperature is assumed to remain constant throughout the permeation test thus allowing the above mentioned effects of temperature on fluid rock reaction to be ignored since the mineral components of the carbonate samples that react with the reactive fluid are calcite and dolomite the above equation can be rewritten as 14 v d i s s l o v e ν q t m calcite δ c calcite m dolomite δ c dolomite d t the change in the porosity of the carbonate samples can be expressed by the dissolved volume 15 ϕ t t 1 v v d i s s l o v e t therefore the porosity of carbonate samples at moment t can be deduced as 16 ϕ t ϕ 0 1 v ν q t m calcite δ c calcite m dolomite δ c dolomite d t the evolution of porosity at the negative pore permeability correlation stage due to mineral dissolution was obtained by incorporating the experimentally measured ionic concentrations into the above equation as shown in fig 14 comparison with experimental data verified that the mineral dissolution model could predict the evolution of porosity at this stage this also indicates that the mechanism of pore structure evolution transitioned from stress sensitivity in the previous stage to localized mineral dissolution in this stage this study has not yet been able to develop a blockage model to evaluate permeability evolution at this stage a polynomial fit of the experimental data on porosity and permeability at this stage was used to broadly evaluate the porosity permeability evolution as shown in fig 15 the permeability decreased significantly with increasing porosity the permeability continued to decrease until the porosity increased to 1 4 at this point the permeability started to increase slightly this finding again suggests that in tight carbonates localized dissolution may not cause an increase in permeability but rather blockage of the pore throat by exfoliating cementation this interesting experimental phenomenon requires further investigation 4 3 formation of a dominant seepage channel at the mineral dissolution stage the carbonate samples were gradually dissolved as the reactive fluid was injected with a simultaneous increase in porosity and permeability at the later stages of the penetration test the mechanism of mineral dissolution is dominant mainly occurring in macropores mesopores and micropores fig 16 represents the formation mechanism of the dominant seepage channel i firstly the cementation exfoliated from the narrow macropores does not block up at the throat of pores due to the higher degree of dissolution in the seepage channels ii secondly the dissolution of isolated pores are gradually interconnected to form a dominant seepage channel eventually creating a fracture network with the main channel thus in contrast to the dissolution mechanism at the negatively correlated porosity permeability stage the mineral dissolution at this stage is no longer confined to a local area but the overall dissolution pore starts to form and gradually develops into a dominant seepage channel fig 17 illustrates the variation of pore volume fractions with different scales at the mineral dissolution stage it can be found that the mesopores have the highest growth rate which increases from 0 48 to 0 64 the following is macropores increased from 0 34 to 0 43 however the micropores only increased slightly from 0 48 to 0 51 these results verify that the mineral dissolution no longer occurs primarily in micropores but transitions to mesopores and macropores the effect of mineral dissolution at this stage does not only cause an increase in porosity but a synergistic increase in porosity and permeability therefore the relationship between permeability and porosity at this stage follows the description of the kozeny carman equation fig 18 verifies the correctness of this positively correlated relationship 5 conclusions in this study we used the rock seepage coupled nmr online analysis and imaging system platform to conduct an online experimental study on the pore structure evolution and seepage characteristics of carbonate rocks under the coupling effects of stress and reactive fluids the evolutionary relationship between porosity and permeability in carbonate rocks during the long term infiltration process is discussed based on the obtained porosity pore size distribution and permeability from a microscopic perspective the quantitative characterization of multiscale pore volumes revealed the dominant mechanisms of stress sensitivity and mineral dissolution at different evolutionary stages 1 during the initial stage of the test 0 156 h the pore volume of the carbonate samples was significantly compressed the permeability evolution showed strong stress sensitivity with a simultaneous decrease in porosity and permeability the inversion analysis of the t2 spectrum revealed that the most significant decrease in pore volume was the micropores which had a more pronounced stress sensitivity resulting in poor pore connectivity the evolution of permeability with pore structure at this stage is more accurately predicted by developing a permeability model that considers multiscale pore compression coefficients 2 in the middle stage of the test 156 400 h the carbonate samples gradually dissolved as the reactive fluid was continuously injected inversion analysis of the t2 profile revealed that mineral dissolution occurs mainly in the micropores within the grain the exfoliation of minerals with seepage initiation and re precipitation causes local blockage of seepage channels resulting in a decrease in permeability there was a negative correlation between porosity and permeability 3 in the later stage of the test 400 720 h the mineral dissolution of the carbonate samples transitioned from micropores to mesopores and macropores a synergistic increase in the permeability and porosity was observed owing to the progressive dominance of the dissolution mechanism credit authorship contribution statement huimin wang conceptualization methodology writing original draft qing zhou jinchang sheng writing review editing supervision yulong

2409,the progress in intensive production over recent decades have greatly altered land use patterns often resulting in simplified landscapes intensive production is particularly necessary in mountainous areas where arable land resources are scarce but it is a pervasive concern that landscape simplification will increase pressure for mountain flood disaster control in this study rainfall runoff and sediment process data from 1995 to 2015 were observed for a typical intensively developed mountainous watershed data were used to investigate the effects of intensive production on the hydrological response characteristics discharge suspended sediment concentration runoff depth and sediment load under three different rainfall regimes namely rainfall regimes i long duration light rainfall intensity ii short duration high rainfall intensity and iii long duration high amount orchard area in the watershed increased from 4 43 to 37 44 under intensive production from 1995 to 2015 intensive production led to high intensity land use as well as homogenization and simplification of the landscape which inevitably caused changes in hydrological processes in the mountainous watershed intensive production resulted in a significant downward trend in runoff coefficients p 0 001 and sediment loads p 0 006 under the three different rainfall regimes average sediment concentration decreased significantly and continuously 2394 to 12 53 kg m 3 during the 20 years of the study and average runoff fluctuated but decreased from 0 218 m3 s in 2000 to 0 093 m3 s in 2015 according to hysteresis analysis the proportion of counterclockwise loop events decreased after intensive production but remained the dominant circulation mode 40 the proportion of events in eight figure loops increased from 0 06 before intensification to 25 the increase in complex circulation implied that development of intensive production increased the sources of sediment in the watershed the study increases understanding of hydrological responses to intensive production in complex mountainous watersheds and provides practical references for sustainable watershed management and optimization of land use allocation keywords intensive production hydrological response rainfall regimes landscape simplification citrus plantation data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction globally mountainous areas account for 24 of the land area and provide resources for the survival and development of nearly 900 million people fao 2021 owing to the complex and variable topography and large relative elevation difference the land area available for large scale and high intensity production and utilization in mountainous areas should be utilized more sufficiently wang et al 2022 under the circumstance of more scarce cultivated land resources in mountainous areas intensive production is the inevitable choice of land use mode in mountainous areas under multiple pressures such as food security and economic development foley et al 2005 garnett et al 2013 kopittke et al 2019 moreover mountainous areas also contain fresh water resources and have a complex climate with more responsive hydrological processes carbutt and thompson 2021 with the large scale expansion of intensive production in mountainous areas it is unavoidable to cause changes in topography landscape vegetation and other underlying surface characteristics which have implications for hydrological processes and water resources management in the context of global climate change with frequent extreme rainfall events it is of urgent and practical significance to understand the hydrological response characteristics under the intensive production of mountainous watershed in order to better understand the water security and sustainable management of the watershed intensive production with high intensity and homogeneous land use have changed watershed landscape from fragmented and complex to less fragmented and simple by reducing structural differences in the landscape simplification of the landscape is one of the most significant features of intensive production cerdà et al 2018 li et al 2021a b landscape simplification resulting from intensive production is decreases in the diversity of crop patches and landscape scales and increases in the size and connectivity of crop patches meehan et al 2011 in addition landscape simplification can be characterized by the proportion of target crop area jonason et al 2013 landscape simplification is occurring all over the world for example soybean expansion and intensive production in the amazon basin fearnside 2001 gasparri and grau 2009 oil palm cultivation in southeast asia wicke et al 2011 and agricultural intensification in europe stoate et al 2001 previous studies have focused on the effects of intensive production on vegetation coverage neill et al 2013 slope erosion li et al 2020a li et al 2021a b soil quality yi et al 2022 and irrigation demands salmoral et al 2020 however although arable land resources in mountainous areas are scarce research on effects of intensification on watershed hydrology and sediment processes is relatively lacking processes of sink and erosion and sediment production in complex landscape watersheds are complex and variable as a result runoff and sediment yield are also highly variable influenced by differences in the spatial configuration of watershed land use and the heterogeneity of landscape patterns jin et al 2020 with optimizing of arrangement of patches of different land use types watershed runoff can be significantly reduced ziegler et al 2007 more fragmented and complex land use types may significantly increase sediment deposition output shi et al 2013 however the originally complex mountainous conditions have changed to homogenized landscape due to intensive production and hydrological response characteristics of mountain watersheds in this context are not yet clear hydrological response changes are a significant signal of land use intensification allan 2004 variable precipitation and intensive production processes increase uncertainty in the hydrological response of watersheds and the risk of extreme rainfall hazards during spatial temporal coupling marcinkowski et al 2022 strohmenger et al 2022 watershed hydrological characteristics depend heavily on underlying surface features such as topography soil properties and vegetation intensive production often causes changes in those underlying surfaces at the same time intensive production reflects the characteristics of human activities it changes the relationship between water supply and water demand and directly affects the runoff of the watershed neill et al 2013 rizzo et al 2020 geology and long term landscape evolution generally control watershed geomorphological characteristics berghuijs et al 2014 whereas factors affecting rainfall are complex and variable the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is the main factor affecting runoff and sediment in watersheds cristiano et al 2017 morin et al 2006 rainfall intensity directly controls the runoff production and infiltration rates whereas rainfall intensity duration and spatial and temporal characteristics determine the surface runoff flow processes and scouring of the ground surface although previous studies focused on the effect of total precipitation on changes in hydrologic conditions wei et al 2016 however individual rainfall factors frequently do not reflect rainfall effects on hydrologic responses rainfall regimes are defined by amount intensity and duration of precipitation but more importantly different rainfall patterns have different effects on watershed runoff and sediment load and water sediment relationships cao et al 2021 gao et al 2017 for example heavy rainfall can increase flood flows and number of flood events prosdocimi et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which different rainfall regimes affect the watershed hydrological response steep slope planting is a commonly practiced in hilly and mountainous areas around the world cerdà et al 2018 xu et al 2018 intensive production is the current trend of land use change in mountainous areas and is essential practice to develop sustainable agricultural riechers et al 2020 to determine complex hydrological responses to intensive production under different rainfall regimes more detailed and accurate data are required than those currently available in this study the effects of intensive production and variation in rainfall on changes in of watershed hydrological response in typical mountainous watersheds in the three gorges reservoir area were investigated using a large amount of hydrological monitoring data collected over the past 20 years the main objective of this study were to 1 analysis of landscape simplification as a result of intensive production 2 explore the effects of intensive production on runoff depth sediment load discharge and suspended sediment concentration under different rainfall regimes 3 determine effects of intensive production on hysteresis loops dynamics under different rainfall regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wangjiaqiao watershed 31 5 n to 31 9 n 110 40 e to 110 43 e fig 1 is at the end of the three gorges reservoir area hubei province china and has a total drainage area of approximately 16 7 km2 monthly average rainfall and temperature distribution are very uniform average annual precipitation is 1016 mm 70 of which occurs between may and september watershed elevations and slope gradients range from 184 to 1180 m and from 2 to 58 respectively paddy soils and purple soils are the major soil types in the area with forest orchard cropland and residential land the major land use types the wangjiaqiao watershed has three villages and a population of 5130 in the past 20 years driven by economic benefits and policies production methods of farmers in the small wangjiaqiao watershed have gradually changed from crop cultivation to citrus production 2 2 data collection field surveys were conducted in 1995 2005 and 2015 and basic characteristics of land use and natural environmental conditions of the watershed were obtained aerial photos 1995 spot5 images 2005 and gaofen 2 images 2015 were first resampled to 2 5 m resolution in order to obtain land use and landscape pattern classification information of the study area calibration and atmospheric correction for gas aerosol and cirrus cloud effects were performed according to administrative boundaries of the study area image mosaicking and clipping were performed according to research needs the landscape classification used primary classes combined with secondary classes to divide the landscape into eight land use types woodland sparse woodland orchard grassland cropland residential land road and water landscape metrics were selected to determine effects of intensive production on landscape pattern the landscape pattern index is based on highly concentrated landscape pattern information and is a simple indicator for quantitative analysis of landscape structural composition and spatial configuration zhao et al 2019 zhou and li 2015 to comprehensively reflect spatial pattern characteristics of the landscape and avoid redundancy of landscape pattern information landscape metrics at the type level were selected to analyze landscape pattern characteristics in conjunction with the study area profile the software spatial pattern analysis program for categorical and continuous maps or fragstats v4 2 university of massachusetts usa is a spatial pattern analysis program used to quantify the structure of landscapes and it was used to calculate landscape metrics using land use data in the study area the applied metrics were patch density pd large patch index lpi edge density ed landscape shape lsi aggregation index ai contagion index contag splitting index split shannon s diversity index shdi the ecological significance and related algorithms of each index are presented in the supplementary material rain gage stations in the upper wangjiaqiao watershed provided records from 1995 to 2015 a continuously recording water level stage recorder and a silt sampler metal type were used to record discharge and sediment complemented by manual samples respectively the water stage was measured and transformed into discharge by using a calibrated rating curve obtained from periodic flow measurements suspended sediment concentrations sscs were determined using a gravimetric method water samples were vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and residues were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h weight of dried residues and initial sample volumes were used to obtain ssc then the total suspended sediment load tl was calculated from the ssc and discharge q and the runoff coefficient rc was calculated from surface runoff mm and precipitation mm the classic hydrograph separation method mcdonnell 2009 was used to separate runoff into storm flow and base flow categories paired ssc q data were obtained during rainfall runoff events for a total of 206 rainfall events paired ssc q samples were collected from 1996 to 2015 in addition q max q min q mean and sscmean of each year in the 20 years were determined the ssc q hysteresis loops proposed by williams williams 1989 were used to study internal erosion and sediment yield processes of the watershed to analyze the source of sediment in a flood event in general hysteresis loops have different shapes including clockwise counterclockwise figure eight and complex loops and different loop patterns indicate various potential sources of sediment and sediment depletion evaluating suspended sediment concentration discharge sscq hysteresis can provide an additional way to understand changes in sediment sources sediment reserves and flow pathways sherriff et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 2 3 clustering approach a clustering approach was used to classify rainfall events and to perform further statistical analysis wei et al 2009 fang et al 2012 huang et al 2018 there are two methods of clustering hierarchical clustering and nonhierarchical clustering k means clustering the k means clustering method is more suitable for a large number of cases and a cluster number must be determined before classification thus k means clustering was used to divide 206 rainfall events with three variables into three rainfall regimes in this study the most appropriate cluster number was chosen through trial and error normally the classification must meet the anova criterion of significance at p 0 001 the three rainfall variables included rainfall depth p maximum 30 min rainfall intensity i30 and rainfall duration d rainfall events in the 20 years were divided into three rainfall regimes as shown in table 1 rainfall regime i occurred 81 times and the cumulative rainfall was 2 991 2 mm rainfall regime ii occurred 98 times and the cumulative rainfall reached 2 649 5 mm and rainfall regime iii occurred 27 times and the cumulative rainfall reached 1 569 0 mm average rainfall and rainfall duration of the three rainfall regimes were in the order rainfall regime iii rainfall regime i rainfall regime ii the i30 was in the following descending order rainfall regime ii rainfall regime iii rainfall regime i rainfall regime i included rainfall events of moderate rainfall 36 mm and medium duration 1030 min rainfall regime ii included events of short duration 342 min and small rainfall 27 mm with the highest frequency 98 and rainfall regime iii included long duration 2287 min and heavy rainfall 58 mm events with p d and i30 used in cluster analysis rainfall and rainfall duration were significantly different at the level of 0 001 and i30 was significantly different at the level of 0 05 therefore k means cluster analysis was effective at dividing rainfall regime results fig 2 shows distributions of cumulative rainfall frequency fig 2a rainfall fig 2b and the i30 fig 2c for the three rainfall regimes in four periods 1995 2000 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 cumulative rainfall of rainfall regime iii was less than that of the other two regimes because of the relatively low frequency fig 2d shows the distribution of i30 and duration of 206 rainfall events which indicated rainfall with relatively large i30 did not continue for a long time rainfall duration with the i30 greater than 30 mm lasted 10 h which was a decisive factor in the clustering of different rainfall regimes in the wangjiaqiao watershed of the three gorges reservoir area 2 4 statistical analyses the mann kendall test proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1957 was used to identify trends in p q and tl during the 20 year study period mann kendall tests were performed in matlab 7 0 math works natick usa statistical analyses were also conducted in spss 21 0 ibm co armonk ny usa and figures were prepared by originpro 2022 originlab ma usa anova was used to test for significant differences among rainfall regimes and degree of intensification with differences significant at p 0 05 the software fragstats a widely accepted tool to quantify landscape metrics was used to analyze landscape patterns 3 results 3 1 intensive production and landscape simplification the dynamic evolution of intensive watershed development was shown in fig 3 monoculture citrus production showed intensive development with rapid expansion of the orchard area in the watershed which increased from only 4 43 of the watershed area in 1995 to 37 44 in 2015 table 2 the area increased by 8 5 times to 6 16 km2 indicating remarkable simplification of the landscape orchards gradually evolved from sporadic distribution in 1995 to contiguous development in 2015 thus production mode of farmers gradually shifted from crop to citrus cultivation in the watershed from 1995 to 2015 landscape structure of the watershed changed significantly trending toward landscape simplification table 2 trends in variation in pd lsi and ai were generally consistent at the orchard type level decreasing to minimums in 2015 shannon s diversity index increased continuously from 1995 to 2015 and reached a maximum in 2015 the segmentation indices split and ed of orchards decreased whereas the lpi and contag continued to increase 3 2 effects of intensive production on runoff and sediment load under different rainfall regimes the characteristics of runoff and suspended sediment under the three rainfall regimes are indicated in table 3 average runoff coefficients of different rainfall regimes were ranked in the order rainfall regime i rainfall regime ii rainfall regime iii the order of the average erosion amount was rainfall regime iii rainfall regime i rainfall regime ii rainfall regime iii produced the largest cumulative erosion amount 2574 55 t with large accumulated discharge 156 26 mm although rainfall regime i had the largest cumulative rainfall of 2991 2 mm the amount of erosion was small at only 1289 78 t cumulative rainfall of rainfall regime i was similar to that of rainfall regime ii but cumulative surface runoff was different linear trend analysis of the rainfall runoff sediment data series in the watershed between 1995 and 2015 showed a decreasing trend in runoff coefficients and sediment loads under all three rainfall regimes fig 4 shows schematic variation in runoff coefficients and total sediment load over time for the three rainfall regimes trends in decreases in runoff coefficients and sediment load for each rainfall regime were generally consistent wide variation was observed in runoff coefficients or sediment loads among different rainfall regimes under rainfall regime i there was a significant decrease in sediment load sediment load under rainfall regimes i and iii decreased in magnitude compared with that under rainfall regime ii whereas it decreased only slightly under rainfall regime ii rainfall events that produced high runoff and sediment loads all occurred before 2005 according to two way anova results table 4 tl was significantly different among rainfall regimes p 0 008 and degrees of intensification p 0 006 however significant differences in rcs were found only among degrees of intensification p 0 001 there were no significant interactions between rainfall regimes and orchard area for rcs and tls 3 3 effects of intensive production on suspended sediment concentration discharge ssc q dynamics under different rainfall regimes watershed runoff and sediment transport indicators from 1995 to 2015 were analyzed statistically fig 5 the qmean sscmean qmax and qmin all showed fluctuating but decreasing trends during the 20 years the sscmean decreased continuously 2394 to 12 53 g m 3 during the 20 years and the qmean decreased in the process of decrease from 0 218 m3 s 1 in 2000 to 0 016 m3 s 1 in 2005 then the qmean increased to 0 123 m3 s 1 in the next five years and ultimately the annual average runoff decreased to 0 093 m3 s 1in 2015 the trends in qmax and qmean were similar with both showing fluctuating but decreasing trends runoff depth and sediment transport modulus also showed decreasing trends with runoff depth decreasing from 372 38 mm to 137 77 mm and average sediment transport modulus decreasing from 412 8 t km 2 a to 52 8 t km 2 a from the period 1995 2000 to the period 2010 2015 within the watershed rc and sl as well as qmax and sscmax decreased after intensive production thus intensive production was expected to change the hysteresis behavior of runoff and sediment loss different types of hysteresis loop counts for the two periods are presented in fig 6 in general the counterclockwise loop was the dominant hysteresis loop pattern throughout the study period accounting for 49 51 of the counts with 102 occurrences the main characteristic of of this pattern was that when sscmax and qmax occurred at the same time the ssc was higher in the falling water process at the same flow rate than in the rising water phase the hydrograph showed that the ssc was lower in the rising water section than in the falling water section the next most abundant hysteresis loop patterns were clockwise 28 16 and figure eight 15 05 loops and followed by the complex cycle 7 28 however the proportion of events with counterclockwise loops decreased from 57 66 during 1995 2005 to 40 00 during 2006 2015 under rainfall regime iii figure eight loops were relatively more common three of five events than other loops after intensive production whereas counterclockwise loops were the most common fifteen of nineteen events before intensive production spatial and temporal distributions of sediment transport processes and sediment sources were highly variable which led to analysis of specific examples of the types of hysteresis loops in typical flood process events in the watershed fig 6 shows examples of typical runoff sediment hysteresis relations for the three rainfall regimes before and after intensive production in sequence under similar rainfall conditions intensive production led to a decrease in sediment concentration as well as changes in hysteresis pattern after the peak the ssc under rainfall regime i decreased more rapidly than runoff and tended to change sharply fig 7 a d however the ssc under rainfall regimes ii and iii rapidly increased and slowly decreased therefore the amount of sediment produced by rainfall regimes ii and iii might be more limited by sediment transport capacity of the water flow whereas the amount of sediment produced by rainfall regime i was more likely controlled by the sediment detachment process 4 discussion in our study intensive production means that in the complex mountainous environment of the three gorges reservoir area in china traditional decentralized management crop land had been gradually replaced by concentrated and continuous large scale citrus orchards under the guidance of a series of ecological projects and long term support policies i and the intensification resulted in decreases in watershed runoff and sediment production intensive production changed the vegetation cover of the region which contributed to changes in topography and geomorphology before 2000 the cultivation pattern in the region was complex and fragmented with more scattered plots steep slopes and paddy fields as a result there were high levels of runoff qmin of 0 218 m3 s 1 in 2000 and sediment concentration sscmean of 2394 g m 3 in 2000 from the watershed from 2000 a series of ecological projects and long term supportive policies were implemented in the tgra xu et al 2020 and regarding policy traditional scattered management of crop land have gradually been replaced by concentrated and continuous large scale citrus orchards the current citrus cultivation area in the three gorges reservoir area exceeds 35 of the agricultural land area the grain for green project in wangjiaqiao watershed is manifested as transferred paddy fields into economic forests resulting in an increase in the area of citrus orchards and 8 5 times increase in the area of single land use of orchards the orchard has similar structure and function of forest land in the first place with better ecological benefits intensive citrus orchards as plantations forest have the samilar ecological benefits such as soil conservation and water and soil conservation as natural forests but citrus plantations have higher economic benefits hua et al 2022 van dijk et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 the landscape structure changed significantly with consolidation of scattered plots and simplification of the watershed landscape the runoff and sediment production of the watershed showed a clear trend of decrease over 20 years intensification of agricultural production is one of the most profound human caused changes to the global environment neill et al 2013 effects of different types of intensification on watershed hydrology and sediment transport are also important in 2000 forest land area accounted for 48 6 of the area in the small study watershed fang et al 2012 and arable land 18 3 and paddy land 16 3 were also widely distributed under similar rainfall conditions total runoff was two to three times higher and erosion was three to seven times higher in 2000 than 2015 other studies also observe differences in the effects of different types of intensive production on watershed erosion and sediment yield in the southeastern amazon expansion and intensification of soybean agriculture alter watershed hydrology by causing changes in land cover water balance and nutrient inputs fearnside 2001 neill et al 2013 because of reductions in evaporation total watershed runoff with intensive soybean planting increased by three to four times compared with that in forest with intensification of sugarcane planting area in guangxi china a significant increase in farm size is partly responsible for the 46 to 88 and 269 to 301 increase in road and gully erosion respectively in the sugarcane growing watershed li et al 2020a b the expansion of farm scale reduces the heterogeneity of farmland which may accelerate soil erosion and especially river erosion and related nutrient loss the findings of this study present a conclusion contrary to previous intensive heavy intensive production areas that usually produce large amounts of runoff and sediment which reflects the suitability of citrus as a plant with both ecological and economic benefits in intensive production in the context of scarce arable land resources in mountainous areas intensive production from traditional crop land to crop land or from forest land to crop land may increase the risk of soil erosion but the use and implementation of complementary measures for intensive production in the corresponding series of studies mitigates this contradiction different rainfall regimes have different erosion characteristics and responses to differences in rainfall changed dramatically as similar dramatic changes occurred in the watershed landscape structure over 20 years within the study watershed a few rainfall events resulted in significant runoff and sediment loads rainfall regime iii included only 27 rainfall events but resulted in 34 26 of runoff and 43 15 of eroded sediment with relatively long rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity by contrast moderate intensity rainfall resulted in limited sediment production despite the large percentage of rainfall frequency and volume for this type of rainfall this result emphasizes the importance of rainfall type as a major cause of runoff and erosion the rapid decline under rainfall regimes i and iii was in contrast to the gentle decline under rainfall regime ii and the difference was primarily due to lower single rainfall duration and amount of rainfall under rainfall regime ii sediment yield at the outlet of a watershed reflects the sum of all erosion and deposition processes occurring within the watershed huang et al 2018 restrepo et al 2006 counterclockwise hysteresis occurs when the peak runoff is ahead of the peak sediment concentration which also indicates that sediment originates farther from the outlet of the watershed tian et al 2016 under rainfall regime iii high intensity long duration rainfall the figure eight loop was relatively more common three of five events with the figure eight type of hysteresis the sediment stored at the watershed outlet was rapidly consumed at the beginning of the rainfall period resulting in a clockwise hysteresis as rainfall intensity increased infiltration excess runoff became the dominant runoff production pattern in the watershed and sediment concentration decreased faster than runoff resulting in a counterclockwise hysteresis huang et al 2018 javed et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 in the study watershed the counterclockwise loop was the most important hysteresis loop pattern in the entire study period under similar rainfall conditions landscape simplification not only led to the reductions in sediment concentration but also increasingly complex hysteresis loop patterns under the same rainfall regime the changes induced by landscape simplification were also reflected in runoff sediment relations and sediment sources therefore with increasing intensification rainfall leads to transformation of the source sink function of the watershed and the more complex the hysteresis relation is the more extensive the source of sediment although li et al 2009 focused on the effects of changes in land use or vegetation cover on total soil erosion sediment concentration is also important in river ecology and water quality newcombe and macdonald 1991 the changes caused by landscape simplification are also reflected in the runoff sediment relations and sediment sources with increasing area of large scale land management fragmented arable land is transformed by land preparation the topography becomes gentler and drainage of slopes is developed at scale and thus the original runoff sediment transport paths change runoff and sediment on a slope can converge and move rapidly to the hydrological outlet anderson et al 2010 however because of topographic constraints although the three gorges reservoir area has a relatively high proportion of large scale citrus orchards with a slope water system there remain unprepared land on slopes and steep land planted with citrus on natural slopes for citrus orchards on natural slopes lack of supporting slope water systems and long planting slopes intensify slope erosion and nutrient loss thereby increasing sources of sediment the hydrological connectivity of a watershed increases when high intensity and long duration rainfall occurs although intensification increased erosion sources in the watershed citrus orchards have higher surface cover than intensively produced cropland which can reduce raindrop spattering and runoff scour energy thus the intensity of erosion decreased and the total amount of erosion continued to show a decreasing trend as shown in this study integrating the effects of intensive production and rainfall regimes on watershed hydrology can provide a more balanced understanding of sustainable development of intensive production and water management in mountainous watersheds although intensive production bring about the landscape simplification such a single intensive production does not threaten the water security and environmental security of mountainous watersheds taking into account economic benefits and ecological safety intensive production is imperative and worthy of replication around the world 5 conclusions in a typical mountainous watershed in the three gorges reservoir area with intensive agricultural production hydrologic response characteristics were investigated under different rainfall regimes over the past 20 years in general from 1995 to 2015 the monoculture caused by intensification led to landscape simplification within the watershed with orchard area increasing from 4 43 to 37 44 of the total area two hundred and six erosive rainfall events were classified into three rainfall regimes based on rainfall amount rainfall duration and maximum 30 min rain intensity using a k means clustering method rainfall regime iii included only 27 rainfall events but caused 34 26 of runoff and 43 15 of eroded sediment because of relatively long rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity according to anova landscape simplification induced by intensive production resulted in significant downward trends in runoff coefficients p 0 001 and sediment loads p 0 006 under the three rainfall regimes in comparisons of the magnitude of runoff sediment parameters before and after intensification qmax sscmax rc and sl all showed decreasing trends after intensification of production hysteresis analysis indicated that counterclockwise loops were the dominant hysteresis loop patterns throughout the study period under rainfall regime iii eight figure loops were relatively more common three of five events than other patterns after intensive production whereas counterclockwise loops were the most common before intensive production 15 of 19 events the above results implied that with increasing intensification rainfall led to transformation of the source sink function of the watershed in addition with more complex hysteresis relations sediment sources were more extensive when high intensity and long duration rainfall occurred hydrological connectivity of the watershed increased and intensification led to additional sources of erosion in the watershed although erosion intensity and total erosion

2409,the progress in intensive production over recent decades have greatly altered land use patterns often resulting in simplified landscapes intensive production is particularly necessary in mountainous areas where arable land resources are scarce but it is a pervasive concern that landscape simplification will increase pressure for mountain flood disaster control in this study rainfall runoff and sediment process data from 1995 to 2015 were observed for a typical intensively developed mountainous watershed data were used to investigate the effects of intensive production on the hydrological response characteristics discharge suspended sediment concentration runoff depth and sediment load under three different rainfall regimes namely rainfall regimes i long duration light rainfall intensity ii short duration high rainfall intensity and iii long duration high amount orchard area in the watershed increased from 4 43 to 37 44 under intensive production from 1995 to 2015 intensive production led to high intensity land use as well as homogenization and simplification of the landscape which inevitably caused changes in hydrological processes in the mountainous watershed intensive production resulted in a significant downward trend in runoff coefficients p 0 001 and sediment loads p 0 006 under the three different rainfall regimes average sediment concentration decreased significantly and continuously 2394 to 12 53 kg m 3 during the 20 years of the study and average runoff fluctuated but decreased from 0 218 m3 s in 2000 to 0 093 m3 s in 2015 according to hysteresis analysis the proportion of counterclockwise loop events decreased after intensive production but remained the dominant circulation mode 40 the proportion of events in eight figure loops increased from 0 06 before intensification to 25 the increase in complex circulation implied that development of intensive production increased the sources of sediment in the watershed the study increases understanding of hydrological responses to intensive production in complex mountainous watersheds and provides practical references for sustainable watershed management and optimization of land use allocation keywords intensive production hydrological response rainfall regimes landscape simplification citrus plantation data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction globally mountainous areas account for 24 of the land area and provide resources for the survival and development of nearly 900 million people fao 2021 owing to the complex and variable topography and large relative elevation difference the land area available for large scale and high intensity production and utilization in mountainous areas should be utilized more sufficiently wang et al 2022 under the circumstance of more scarce cultivated land resources in mountainous areas intensive production is the inevitable choice of land use mode in mountainous areas under multiple pressures such as food security and economic development foley et al 2005 garnett et al 2013 kopittke et al 2019 moreover mountainous areas also contain fresh water resources and have a complex climate with more responsive hydrological processes carbutt and thompson 2021 with the large scale expansion of intensive production in mountainous areas it is unavoidable to cause changes in topography landscape vegetation and other underlying surface characteristics which have implications for hydrological processes and water resources management in the context of global climate change with frequent extreme rainfall events it is of urgent and practical significance to understand the hydrological response characteristics under the intensive production of mountainous watershed in order to better understand the water security and sustainable management of the watershed intensive production with high intensity and homogeneous land use have changed watershed landscape from fragmented and complex to less fragmented and simple by reducing structural differences in the landscape simplification of the landscape is one of the most significant features of intensive production cerdà et al 2018 li et al 2021a b landscape simplification resulting from intensive production is decreases in the diversity of crop patches and landscape scales and increases in the size and connectivity of crop patches meehan et al 2011 in addition landscape simplification can be characterized by the proportion of target crop area jonason et al 2013 landscape simplification is occurring all over the world for example soybean expansion and intensive production in the amazon basin fearnside 2001 gasparri and grau 2009 oil palm cultivation in southeast asia wicke et al 2011 and agricultural intensification in europe stoate et al 2001 previous studies have focused on the effects of intensive production on vegetation coverage neill et al 2013 slope erosion li et al 2020a li et al 2021a b soil quality yi et al 2022 and irrigation demands salmoral et al 2020 however although arable land resources in mountainous areas are scarce research on effects of intensification on watershed hydrology and sediment processes is relatively lacking processes of sink and erosion and sediment production in complex landscape watersheds are complex and variable as a result runoff and sediment yield are also highly variable influenced by differences in the spatial configuration of watershed land use and the heterogeneity of landscape patterns jin et al 2020 with optimizing of arrangement of patches of different land use types watershed runoff can be significantly reduced ziegler et al 2007 more fragmented and complex land use types may significantly increase sediment deposition output shi et al 2013 however the originally complex mountainous conditions have changed to homogenized landscape due to intensive production and hydrological response characteristics of mountain watersheds in this context are not yet clear hydrological response changes are a significant signal of land use intensification allan 2004 variable precipitation and intensive production processes increase uncertainty in the hydrological response of watersheds and the risk of extreme rainfall hazards during spatial temporal coupling marcinkowski et al 2022 strohmenger et al 2022 watershed hydrological characteristics depend heavily on underlying surface features such as topography soil properties and vegetation intensive production often causes changes in those underlying surfaces at the same time intensive production reflects the characteristics of human activities it changes the relationship between water supply and water demand and directly affects the runoff of the watershed neill et al 2013 rizzo et al 2020 geology and long term landscape evolution generally control watershed geomorphological characteristics berghuijs et al 2014 whereas factors affecting rainfall are complex and variable the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is the main factor affecting runoff and sediment in watersheds cristiano et al 2017 morin et al 2006 rainfall intensity directly controls the runoff production and infiltration rates whereas rainfall intensity duration and spatial and temporal characteristics determine the surface runoff flow processes and scouring of the ground surface although previous studies focused on the effect of total precipitation on changes in hydrologic conditions wei et al 2016 however individual rainfall factors frequently do not reflect rainfall effects on hydrologic responses rainfall regimes are defined by amount intensity and duration of precipitation but more importantly different rainfall patterns have different effects on watershed runoff and sediment load and water sediment relationships cao et al 2021 gao et al 2017 for example heavy rainfall can increase flood flows and number of flood events prosdocimi et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which different rainfall regimes affect the watershed hydrological response steep slope planting is a commonly practiced in hilly and mountainous areas around the world cerdà et al 2018 xu et al 2018 intensive production is the current trend of land use change in mountainous areas and is essential practice to develop sustainable agricultural riechers et al 2020 to determine complex hydrological responses to intensive production under different rainfall regimes more detailed and accurate data are required than those currently available in this study the effects of intensive production and variation in rainfall on changes in of watershed hydrological response in typical mountainous watersheds in the three gorges reservoir area were investigated using a large amount of hydrological monitoring data collected over the past 20 years the main objective of this study were to 1 analysis of landscape simplification as a result of intensive production 2 explore the effects of intensive production on runoff depth sediment load discharge and suspended sediment concentration under different rainfall regimes 3 determine effects of intensive production on hysteresis loops dynamics under different rainfall regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wangjiaqiao watershed 31 5 n to 31 9 n 110 40 e to 110 43 e fig 1 is at the end of the three gorges reservoir area hubei province china and has a total drainage area of approximately 16 7 km2 monthly average rainfall and temperature distribution are very uniform average annual precipitation is 1016 mm 70 of which occurs between may and september watershed elevations and slope gradients range from 184 to 1180 m and from 2 to 58 respectively paddy soils and purple soils are the major soil types in the area with forest orchard cropland and residential land the major land use types the wangjiaqiao watershed has three villages and a population of 5130 in the past 20 years driven by economic benefits and policies production methods of farmers in the small wangjiaqiao watershed have gradually changed from crop cultivation to citrus production 2 2 data collection field surveys were conducted in 1995 2005 and 2015 and basic characteristics of land use and natural environmental conditions of the watershed were obtained aerial photos 1995 spot5 images 2005 and gaofen 2 images 2015 were first resampled to 2 5 m resolution in order to obtain land use and landscape pattern classification information of the study area calibration and atmospheric correction for gas aerosol and cirrus cloud effects were performed according to administrative boundaries of the study area image mosaicking and clipping were performed according to research needs the landscape classification used primary classes combined with secondary classes to divide the landscape into eight land use types woodland sparse woodland orchard grassland cropland residential land road and water landscape metrics were selected to determine effects of intensive production on landscape pattern the landscape pattern index is based on highly concentrated landscape pattern information and is a simple indicator for quantitative analysis of landscape structural composition and spatial configuration zhao et al 2019 zhou and li 2015 to comprehensively reflect spatial pattern characteristics of the landscape and avoid redundancy of landscape pattern information landscape metrics at the type level were selected to analyze landscape pattern characteristics in conjunction with the study area profile the software spatial pattern analysis program for categorical and continuous maps or fragstats v4 2 university of massachusetts usa is a spatial pattern analysis program used to quantify the structure of landscapes and it was used to calculate landscape metrics using land use data in the study area the applied metrics were patch density pd large patch index lpi edge density ed landscape shape lsi aggregation index ai contagion index contag splitting index split shannon s diversity index shdi the ecological significance and related algorithms of each index are presented in the supplementary material rain gage stations in the upper wangjiaqiao watershed provided records from 1995 to 2015 a continuously recording water level stage recorder and a silt sampler metal type were used to record discharge and sediment complemented by manual samples respectively the water stage was measured and transformed into discharge by using a calibrated rating curve obtained from periodic flow measurements suspended sediment concentrations sscs were determined using a gravimetric method water samples were vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and residues were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h weight of dried residues and initial sample volumes were used to obtain ssc then the total suspended sediment load tl was calculated from the ssc and discharge q and the runoff coefficient rc was calculated from surface runoff mm and precipitation mm the classic hydrograph separation method mcdonnell 2009 was used to separate runoff into storm flow and base flow categories paired ssc q data were obtained during rainfall runoff events for a total of 206 rainfall events paired ssc q samples were collected from 1996 to 2015 in addition q max q min q mean and sscmean of each year in the 20 years were determined the ssc q hysteresis loops proposed by williams williams 1989 were used to study internal erosion and sediment yield processes of the watershed to analyze the source of sediment in a flood event in general hysteresis loops have different shapes including clockwise counterclockwise figure eight and complex loops and different loop patterns indicate various potential sources of sediment and sediment depletion evaluating suspended sediment concentration discharge sscq hysteresis can provide an additional way to understand changes in sediment sources sediment reserves and flow pathways sherriff et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 2 3 clustering approach a clustering approach was used to classify rainfall events and to perform further statistical analysis wei et al 2009 fang et al 2012 huang et al 2018 there are two methods of clustering hierarchical clustering and nonhierarchical clustering k means clustering the k means clustering method is more suitable for a large number of cases and a cluster number must be determined before classification thus k means clustering was used to divide 206 rainfall events with three variables into three rainfall regimes in this study the most appropriate cluster number was chosen through trial and error normally the classification must meet the anova criterion of significance at p 0 001 the three rainfall variables included rainfall depth p maximum 30 min rainfall intensity i30 and rainfall duration d rainfall events in the 20 years were divided into three rainfall regimes as shown in table 1 rainfall regime i occurred 81 times and the cumulative rainfall was 2 991 2 mm rainfall regime ii occurred 98 times and the cumulative rainfall reached 2 649 5 mm and rainfall regime iii occurred 27 times and the cumulative rainfall reached 1 569 0 mm average rainfall and rainfall duration of the three rainfall regimes were in the order rainfall regime iii rainfall regime i rainfall regime ii the i30 was in the following descending order rainfall regime ii rainfall regime iii rainfall regime i rainfall regime i included rainfall events of moderate rainfall 36 mm and medium duration 1030 min rainfall regime ii included events of short duration 342 min and small rainfall 27 mm with the highest frequency 98 and rainfall regime iii included long duration 2287 min and heavy rainfall 58 mm events with p d and i30 used in cluster analysis rainfall and rainfall duration were significantly different at the level of 0 001 and i30 was significantly different at the level of 0 05 therefore k means cluster analysis was effective at dividing rainfall regime results fig 2 shows distributions of cumulative rainfall frequency fig 2a rainfall fig 2b and the i30 fig 2c for the three rainfall regimes in four periods 1995 2000 2001 2005 2006 2010 2011 2015 cumulative rainfall of rainfall regime iii was less than that of the other two regimes because of the relatively low frequency fig 2d shows the distribution of i30 and duration of 206 rainfall events which indicated rainfall with relatively large i30 did not continue for a long time rainfall duration with the i30 greater than 30 mm lasted 10 h which was a decisive factor in the clustering of different rainfall regimes in the wangjiaqiao watershed of the three gorges reservoir area 2 4 statistical analyses the mann kendall test proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1957 was used to identify trends in p q and tl during the 20 year study period mann kendall tests were performed in matlab 7 0 math works natick usa statistical analyses were also conducted in spss 21 0 ibm co armonk ny usa and figures were prepared by originpro 2022 originlab ma usa anova was used to test for significant differences among rainfall regimes and degree of intensification with differences significant at p 0 05 the software fragstats a widely accepted tool to quantify landscape metrics was used to analyze landscape patterns 3 results 3 1 intensive production and landscape simplification the dynamic evolution of intensive watershed development was shown in fig 3 monoculture citrus production showed intensive development with rapid expansion of the orchard area in the watershed which increased from only 4 43 of the watershed area in 1995 to 37 44 in 2015 table 2 the area increased by 8 5 times to 6 16 km2 indicating remarkable simplification of the landscape orchards gradually evolved from sporadic distribution in 1995 to contiguous development in 2015 thus production mode of farmers gradually shifted from crop to citrus cultivation in the watershed from 1995 to 2015 landscape structure of the watershed changed significantly trending toward landscape simplification table 2 trends in variation in pd lsi and ai were generally consistent at the orchard type level decreasing to minimums in 2015 shannon s diversity index increased continuously from 1995 to 2015 and reached a maximum in 2015 the segmentation indices split and ed of orchards decreased whereas the lpi and contag continued to increase 3 2 effects of intensive production on runoff and sediment load under different rainfall regimes the characteristics of runoff and suspended sediment under the three rainfall regimes are indicated in table 3 average runoff coefficients of different rainfall regimes were ranked in the order rainfall regime i rainfall regime ii rainfall regime iii the order of the average erosion amount was rainfall regime iii rainfall regime i rainfall regime ii rainfall regime iii produced the largest cumulative erosion amount 2574 55 t with large accumulated discharge 156 26 mm although rainfall regime i had the largest cumulative rainfall of 2991 2 mm the amount of erosion was small at only 1289 78 t cumulative rainfall of rainfall regime i was similar to that of rainfall regime ii but cumulative surface runoff was different linear trend analysis of the rainfall runoff sediment data series in the watershed between 1995 and 2015 showed a decreasing trend in runoff coefficients and sediment loads under all three rainfall regimes fig 4 shows schematic variation in runoff coefficients and total sediment load over time for the three rainfall regimes trends in decreases in runoff coefficients and sediment load for each rainfall regime were generally consistent wide variation was observed in runoff coefficients or sediment loads among different rainfall regimes under rainfall regime i there was a significant decrease in sediment load sediment load under rainfall regimes i and iii decreased in magnitude compared with that under rainfall regime ii whereas it decreased only slightly under rainfall regime ii rainfall events that produced high runoff and sediment loads all occurred before 2005 according to two way anova results table 4 tl was significantly different among rainfall regimes p 0 008 and degrees of intensification p 0 006 however significant differences in rcs were found only among degrees of intensification p 0 001 there were no significant interactions between rainfall regimes and orchard area for rcs and tls 3 3 effects of intensive production on suspended sediment concentration discharge ssc q dynamics under different rainfall regimes watershed runoff and sediment transport indicators from 1995 to 2015 were analyzed statistically fig 5 the qmean sscmean qmax and qmin all showed fluctuating but decreasing trends during the 20 years the sscmean decreased continuously 2394 to 12 53 g m 3 during the 20 years and the qmean decreased in the process of decrease from 0 218 m3 s 1 in 2000 to 0 016 m3 s 1 in 2005 then the qmean increased to 0 123 m3 s 1 in the next five years and ultimately the annual average runoff decreased to 0 093 m3 s 1in 2015 the trends in qmax and qmean were similar with both showing fluctuating but decreasing trends runoff depth and sediment transport modulus also showed decreasing trends with runoff depth decreasing from 372 38 mm to 137 77 mm and average sediment transport modulus decreasing from 412 8 t km 2 a to 52 8 t km 2 a from the period 1995 2000 to the period 2010 2015 within the watershed rc and sl as well as qmax and sscmax decreased after intensive production thus intensive production was expected to change the hysteresis behavior of runoff and sediment loss different types of hysteresis loop counts for the two periods are presented in fig 6 in general the counterclockwise loop was the dominant hysteresis loop pattern throughout the study period accounting for 49 51 of the counts with 102 occurrences the main characteristic of of this pattern was that when sscmax and qmax occurred at the same time the ssc was higher in the falling water process at the same flow rate than in the rising water phase the hydrograph showed that the ssc was lower in the rising water section than in the falling water section the next most abundant hysteresis loop patterns were clockwise 28 16 and figure eight 15 05 loops and followed by the complex cycle 7 28 however the proportion of events with counterclockwise loops decreased from 57 66 during 1995 2005 to 40 00 during 2006 2015 under rainfall regime iii figure eight loops were relatively more common three of five events than other loops after intensive production whereas counterclockwise loops were the most common fifteen of nineteen events before intensive production spatial and temporal distributions of sediment transport processes and sediment sources were highly variable which led to analysis of specific examples of the types of hysteresis loops in typical flood process events in the watershed fig 6 shows examples of typical runoff sediment hysteresis relations for the three rainfall regimes before and after intensive production in sequence under similar rainfall conditions intensive production led to a decrease in sediment concentration as well as changes in hysteresis pattern after the peak the ssc under rainfall regime i decreased more rapidly than runoff and tended to change sharply fig 7 a d however the ssc under rainfall regimes ii and iii rapidly increased and slowly decreased therefore the amount of sediment produced by rainfall regimes ii and iii might be more limited by sediment transport capacity of the water flow whereas the amount of sediment produced by rainfall regime i was more likely controlled by the sediment detachment process 4 discussion in our study intensive production means that in the complex mountainous environment of the three gorges reservoir area in china traditional decentralized management crop land had been gradually replaced by concentrated and continuous large scale citrus orchards under the guidance of a series of ecological projects and long term support policies i and the intensification resulted in decreases in watershed runoff and sediment production intensive production changed the vegetation cover of the region which contributed to changes in topography and geomorphology before 2000 the cultivation pattern in the region was complex and fragmented with more scattered plots steep slopes and paddy fields as a result there were high levels of runoff qmin of 0 218 m3 s 1 in 2000 and sediment concentration sscmean of 2394 g m 3 in 2000 from the watershed from 2000 a series of ecological projects and long term supportive policies were implemented in the tgra xu et al 2020 and regarding policy traditional scattered management of crop land have gradually been replaced by concentrated and continuous large scale citrus orchards the current citrus cultivation area in the three gorges reservoir area exceeds 35 of the agricultural land area the grain for green project in wangjiaqiao watershed is manifested as transferred paddy fields into economic forests resulting in an increase in the area of citrus orchards and 8 5 times increase in the area of single land use of orchards the orchard has similar structure and function of forest land in the first place with better ecological benefits intensive citrus orchards as plantations forest have the samilar ecological benefits such as soil conservation and water and soil conservation as natural forests but citrus plantations have higher economic benefits hua et al 2022 van dijk et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 the landscape structure changed significantly with consolidation of scattered plots and simplification of the watershed landscape the runoff and sediment production of the watershed showed a clear trend of decrease over 20 years intensification of agricultural production is one of the most profound human caused changes to the global environment neill et al 2013 effects of different types of intensification on watershed hydrology and sediment transport are also important in 2000 forest land area accounted for 48 6 of the area in the small study watershed fang et al 2012 and arable land 18 3 and paddy land 16 3 were also widely distributed under similar rainfall conditions total runoff was two to three times higher and erosion was three to seven times higher in 2000 than 2015 other studies also observe differences in the effects of different types of intensive production on watershed erosion and sediment yield in the southeastern amazon expansion and intensification of soybean agriculture alter watershed hydrology by causing changes in land cover water balance and nutrient inputs fearnside 2001 neill et al 2013 because of reductions in evaporation total watershed runoff with intensive soybean planting increased by three to four times compared with that in forest with intensification of sugarcane planting area in guangxi china a significant increase in farm size is partly responsible for the 46 to 88 and 269 to 301 increase in road and gully erosion respectively in the sugarcane growing watershed li et al 2020a b the expansion of farm scale reduces the heterogeneity of farmland which may accelerate soil erosion and especially river erosion and related nutrient loss the findings of this study present a conclusion contrary to previous intensive heavy intensive production areas that usually produce large amounts of runoff and sediment which reflects the suitability of citrus as a plant with both ecological and economic benefits in intensive production in the context of scarce arable land resources in mountainous areas intensive production from traditional crop land to crop land or from forest land to crop land may increase the risk of soil erosion but the use and implementation of complementary measures for intensive production in the corresponding series of studies mitigates this contradiction different rainfall regimes have different erosion characteristics and responses to differences in rainfall changed dramatically as similar dramatic changes occurred in the watershed landscape structure over 20 years within the study watershed a few rainfall events resulted in significant runoff and sediment loads rainfall regime iii included only 27 rainfall events but resulted in 34 26 of runoff and 43 15 of eroded sediment with relatively long rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity by contrast moderate intensity rainfall resulted in limited sediment production despite the large percentage of rainfall frequency and volume for this type of rainfall this result emphasizes the importance of rainfall type as a major cause of runoff and erosion the rapid decline under rainfall regimes i and iii was in contrast to the gentle decline under rainfall regime ii and the difference was primarily due to lower single rainfall duration and amount of rainfall under rainfall regime ii sediment yield at the outlet of a watershed reflects the sum of all erosion and deposition processes occurring within the watershed huang et al 2018 restrepo et al 2006 counterclockwise hysteresis occurs when the peak runoff is ahead of the peak sediment concentration which also indicates that sediment originates farther from the outlet of the watershed tian et al 2016 under rainfall regime iii high intensity long duration rainfall the figure eight loop was relatively more common three of five events with the figure eight type of hysteresis the sediment stored at the watershed outlet was rapidly consumed at the beginning of the rainfall period resulting in a clockwise hysteresis as rainfall intensity increased infiltration excess runoff became the dominant runoff production pattern in the watershed and sediment concentration decreased faster than runoff resulting in a counterclockwise hysteresis huang et al 2018 javed et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 in the study watershed the counterclockwise loop was the most important hysteresis loop pattern in the entire study period under similar rainfall conditions landscape simplification not only led to the reductions in sediment concentration but also increasingly complex hysteresis loop patterns under the same rainfall regime the changes induced by landscape simplification were also reflected in runoff sediment relations and sediment sources therefore with increasing intensification rainfall leads to transformation of the source sink function of the watershed and the more complex the hysteresis relation is the more extensive the source of sediment although li et al 2009 focused on the effects of changes in land use or vegetation cover on total soil erosion sediment concentration is also important in river ecology and water quality newcombe and macdonald 1991 the changes caused by landscape simplification are also reflected in the runoff sediment relations and sediment sources with increasing area of large scale land management fragmented arable land is transformed by land preparation the topography becomes gentler and drainage of slopes is developed at scale and thus the original runoff sediment transport paths change runoff and sediment on a slope can converge and move rapidly to the hydrological outlet anderson et al 2010 however because of topographic constraints although the three gorges reservoir area has a relatively high proportion of large scale citrus orchards with a slope water system there remain unprepared land on slopes and steep land planted with citrus on natural slopes for citrus orchards on natural slopes lack of supporting slope water systems and long planting slopes intensify slope erosion and nutrient loss thereby increasing sources of sediment the hydrological connectivity of a watershed increases when high intensity and long duration rainfall occurs although intensification increased erosion sources in the watershed citrus orchards have higher surface cover than intensively produced cropland which can reduce raindrop spattering and runoff scour energy thus the intensity of erosion decreased and the total amount of erosion continued to show a decreasing trend as shown in this study integrating the effects of intensive production and rainfall regimes on watershed hydrology can provide a more balanced understanding of sustainable development of intensive production and water management in mountainous watersheds although intensive production bring about the landscape simplification such a single intensive production does not threaten the water security and environmental security of mountainous watersheds taking into account economic benefits and ecological safety intensive production is imperative and worthy of replication around the world 5 conclusions in a typical mountainous watershed in the three gorges reservoir area with intensive agricultural production hydrologic response characteristics were investigated under different rainfall regimes over the past 20 years in general from 1995 to 2015 the monoculture caused by intensification led to landscape simplification within the watershed with orchard area increasing from 4 43 to 37 44 of the total area two hundred and six erosive rainfall events were classified into three rainfall regimes based on rainfall amount rainfall duration and maximum 30 min rain intensity using a k means clustering method rainfall regime iii included only 27 rainfall events but caused 34 26 of runoff and 43 15 of eroded sediment because of relatively long rainfall duration and high rainfall intensity according to anova landscape simplification induced by intensive production resulted in significant downward trends in runoff coefficients p 0 001 and sediment loads p 0 006 under the three rainfall regimes in comparisons of the magnitude of runoff sediment parameters before and after intensification qmax sscmax rc and sl all showed decreasing trends after intensification of production hysteresis analysis indicated that counterclockwise loops were the dominant hysteresis loop patterns throughout the study period under rainfall regime iii eight figure loops were relatively more common three of five events than other patterns after intensive production whereas counterclockwise loops were the most common before intensive production 15 of 19 events the above results implied that with increasing intensification rainfall led to transformation of the source sink function of the watershed in addition with more complex hysteresis relations sediment sources were more extensive when high intensity and long duration rainfall occurred hydrological connectivity of the watershed increased and intensification led to additional sources of erosion in the watershed although erosion intensity and total erosion
