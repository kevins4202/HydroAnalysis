systems and only 29 of them treat the wastewater collected 1 in the country from the entire organic load generated by the population daily only 39 is removed by the existing sewage treatment infrastructure as a result in terms of remaining organic load about 5 5 thousand tons bod day reach the recipient bodies 2 the sewage treatment systems used mainly aim to remove solids and organic matter however these are not the only constituents that can cause problems to the environment the macronutrients in domestic sewage such as nitrogen when not removed adequately may cause damage to the environment such as eutrophication reducing dissolved oxygen concentration in the environment and leading to fish mortality and human health related problems 3 biological treatment is the most commonly used technique to remove organic matter and nitrogen due to its low cost and high efficiency the biological removal of organic matter occurs through the action of heterotrophic microorganisms while the removal of nitrogen is carried out by a series of oxidation and reduction processes the oxidation process of n ammonia nh4 n to nitrite no2 n and later to nitrate no3 n occurs conventionally through the action of aerobic nitrifying bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the denitrification process facultative heterotrophic bacteria reduce no2 n and no3 n to n2 in the absence of molecular oxygen nitrifying bacteria species are highly sensitive to environmental conditions such as ph alkalinity temperature dissolved oxygen do and nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations furthermore they have a low growth rate and are easily washed out of treatment systems 4 5 thus it is necessary to use techniques that will keep them in the system and enable their development such as long hydraulic retention time hrt solids retention time srt and immobilized biomass the structured bed reactor is a new alternative for biologically treating wastewater in this type of reactor a high concentration of biomass adhered and suspended is maintained inside resulting in long solids retention time studies on this reactor with intermittent aeration cycles ia on a bench scale have obtained good results in the removal of nitrogen and organic matter above 70 6 8 however there are no studies of this configuration of the reactor with intermittent aeration ia applied to the treatment of real municipal wastewater ia may lead to a simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process bringing some benefits to treatment plants such as energy savings and the non use of external sources of alkalinity for the nitrification process which is important in the treatment of effluents with high concentrations of nitrogen considering the above the aim of the study was to evaluate nitrogen and organic matter removal from real municipal sewage with high concentrations of nitrogen using a self inoculated structured bed reactor operating at different intermittent aeration cycles the influence of aeration cycles on the concentration of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria adhered and suspended was also investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental installation the bench scale experimental installation consisted of a continuous flow reactor built in acrylic with an external diameter of 22 cm internal diameter of 16 cm and height of 82 cm total volume of 12 l as support material cylindrical polyurethane foam structures about 3 cm in diameter and 65 cm in height were used totalling 13 structures inside the reactor generating a bed with porosity of 28 for vertical fixation of the cylindrical structures in the reactor pvc rods were used fitted at the ends as proposed by barana 7 and moura 8 fig 1 the reactor was fed by a positive displacement pump prominent gaia model maximum flow 1 2 l h 1 for aeration three air pumps mark big alpha a230 were used connected to porous stones that provided an airflow rate of approximately 9 5 l min 1 during the system operation the nitrified effluent was recirculated three times in the entry flow qre 3q recirculation was done through a pump of the same brand and model as that used for feeding the system was operated for 194 days at room temperature 25 1 c this period was divided into two times start up 33 days hrt of 58 h and operation phase 161 days hrt of 16 h the operation phase was divided into 3 phases with different ia cycles turned on aeration o turned off aeration a phase 1 4 h o 2 h a 66 days phase 2 2 h o 1 h a 45 days and phase 3 2 h o 2 h a 50 days the duration of these phases was obtained in function of the time necessary to observe the lowest results variability that is until a steady state is verified 2 2 real municipal wastewater the real municipal wastewater came from the sewage treatment station sts of the paran√° sanitation company sts north sanepar located in the city of londrina pr and was collected weekly after the preliminary treatment screening and grit removal at the time of use a 20 l reservoir was filled at ambient temperature where the sanitary sewer was pumped in and fed to the reactor table 1 presents the characterization of the municipal wastewater used 2 3 reactor self inoculation in order to start the operation of the system effectively an inoculum was obtained from the continuous aeration of municipal wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor sbr operated with 24 h hrt until the nitrifying organism activity was verified 30 days after this period the sludge formed in the sbr was placed in contact with the cylindrical structures of polyurethane used as support material in the structured bed reactor for a period of 24 h after this time the cylindrical structures were installed in the reactor which was operated under continuous aeration and flow with 58 h of hrt to favor the adaptation and fixation of the biomass initiating the autoinoculation phase of the reactor after 33 days removal of 100 of nh4 n in the effluent was verified and the study of the system was started effectively with the binding of ia and hrt alteration 2 4 chemical and physical analyses the system was monitored using chemical and physical analyses of the influent and effluent based on the procedures described by standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 9 the parameters analyzed were ph 4500 h b total

were carried out to evaluate the concentration of nitrifying bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifying bacteria desn in the support material sm effluent ef and sludge sl the analysis to determine the concentration of aob nob and denitrifiers in the sm and ef were performed 5 times in phase 1 on the 33rd 47th 61st 75th 84th days of operation 2 times in phase 2 108th and 127th days of operation and 3 times in phase 3 169th 176th and 191st days of operation the analysis for concentrations of these organisms in sl were performed 2 times in each phase phase 1 on the 61st and 84th days phase 2 on the 108th and 127th days and phase 3 on the 169th and 191st days 2 5 1 sample preparation sm ef and sl to determine the most probable number per gram of total volatile solids mpn gvss 1 of aob nob and denitrifying bacteria all samples collected for analyses sm ef and sl were diluted serially in saline solution up to 10 10 following the methodologies proposed to determine the most probable number per gram of total volatile solids mpn gvss 1 the effluent ef for the microbiological analyses was collected inside the reactor after opening it to remove a sample of sm to be analyzed about 10 ml of effluent was collected of which 2 ml was used for the serial dilution process the collected sm was approximately 1 2 cm in diameter and 3 cm high and was removed from random points using a sterile scalpel the sm collected was divided into 4 equal parts one for the serial dilution process one for determining the total solids and the remaining two were discarded the portion of the sm intended for the serial dilution process was placed in a 100 ml falcon tube together with 10 g of glass beads and 20 ml of sterile distilled water the falcon tube was placed in vortex equipment mark ql 901 where all the contents were agitated for 10 min to allow detachment of the biomass the sample from this agitation was considered as the first dilution the other sm portion for determining the adhered total volatile solids was placed in a falcon tube and shaken for 25 min the sample from this shaking was placed in a capsule and the procedures described by apha 9 were carried out to determine the volatile suspended solids concentration 2540 e the sl used was collected at the lower input of the reactor after collection it was allowed to stand for 30 min after which 10 ml of sedimented contents were collected the collected material was placed in a falcon tube with 10 g of glass beads and shaken for 10 min in a vortex to allow the flocs to break from this material 2 ml was collected to proceed with the serial dilution 2 5 1 1 quantification of nitrifying aob and nob and denitrifying bacteria the quantification analysis for mpn gvss 1 of nitrifying bacteria aob and nob was based on the methodology proposed by schmidt and belser 10 to determine the mpn gvss 1 of denitrifying organisms the methodology proposed by tiedje 11 was used the mpn was calculated with the combination of positive tubes using a probability standard table found in apha 9 the results were divided by the total vss in each operational phase 2 6 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was applied in order to verify if there were significant differences between the results of tn and cod total removal in the analyzed samples the factorial anova was applied so as to verify if there were significant differences between the estimates of the most probable number mpn gvss 1 of the microorganisms analyzed among the groups aob nob and desn in the places sm ef and sl and phases 1 2 and 3 as well as the interaction between them due to the high order of magnitude of the results for mpn gvss 1 the data were transformed from the application of the square root to reduce the dimensionality the analysis of variance were carried out in the statistica 10 software 12 using a 5 decision level p value 0 05 the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were accepted for both analysis of variance performed evaluated by the shapiro wilks and levene s tests respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen and organic matter removal fig 2 shows the influent in and effluent ef ph and alkalinity results during the experimental phases during the system operation there were variations in the influent 7 1 9 6 and effluent ph 5 0 9 8 values however the ph was maintained within values considered very good during most of the operational periods for the development of nitrifying and denitrifying organisms ph between 7 8 13 14 alkalinity values also varied in the influent maximum 427 mg caco3 l 1and minimum 134 mg caco3 l 1 and in the effluent maximum 537 mg caco3 l 1 and minimum 4 mg caco3 l 1 variability in alkalinity values is related to its consumption during the process as well as its punctual addition external to the influent sodium bicarbonate 0 25 g l 1 180 mg l 1 hco3 to maintain the ph close to neutrality so that the nitrifying process is not affected alkalinity is essential for the biological nitrifying process to occur as it consumes approximately 7 1 mg caco3 for each mg of nh4 noxidation due to the liberation of h in the process the higher alkalinity in the influent favors biological treatment systems that use support material for biofilm formation as it increases the ph in the internal layers of the biofilm contributing to a faster nitrification process 15 table 2 shows the means and standard deviation for tkn and nh4 n concentrations of effluent and influent from the reactor together with the removal mean obtained during each operational phase and concentrations of no2 n and no3 n of the effluent applied and removed nitrogen load table 2 shows that the concentration of tkn found in the municipal wastewater throughout the period of analysis was above the average values found for conventional municipal wastewater which characterizes it as sanitary sewage with a high concentration of nitrogen average above 70 mg l 1 of tkn 16 17 currently for the release of sanitary sewage in receiving bodies of water a maximum limit is not established in brazil for the concentration of nitrogenous compounds such as nh4 n although conama resolution n 430 2011 18 establishes a limit for other effluents of 20 mg l 1 of nh4 n as for ph the range of values considered suitable for launching is between 7 and 9 the temperature should be less than 40 c and bod5 20 less than 120 mg l 1 other parameters are also cited but were not monitored in this study all the monitored quality parameters met the requirements of the resolution and thus the proposed treatment system can be considered as efficient regarding the removal of nh4 n considering a limit of 20 mg l 1 only phase 2 kept the concentrations of this pollutant below those required phase 2 showed the highest removal percentage of tkn 80 15 with a removal nitrogen load of 0 060 0 020 kg n m 3 d 1 a value close to that found by moura et al 8 working with a structured bed reactor with ia of 2 h o 1 h a and hrt of 12 h and synthetic wastewater the system responded well to the applied nitrogen load variation maintaining high tkn and nh4 n removal percentages even with high concentrations in the influent it is likely that the stability in relation to the removal of nitrogenous constituents is associated with the reacto≈ïs self inoculation as this fact may have favored the development and permanence of nitrifying organisms in the system which are adapted to the existing variation in the effluent to be treated the lowest effluent concentrations of nh4 n were observed in phase 2 with values below 20 mg l 1 the average removal percentage of nh4 n in this phase was 86 15 possibly the greatest removal efficiency for tkn and nh4 n in phase 2 was related to maintaining dissolved oxygen concentration in the medium above 1 mg l 1 throughout the whole ia cycle fig 3 different from phases 1 and 3 besides the greater biomass adaptation period in the reactor to the ia process the nitrification process can be limited to do concentrations of 0 5 2 5 mg l 1 values over 2 0 mg l 1 and is recommended for complete nitrification in effluent treatment systems 19 20 denitrification efficiencies obtained in phases 1 2 and 3 were 70 20 74 15 and 74 18 respectively showing that nitrifying and denitrifying organisms acted together throughout the operation system the coexistence and action of these organisms in the same operational unit can be explained by the adhesion of these organisms to the support material biofilm and the formation of flocs formations of the biofilm and flocs can create resistance to diffusion of do and nutrients which therefore generate concentration gradients allowing microorganisms to perform different metabolic pathways in the case of biological treatment systems that treat effluents with nitrogen and organic matter availability in the outer layers of the biofilm the aerobic organisms responsible for oxidation of ammoniacal nitrogen to nitrate can be found moreover in the inner layers the optional heterotrophic denitrifying organisms can be found which in the absence of do use no3 n as an oxidizing agent completing the conventional biological denitrifying process 21 22 due to the formation of this gradient the denitrification process can occur in systems with high do concentrations 23 24 which enables the snd process in the same reactor without harming any of the groups 24 some studies that used support material in biological systems aiming at nitrogen removal reported nitrate reduction in do concentrations higher than 4 mg l 1 these authors related the viability of this process due to the existence of gradients of substrate concentration in the biofilm formed in the support material or in flocs 6 8 22 24 27 the mean c n codtotal tkn ratio found in the system was 4 2 in phase 1 6 4 in phase 2 and 3 2 in phase 3 the c n ratio directly affects the fraction of autotrophic nitrifying and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm 28 xia et al 28 report that the higher the c n ratio the higher the efficiency of snd due to the availability of electron donors in the middle the percentage of tn removal in phase 1 was 67 10 phase 2 68 9 and phase 3 41 6 according to the analysis of variance data one way anova there was no significant difference between the tn removal percentage of phases 1 and 2 however a significant difference was demonstrated between the results for phases 1 and 3 p 0 01 and 2 and 3 p 0 01 the tn removal was significantly smaller for phase 3 in their research jafarzadeh et al 29 report that the higher the c n ratio found in the medium the higher the tn removal percentage systems operated to reach the snd process with ia cycle operation normally operate with higher c n ratios to systems that aim only at the nitrification process 22 in their research fan et al 30 found removal percentages of 99 of nitrogen and 96 of cod when the c n ratio was 10 the authors verified that with superior values the system did not function as effectively possibly due to the competition between the nitrifying and heterotrophic for do in the outer layers of the biofilm highlighting that the heterotrophic organisms develop faster than the autotrophic organisms table 3 shows the results for codtotal bod organic load and removal percentage for codtotal and bod during the reactor operation period in general all operational phases of the system demonstrated low concentrations of cod and bod effluent mainly in phase 2 table 3 this phase showed a greater percentage of nitrogen and organic matter removal and operated with a greater concentration of od throughout the ia cycle operation this trend indicates that the heterotrophic bacteria is higher in periods where the availability of od is greater which corroborates with the results found by wosiack et al 6 and asadi et al 31 with regards to the organic matter removal the experiment found significant differences only between phases 1 and 2 p 0 01 with greater removal significance for phase 2 one way anova 3 2 most probable number of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria table 4 shows the results for the factorial analysis of variance from the most probable number of nitrifying aob and nob and denitrifying bacteria in the three analyzed places sm ef and sl throughout the three phases considered phases 1 2 and 3 the effects of groups places and phases on the average of the most probable number of bacteria in the present study showed significant isolated effects as well as significant par a par interaction between the three parameters table 4 f8 45 20 2 p 0 01 therefore the differences between the most probable number average detected between groups depend on the means and phases taken into consideration fig 4 fig 4a shows a significant difference between the averages of the most probable number for the different groups of bacteria analyzed emphasizing the high values for the denitrifying bacteria according to souza and foresti 32 in sanitary sewage treatment the nitrifying process frequently occurs through the action of the facultative denitrifying bacteria which in the absence of oxygen use the no3 as a final electron acceptor a specific growth rate difference between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria could explain the high concentrations of denitrifying bacteria in relation to the nitrifying aob and nob nitrifying bacteria average growth rates go up to 0 76 and 0 84 d 1 respectively while the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria go up to 4 8 d 1 33 34 fig 4b shows that there was a significant difference between the averages of the most probable numbers among the bacteria in relation to the different places sm ef and sl highlighting the high values of the bacteria present in the sludge possibly the higher concentration of bacteria in the sludge is related to the high concentration of denitrifying bacteria found in this medium in systems with high do concentrations the conventional denitrifying process generally occurs in sm biofilm in its inferior layers or in the sl where floc formation occurs allowing the existence of anaerobic anoxic environments in its lower layers zhang et al 34 analyzing the diversity of denitrifying bacteria in the sludge and biofilm found that these bacteria are present in both means however they are more abundant in the sludge where they remain in suspension and are able to move in the system by having more food available according to nogueira et al 35 in systems with c and n availability the diversity of heterotrophic bacteria in suspension is greater than the adhered since when fixed mainly in the external layers of the biofilm they are exposed to high stress conditions therefore only heterotrophic bacteria with high growth rates are maintained under these conditions while the other groups remain in suspension fig 4c shows that there are significant differences between the most probable numbers of bacteria among the phases studied the highest bacterial abundances were found in phases 1 and 2 especially phase 2 which may explain the higher percentages of tkn removal in this phase the results indicated that the activities of the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers were favoured in phase 2 possibly due to medium conditions such as do availability high sludge age 19 26 and 33 in phases 1 2 and 3 respectively and substrates in concentrations sufficient for the viability of nitrification processes and denitrification phase 2 was the phase with the highest mean do concentration in each ia cycle 4 3 0 7 mg l 1 followed by phase 3 3 1 0 2 mg l 1 and phase 1 2 7 1 6 mg l 1 the greater the availability of do the greater the development of nitrifying microorganisms as they depend on do for their development rodrigues et al 36 and palma and manga 37 point out that the do concentration in the medium directly affects the concentration of nitrifying bacteria finding a positive liner correlation between the abundance of these microorganisms and do concentration fig 5 shows the graph for multivariate anova and mean and standard errors of the mpn gvss 1 of the interaction among treatments in this fig it can be observed that the concentration of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria found in the sm in all analyzed phases did not change significantly indicating that the sm used in the reactor bed favored the permanence of the analyzed groups in the system even in the different ia cycles another hypothesis for the permanence of these organisms in the system could be due to the self inoculated reactor as the organisms in the system are already adapted to the characteristics of the effluent in their research santos et al 38 used the same reactor configuration as the present study operated with intermittent aeration and different c n ratios and reported low values of effluent vss and high cod and tn removal efficiencies concluding that the biological processes were performed almost uniquely by the attached biomass according to moura et al 8 efficient tn removal in a single reactor could also be attributed to the spatial distribution of microorganisms responsible for nitrification and denitrification and do diffusion inside the support medium the authors add in their discussion that in the support material used in their research polyurethane foam 3 cm in diameter same diameter used in this research an anoxic zone may have been generated inside the foam which favored the growth of denitrifying microorganisms due to a lack of do oxygen availability is greater near the support medium surface and thus nitrifying microorganisms may have grown in its outer regions wosiack et al 6 who also used a structured bed reactor operated with intermittent aeration pointed out that the polyurethane foam enabled the development of an exterior aerobic environment and an interior anoxic environment so that both nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria could coexist and perform the nitrogen removal process completely this fact can be explained by the high rates of denitrification even in the tests with long aeration periods and under conditions of do between 2 and 4 mg l 1 can et al 39 investigated the variation in oxygen concentration dissolved in support materials polyurethane foam used in a mobile bed reactor mbr the authors discussed that oxygen penetrated from the bulk liquid into the biofilm and gradually decreased to zero from the bulk liquid to the center of the carrier the authors also considered that pores in the carrier allowed oxygen penetration into the biofilm hence the thickness of the aerobic zone was thicker than other biofilms on non porous carriers it is important to note that the discussion above regarding the formation of do and nutrient gradients can be applied to both the biofilm formed in the sm and the flocs present in the sludge as both are formed by polymer excreta expelled by the microorganisms which are found in the medium in fig 5 it can also be observed that regardless of the analyzed phase the denitrifying bacteria were present in high concentrations in the sludge which as already discussed may be related to the metabolism of these organisms 4 conclusion the percentages of removal of organic matter above 80 indicate that the system was stable in relation to the removal of this pollutant even in different aeration conditions and the variability in the characteristics of the influent municipal wastewater the percentages of tn removal were variable throughout the reacto≈ïs operating period mainly due to the high variation of the concentration of nitrogen present in the influent municipal wastewater even with these variations the concentration of nitrifying bacteria aob and nob found in the analyzed media sm ef and sl did not experience much variation this result can be related to the self inoculation process which may have favoured the permanence of organisms adapted to the sewage characteristics as well as to the existence of the support material which may have kept the nitrifying organisms in the system for a long time among the phases operated in the treatment system phase 2 2 h o 1 a presented the highest percentage removal of nh4 n removal this result is possibly related to the maintenance of do concentrations in the medium above 3 mg l 1 throughout the cycle at this stage the denitrification process was also obtained 74 15 which contributed to the removal of tn in the system of 68 9 these results show that in the system the snd process occurred this process can be justified by the limitation of the transfer of do in the support material and flocs as in the lower layers of this the do concentrations are low making the denitrification process possible there was a significant difference between the abundance of analyzed bacteria nitrifying and denitrifying in the different ia cycles adopted however the differences among these groups depend on the places and phases considered acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the sanitation

were carried out to evaluate the concentration of nitrifying bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifying bacteria desn in the support material sm effluent ef and sludge sl the analysis to determine the concentration of aob nob and denitrifiers in the sm and ef were performed 5 times in phase 1 on the 33rd 47th 61st 75th 84th days of operation 2 times in phase 2 108th and 127th days of operation and 3 times in phase 3 169th 176th and 191st days of operation the analysis for concentrations of these organisms in sl were performed 2 times in each phase phase 1 on the 61st and 84th days phase 2 on the 108th and 127th days and phase 3 on the 169th and 191st days 2 5 1 sample preparation sm ef and sl to determine the most probable number per gram of total volatile solids mpn gvss 1 of aob nob and denitrifying bacteria all samples collected for analyses sm ef and sl were diluted serially in saline solution up to 10 10 following the methodologies proposed to determine the most probable number per gram of total volatile solids mpn gvss 1 the effluent ef for the microbiological analyses was collected inside the reactor after opening it to remove a sample of sm to be analyzed about 10 ml of effluent was collected of which 2 ml was used for the serial dilution process the collected sm was approximately 1 2 cm in diameter and 3 cm high and was removed from random points using a sterile scalpel the sm collected was divided into 4 equal parts one for the serial dilution process one for determining the total solids and the remaining two were discarded the portion of the sm intended for the serial dilution process was placed in a 100 ml falcon tube together with 10 g of glass beads and 20 ml of sterile distilled water the falcon tube was placed in vortex equipment mark ql 901 where all the contents were agitated for 10 min to allow detachment of the biomass the sample from this agitation was considered as the first dilution the other sm portion for determining the adhered total volatile solids was placed in a falcon tube and shaken for 25 min the sample from this shaking was placed in a capsule and the procedures described by apha 9 were carried out to determine the volatile suspended solids concentration 2540 e the sl used was collected at the lower input of the reactor after collection it was allowed to stand for 30 min after which 10 ml of sedimented contents were collected the collected material was placed in a falcon tube with 10 g of glass beads and shaken for 10 min in a vortex to allow the flocs to break from this material 2 ml was collected to proceed with the serial dilution 2 5 1 1 quantification of nitrifying aob and nob and denitrifying bacteria the quantification analysis for mpn gvss 1 of nitrifying bacteria aob and nob was based on the methodology proposed by schmidt and belser 10 to determine the mpn gvss 1 of denitrifying organisms the methodology proposed by tiedje 11 was used the mpn was calculated with the combination of positive tubes using a probability standard table found in apha 9 the results were divided by the total vss in each operational phase 2 6 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was applied in order to verify if there were significant differences between the results of tn and cod total removal in the analyzed samples the factorial anova was applied so as to verify if there were significant differences between the estimates of the most probable number mpn gvss 1 of the microorganisms analyzed among the groups aob nob and desn in the places sm ef and sl and phases 1 2 and 3 as well as the interaction between them due to the high order of magnitude of the results for mpn gvss 1 the data were transformed from the application of the square root to reduce the dimensionality the analysis of variance were carried out in the statistica 10 software 12 using a 5 decision level p value 0 05 the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were accepted for both analysis of variance performed evaluated by the shapiro wilks and levene s tests respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen and organic matter removal fig 2 shows the influent in and effluent ef ph and alkalinity results during the experimental phases during the system operation there were variations in the influent 7 1 9 6 and effluent ph 5 0 9 8 values however the ph was maintained within values considered very good during most of the operational periods for the development of nitrifying and denitrifying organisms ph between 7 8 13 14 alkalinity values also varied in the influent maximum 427 mg caco3 l 1and minimum 134 mg caco3 l 1 and in the effluent maximum 537 mg caco3 l 1 and minimum 4 mg caco3 l 1 variability in alkalinity values is related to its consumption during the process as well as its punctual addition external to the influent sodium bicarbonate 0 25 g l 1 180 mg l 1 hco3 to maintain the ph close to neutrality so that the nitrifying process is not affected alkalinity is essential for the biological nitrifying process to occur as it consumes approximately 7 1 mg caco3 for each mg of nh4 noxidation due to the liberation of h in the process the higher alkalinity in the influent favors biological treatment systems that use support material for biofilm formation as it increases the ph in the internal layers of the biofilm contributing to a faster nitrification process 15 table 2 shows the means and standard deviation for tkn and nh4 n concentrations of effluent and influent from the reactor together with the removal mean obtained during each operational phase and concentrations of no2 n and no3 n of the effluent applied and removed nitrogen load table 2 shows that the concentration of tkn found in the municipal wastewater throughout the period of analysis was above the average values found for conventional municipal wastewater which characterizes it as sanitary sewage with a high concentration of nitrogen average above 70 mg l 1 of tkn 16 17 currently for the release of sanitary sewage in receiving bodies of water a maximum limit is not established in brazil for the concentration of nitrogenous compounds such as nh4 n although conama resolution n 430 2011 18 establishes a limit for other effluents of 20 mg l 1 of nh4 n as for ph the range of values considered suitable for launching is between 7 and 9 the temperature should be less than 40 c and bod5 20 less than 120 mg l 1 other parameters are also cited but were not monitored in this study all the monitored quality parameters met the requirements of the resolution and thus the proposed treatment system can be considered as efficient regarding the removal of nh4 n considering a limit of 20 mg l 1 only phase 2 kept the concentrations of this pollutant below those required phase 2 showed the highest removal percentage of tkn 80 15 with a removal nitrogen load of 0 060 0 020 kg n m 3 d 1 a value close to that found by moura et al 8 working with a structured bed reactor with ia of 2 h o 1 h a and hrt of 12 h and synthetic wastewater the system responded well to the applied nitrogen load variation maintaining high tkn and nh4 n removal percentages even with high concentrations in the influent it is likely that the stability in relation to the removal of nitrogenous constituents is associated with the reacto≈ïs self inoculation as this fact may have favored the development and permanence of nitrifying organisms in the system which are adapted to the existing variation in the effluent to be treated the lowest effluent concentrations of nh4 n were observed in phase 2 with values below 20 mg l 1 the average removal percentage of nh4 n in this phase was 86 15 possibly the greatest removal efficiency for tkn and nh4 n in phase 2 was related to maintaining dissolved oxygen concentration in the medium above 1 mg l 1 throughout the whole ia cycle fig 3 different from phases 1 and 3 besides the greater biomass adaptation period in the reactor to the ia process the nitrification process can be limited to do concentrations of 0 5 2 5 mg l 1 values over 2 0 mg l 1 and is recommended for complete nitrification in effluent treatment systems 19 20 denitrification efficiencies obtained in phases 1 2 and 3 were 70 20 74 15 and 74 18 respectively showing that nitrifying and denitrifying organisms acted together throughout the operation system the coexistence and action of these organisms in the same operational unit can be explained by the adhesion of these organisms to the support material biofilm and the formation of flocs formations of the biofilm and flocs can create resistance to diffusion of do and nutrients which therefore generate concentration gradients allowing microorganisms to perform different metabolic pathways in the case of biological treatment systems that treat effluents with nitrogen and organic matter availability in the outer layers of the biofilm the aerobic organisms responsible for oxidation of ammoniacal nitrogen to nitrate can be found moreover in the inner layers the optional heterotrophic denitrifying organisms can be found which in the absence of do use no3 n as an oxidizing agent completing the conventional biological denitrifying process 21 22 due to the formation of this gradient the denitrification process can occur in systems with high do concentrations 23 24 which enables the snd process in the same reactor without harming any of the groups 24 some studies that used support material in biological systems aiming at nitrogen removal reported nitrate reduction in do concentrations higher than 4 mg l 1 these authors related the viability of this process due to the existence of gradients of substrate concentration in the biofilm formed in the support material or in flocs 6 8 22 24 27 the mean c n codtotal tkn ratio found in the system was 4 2 in phase 1 6 4 in phase 2 and 3 2 in phase 3 the c n ratio directly affects the fraction of autotrophic nitrifying and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm 28 xia et al 28 report that the higher the c n ratio the higher the efficiency of snd due to the availability of electron donors in the middle the percentage of tn removal in phase 1 was 67 10 phase 2 68 9 and phase 3 41 6 according to the analysis of variance data one way anova there was no significant difference between the tn removal percentage of phases 1 and 2 however a significant difference was demonstrated between the results for phases 1 and 3 p 0 01 and 2 and 3 p 0 01 the tn removal was significantly smaller for phase 3 in their research jafarzadeh et al 29 report that the higher the c n ratio found in the medium the higher the tn removal percentage systems operated to reach the snd process with ia cycle operation normally operate with higher c n ratios to systems that aim only at the nitrification process 22 in their research fan et al 30 found removal percentages of 99 of nitrogen and 96 of cod when the c n ratio was 10 the authors verified that with superior values the system did not function as effectively possibly due to the competition between the nitrifying and heterotrophic for do in the outer layers of the biofilm highlighting that the heterotrophic organisms develop faster than the autotrophic organisms table 3 shows the results for codtotal bod organic load and removal percentage for codtotal and bod during the reactor operation period in general all operational phases of the system demonstrated low concentrations of cod and bod effluent mainly in phase 2 table 3 this phase showed a greater percentage of nitrogen and organic matter removal and operated with a greater concentration of od throughout the ia cycle operation this trend indicates that the heterotrophic bacteria is higher in periods where the availability of od is greater which corroborates with the results found by wosiack et al 6 and asadi et al 31 with regards to the organic matter removal the experiment found significant differences only between phases 1 and 2 p 0 01 with greater removal significance for phase 2 one way anova 3 2 most probable number of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria table 4 shows the results for the factorial analysis of variance from the most probable number of nitrifying aob and nob and denitrifying bacteria in the three analyzed places sm ef and sl throughout the three phases considered phases 1 2 and 3 the effects of groups places and phases on the average of the most probable number of bacteria in the present study showed significant isolated effects as well as significant par a par interaction between the three parameters table 4 f8 45 20 2 p 0 01 therefore the differences between the most probable number average detected between groups depend on the means and phases taken into consideration fig 4 fig 4a shows a significant difference between the averages of the most probable number for the different groups of bacteria analyzed emphasizing the high values for the denitrifying bacteria according to souza and foresti 32 in sanitary sewage treatment the nitrifying process frequently occurs through the action of the facultative denitrifying bacteria which in the absence of oxygen use the no3 as a final electron acceptor a specific growth rate difference between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria could explain the high concentrations of denitrifying bacteria in relation to the nitrifying aob and nob nitrifying bacteria average growth rates go up to 0 76 and 0 84 d 1 respectively while the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria go up to 4 8 d 1 33 34 fig 4b shows that there was a significant difference between the averages of the most probable numbers among the bacteria in relation to the different places sm ef and sl highlighting the high values of the bacteria present in the sludge possibly the higher concentration of bacteria in the sludge is related to the high concentration of denitrifying bacteria found in this medium in systems with high do concentrations the conventional denitrifying process generally occurs in sm biofilm in its inferior layers or in the sl where floc formation occurs allowing the existence of anaerobic anoxic environments in its lower layers zhang et al 34 analyzing the diversity of denitrifying bacteria in the sludge and biofilm found that these bacteria are present in both means however they are more abundant in the sludge where they remain in suspension and are able to move in the system by having more food available according to nogueira et al 35 in systems with c and n availability the diversity of heterotrophic bacteria in suspension is greater than the adhered since when fixed mainly in the external layers of the biofilm they are exposed to high stress conditions therefore only heterotrophic bacteria with high growth rates are maintained under these conditions while the other groups remain in suspension fig 4c shows that there are significant differences between the most probable numbers of bacteria among the phases studied the highest bacterial abundances were found in phases 1 and 2 especially phase 2 which may explain the higher percentages of tkn removal in this phase the results indicated that the activities of the autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers were favoured in phase 2 possibly due to medium conditions such as do availability high sludge age 19 26 and 33 in phases 1 2 and 3 respectively and substrates in concentrations sufficient for the viability of nitrification processes and denitrification phase 2 was the phase with the highest mean do concentration in each ia cycle 4 3 0 7 mg l 1 followed by phase 3 3 1 0 2 mg l 1 and phase 1 2 7 1 6 mg l 1 the greater the availability of do the greater the development of nitrifying microorganisms as they depend on do for their development rodrigues et al 36 and palma and manga 37 point out that the do concentration in the medium directly affects the concentration of nitrifying bacteria finding a positive liner correlation between the abundance of these microorganisms and do concentration fig 5 shows the graph for multivariate anova and mean and standard errors of the mpn gvss 1 of the interaction among treatments in this fig it can be observed that the concentration of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria found in the sm in all analyzed phases did not change significantly indicating that the sm used in the reactor bed favored the permanence of the analyzed groups in the system even in the different ia cycles another hypothesis for the permanence of these organisms in the system could be due to the self inoculated reactor as the organisms in the system are already adapted to the characteristics of the effluent in their research santos et al 38 used the same reactor configuration as the present study operated with intermittent aeration and different c n ratios and reported low values of effluent vss and high cod and tn removal efficiencies concluding that the biological processes were performed almost uniquely by the attached biomass according to moura et al 8 efficient tn removal in a single reactor could also be attributed to the spatial distribution of microorganisms responsible for nitrification and denitrification and do diffusion inside the support medium the authors add in their discussion that in the support material used in their research polyurethane foam 3 cm in diameter same diameter used in this research an anoxic zone may have been generated inside the foam which favored the growth of denitrifying microorganisms due to a lack of do oxygen availability is greater near the support medium surface and thus nitrifying microorganisms may have grown in its outer regions wosiack et al 6 who also used a structured bed reactor operated with intermittent aeration pointed out that the polyurethane foam enabled the development of an exterior aerobic environment and an interior anoxic environment so that both nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria could coexist and perform the nitrogen removal process completely this fact can be explained by the high rates of denitrification even in the tests with long aeration periods and under conditions of do between 2 and 4 mg l 1 can et al 39 investigated the variation in oxygen concentration dissolved in support materials polyurethane foam used in a mobile bed reactor mbr the authors discussed that oxygen penetrated from the bulk liquid into the biofilm and gradually decreased to zero from the bulk liquid to the center of the carrier the authors also considered that pores in the carrier allowed oxygen penetration into the biofilm hence the thickness of the aerobic zone was thicker than other biofilms on non porous carriers it is important to note that the discussion above regarding the formation of do and nutrient gradients can be applied to both the biofilm formed in the sm and the flocs present in the sludge as both are formed by polymer excreta expelled by the microorganisms which are found in the medium in fig 5 it can also be observed that regardless of the analyzed phase the denitrifying bacteria were present in high concentrations in the sludge which as already discussed may be related to the metabolism of these organisms 4 conclusion the percentages of removal of organic matter above 80 indicate that the system was stable in relation to the removal of this pollutant even in different aeration conditions and the variability in the characteristics of the influent municipal wastewater the percentages of tn removal were variable throughout the reacto≈ïs operating period mainly due to the high variation of the concentration of nitrogen present in the influent municipal wastewater even with these variations the concentration of nitrifying bacteria aob and nob found in the analyzed media sm ef and sl did not experience much variation this result can be related to the self inoculation process which may have favoured the permanence of organisms adapted to the sewage characteristics as well as to the existence of the support material which may have kept the nitrifying organisms in the system for a long time among the phases operated in the treatment system phase 2 2 h o 1 a presented the highest percentage removal of nh4 n removal this result is possibly related to the maintenance of do concentrations in the medium above 3 mg l 1 throughout the cycle at this stage the denitrification process was also obtained 74 15 which contributed to the removal of tn in the system of 68 9 these results show that in the system the snd process occurred this process can be justified by the limitation of the transfer of do in the support material and flocs as in the lower layers of this the do concentrations are low making the denitrification process possible there was a significant difference between the abundance of analyzed bacteria nitrifying and denitrifying in the different ia cycles adopted however the differences among these groups depend on the places and phases considered acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the sanitation

14556,stainless steel mesh and hemmed knitted fiber glass strips were coated with tio2 sol to study the possibilities of the two materials as alternative supports for tio2 in photocatalytic wastewater treatment process commercially available p25 p90 and pc500 powder catalysts were successfully immobilized on stainless steel mesh and fiber glass strips the prepared photocatalysts were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem the retention stability of as prepared layers of photocatalyst on fiber glass strips was tested by sonication test best adhesion levels were achieved with p90 with only 17 of photocatalyst loss during the harsh sonication test the photocatalytic activity was tested with degradation of phenol and commercial textile dye reactive blue 19 in flow through photoreactor after 240 min of irradiation mineralization degree of pollutants ranged from 72 to 99 for rb 19 and 38 to 94 for phenol keywords photocatalysis phenol reactive blue degradation 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aop were developed in search of low cost and efficient methods for degradation of persistent organic pollutants pops in wastewaters 1 phenol a highly volatile aromatic compound in form of white or transparent crystals is one of the most common pops found in wastewaters 1 it is considered carcinogenic genotoxic and causes weight reduction and infertility to exposed organisms 2 because of its harmful properties it is recognized as potentially hazardous to environment and human so it needs to be removed from wastewaters before they are released in the environment reactive blue 19 rb 19 known as remazol brilliant blue r is a commercial dye used in textile industry it is also categorized as pop due to aromatic anthraquinone structure it is very resistant to chemical oxidation 3 4 moreover high dye concentration in surface waters can block photosynthesis 4 when degrading rb 19 by photocatalysis one of the aops discoloration occurs much sooner than complete mineralization toc analysis is an important technique to observe this discrepancy and signals possible formation of stable reaction intermediates that may be even more toxic than the parent compound photocatalysis aims at degradation of pops to carbon dioxide water mineral salts and acids 5 6 in this regard tio2 the most common photocatalyst can be used as suspension or immobilized on different supports the main advantage of suspended photocatalysts is a high contact surface area which contributes to higher degradation rate of pollutants slurry reactors that utilize suspended photocatalysts are mostly used in pilot laboratory experiments however for industrial large scale applications immobilized photocatalysts are much more desired since there is no need for filtration unit at the end of the process 7 this reduces initial and also operational costs making the method more economically acceptable for large scale industrial usage like suspended photocatalysts immobilized photocatalysts also have its downsides the main being lower efficiency due to reduced reaction surface decreasing the degradation rate 7 8 because of that the time of photocatalytic treatment has to be prolonged lowering the daily capacity of substrate treated second limitation is that efficient methods for immobilization still need to be developed our objective here was to develop industrially viable methods for photocatalyst application together with economically effective supports for that reason immobilized photocatalyst was used for immobilization different types of supports can be used glass aluminum stainless steel ceramics quartz sand etc 9 18 due to low costs good flexibility and efficiency showed in several publications 13 17 fiber glass strips fgs have become increasingly popular as support for immobilization of photocatalysts tio2 immobilization on fgss can be fast and simple as presented also in this work a modified dip coating technique used for fgss however was not appropriate for immobilization of tio2 on stainless steel mesh ssm therefore tio2 was immobilized on ss mesh by adapting method of electrophoretic immobilization 23 dip coating technique was not found appropriate for ssm support due to two main reasons in the case of too dense sol the resulting photocatalyst layer was too thick for which clear openings were also filled with the sol which severely decreased retention stability as sol in the openings is less stable and was damaged by water flow in the case of too thin sol immobilization was impossible since it was running off too quickly to successfully immobilize it research conducted by dougna et al 12 reported that stainless steel is a preferable option for immobilization of tio2 photocatalyst compared to ahlstrom paper with tio2 photocatalyst immobilized el kalliny et al 13 showed that for degradation of sodium hydroxide stainless steel woven wire mesh is a good photocatalyst substrate due to its large surface area and the possibility of light to be effectively distributed through it mozia et al 14 tested stainless steel mesh and fiberglass strips as substrates for tio2 photocatalyst in degradation of phenol chen and chen 15 found that tio2 immobilized on fiberglass strip is up to 68 more efficient than tio2 suspended in solution li et al 16 obtained similar results while comparing efficiency of tio2 immobilized on fiberglass strip and tio2 applied on glass as thin film tio2 immobilized on fiberglass strip was up to 40 more efficient degrading methylene blue dye erjavec et al 17 have successfully prepared glass fiber supported tio2 photocatalysts for degradation of bisphenolic components in both batch and mixed flow reactor tio2 was immobilized by impregnating the non wovenglass fiber cloth 17 a supported catalyst composed of a nanostructured tio2 film deposited on a stainless steel mesh using the metal organic chemical vapour deposition technique was prepared by murgolo et al 18 the as prepared supported photocatalysts demonstrate higher efficiency for degradation of a mixture of contaminants of emerging concern in real groundwater than observed under direct photolysis and photocatalysis using only tio2 degussa p25 at the same amount of photocatalyst 18 the main focus of this research is i to find chemically inert and economically efficient support materials for the immobilization of tio2 that can be used in photocatalytic wastewater treatment and ii to develop a user friendly method for the immobilization of tio2 on the support materials p25 pc500 and p90 were used as titania source the titania were immobilized on fiber glass strips fgss and stainless steel mesh ssm by modified dip coating and electrochemical deposition technique respectively the photocatalytic activity of as prepared samples was investigated in the treatment of model wastewaters containing phenol and rb 19 as aqueous pollutants the degradation process was followed by different techniques e g high performance liquid chromatography hplc total organic carbon toc analysis and uv vis spectrophotometry 2 experimental procedure 2 1 chemicals and materials all the chemicals in this study were used as purchased dye reactive blue 19 rb 19 from bezema 98 phenol 99 5 from fluka tetraethyl orthosilicate teos 98 from acros organics

acetonitrile 99 9 from j t baker commercial tio2 nanopowders were obtained from evonik degussa aeroxide p25 and p90 and cristal global millenium cristalaciv pc500 all aqueous solutions were prepared using double deionized water from the nanopure system barnstead hemmed knitted fiber glass strip 5 cm 230 cm was acquired from toolcraft while stainless steel mesh d 1 4 mm w 0 315 mm aisi 304 and stainless steel net d 1 6 mm w 11 2 mm aisi 304 from fipis d o o 2 2 preparation of titania binder sol suspension immobilization of different commercial tio2 nanoparticles on fiber glass strips fgss and stainless steel mesh ssm was conducted using the sol suspension procedure 9 19 20 for titania sol preparation 30 ml titanium tetraisopropoxide ttip diluted in 5 ml ethanol was hydrolyzed in an aqueous solution 90 ml of hclo4 70 where acid stabilized the sol during hydrolysis and condensation reaction of ttip a white precipitate of hydrated amorphous tio2 was formed which was then refluxed for 48 h causing the crystallization and deaggregation of tio2 resulting in a stable nanocrystalline titania sol in another part a homogeneous silica sol was prepared from teos 3 72 ml deionized water 2 ml and hcl 37 38 15 5 Œºl to hydrolyze silica precursor for later condensation reaction afterwards 4 2 ml titania sol 600 Œºl silica sol 1 ml levasil 200 30 and 4 ml ethanol were gradually mixed together to give a binder sol finally 1 6 g of titania nanopowders pc500 p25 or p90 were suspended in the binder sol the titania binder sol was then placed in a cold ultrasonic bath for 10 min to obtain the final sol suspension that contained 17 8 wt total tio2 titania silica sol that was prepared as described above was used for fiber glass strips coating however for stainless steel mesh diluted sol was applied containing 32 ml of total amount of ethanol and selected p90 titania nanopowder it is important to mention that the amount of titania from ttip in the titania binder sol suspension is very low compared with commercial titania 0 0081 mol vs 0 05 mol therefore the effect of titania sol from ttip precursor in the titania binder sol suspension is negligible regarding its activity contribution however it acts beneficially as a binder component 19 2 3 immobilization of titania binder sol suspension hemmed knitted fiber glass strips fgss and stainless steel mesh ssm were used as photocatalyst substrates immobilization on fgss was done by dip coating technique using a home made device which allowed constant and steady tio2 sol immobilization before immobilization the fgss were washed with ethanol and deionized water after drying the clean fgss were slowly dipped in titania binder sol horizontally and then dried the pulling speed of strip was 1 cm s 1 amount of deposited catalyst after first immobilization was 3 9 mg cm 2 which is sufficient for effective absorption or uv irradiation the photocatalysts immobilized on fgss were placed in an oven at 150 c for 1 h p25 pc500 and p90 have already crystalline structure and the heat treatment is needed just to immobilize the titania binder sol suspension on fiber glass or ssm effectively it does not have any important effect on the crystallinity of the photocatalyst 22 afterwards the immobilized photocatalysts were cooled to room temperature and then placed under uv light to degrade any organic matter which was not eliminated during the drying procedure electrophoretic method of tio2 immobilization on ssm was applied which was adopted from yanagida et al 23 and slightly modified the electrochemical deposition system consisted of a laboratory power supply voltcraft ps 405 pro a polished aluminum plate and a plexiglas container the plexiglas container was filled with the titania binder sol in which the aluminum plate used as the anode and ssm used as the cathode were submerged prior to the immobilization process the ssm was cut into hexagonal shape side 8 cm and rinsed with ethanol after applying the electric power of 200 w 40 v 5 a for 20 s the ssm was taken out from the container and the excess sol suspension was removed by an air compressor afterwards the mesh was dried and put in an oven at 150 c for 1 h and then placed under uv light for 1 h to remove any organic residues only two layers could be deposited on one piece of support because of electric current limitations with a stronger power supply more layers can be immobilized if immobilization time was longer than 20 s the layer was too thick cracks were larger and lumps started to form if time of immobilization was shorter the obtained layer was too thin for fast and efficient catalytic action the samples were abbreviated as tio2 fgss or tio2 ssm where tio2 is p90 or p25 or pc500 in case of fgss and p90 in case of ssm 2 4 characterization for x ray powder diffraction xrd characterization the so called film powder samples were used obtained by careful scratching a number of immobilized photocatalysts from their supports and collecting the powder the xrd patterns were obtained on a panalytical x pert pro high resolution diffractometer cukŒ±1 radiation of 1 5406 √• was used in range from 5 01 to 89 98 with a step size of 0 017 using a fully opened x celerator detector the peak width at half maximum in the xrd diffractograms for the most intense peak anatase at 2Œ∏ 25 1 was taken to determine the

angle 22 the stability retention of immobilized photocatalyst on fiber glass strips was tested by sonication test 21 in short the coated fiber glass strips two parallels for each tio2 type were placed in a beaker and set in a cold ultrasonic bath 30 khz 400 w sonis 4 gt iskra pio slovenia for predetermined length of time sonication test conditions are much more rigorous compared to conditions in photoreactor that is why the stability tests were shorter than photodegradation experiments afterwards samples were weighed to evaluate the mass loss during the test sonication tests were also conducted on ssm the morphology of as prepared layers has been characterized by jsm 7001 ttls jeol scanning electron microscope operating at 30 kv detector used was sensing secondary electrons stainless steel samples were observed as they were but on fiber glass strips samples carbon was coated before doing the measurements carbon coating device used was gatan thickness monitor model 681 20000 2 5 photocatalytic reaction system a home made prototype flow through reactor was designed and built for activity tests 20 the reactor cell made of borosilicate glass with an inner diameter of 80 mm and a volume of 1 5 l is placed in the center of photoreactor ozonator pacific ozone technology model lab21 was also used in some sets of experiments where the effect of ozone on the degradation of organic compounds was investigated in combination with and without the photocatalyst inflow can be on the top or at the bottom of the reactor cell depending on the purpose of testing upper part of the cell can be removed so that the supported catalysts can be placed into the cell 6 low pressure mercury lamps were used as uva radiation source cleo compact 15 w 288 mm 16 mm phillips broad maximum at 355 nm the lamps were positioned around the reaction cell on a circular line and the reflective surface of aluminum was placed behind them the uv 290 390 nm irradiation intensity in reactor at cell position was 16 4 w m 2 measured by a uva radiometer the maximum inflow and outflow was 1 l min 1 both substrates were inserted separately into reactor cell which is described below fiber glass strips were placed horizontally wrapped around stainless steel net while stainless steel meshes vertically the scheme of photoreactor setup is shown in fig 1 2 5 1 photolysis photocatalytic and adsorption experiments tio2 fgss amount of photocatalyst 3 9 mg cm 2 was placed in the reactor cell the reactor cell was flushed with distilled water and afterwards filled with 2 l of deionized water the flow on the peristaltic pump was set to 0 9 l min 1 to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the setup was kept in the dark for 30 min the initial concentration of rb 19 was 20 mg l 1 the reaction solution was constantly purged with oxygen or ozone in case of photocatalytic ozonation experiment through stock container with concentration of 3 4 mg l 1 with 5 g h 1 rate before next experiment system was only flushed with deionized water procedure with phenol was the same as it was with rb 19 only the initial phenol concentration was 40 mg l 1 in case of the test with ss mesh the immobilized tio2 on fiber glass strips was replaced by ss meshes amount of photocatalyst 1 3 mg cm 2 and both experiments were repeated there were 4 different experiment tests with ss meshes 1 photocatalytic reaction test with one layer of p90 photocatalyst ss mesh 1 x p90 uv 2 photocatalytic reaction test with two layers of p90 photocatalyst ss mesh 2 x p90 uv 3 oxidation reaction test with no photocatalyst immobilized ss mesh uv 4 photocatalytic ozonation with two layers of p90 photocatalyst ss mesh 2 x p90 o3 uv these tests were done to study the differences in photocatalytic degradation ability between one or two layers of immobilized p90 photocatalyst photolysis experiments were performed in the same way as photocatalytic degradation however just without photocatalysts generally in photolysis the solution was constantly purged with oxygen or ozone in case of photo ozonation keeping the solution saturated with dissolved oxygen or ozone over the whole reaction time deionized water was left purging with oxygen or ozone 30 min in the dark prior to adding solution of organic pollutant rb 19 or phenol and irradiating it in general samples of 1 and 25 ml were taken at different time intervals during the irradiation for high pressure liquid chromatography hplc non purgeable organic carbon npoc and uv vis spectrometer analysis each experiment was replicated 4 times to obtain the approximate experimental error it is important to mention that such high concentrations of pollutants were used to get an idea of system degradation capacity the difference in concentrations is due to the more complicated chemical structure of rb 19 compared to phenol 2 6 analytical procedure 2 6 1 high pressure liquid chromatography hplc hewlett packard 1100 series high pressure liquid chromatography with zorbax c8 250 4 6 mm 5 Œºm column and alltech 10 4 mm pre column was used to determine phenol concentration 85 15 mixture of 10 mm aqueous ammonium acetate solution and acetonitrile as the eluent was used in the first 4 min the eluent was changed to a 30 70 mixture by applying a linear gradient between 4 and 16 min the eluent flow rate was 1 ml min 1 and the injection volume was 10 Œºl the elution of the compounds was monitored by the dad detector at 214 nm 2 6 2 non purgeable organic carbon measurements npoc samples 25 ml were analyzed by measuring the non purgeable organic carbon npoc concentrations on analytik jena multi n c 3100 apparatus the toc analysis method included purging with oxygen 150 s sample volume for analysis was 500 Œºl and washing volume 2 ml samples were incinerated at temperature of 850 c and detector maximum peak integration time was 300 s prior to the analysis samples were acidified by 2 m hcl 125 Œºl to prevent all possibly suspended organic compounds to sink 2 6 3 uv vis spectrophotometer the concentration of rb 19 was measured by hewlett packard 8453 uv vis spectrophotometer through its absorption peak at 590 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics and morphology of photocatalysts xrd analysis is measured from the powder which was obtained by carefully scratching immobilized tio2 from fiber glass strips fgss results are shown in fig 2 the addition of a binder and immobilization did not cause any phase change in tio2 most likely because the treatment of the samples took place at low temperature 150 c 1 h based on the data of commercial titania and our measurements anatase is the major crystalline phase in pc500 samples while p25 and p90 samples consist of both anatase 82 and rutile 18 phases 22 crystal size determination by scherrer equation showed the smallest crystals for pc500 around 6 nm while the p90 exhibited somewhat larger nanocrystals around 14 nm and p25 the largest nanocrystals around 21 nm which is in agreement with other published results 23 it is important to mention that there is no perceived impact of the type of support fgs or ssm on xrd patterns of the immobilized titania since the treatment of the samples takes place at low temperature for example the diffractograms of p25 and pc500 photocatalysts did not change when immobilized on al supports 24 in order to apply the supported tio2 catalysts in the degradation experiments the connection between the tio2 photocatalyst and the support material fgs or ssm should be strong enough to investigate the stability of the as prepared catalysts they were placed in an ultrasonic bath and the sample weight was measured as a function of sonication time results of this stability test are shown in fig 3 for each type of tio2 on fiber glass strips two parallel experiments were made as it is shown stability of tio2 fgs is in the following order p90 p25 pc500 for p90 fgs the retained mass after 5 min sonication time is about 80 and both parallel samples show the same behavior in contrast p25 fgs and pc500 fgs show a very poor stability for p25 fgs the retained mass is less than 50 and for pc500 fgs the retained mass is below 0 because fgs started to disintegrate after most of photocatalyst fell off the lower stability of these two samples could be explained by their crystallite sizes the crystallite size of p25 particles is 21 nm which is larger than p90 16 nm and thus the adhesion efficiency of the binder sol was decreased the crystallite size of pc500 is around 6 nm but because of the smaller primary particles size agglomerates started to form during sol suspension preparation which severely decreased retention of tio2 layer 22 these results revealed that the type of the photocatalyst somehow influences the stability significantly the results are in agreement with our previous study 22 presenting correlation between formation of agglomerates in the sol and durability of resulting coatings it was shown that titania powders with smaller primary particle size form bigger nano agglomerates 170 nm in which the particles are not bound leading to lower mechanical resistance also for p25 and pc500 two tests were done but in comparison to p90 the two curves strongly differ which shows severe problems in the synthesis of the supported p25 and pc500 catalysts as the best stability was achieved with p90 this photocatalyst was also immobilized on ssm as shown in fig 3 p90 ssm shows a better stability than p90 fgs after 5 min sonication time the loss is less than 1 to show the structure of the supported p90 catalysts sem images were taken before the experiment fig 4 when comparing the supports larger specific surface is noticed with fiber glass strips cracks on layer deposited on stainless steel can be seen fig 4 bottom while almost no cracks are visible on fiber glass strips at both magnifications fig 4 top tio2 layer on stainless steel mesh is more evenly distributed compared to photocatalyst immobilized on fiber glass strips furthermore the thickness of the photocatalyst layer on ssm and fgs are 11 3 Œºm and 1 4 Œºm respectively fig 5 3 2 pollutant degradation 3 2 1 rb 19 degradation since the mechanical stability of immobilized p90 photocatalysts was the best they were also chosen for photocatalytic degradation tests at first we selected rb 19 as model dye for the degradation tests because it is a commercial dye and used in textile industry the photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of rb 19 dye in the presence of p90 fgss and p90 ssm are shown in fig 6 photolysis experiments were performed in the same way as photocatalysis but without photocatalyst it is evident that during the photolysis the concentration of rb 19 is almost constant over the whole time interval of 300 min confirming photostability of the dye in the case of photocatalysis the rb 19 degradation curve is quite similar in the presence of both immobilized photocatalysts p90 immobilized on fiber glass strips and p90 immobilized on ss mesh the dye is completely degraded within 4 h of irradiation photocatalytic ozonation results were not obtained by uv vis spectrometer as decolorization of rb 19 was so fast that it was not possible to conduct measurements and analysis however as it can be seen in fig 7 not all of the non purgeable organic compound can be degraded by photocatalytic ozonation the photolysis photocatalysis ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 results in terms of toc analysis are shown in fig 7 photolysis experiments were performed in the same way as photocatalysis but without photocatalyst as it is expected during the photolysis reaction toc is constant in the presence of both fgs and ssm which means that there is no degradation or adsorption during the photolysis process some fluctuations are noticeable but they can be due to experimental errors during the sampling and toc measurements in the case of photocatalytic degradation with p90 immobilized on fgs toc decreased faster than with p90 immobilized on ssm the cause for this occurrence could be that the available photocatalytic surface was much smaller in comparison to photocatalyst immobilized on fgs it is important to mention that the photocatalytic degradation of rb 19 is similar in the presence of ssm 1 x p90 and ssm 2 x p90 the low geometric surface area of ssm is also most probably the reason for negligible difference between photocatalytic degradation results with 1 or 2 layers of p90 photocatalyst another reason could be related to the total layer thickness as the light can only diffuse a certain length in the photocatalytic layer immobilization of 2 photocatalyst layers will lead to a too thick layer where only the outer part is used to capture the light however the photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 in the presence of ssm 2 x p90 is much faster main reason for this is most probably combination of well distributed light irradiation through the entire reactor volume and presence of ozone despite low surface coverage with tio2 which is a mass transfer limiting factor in the case of photocatalytic process the setup using ssm shows its clear advantage when used in photocatalytic ozonation process as it is shown in fig 7 toc also decreased in both cases with ozone but without p90 immobilized on fgs or ssm that means the presence of ozone without photocatalyst can also degrade rb 19 since ozone radicals split bonds in dye molecules however toc concentration is decreasing faster in case of photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 meaning that degradation is faster in comparison to photo oxidation highest degradation rate constant at photo ozonation is 0 9 mol l 1s 1 achieved on ssm while highest k at photo oxidation is 0 41 mol l 1 s 1 achieved on fgs in fact the highest degradation rate was achieved in case of photocatalytic ozonation using tio2 coated ssms we calculated the degradation rate constant for each rb 19 degradation experiment as shown in fig 8 best degradation rate was achieved with photocatalytic ozonation on both supports though k value with ssm was around 20 higher than with fgs as already stated this could be due to the position of supports where horizontally positioned ssm intercepts more ozone than vertically positioned fgs the plot also shows that ozone itself is strong enough to degrade rb 19 in combination with the photocatalyst the degradation rate doubles indicating that this combination has a synergistic effect 3 2 2 phenol degradation in addition to rb 19 dye the degradation of phenol as a model organic compound was also investigated phenol degradation curves by photolysis photocatalysis photo ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation are shown in fig 9 as expected the concentration of phenol is almost constant during the photolysis in case of both fgs and ssm the photocatalytic degradation of phenol is similar with p90 immobilized on fgs and ssm 1 x p90 and ssm 2 x p90 while the highest degradation rate constant was calculated at photocatalytic ozonation in the presence of p90 immobilized on ssm however the trends of ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation are almost similar in both cases of p90 immobilized on fgs and ssm this is because phenol molecule can be easily degraded by ozone alone however when observing complete mineralization of phenol molecule it is very well seen that much faster rate of degradation is achieved by photocatalytic ozonation the mineralization of phenol is shown in fig 10 as it is shown no mineralization occurs by photolysis on any of the supports in case of photolytic ozonation phenol was partially mineralized in case of photocatalytic oxidation the mineralization is faster on fgs compared to ssm mineralization is faster with p90 immobilized on ssm compared to p90 immobilized on fgs it is important to mention that in comparison to rb 19 the mineralization process is slower in case of phenol fig 7 and 10 there could be two reasons for this observation i higher initial concentration of phenol 40 mg l 1 compared to rb 19 20 mg l 1 ii molecules such as rb 19 are easily degradable by ozonation alone but simpler and more stable molecules such as phenol cannot be mineralized in this way photocatalytic ozonation process is mandatory to enhance mineralization reaction rates furthermore when degradation of phenol is compared to its complete mineralization time for mineralization of secondary degradation products of phenol can be estimated with the fastest method only 120 min was enough to degrade phenol but for complete mineralization of phenol to co2 and h2o even 180 min was not enough in fact these results show the actual time difference between pollutant degradation and degradation of secondary products the fact that some secondary degradation products are even more dangerous and poisonous than the primary pollutant itself phenol is secondary degradation product of rb 19 dye gives rise to concern and shows that when degrading pollutants concentration of secondary degradation products must also be observed the degradation rate constants for each experiment of phenol degradation were calculated as well as shown in fig 11 very similar to fig 8 the best degradation rate was achieved with photocatalytic ozonation on both supports were k with ssm was also around 20 higher than with fgs the only difference compared to rb 19 degradation is that degradation rates are lower which shows that phenol is more difficult to degrade calculation of rate constant also points out that ozone and photocatalyst combination has synergistic effect 20 it is worthwhile to mention that the best performed photocatalyst was tested towards recyclability after three repeated photodegradation cycle no significant loss of performance was observed 4 conclusion the present study investigated the possible use of fgs and ssm as alternative supports for immobilization of tio2 for degradation of organic pollutants results show that both supports were functional fgss have higher photocatalytic potential due to the ability to support higher amount of immobilized photocatalyst but on the other side results obtained with ssm are also promising despite smaller effective surface ssm support with photocatalyst coating offers substantial photocatalytic activity and at certain conditions comparable to fgss horizontal dip coating method was found suitable for tio2 immobilization on fgss and electrophoretic deposition was the method of choice for tio2 immobilization on ssms results of photolysis photocatalysis photo ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 and phenol are comparable the most efficient method was photocatalytic ozonation with tio2 immobilized on ssm results of phenol degradation and mineralization confirmed that when monitoring pollutant degradation secondary degradation products should also be traced especially because they could be even more dangerous than the pollutant itself even if concentration of pollutant decreases this is not necessary an indicator of at least partial mineralization it can be concluded that both types of supports are applicable in water treatment and just with some modifications they could also be used in air treatment because of the flexibility of both supports more complex shapes could be made which would increase the effective surface and degradation rate so that methods would be more energetically and economically efficient the immobilization processes for both supports could easily be transferred on large scale application 
14556,stainless steel mesh and hemmed knitted fiber glass strips were coated with tio2 sol to study the possibilities of the two materials as alternative supports for tio2 in photocatalytic wastewater treatment process commercially available p25 p90 and pc500 powder catalysts were successfully immobilized on stainless steel mesh and fiber glass strips the prepared photocatalysts were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem the retention stability of as prepared layers of photocatalyst on fiber glass strips was tested by sonication test best adhesion levels were achieved with p90 with only 17 of photocatalyst loss during the harsh sonication test the photocatalytic activity was tested with degradation of phenol and commercial textile dye reactive blue 19 in flow through photoreactor after 240 min of irradiation mineralization degree of pollutants ranged from 72 to 99 for rb 19 and 38 to 94 for phenol keywords photocatalysis phenol reactive blue degradation 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aop were developed in search of low cost and efficient methods for degradation of persistent organic pollutants pops in wastewaters 1 phenol a highly volatile aromatic compound in form of white or transparent crystals is one of the most common pops found in wastewaters 1 it is considered carcinogenic genotoxic and causes weight reduction and infertility to exposed organisms 2 because of its harmful properties it is recognized as potentially hazardous to environment and human so it needs to be removed from wastewaters before they are released in the environment reactive blue 19 rb 19 known as remazol brilliant blue r is a commercial dye used in textile industry it is also categorized as pop due to aromatic anthraquinone structure it is very resistant to chemical oxidation 3 4 moreover high dye concentration in surface waters can block photosynthesis 4 when degrading rb 19 by photocatalysis one of the aops discoloration occurs much sooner than complete mineralization toc analysis is an important technique to observe this discrepancy and signals possible formation of stable reaction intermediates that may be even more toxic than the parent compound photocatalysis aims at degradation of pops to carbon dioxide water mineral salts and acids 5 6 in this regard tio2 the most common photocatalyst can be used as suspension or immobilized on different supports the main advantage of suspended photocatalysts is a high contact surface area which contributes to higher degradation rate of pollutants slurry reactors that utilize suspended photocatalysts are mostly used in pilot laboratory experiments however for industrial large scale applications immobilized photocatalysts are much more desired since there is no need for filtration unit at the end of the process 7 this reduces initial and also operational costs making the method more economically acceptable for large scale industrial usage like suspended photocatalysts immobilized photocatalysts also have its downsides the main being lower efficiency due to reduced reaction surface decreasing the degradation rate 7 8 because of that the time of photocatalytic treatment has to be prolonged lowering the daily capacity of substrate treated second limitation is that efficient methods for immobilization still need to be developed our objective here was to develop industrially viable methods for photocatalyst application together with economically effective supports for that reason immobilized photocatalyst was used for immobilization different types of supports can be used glass aluminum stainless steel ceramics quartz sand etc 9 18 due to low costs good flexibility and efficiency showed in several publications 13 17 fiber glass strips fgs have become increasingly popular as support for immobilization of photocatalysts tio2 immobilization on fgss can be fast and simple as presented also in this work a modified dip coating technique used for fgss however was not appropriate for immobilization of tio2 on stainless steel mesh ssm therefore tio2 was immobilized on ss mesh by adapting method of electrophoretic immobilization 23 dip coating technique was not found appropriate for ssm support due to two main reasons in the case of too dense sol the resulting photocatalyst layer was too thick for which clear openings were also filled with the sol which severely decreased retention stability as sol in the openings is less stable and was damaged by water flow in the case of too thin sol immobilization was impossible since it was running off too quickly to successfully immobilize it research conducted by dougna et al 12 reported that stainless steel is a preferable option for immobilization of tio2 photocatalyst compared to ahlstrom paper with tio2 photocatalyst immobilized el kalliny et al 13 showed that for degradation of sodium hydroxide stainless steel woven wire mesh is a good photocatalyst substrate due to its large surface area and the possibility of light to be effectively distributed through it mozia et al 14 tested stainless steel mesh and fiberglass strips as substrates for tio2 photocatalyst in degradation of phenol chen and chen 15 found that tio2 immobilized on fiberglass strip is up to 68 more efficient than tio2 suspended in solution li et al 16 obtained similar results while comparing efficiency of tio2 immobilized on fiberglass strip and tio2 applied on glass as thin film tio2 immobilized on fiberglass strip was up to 40 more efficient degrading methylene blue dye erjavec et al 17 have successfully prepared glass fiber supported tio2 photocatalysts for degradation of bisphenolic components in both batch and mixed flow reactor tio2 was immobilized by impregnating the non wovenglass fiber cloth 17 a supported catalyst composed of a nanostructured tio2 film deposited on a stainless steel mesh using the metal organic chemical vapour deposition technique was prepared by murgolo et al 18 the as prepared supported photocatalysts demonstrate higher efficiency for degradation of a mixture of contaminants of emerging concern in real groundwater than observed under direct photolysis and photocatalysis using only tio2 degussa p25 at the same amount of photocatalyst 18 the main focus of this research is i to find chemically inert and economically efficient support materials for the immobilization of tio2 that can be used in photocatalytic wastewater treatment and ii to develop a user friendly method for the immobilization of tio2 on the support materials p25 pc500 and p90 were used as titania source the titania were immobilized on fiber glass strips fgss and stainless steel mesh ssm by modified dip coating and electrochemical deposition technique respectively the photocatalytic activity of as prepared samples was investigated in the treatment of model wastewaters containing phenol and rb 19 as aqueous pollutants the degradation process was followed by different techniques e g high performance liquid chromatography hplc total organic carbon toc analysis and uv vis spectrophotometry 2 experimental procedure 2 1 chemicals and materials all the chemicals in this study were used as purchased dye reactive blue 19 rb 19 from bezema 98 phenol 99 5 from fluka tetraethyl orthosilicate teos 98 from acros organics

acetonitrile 99 9 from j t baker commercial tio2 nanopowders were obtained from evonik degussa aeroxide p25 and p90 and cristal global millenium cristalaciv pc500 all aqueous solutions were prepared using double deionized water from the nanopure system barnstead hemmed knitted fiber glass strip 5 cm 230 cm was acquired from toolcraft while stainless steel mesh d 1 4 mm w 0 315 mm aisi 304 and stainless steel net d 1 6 mm w 11 2 mm aisi 304 from fipis d o o 2 2 preparation of titania binder sol suspension immobilization of different commercial tio2 nanoparticles on fiber glass strips fgss and stainless steel mesh ssm was conducted using the sol suspension procedure 9 19 20 for titania sol preparation 30 ml titanium tetraisopropoxide ttip diluted in 5 ml ethanol was hydrolyzed in an aqueous solution 90 ml of hclo4 70 where acid stabilized the sol during hydrolysis and condensation reaction of ttip a white precipitate of hydrated amorphous tio2 was formed which was then refluxed for 48 h causing the crystallization and deaggregation of tio2 resulting in a stable nanocrystalline titania sol in another part a homogeneous silica sol was prepared from teos 3 72 ml deionized water 2 ml and hcl 37 38 15 5 Œºl to hydrolyze silica precursor for later condensation reaction afterwards 4 2 ml titania sol 600 Œºl silica sol 1 ml levasil 200 30 and 4 ml ethanol were gradually mixed together to give a binder sol finally 1 6 g of titania nanopowders pc500 p25 or p90 were suspended in the binder sol the titania binder sol was then placed in a cold ultrasonic bath for 10 min to obtain the final sol suspension that contained 17 8 wt total tio2 titania silica sol that was prepared as described above was used for fiber glass strips coating however for stainless steel mesh diluted sol was applied containing 32 ml of total amount of ethanol and selected p90 titania nanopowder it is important to mention that the amount of titania from ttip in the titania binder sol suspension is very low compared with commercial titania 0 0081 mol vs 0 05 mol therefore the effect of titania sol from ttip precursor in the titania binder sol suspension is negligible regarding its activity contribution however it acts beneficially as a binder component 19 2 3 immobilization of titania binder sol suspension hemmed knitted fiber glass strips fgss and stainless steel mesh ssm were used as photocatalyst substrates immobilization on fgss was done by dip coating technique using a home made device which allowed constant and steady tio2 sol immobilization before immobilization the fgss were washed with ethanol and deionized water after drying the clean fgss were slowly dipped in titania binder sol horizontally and then dried the pulling speed of strip was 1 cm s 1 amount of deposited catalyst after first immobilization was 3 9 mg cm 2 which is sufficient for effective absorption or uv irradiation the photocatalysts immobilized on fgss were placed in an oven at 150 c for 1 h p25 pc500 and p90 have already crystalline structure and the heat treatment is needed just to immobilize the titania binder sol suspension on fiber glass or ssm effectively it does not have any important effect on the crystallinity of the photocatalyst 22 afterwards the immobilized photocatalysts were cooled to room temperature and then placed under uv light to degrade any organic matter which was not eliminated during the drying procedure electrophoretic method of tio2 immobilization on ssm was applied which was adopted from yanagida et al 23 and slightly modified the electrochemical deposition system consisted of a laboratory power supply voltcraft ps 405 pro a polished aluminum plate and a plexiglas container the plexiglas container was filled with the titania binder sol in which the aluminum plate used as the anode and ssm used as the cathode were submerged prior to the immobilization process the ssm was cut into hexagonal shape side 8 cm and rinsed with ethanol after applying the electric power of 200 w 40 v 5 a for 20 s the ssm was taken out from the container and the excess sol suspension was removed by an air compressor afterwards the mesh was dried and put in an oven at 150 c for 1 h and then placed under uv light for 1 h to remove any organic residues only two layers could be deposited on one piece of support because of electric current limitations with a stronger power supply more layers can be immobilized if immobilization time was longer than 20 s the layer was too thick cracks were larger and lumps started to form if time of immobilization was shorter the obtained layer was too thin for fast and efficient catalytic action the samples were abbreviated as tio2 fgss or tio2 ssm where tio2 is p90 or p25 or pc500 in case of fgss and p90 in case of ssm 2 4 characterization for x ray powder diffraction xrd characterization the so called film powder samples were used obtained by careful scratching a number of immobilized photocatalysts from their supports and collecting the powder the xrd patterns were obtained on a panalytical x pert pro high resolution diffractometer cukŒ±1 radiation of 1 5406 √• was used in range from 5 01 to 89 98 with a step size of 0 017 using a fully opened x celerator detector the peak width at half maximum in the xrd diffractograms for the most intense peak anatase at 2Œ∏ 25 1 was taken to determine the

angle 22 the stability retention of immobilized photocatalyst on fiber glass strips was tested by sonication test 21 in short the coated fiber glass strips two parallels for each tio2 type were placed in a beaker and set in a cold ultrasonic bath 30 khz 400 w sonis 4 gt iskra pio slovenia for predetermined length of time sonication test conditions are much more rigorous compared to conditions in photoreactor that is why the stability tests were shorter than photodegradation experiments afterwards samples were weighed to evaluate the mass loss during the test sonication tests were also conducted on ssm the morphology of as prepared layers has been characterized by jsm 7001 ttls jeol scanning electron microscope operating at 30 kv detector used was sensing secondary electrons stainless steel samples were observed as they were but on fiber glass strips samples carbon was coated before doing the measurements carbon coating device used was gatan thickness monitor model 681 20000 2 5 photocatalytic reaction system a home made prototype flow through reactor was designed and built for activity tests 20 the reactor cell made of borosilicate glass with an inner diameter of 80 mm and a volume of 1 5 l is placed in the center of photoreactor ozonator pacific ozone technology model lab21 was also used in some sets of experiments where the effect of ozone on the degradation of organic compounds was investigated in combination with and without the photocatalyst inflow can be on the top or at the bottom of the reactor cell depending on the purpose of testing upper part of the cell can be removed so that the supported catalysts can be placed into the cell 6 low pressure mercury lamps were used as uva radiation source cleo compact 15 w 288 mm 16 mm phillips broad maximum at 355 nm the lamps were positioned around the reaction cell on a circular line and the reflective surface of aluminum was placed behind them the uv 290 390 nm irradiation intensity in reactor at cell position was 16 4 w m 2 measured by a uva radiometer the maximum inflow and outflow was 1 l min 1 both substrates were inserted separately into reactor cell which is described below fiber glass strips were placed horizontally wrapped around stainless steel net while stainless steel meshes vertically the scheme of photoreactor setup is shown in fig 1 2 5 1 photolysis photocatalytic and adsorption experiments tio2 fgss amount of photocatalyst 3 9 mg cm 2 was placed in the reactor cell the reactor cell was flushed with distilled water and afterwards filled with 2 l of deionized water the flow on the peristaltic pump was set to 0 9 l min 1 to reach adsorption desorption equilibrium the setup was kept in the dark for 30 min the initial concentration of rb 19 was 20 mg l 1 the reaction solution was constantly purged with oxygen or ozone in case of photocatalytic ozonation experiment through stock container with concentration of 3 4 mg l 1 with 5 g h 1 rate before next experiment system was only flushed with deionized water procedure with phenol was the same as it was with rb 19 only the initial phenol concentration was 40 mg l 1 in case of the test with ss mesh the immobilized tio2 on fiber glass strips was replaced by ss meshes amount of photocatalyst 1 3 mg cm 2 and both experiments were repeated there were 4 different experiment tests with ss meshes 1 photocatalytic reaction test with one layer of p90 photocatalyst ss mesh 1 x p90 uv 2 photocatalytic reaction test with two layers of p90 photocatalyst ss mesh 2 x p90 uv 3 oxidation reaction test with no photocatalyst immobilized ss mesh uv 4 photocatalytic ozonation with two layers of p90 photocatalyst ss mesh 2 x p90 o3 uv these tests were done to study the differences in photocatalytic degradation ability between one or two layers of immobilized p90 photocatalyst photolysis experiments were performed in the same way as photocatalytic degradation however just without photocatalysts generally in photolysis the solution was constantly purged with oxygen or ozone in case of photo ozonation keeping the solution saturated with dissolved oxygen or ozone over the whole reaction time deionized water was left purging with oxygen or ozone 30 min in the dark prior to adding solution of organic pollutant rb 19 or phenol and irradiating it in general samples of 1 and 25 ml were taken at different time intervals during the irradiation for high pressure liquid chromatography hplc non purgeable organic carbon npoc and uv vis spectrometer analysis each experiment was replicated 4 times to obtain the approximate experimental error it is important to mention that such high concentrations of pollutants were used to get an idea of system degradation capacity the difference in concentrations is due to the more complicated chemical structure of rb 19 compared to phenol 2 6 analytical procedure 2 6 1 high pressure liquid chromatography hplc hewlett packard 1100 series high pressure liquid chromatography with zorbax c8 250 4 6 mm 5 Œºm column and alltech 10 4 mm pre column was used to determine phenol concentration 85 15 mixture of 10 mm aqueous ammonium acetate solution and acetonitrile as the eluent was used in the first 4 min the eluent was changed to a 30 70 mixture by applying a linear gradient between 4 and 16 min the eluent flow rate was 1 ml min 1 and the injection volume was 10 Œºl the elution of the compounds was monitored by the dad detector at 214 nm 2 6 2 non purgeable organic carbon measurements npoc samples 25 ml were analyzed by measuring the non purgeable organic carbon npoc concentrations on analytik jena multi n c 3100 apparatus the toc analysis method included purging with oxygen 150 s sample volume for analysis was 500 Œºl and washing volume 2 ml samples were incinerated at temperature of 850 c and detector maximum peak integration time was 300 s prior to the analysis samples were acidified by 2 m hcl 125 Œºl to prevent all possibly suspended organic compounds to sink 2 6 3 uv vis spectrophotometer the concentration of rb 19 was measured by hewlett packard 8453 uv vis spectrophotometer through its absorption peak at 590 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics and morphology of photocatalysts xrd analysis is measured from the powder which was obtained by carefully scratching immobilized tio2 from fiber glass strips fgss results are shown in fig 2 the addition of a binder and immobilization did not cause any phase change in tio2 most likely because the treatment of the samples took place at low temperature 150 c 1 h based on the data of commercial titania and our measurements anatase is the major crystalline phase in pc500 samples while p25 and p90 samples consist of both anatase 82 and rutile 18 phases 22 crystal size determination by scherrer equation showed the smallest crystals for pc500 around 6 nm while the p90 exhibited somewhat larger nanocrystals around 14 nm and p25 the largest nanocrystals around 21 nm which is in agreement with other published results 23 it is important to mention that there is no perceived impact of the type of support fgs or ssm on xrd patterns of the immobilized titania since the treatment of the samples takes place at low temperature for example the diffractograms of p25 and pc500 photocatalysts did not change when immobilized on al supports 24 in order to apply the supported tio2 catalysts in the degradation experiments the connection between the tio2 photocatalyst and the support material fgs or ssm should be strong enough to investigate the stability of the as prepared catalysts they were placed in an ultrasonic bath and the sample weight was measured as a function of sonication time results of this stability test are shown in fig 3 for each type of tio2 on fiber glass strips two parallel experiments were made as it is shown stability of tio2 fgs is in the following order p90 p25 pc500 for p90 fgs the retained mass after 5 min sonication time is about 80 and both parallel samples show the same behavior in contrast p25 fgs and pc500 fgs show a very poor stability for p25 fgs the retained mass is less than 50 and for pc500 fgs the retained mass is below 0 because fgs started to disintegrate after most of photocatalyst fell off the lower stability of these two samples could be explained by their crystallite sizes the crystallite size of p25 particles is 21 nm which is larger than p90 16 nm and thus the adhesion efficiency of the binder sol was decreased the crystallite size of pc500 is around 6 nm but because of the smaller primary particles size agglomerates started to form during sol suspension preparation which severely decreased retention of tio2 layer 22 these results revealed that the type of the photocatalyst somehow influences the stability significantly the results are in agreement with our previous study 22 presenting correlation between formation of agglomerates in the sol and durability of resulting coatings it was shown that titania powders with smaller primary particle size form bigger nano agglomerates 170 nm in which the particles are not bound leading to lower mechanical resistance also for p25 and pc500 two tests were done but in comparison to p90 the two curves strongly differ which shows severe problems in the synthesis of the supported p25 and pc500 catalysts as the best stability was achieved with p90 this photocatalyst was also immobilized on ssm as shown in fig 3 p90 ssm shows a better stability than p90 fgs after 5 min sonication time the loss is less than 1 to show the structure of the supported p90 catalysts sem images were taken before the experiment fig 4 when comparing the supports larger specific surface is noticed with fiber glass strips cracks on layer deposited on stainless steel can be seen fig 4 bottom while almost no cracks are visible on fiber glass strips at both magnifications fig 4 top tio2 layer on stainless steel mesh is more evenly distributed compared to photocatalyst immobilized on fiber glass strips furthermore the thickness of the photocatalyst layer on ssm and fgs are 11 3 Œºm and 1 4 Œºm respectively fig 5 3 2 pollutant degradation 3 2 1 rb 19 degradation since the mechanical stability of immobilized p90 photocatalysts was the best they were also chosen for photocatalytic degradation tests at first we selected rb 19 as model dye for the degradation tests because it is a commercial dye and used in textile industry the photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of rb 19 dye in the presence of p90 fgss and p90 ssm are shown in fig 6 photolysis experiments were performed in the same way as photocatalysis but without photocatalyst it is evident that during the photolysis the concentration of rb 19 is almost constant over the whole time interval of 300 min confirming photostability of the dye in the case of photocatalysis the rb 19 degradation curve is quite similar in the presence of both immobilized photocatalysts p90 immobilized on fiber glass strips and p90 immobilized on ss mesh the dye is completely degraded within 4 h of irradiation photocatalytic ozonation results were not obtained by uv vis spectrometer as decolorization of rb 19 was so fast that it was not possible to conduct measurements and analysis however as it can be seen in fig 7 not all of the non purgeable organic compound can be degraded by photocatalytic ozonation the photolysis photocatalysis ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 results in terms of toc analysis are shown in fig 7 photolysis experiments were performed in the same way as photocatalysis but without photocatalyst as it is expected during the photolysis reaction toc is constant in the presence of both fgs and ssm which means that there is no degradation or adsorption during the photolysis process some fluctuations are noticeable but they can be due to experimental errors during the sampling and toc measurements in the case of photocatalytic degradation with p90 immobilized on fgs toc decreased faster than with p90 immobilized on ssm the cause for this occurrence could be that the available photocatalytic surface was much smaller in comparison to photocatalyst immobilized on fgs it is important to mention that the photocatalytic degradation of rb 19 is similar in the presence of ssm 1 x p90 and ssm 2 x p90 the low geometric surface area of ssm is also most probably the reason for negligible difference between photocatalytic degradation results with 1 or 2 layers of p90 photocatalyst another reason could be related to the total layer thickness as the light can only diffuse a certain length in the photocatalytic layer immobilization of 2 photocatalyst layers will lead to a too thick layer where only the outer part is used to capture the light however the photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 in the presence of ssm 2 x p90 is much faster main reason for this is most probably combination of well distributed light irradiation through the entire reactor volume and presence of ozone despite low surface coverage with tio2 which is a mass transfer limiting factor in the case of photocatalytic process the setup using ssm shows its clear advantage when used in photocatalytic ozonation process as it is shown in fig 7 toc also decreased in both cases with ozone but without p90 immobilized on fgs or ssm that means the presence of ozone without photocatalyst can also degrade rb 19 since ozone radicals split bonds in dye molecules however toc concentration is decreasing faster in case of photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 meaning that degradation is faster in comparison to photo oxidation highest degradation rate constant at photo ozonation is 0 9 mol l 1s 1 achieved on ssm while highest k at photo oxidation is 0 41 mol l 1 s 1 achieved on fgs in fact the highest degradation rate was achieved in case of photocatalytic ozonation using tio2 coated ssms we calculated the degradation rate constant for each rb 19 degradation experiment as shown in fig 8 best degradation rate was achieved with photocatalytic ozonation on both supports though k value with ssm was around 20 higher than with fgs as already stated this could be due to the position of supports where horizontally positioned ssm intercepts more ozone than vertically positioned fgs the plot also shows that ozone itself is strong enough to degrade rb 19 in combination with the photocatalyst the degradation rate doubles indicating that this combination has a synergistic effect 3 2 2 phenol degradation in addition to rb 19 dye the degradation of phenol as a model organic compound was also investigated phenol degradation curves by photolysis photocatalysis photo ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation are shown in fig 9 as expected the concentration of phenol is almost constant during the photolysis in case of both fgs and ssm the photocatalytic degradation of phenol is similar with p90 immobilized on fgs and ssm 1 x p90 and ssm 2 x p90 while the highest degradation rate constant was calculated at photocatalytic ozonation in the presence of p90 immobilized on ssm however the trends of ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation are almost similar in both cases of p90 immobilized on fgs and ssm this is because phenol molecule can be easily degraded by ozone alone however when observing complete mineralization of phenol molecule it is very well seen that much faster rate of degradation is achieved by photocatalytic ozonation the mineralization of phenol is shown in fig 10 as it is shown no mineralization occurs by photolysis on any of the supports in case of photolytic ozonation phenol was partially mineralized in case of photocatalytic oxidation the mineralization is faster on fgs compared to ssm mineralization is faster with p90 immobilized on ssm compared to p90 immobilized on fgs it is important to mention that in comparison to rb 19 the mineralization process is slower in case of phenol fig 7 and 10 there could be two reasons for this observation i higher initial concentration of phenol 40 mg l 1 compared to rb 19 20 mg l 1 ii molecules such as rb 19 are easily degradable by ozonation alone but simpler and more stable molecules such as phenol cannot be mineralized in this way photocatalytic ozonation process is mandatory to enhance mineralization reaction rates furthermore when degradation of phenol is compared to its complete mineralization time for mineralization of secondary degradation products of phenol can be estimated with the fastest method only 120 min was enough to degrade phenol but for complete mineralization of phenol to co2 and h2o even 180 min was not enough in fact these results show the actual time difference between pollutant degradation and degradation of secondary products the fact that some secondary degradation products are even more dangerous and poisonous than the primary pollutant itself phenol is secondary degradation product of rb 19 dye gives rise to concern and shows that when degrading pollutants concentration of secondary degradation products must also be observed the degradation rate constants for each experiment of phenol degradation were calculated as well as shown in fig 11 very similar to fig 8 the best degradation rate was achieved with photocatalytic ozonation on both supports were k with ssm was also around 20 higher than with fgs the only difference compared to rb 19 degradation is that degradation rates are lower which shows that phenol is more difficult to degrade calculation of rate constant also points out that ozone and photocatalyst combination has synergistic effect 20 it is worthwhile to mention that the best performed photocatalyst was tested towards recyclability after three repeated photodegradation cycle no significant loss of performance was observed 4 conclusion the present study investigated the possible use of fgs and ssm as alternative supports for immobilization of tio2 for degradation of organic pollutants results show that both supports were functional fgss have higher photocatalytic potential due to the ability to support higher amount of immobilized photocatalyst but on the other side results obtained with ssm are also promising despite smaller effective surface ssm support with photocatalyst coating offers substantial photocatalytic activity and at certain conditions comparable to fgss horizontal dip coating method was found suitable for tio2 immobilization on fgss and electrophoretic deposition was the method of choice for tio2 immobilization on ssms results of photolysis photocatalysis photo ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation of rb 19 and phenol are comparable the most efficient method was photocatalytic ozonation with tio2 immobilized on ssm results of phenol degradation and mineralization confirmed that when monitoring pollutant degradation secondary degradation products should also be traced especially because they could be even more dangerous than the pollutant itself even if concentration of pollutant decreases this is not necessary an indicator of at least partial mineralization it can be concluded that both types of supports are applicable in water treatment and just with some modifications they could also be used in air treatment because of the flexibility of both supports more complex shapes could be made which would increase the effective surface and degradation rate so that methods would be more energetically and economically efficient the immobilization processes for both supports could easily be transferred on large scale application 
14557,using greener processes to treat wastewater has become increasingly popular because these processes are environmentally friendly and offer a wide variety of other benefits such as reducing costs reducing the generation of by products and providing greater biodegradability in particular moringa oleifera mo has historically been used as a natural coagulant to treat contaminated effluents and it continues to be used today this paper is a collection of information related with using mo in contemporary applications mainly wastewater treatment it reviews the main active components involved in

educational scientific and cultural organization wsmol water soluble mo lectin wsp whole seed powder wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction water is a key factor for economic development worldwide because it is widely used in different productive sectors such as industry livestock and agricultural production and urban supply which has led to water overuse according to unesco reduced water quality contributes to water scarcity factors such as rapid urbanization increased farming activities pesticide use land degradation high population density and unsuitable waste disposal are affecting the quality of available fresh water sources 1 one of the main challenges of this century will be achieving water recycling processes to ensure worldwide water supply effective water resource management and contamination control are required to fulfill this water challenge to accomplish these requirements investment in a sustainable sanitation system is needed that includes technical economic social and ecological approaches 2 wastewater treatment is a key process in sanitation systems one of the major challenges that water treatment processes face is the removal of hydrophobic colloids because this particulate matter which is mainly organic in nature is usually present at high concentrations and sizes compared with other pollutants 3 in wastewater treatment processes one of the primary processes is coagulation followed by flocculation coagulation and flocculation are physicochemical processes that are frequently used at the beginning or end of wastewater treatment processes in conventional treatment processes many different types of coagulants are commonly used depending on the chemical features of the contaminants present in the water in general coagulants are classified as inorganic as well as synthetic organic or natural organic polymers 4 a new trend in wastewater treatment is currently being developed that uses more environmentally friendly materials such as natural organic polymers which have a variety of benefits including reducing costs preventing variations in the ph of the treated water reducing the production of sludge and providing greater biodegradability 5 although it seems like a recent idea it is worth mentioning the existence of sanskrit manuscripts that describe using substances from plant sources to treat domestic wastewater 6 although different natural coagulants have been studied for wastewater treatment in recent years 5 7 9 there is a significant lack of systematic information on the main advantages and disadvantages challenges and perspectives for using such natural materials for wastewater treatment the goals of this work are to undertake an in depth review of state of the art uses of moringa oleifera mo seeds and their related products to treat wastewater identify current knowledge gaps and determine future research directions 2 properties of moringa oleifera moringa oleifera has been frequently reported for its wide use as a vegetable functional food and medicinal plant with a rich nutritional composition and diverse pharmacological activities 10 the typical lipid content fatty acids and triglycerides of mo seeds is shown in table 1 in some reports analyzing egyptian mo seeds a large amount of fatty acids particularly omega 9 76 and saturated fatty acids e g palmitic stearic and arachidic acid 12 were found 11 and the oil obtained from the seeds showed nontoxic effects 12 additionally the presence of saponins flavonoids steroids terpenoids phenols and triterpenoids was confirmed in the plant material 13 the mo seed lipid content has been suggested to be related with harvesting practices or regional conditions leading to variations in the range of 30 to 42 14 it has been reported that the presence of fatty acids does not significantly affect mo seed coagulation activity 15 and therefore oil extraction is not needed to use mo seeds as a coagulant in coagulation flocculation c f processes 16 however it has also been reported that keeping the mo seed oils could have additional benefits because the presence of some fatty acids e g palmitoleic oleic linoleic linolenic cis 11 eicosenoic and cis 11 14 eicosadienoic acid in the range of 0 01 w v significantly prevent the formation of s aureus biofilm 17 moringa oleifera has also been found to have interesting biological activity for example ovicidal and larvicidal activity against haemonchus contortus has been reported for low molecular weight 12 kda mo fractions 18 and saponins and tannins from young mo pods respectively 19 20 these compounds have been reported to destabilize cell membrane and cuticle collagen in the parasite but their activity is significantly dependent on the dose and exposure time 21 tannins from mo seeds have been found to reduce the motility of the infective stage larvae l3s in haemonchus contortus eggs by generating paralysis and interfering in the neuromuscular coordination of the larvae 20 22 23 crude extracts from different tissues of mo have been analyzed that show antibacterial activity against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria among them extracts from leaves bark roots flowers fruit and seeds have been reported 10 nevertheless relatively few reports related with the biological activity of distilled water or saline solution extracts of mo seeds are available in a report from 2012 segupta et al 24 showed that mo seed extract reduced the number of helminth eggs in irrigation water however these results are linked to the capability of the mo seed extract to reduce the number of helminth eggs based on its coagulation capability and not its biological activity other nonaqueous mo seed extracts have shown antibacterial and antifungal activity but only a few studies reported biological activity in aqueous extracts for example water soluble mo seed lectin was reported to be significantly effective against aedes aegypti larvae 25 and have antibacterial activity 26 27 the flocculating cationic polypeptide mocp isolated from mo seeds showed antibacterial activity by damaging bacterial cell membranes 28 however little is known about the mechanisms for bactericidal activity and a more systematic study is needed on the biological activity of aqueous mo seed extracts as well as the mechanisms involved 3 mo seeds as a coagulant flocculant 3 1 moringa oleifera mo seed processing techniques depending on the degree of purification required the three main steps in mo coagulant preparation are a flour preparation primary b protein extract secondary and c purification tertiary 5 the sequence of steps used in mo coagulant preparation or even the exclusion of one of them will directly influence the features of the coagulant and its performance in removing pollutants from different wastewater sources table 2 the preliminary process steps needed for seed harvesting include maturation husk removal and grinding fig 1 obtaining mo flour with a specific particle size can be achieved by using different equipment including a grinder mortar blender and mixer grinders and mortars are more effective in generating mo flour with a small particle size which reduces some lipids that are present in the seeds and reduces turbidity and apparent color when the flour is used in water treatment processes 29 the mo flour can then be sieved to decrease the particle size distribution according to the literature the most recommended particle sizes for water treatment applications range between 0 25 mm and 1 25 mm see table 2 after being sieved the powder can be dried by direct or indirect heat sources e g using solar radiation or a furnace 30 31 the mo seeds not only contain proteins that act as active coagulating agents but also a wide variety of other carbon based chemical compounds that favor the increase of organic load in treated wastewater therefore a post processing treatment is advisable for mo flour to extract coagulating compounds extracting mo proteins using water or salt solutions is suggested as a secondary process table 2 5 the efficiency of mo extracts to treat drinking water has been analyzed by several research groups as shown in table 2 however the main drawback associated with using mo seed extract with distilled water moc dw as a coagulant is the increase in chemical oxygen demand cod because of its dissolved organic carbon content which discourages its use in treating drinking water 32 33 when moc dw was used in filter units it did not significantly improve the efficiency of total solids removal and the efficiency of cod removal from effluents remains controversial because cod removal was reported improved in some cases but in other cases a significant increase in the cod load was found 34 35 better coagulant properties have been reported for salt solution extraction moc sc compared with water extraction moc dw 36 tables 3 and 4 which are usually related with the higher amount of soluble protein present in moc sc because the salts increase the ionic strength this increases the solubility of active ingredients 5 and favors the detachment of protein which produces a higher degree of solubility and amount of active ingredients in the medium 37 the removal of turbidity using nacl based moc sc extracts has been found to be greater than using kcl based moc sc extracts additionally flocs formed using nacl based moc sc coagulants precipitated at a higher rate and achieved higher color and turbidity removal in drinking water compared with those generated with the coagulant extracted using kcl 38 39 however the contents of organic carbon nitrates and phosphorus in the treated water have been reported to increase when moc dw and moc sc are used whereas no increase was observed using other mo seed purification treatments 32 40 5 this increase in organic matter has been reported to act as precursor to chlorination by products which suggests that mo seeds should be used as a coagulant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater effluents intended for water reuse only after purifying the active proteins 36 delipidation or some other purification method such as dialysis centrifugation ion exchange or lyophilization may be used to obtain pure coagulants table 1 5 40 41 the mo flour obtained through freeze drying and distilled water extraction has a soft and fine appearance whereas the mo flour obtained through saline solution extraction appears dry coarse and rough 37 consequently the final mo extract may differ based on the purification method and therefore different solvent extractions and extract fractionation will yield different types of products with varying quantities of bioactive compounds from the plant material 19 13 previous reports have compared the different solvents used for mo seed extraction 42 mainly using distilled water and salt solutions e g sodium chloride potassium chloride and sodium hydroxide as the extracting solvents nevertheless relatively few papers are available that present a systematic study of the effect of salt concentration on the efficiency of the extract in water treatment applications 43 because of the ionic nature of some coagulant agents in mo seeds a significant correlation between the ionic strength in the solvent and the extraction yield as well as the extract efficiency should be expected in water treatment applications however the lack of information in this subject is a significant knowledge gap that needs to be understood another related research avenue is using fraction coagulation performance to estimate the effect of different constituents in the extract on coagulation performance normark et al 15 used extract that contained protein fractions to assess their performance in coagulation processes to remove turbidity in drinking water they found an interesting trend in the performance of the different fractions related not only to the overall protein fraction but also to the actual water quality particularly water hardness however water hardness is a broad water quality parameter that may include several different ionic constituents that might have significantly different effects on the coagulation process systematic studies on mo extract fractions and the effect of specific ions in water e g chloride sulfate phosphate and carbonates would result in highly interesting new data for practical applications enhancing the coagulant characteristics observed in mo seed extracts is also a very interesting innovative research direction for example using iron oxide nanoparticles to improve mo seed extract efficiency for water treatment was reported recently 44 in this work the authors used iron oxide nanoparticles to create a magnetic coagulant that allows fast settling and easier separation of the flocs by using a magnetic field however nanomaterials agglomerate to a wide variety of novel materials with diverse physical characteristics that could be used to modify mo seed extracts to confer a wide variety of specific characteristics that may serve different purposes in water treatment processes furthermore using mo extracts to produce nanoparticles is another highly interesting research direction moringa oleifera extracts have been used to synthesize silver gold and zinc oxide nanoparticles with antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties 45 48 however the full potential of mo extracts in nanoparticle synthesis is not completely known and is a significant knowledge gap that is worth exploring 3 2 mo active components previous studies suggest that the coagulant properties of mature dry mo seeds are generated by the presence of cationic and water soluble proteins and some authors suggest that these coagulant properties can be improved by adding cations 41 49 it is worth noting that mo trees grow in different geographic areas which means that their seeds may have different constitutions depending on growth conditions that may eventually affect the protein concentration and coagulating properties 50 over eight different cationic protein fractions have been isolated from aqueous extracts of mo seeds 15 low molecular weight compounds 12 kda in the mo seed include not only proteins and peptides but also other organic compounds such as tannins terpenes and alkaloids 20 the active agents responsible for coagulation in mo have been suggested to be dimeric cationic proteins with a molecular mass in the range of 12 14 kda and an isoelectric point of ph 10 11 which means that they have a highly cationic nature 41 51 52 in this framework it has been also found that mo flour with high fractions of cationic protein 12 19 kda 94 9 w w and particle sizes in the range of 1 2 nm to 1 5 nm had higher adsorption affinities for suspended solids 15 another active agent that was initially identified as an organic polyelectrolyte and later as a thermoresistant protein with a molecular mass of 6 5 kda and isoelectric point ph between 9 6 and 10 has also been reported to have coagulation and antimicrobial properties 40 53 54 these findings are in agreement with a previous report of a 7 kda coagulant protein which was characterized within the intrinsically disordered proteins idps group with high thermal stability to have 70 of the coagulation activity exhibited by the crude protein extract 55 and a higher presence in the purified mo seeds at basic ph conditions amino acids from mo seeds have been reported to act as a buffer by accepting protons from water or releasing hydroxyl ions 41 56 57 in general it has been suggested that the capability of amino acids to have positive or negative charges depending on ph allows mo flour particles to adsorb anionic or cationic species 58 other reports indicate that any individual or combined cationic protein fraction can play a significant role in coagulation except for the combination of weakly cationic proteins with lower protein fractions 15 different types of protein have been identified to be responsible for mo promoted c f processes when used in wastewater treatment including some that are associated with biologic activity table 5 for example moringa oleifera lectin cmol protein a 3 kda lectin has been reported to have high coagulating activity whereas water soluble mo lectin wsmol isolated from seeds showed high antioxidant 59 25 60 and insecticidal activity however its use in water bodies when nontarget organisms are present requires further evaluation 61 four isoforms of the chitin binding protein mo cbp3 a 14 kda protein have been isolated from mo seeds namely mo cbp3 1 mo cbp3 2 mo cbp3 3 and mo cbp3 4 62 specifically mo cbp3 1 is a thermostable antifungal antibacterial flocculating 2s albumin that is widely used in water treatment mo cbp3 1 has also been reported to bind chitin by different mechanisms 63 and achieve pollutant removal depending on its chemical structure at a low concentration 0 2 wt 64 65 another active component extracted from mo seeds using salt in aqueous medium has been reported to be an organic polyelectrolyte with a molecular mass of approximately 3 kda 40 which has also shown highly efficient coagulant effects 49 despite all the available information more detailed research is needed to accurately determine the mo seed components involved in c f processes as well as the major variables involved that may affect their efficiency for example using phytochemical procedures to isolate and identify major and minor secondary metabolites in mo seeds is a significant knowledge gap that should be systematically researched along with the effect that other water parameters such as ionic strength and the presence of natural organic matter nom may have on process performance using modern analytical tools to identify the main components of the mo seed extracts seems to be another major knowledge gap for example only few reports on the analysis of some specific components in mo using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms are available 66 68 all of which mostly focus on biologically active or nutrimental metabolites using advanced mass spectrometry ms technologies such as triple quadrupole qqq and ion trap it in the chemical analysis of the coagulant active components from mo seed extracts may allow for the identification of unknown secondary metabolites that may have significant effects on c f processes other more recent technologies such as linear ion trap lit quadrupole quadrupole time of flight qqtof and quadrupole linear ion trap qqlit could be used for structure elucidation pretreating the extract sample for metabolite isolation is also a potential research gap as described in section 2 1 because mo seed extraction procedures involve distilled water and some specific saline solutions as solvents further extract partition analysis is needed 15 it is possible that using more accurate partition procedures such as solid phase extraction capillary electrophoresis or preparative ion or liquid chromatography to identify and isolate other components in the extract may help explain the reported behavior for water treatment processes 3 3 coagulation flocculation mechanisms the conventional zeta potential versus ph curve positive at low ph values and negative at high ph values is usually reported for mo seeds and the same trend has been reported for products from major purification processes using delipidated mo seeds as well as moc sc extracts moc sc pc or moc dw extracts moc dw pc it has been found that the zeta potential value increased for concentrated extracts and decreased for filtered extracts 69 71 the predominant mechanisms for pollutant removal using mo are adsorption charge neutralization and destabilized colloids particles as shown in fig 2 72 for nonprotein organic components the coagulation mechanism proposed is described as a cross linked structure with a network form like that proposed for sweep coagulation processes further related studies on coagulation using mo seeds 73 suggest that increasing ph values within the aqueous system results in the release of hydroxyl groups which shift the solution ph to alkaline values 74 75 and allow for colloid destabilization in some cases some authors have proposed that binding sites in mo proteins could be related with ph changes because of competition between h h3o and oh 76 in the case of low ph values h3o or h depending on the ph will compete with metal cationic ions for binding sites on mo proteins 76 77 or any other available active site previous studies also showed that at very low ph values e g 2 5 cationic ions such as cr 6 and as 5 are removed better than cr 3 and as 3 78 80 this can be explained by the schulze hardy rule nevertheless it seems contrary to the double layer compression coagulation method because charge neutralization could be present because of a major h presence in solution which is the same charge as the cations used in the experiments therefore another mechanism must be present besides charge neutralization in the case of organic pollutants specifically dyes no significant impact on biosorption were reported by a change in ph values 81 85 except when dyes were mixed with other species and then treated such as in distillery spent wash for this type of treatment lower ph values were reported to achieve higher dye removals 86 nevertheless tannery wastewater was an exception for which low ph conditions did not achieve the best removals 38 probably because of the presence of other organic compounds related with leather organic wastes previous reports on the real scale use of mo to treat wastewater suggest that ph values do not significantly affect the efficiency of the c f processes because of its complex cationic and anionic species mixture other components in mo seeds may also aid in coagulation to destabilize colloids in fact the hydrophobic effect between mo proteins and hydrophobic colloids in the wastewater could play an important part in c f processes 87 88 the removal of other organic compounds using mo seeds was also tested for example disinfection by products e g haloethers trihalomethanes and haloketones were successfully removed from water by adsorption using batch and fixed bed column experiments polar functional groups such as oh co and cn were found to be involved in the removal processes following the langmuir model at the main active sites which suggests that mo seed flour has a higher adsorption capacity than other reported sorbents 89 tetracycline removal using mo seed preparations has also been reported to be feasible 90 the authors suggested that coagulation was the mechanism that removed tetracycline from water through its interaction with lectin binding sites which was closely related with the zeta potential and ph in the process understanding the removal mechanisms is probably one of the most interesting gaps identified for water treatment processes using mo seeds particularly in the case of organic contaminants the processes involved in removing ionic species such as metallic ions or metalloids has been most widely studied and it is better understood in the case of organic contaminants for which ionic structures are almost nonexistent but polar and nonpolar structures should be considered the amount of available information is practically null as stated previously some reports have been published on using mo seeds to remove cod but the behavior of such a gross parameter can hardly be compared with those for the individual pollutants contributing to the overall cod first systematic studies on the potential of mo seeds to remove priority and emerging contaminants are needed few studies on the removal of emerging pollutants such as surfactants 91 92 pharmaceuticals 93 posttreatment chemicals 89 and detergents 94 are available as an example a research on agricultural and urban wastewater treatment using chitosan and mo seed flour to remove mn pb and turbidity concluded that pollutant removal mechanism does not depend on the nature of the water submitted to remediation when mo seed flour was analized nevertheless they acknowledge the impact of emerging contaminants on mo behavior 95 considering the growing amount of compounds that are proposed to be included in the list of emerging contaminants the feasibility of using mo seeds for treating water contaminated with these compounds is a gap that is worth exploring new research avenues should focus on real wastewater samples that contain the target pollutants and or the overall characterization of the mechanisms involved in the removal processes as well as potential pre and posttreatment processes that can be coupled with mo seeds to find the best technology available 4 mo for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment 4 1 livestock and food industry wastewater for treating livestock effluents with mo seed 64 cod removal 96 has been achieved using a dose of 7 g l table 6 for removing turbidity no improvement was reported for porcine wastewater treatment but total and thermotolerant coliforms were significantly removed 96 and 94 respectively 97 for treating synthetic dairy industry wastewater mo was also reported to have better removal results using an increased dose of coagulant under basic conditions 50 removal of cod and 95 removal of color and turbidity 4 achieving high cod removal using mo seeds is difficult because some organic compounds in mo seeds can be transferred to the effluent to solve this problem some studies used filters as a complementary process for example an increase in cod removal from 40 to 99 was reported using mo coagulation followed by ultrafiltration 98 however statistical analysis demonstrated that mo seeds did not increase the removal efficiency of total solids in wastewater 34 different organic filter materials i e coal sawdust gliricidia branches and eucalyptus and bamboo leaves were tested after mo application and bamboo leaves were found to provide the best results 35 for synthetic dairy wastewater no significant difference was found between the total suspended solids total solids and cod removal values when different the filtration materials were tested after mo treatment 34 suhartini et al 99 proposed using mo seeds 150 mg l in a primary sedimentation tank followed by two stage settling with natural filters i e coconut fiber followed by sand to remove organic matter and coliforms in tapioca starch wastewater the removal results were good for biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and cod table 7 but the coliform content slightly increased which was probably because of the higher bod values in tapioca starch wastewater compared with other wastewater types making detention time in sedimentation tanks favorable to microorganism growth wastewater from the coffee industry was tested for turbidity removal using mo seed water extract and turbidity removal higher than 90 was achieved as shown in table 7 100 the moc dw was found to be ph dependent achieving 100 of insoluble cod and total nitrogen removal but with a low efficiency of tss and total cod removal of 54 and 25 respectively 101 bhatia et al 102 achieved a high removal of suspended solids 99 3 by mixing mo seed flour after lipid extraction with a liquid dispersion flocculant nalco 7751 but with poor cod removal efficiency these authors later used factorial experiment design and response surface methodology rsm to optimize the process and they found the optimum dose of mo to be 3469 mg l and the optimum does of nalco 7751 to be 6736 mg l 103 using mo to treat distillery waste effluents has been reported to remove 97 of color 90 of cod and 99 of turbidity by mixing ferric sulfate and moc sc 86 using rsm to optimize the process prasad 104 found that mo extracts made with 0 25 m potassium chloride are better at removing color than mo extracts made with sodium chloride 4 2 textile and dye industry wastewater the chemical structure specifically related to the number of sulfonic groups affects the behavior of dyes with respect to mo acting as a coagulant 81 it has been reported that changes in the ph value resulted in no significant changes in removing reactive dyes with only slightly better performance for processes taking place at ph 9 0 81 dyes with cationic and anionic properties such as methylene blue and acid orange 7 were removed in acidic conditions ph 2 5 5 as shown in table 8 temperature does not seem to be a significant factor when mo seeds are used as a coagulant the best coagulant dose changed depending on the initial dye concentration table 8 although in general reactive dyes require higher coagulant doses to be removed most of the studies on dye removal focus on using mo seed flour as an extract with salts including anionic dyes evidence shows these extracts improved dye removal compared with using only mo seed flour the mo extracts obtained by stirring the seed flour into a saline solution achieved over 94 of dye removal for all solutions except acid orange 7 when just water was used in the extraction solution only 80 of dye removal was achieved nevertheless other authors have suggested that adding salt could be unnecessary because textile wastewater contains high levels of salt 81 table 9 shows that treating real dye effluents is more difficult because lower removal percentages have been achieved compared with those obtained for synthetic sample studies which is probably related to the higher loads of organic and inorganic residuals occurring in real wastewater compared with the synthetic wastewater samples the partially delipidated shelled mo seed powder was able to coagulate 200 l of real textile wastewater which proved to be the most effective coagulant when compared with moc sc and moc dw in this framework improving the removal capability of mo seed flour by adding a second treatment and also using organic materials as active components in the treatment similar to the organic filters used before is desirable a solid state fermentation composting reactor using sunflower head waste shw disks was used after mo seed flour and the results were less toxic than the supernatant obtained after coagulation with only mo 105 adding a second treatment process improves the performance of the water treatment after using mo seeds and makes the process suitable to treat wastewater from the textile industry which is of particular interest for asia africa and the americas where mo plants can be easily harvested and textile wastewater production is highly significant such as in china india and brazil 106 4 3 municipal wastewater effluents the mo seeds and their extracts have been tested for their potential to remove pollutants from municipal wastewater effluents the reported results showed that primary treatment using water mo extracts achieved higher removal efficiency for lead and chromium compared with mo seed flour but using mo seed flour decreased electric conductivity and maintained better ph stability 56 table 10 shows detailed information on using different mo related products for municipal wastewater effluents combining commercial coagulants with mo has been reported to be a common practice for improving the treatment results for municipal effluents using a combination of 100 mg l of mo and 10 mg l of aluminum sulfate followed by sand filtration removed 64 of cod and decreased the amount of sludge generated during the treatment process 3 the highest reduction in turbidity 96 8 was obtained using aluminum sulfate followed by wsmol compared with its simultaneous application 91 3 107 the mo treatment showed the highest efficiency in reducing total bacterial population compared with aluminum sulfate and sand filters applied in a stabilization pond 108 4 4 treatment of specific wastewater contaminants 4 4 1 turbidity and microorganisms removal the mo seed flour is efficient in removing turbidity which significantly correlates with the removal of helminth eggs in turbid wastewater 109 however the efficiency of mo extract decreases with turbidity reduction yarahmadi et al 2009 compared the efficiency of mo extract with polyaluminium chloride and the later had greater efficiency in low turbid water 72 chaudhuri et al 2009 also concluded that mo seed extract was effective as a primary coagulant and as an adjuvant coagulant for clarifying turbid or colored water 110 noor et al 2015 achieved 96 removal of turbidity in wastewater using mo seed flour and kcl based extracts 37 an antimicrobial factor called glucomoringin gmg has been found in mo seeds which is estimated to remove three log 99 99 of coliforms in water 111 113 other studies have stated that the antimicrobial qualities of mo seed protein is attributable to membrane fusion 114 moringa oleifera seed flour is commonly used to clarify turbid water but table 11 shows that different contaminant removal values are achieved using mo seed products obtained with different treatments mainly moc sc and moc dw the general trend shows that the mo seed flour itself achieves the best results although a major coagulant dose is needed it also seems that moc sc is best for achieving removals but a selective microorganism removal behavior is present there seems to be very little difference in the removal values of mo extracts and therefore statistical studies are needed to determine whether the difference is significant as described previously filtration is an alternative option for an additional water treatment after using mo related products in this case removing microorganisms in water and using mo seed flour as a coagulant in slow filtration processes seems to lower the coagulant dose and improve removal values however more research is needed to determine whether or not slow filtration process generate an increase in microorganism loads as reported previously 115 previous works have found that mo seed extracts possesses low antimicrobial effectiveness against vibrio spp compared with extracts made of mo tree pods leaves and flowers 116 additionally if mo seed flour is used to purify drinking water the organic matter content in the treated water promotes microbial recontamination therefore the storage time of water treated with mo seed flour should be less than 24 h and at a low temperature 80 more research is needed to determine whether or not water that is free from microorganisms can be obtained using mo related products 117 even if this is possible another issue is that microorganisms may be making their way into sewage sludge along with suspended solids 57 this could cause an increase in pathogen antibiotic resistance ar or antibiotic multiresistance amr for which standard treatments become inefficient which increases the risk of propagation 118 because some popular antibiotics e g fluoroquinolones fqs have a high affinity to sludge and sediments 119 for example rosas et al 2015 found that 16 of the total bacteria load in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp presented amr 12 of the amr bacteria was transported into sediment where treated wastewater was discharged and 7 of the amr bacteria was transported to the lake water 120 because the bacteria are not inactivated they remain active in the sludge 57 and make sludge and sediments unusable for agriculture purposes this presents another knowledge gap that needs to be studied to determine whether using mo seed flour and their related products are an ecologically feasible wastewater treatment 4 4 2 trace metals removal table 12 shows the main metals and metalloids removed with mo seeds that have been reported in literature cadmium cd was removed 85 from water using a batch and continuous flow system in a fixed bed column 121 by adding 20 g l of mo seed flour at an initial ph of 6 5 122 fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir was used to demonstrate that cd removal with mo seed flour in water proceeded through cd amino acid interactions that are responsible for the adsorption of the contaminant 78 123 124 the removal of cd and zinc zn has been shown to fit the langmuir model with significantly higher correlation coefficients 0 98 in both cases establishing that zn2 was highly bioadsorbed up to 60 which was greater than cd2 76 because the zn removal process is more sensitive to ph changes than cd2 the ph was found to affect zn removal with mo seed flour because of the pronounced increase of zn biosorption with the increase of the initial ph value in the solution 123 the use of encapsulated mo seed flour achieved 61 of zn removal which increased to 84 removal using a 4 5 cm internal diameter 55 cm high packed column made of pyrex glass 77 in the case of copper cu adsorption using mo seed flour was affected by particle size 30 in particular the removal of heavy metals using mo seed flour improved with particle sizes in the range of 250 mm to 106 mm 123 using encapsulated moringa oleifera beads emb in batch experiments dose 10 g l at ph 2 0 a 99 removal of cu was achieved but no significant improvement in cu removal was found when the packed column process was tested 77 the removal of trivalent chromium cr iii using mo seed flour has been reported to be in the range of 81 to 97 78 124 125 whereas removals as high as 88 are reported for hexavalent chromium cr vi the removal efficiency in the case of cr iii and vi has been suggested to be closely related with the seed flour posttreatment the presence of other metals 78 124 125 and the ph 78 125 the removal of lead pb has been tested using mo and moringa stenopetala seed flour moringa stenopetala showed better coagulant performance in the removal of pb with 15 g l being the best removal conditions at 100 c and ph 10 0 9 however other authors have found different operating conditions obtaining 95 removal of pb using only mo seed flour and mild operation conditions ph 2 0 coagulant dose 5 g l and 22 c 123 in summary it can be stated that the general tendency of mo seed flour is that it performs better as a coagulant for metal ions when present as small particles approximately 106 Œºm and under acidic conditions except in the case of nickel ni and manganese mn 123 removal efficiency decreases 10 20 when treating different metal ions simultaneously which can be rationalized by the decrease in available adsorption sites 124 hydrogen ion and metal cation exchange mechanisms may be involved in the removal process and result in metal hydroxide precipitation which is suggested by the extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafss analysis 8 the results obtained from regenerating the material used in different cycles show that exhausted mo biomaterial could be effectively used for up to five cycles for sorption 78 as stated previously further studies on treating real metal wastewater that focus on toxicity in treated water and sludge are needed to determine the capability of mo seed flour to be reused 5 conclusions the number of information gaps identified in this research area are significant despite the encouraging reported results for using mo to treat wastewater and the lack of systematic research that has been conducted is one of the most important because of the wide variety of content in mo seeds and the different wastewater types it is difficult to use the available information to determine the coagulation mechanisms taking place when mo seed flour or any of its derivatives are used for wastewater treatment nevertheless some important information regarding using mo related products in wastewater treatment has been determined although ph seems to have significant effects on specific contaminants being removed from synthetic wastewater changes in ph have not been found to affect mo related coagulant performance in real wastewater treatment mo seed flour shows good results for removing turbidity and real wastewater pollutants although purification and protein extraction of mo seed flour show a significant improvement in some pollutant removal in general these improvements are mainly seen when specific pollutants are studied alone in synthetic wastewater samples although purification is not needed to use mo seed flour to treat wastewater it is usually used to avoid increasing organic matter after wastewater treatment the main reason to avoid increasing organic matter after wastewater treatment is because organic matter allows for microorganism growth although mo seed flour has antimicrobial effects these effects have not been found to significantly overcome microbial growth for long detention time periods wastewater treatment using mo seed flour is a highly interesting alternative method in developing countries specifically for small wastewater treatment plants of the several advantages of using mo seed flour high cost efficiency and low toxicity are the most important additionally when mo is used in conjunction with chemical coagulants to enhance water treatment processes it improves efficiency and lowers the final toxicity of the treated water other beneficial aspects of using mo related products in wastewater treatment are their larvicidal and antimicrobial effects which are most obvious when mo products are used without processing techniques more studies are needed to determine how the contents of mo seeds interact with colloids present in wastewater and understand their behavior and stability acknowledgments this material is based upon work supported in part by the national science foundation grant iia 1301726 the authors are also

14557,using greener processes to treat wastewater has become increasingly popular because these processes are environmentally friendly and offer a wide variety of other benefits such as reducing costs reducing the generation of by products and providing greater biodegradability in particular moringa oleifera mo has historically been used as a natural coagulant to treat contaminated effluents and it continues to be used today this paper is a collection of information related with using mo in contemporary applications mainly wastewater treatment it reviews the main active components involved in the processes the most significant mechanisms identified seed processing techniques and some practical applications and the main trends in the field as well as provides comments and recommendations

educational scientific and cultural organization wsmol water soluble mo lectin wsp whole seed powder wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction water is a key factor for economic development worldwide because it is widely used in different productive sectors such as industry livestock and agricultural production and urban supply which has led to water overuse according to unesco reduced water quality contributes to water scarcity factors such as rapid urbanization increased farming activities pesticide use land degradation high population density and unsuitable waste disposal are affecting the quality of available fresh water sources 1 one of the main challenges of this century will be achieving water recycling processes to ensure worldwide water supply effective water resource management and contamination control are required to fulfill this water challenge to accomplish these requirements investment in a sustainable sanitation system is needed that includes technical economic social and ecological approaches 2 wastewater treatment is a key process in sanitation systems one of the major challenges that water treatment processes face is the removal of hydrophobic colloids because this particulate matter which is mainly organic in nature is usually present at high concentrations and sizes compared with other pollutants 3 in wastewater treatment processes one of the primary processes is coagulation followed by flocculation coagulation and flocculation are physicochemical processes that are frequently used at the beginning or end of wastewater treatment processes in conventional treatment processes many different types of coagulants are commonly used depending on the chemical features of the contaminants present in the water in general coagulants are classified as inorganic as well as synthetic organic or natural organic polymers 4 a new trend in wastewater treatment is currently being developed that uses more environmentally friendly materials such as natural organic polymers which have a variety of benefits including reducing costs preventing variations in the ph of the treated water reducing the production of sludge and providing greater biodegradability 5 although it seems like a recent idea it is worth mentioning the existence of sanskrit manuscripts that describe using substances from plant sources to treat domestic wastewater 6 although different natural coagulants have been studied for wastewater treatment in recent years 5 7 9 there is a significant lack of systematic information on the main advantages and disadvantages challenges and perspectives for using such natural materials for wastewater treatment the goals of this work are to undertake an in depth review of state of the art uses of moringa oleifera mo seeds and their related products to treat wastewater identify current knowledge gaps and determine future research directions 2 properties of moringa oleifera moringa oleifera has been frequently reported for its wide use as a vegetable functional food and medicinal plant with a rich nutritional composition and diverse pharmacological activities 10 the typical lipid content fatty acids and triglycerides of mo seeds is shown in table 1 in some reports analyzing egyptian mo seeds a large amount of fatty acids particularly omega 9 76 and saturated fatty acids e g palmitic stearic and arachidic acid 12 were found 11 and the oil obtained from the seeds showed nontoxic effects 12 additionally the presence of saponins flavonoids steroids terpenoids phenols and triterpenoids was confirmed in the plant material 13 the mo seed lipid content has been suggested to be related with harvesting practices or regional conditions leading to variations in the range of 30 to 42 14 it has been reported that the presence of fatty acids does not significantly affect mo seed coagulation activity 15 and therefore oil extraction is not needed to use mo seeds as a coagulant in coagulation flocculation c f processes 16 however it has also been reported that keeping the mo seed oils could have additional benefits because the presence of some fatty acids e g palmitoleic oleic linoleic linolenic cis 11 eicosenoic and cis 11 14 eicosadienoic acid in the range of 0 01 w v significantly prevent the formation of s aureus biofilm 17 moringa oleifera has also been found to have interesting biological activity for example ovicidal and larvicidal activity against haemonchus contortus has been reported for low molecular weight 12 kda mo fractions 18 and saponins and tannins from young mo pods respectively 19 20 these compounds have been reported to destabilize cell membrane and cuticle collagen in the parasite but their activity is significantly dependent on the dose and exposure time 21 tannins from mo seeds have been found to reduce the motility of the infective stage larvae l3s in haemonchus contortus eggs by generating paralysis and interfering in the neuromuscular coordination of the larvae 20 22 23 crude extracts from different tissues of mo have been analyzed that show antibacterial activity against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria among them extracts from leaves bark roots flowers fruit and seeds have been reported 10 nevertheless relatively few reports related with the biological activity of distilled water or saline solution extracts of mo seeds are available in a report from 2012 segupta et al 24 showed that mo seed extract reduced the number of helminth eggs in irrigation water however these results are linked to the capability of the mo seed extract to reduce the number of helminth eggs based on its coagulation capability and not its biological activity other nonaqueous mo seed extracts have shown antibacterial and antifungal activity but only a few studies reported biological activity in aqueous extracts for example water soluble mo seed lectin was reported to be significantly effective against aedes aegypti larvae 25 and have antibacterial activity 26 27 the flocculating cationic polypeptide mocp isolated from mo seeds showed antibacterial activity by damaging bacterial cell membranes 28 however little is known about the mechanisms for bactericidal activity and a more systematic study is needed on the biological activity of aqueous mo seed extracts as well as the mechanisms involved 3 mo seeds as a coagulant flocculant 3 1 moringa oleifera mo seed processing techniques depending on the degree of purification required the three main steps in mo coagulant preparation are a flour preparation primary b protein extract secondary and c purification tertiary 5 the sequence of steps used in mo coagulant preparation or even the exclusion of one of them will directly influence the features of the coagulant and its performance in removing pollutants from different wastewater sources table 2 the preliminary process steps needed for seed harvesting include maturation husk removal and grinding fig 1 obtaining mo flour with a specific particle size can be achieved by using different equipment including a grinder mortar blender and mixer grinders and mortars are more effective in generating mo flour with a small particle size which reduces some lipids that are present in the seeds and reduces turbidity and apparent color when the flour is used in water treatment processes 29 the mo flour can then be sieved to decrease the particle size distribution according to the literature the most recommended particle sizes for water treatment applications range between 0 25 mm and 1 25 mm see table 2 after being sieved the powder can be dried by direct or indirect heat sources e g using solar radiation or a furnace 30 31 the mo seeds not only contain proteins that act as active coagulating agents but also a wide variety of other carbon based chemical compounds that favor the increase of organic load in treated wastewater therefore a post processing treatment is advisable for mo flour to extract coagulating compounds extracting mo proteins using water or salt solutions is suggested as a secondary process table 2 5 the efficiency of mo extracts to treat drinking water has been analyzed by several research groups as shown in table 2 however the main drawback associated with using mo seed extract with distilled water moc dw as a coagulant is the increase in chemical oxygen demand cod because of its dissolved organic carbon content which discourages its use in treating drinking water 32 33 when moc dw was used in filter units it did not significantly improve the efficiency of total solids removal and the efficiency of cod removal from effluents remains controversial because cod removal was reported improved in some cases but in other cases a significant increase in the cod load was found 34 35 better coagulant properties have been reported for salt solution extraction moc sc compared with water extraction moc dw 36 tables 3 and 4 which are usually related with the higher amount of soluble protein present in moc sc because the salts increase the ionic strength this increases the solubility of active ingredients 5 and favors the detachment of protein which produces a higher degree of solubility and amount of active ingredients in the medium 37 the removal of turbidity using nacl based moc sc extracts has been found to be greater than using kcl based moc sc extracts additionally flocs formed using nacl based moc sc coagulants precipitated at a higher rate and achieved higher color and turbidity removal in drinking water compared with those generated with the coagulant extracted using kcl 38 39 however the contents of organic carbon nitrates and phosphorus in the treated water have been reported to increase when moc dw and moc sc are used whereas no increase was observed using other mo seed purification treatments 32 40 5 this increase in organic matter has been reported to act as precursor to chlorination by products which suggests that mo seeds should be used as a coagulant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater effluents intended for water reuse only after purifying the active proteins 36 delipidation or some other purification method such as dialysis centrifugation ion exchange or lyophilization may be used to obtain pure coagulants table 1 5 40 41 the mo flour obtained through freeze drying and distilled water extraction has a soft and fine appearance whereas the mo flour obtained through saline solution extraction appears dry coarse and rough 37 consequently the final mo extract may differ based on the purification method and therefore different solvent extractions and extract fractionation will yield different types of products with varying quantities of bioactive compounds from the plant material 19 13 previous reports have compared the different solvents used for mo seed extraction 42 mainly using distilled water and salt solutions e g sodium chloride potassium chloride and sodium hydroxide as the extracting solvents nevertheless relatively few papers are available that present a systematic study of the effect of salt concentration on the efficiency of the extract in water treatment applications 43 because of the ionic nature of some coagulant agents in mo seeds a significant correlation between the ionic strength in the solvent and the extraction yield as well as the extract efficiency should be expected in water treatment applications however the lack of information in this subject is a significant knowledge gap that needs to be understood another related research avenue is using fraction coagulation performance to estimate the effect of different constituents in the extract on coagulation performance normark et al 15 used extract that contained protein fractions to assess their performance in coagulation processes to remove turbidity in drinking water they found an interesting trend in the performance of the different fractions related not only to the overall protein fraction but also to the actual water quality particularly water hardness however water hardness is a broad water quality parameter that may include several different ionic constituents that might have significantly different effects on the coagulation process systematic studies on mo extract fractions and the effect of specific ions in water e g chloride sulfate phosphate and carbonates would result in highly interesting new data for practical applications enhancing the coagulant characteristics observed in mo seed extracts is also a very interesting innovative research direction for example using iron oxide nanoparticles to improve mo seed extract efficiency for water treatment was reported recently 44 in this work the authors used iron oxide nanoparticles to create a magnetic coagulant that allows fast settling and easier separation of the flocs by using a magnetic field however nanomaterials agglomerate to a wide variety of novel materials with diverse physical characteristics that could be used to modify mo seed extracts to confer a wide variety of specific characteristics that may serve different purposes in water treatment processes furthermore using mo extracts to produce nanoparticles is another highly interesting research direction moringa oleifera extracts have been used to synthesize silver gold and zinc oxide nanoparticles with antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic properties 45 48 however the full potential of mo extracts in nanoparticle synthesis is not completely known and is a significant knowledge gap that is worth exploring 3 2 mo active components previous studies suggest that the coagulant properties of mature dry mo seeds are generated by the presence of cationic and water soluble proteins and some authors suggest that these coagulant properties can be improved by adding cations 41 49 it is worth noting that mo trees grow in different geographic areas which means that their seeds may have different constitutions depending on growth conditions that may eventually affect the protein concentration and coagulating properties 50 over eight different cationic protein fractions have been isolated from aqueous extracts of mo seeds 15 low molecular weight compounds 12 kda in the mo seed include not only proteins and peptides but also other organic compounds such as tannins terpenes and alkaloids 20 the active agents responsible for coagulation in mo have been suggested to be dimeric cationic proteins with a molecular mass in the range of 12 14 kda and an isoelectric point of ph 10 11 which means that they have a highly cationic nature 41 51 52 in this framework it has been also found that mo flour with high fractions of cationic protein 12 19 kda 94 9 w w and particle sizes in the range of 1 2 nm to 1 5 nm had higher adsorption affinities for suspended solids 15 another active agent that was initially identified as an organic polyelectrolyte and later as a thermoresistant protein with a molecular mass of 6 5 kda and isoelectric point ph between 9 6 and 10 has also been reported to have coagulation and antimicrobial properties 40 53 54 these findings are in agreement with a previous report of a 7 kda coagulant protein which was characterized within the intrinsically disordered proteins idps group with high thermal stability to have 70 of the coagulation activity exhibited by the crude protein extract 55 and a higher presence in the purified mo seeds at basic ph conditions amino acids from mo seeds have been reported to act as a buffer by accepting protons from water or releasing hydroxyl ions 41 56 57 in general it has been suggested that the capability of amino acids to have positive or negative charges depending on ph allows mo flour particles to adsorb anionic or cationic species 58 other reports indicate that any individual or combined cationic protein fraction can play a significant role in coagulation except for the combination of weakly cationic proteins with lower protein fractions 15 different types of protein have been identified to be responsible for mo promoted c f processes when used in wastewater treatment including some that are associated with biologic activity table 5 for example moringa oleifera lectin cmol protein a 3 kda lectin has been reported to have high coagulating activity whereas water soluble mo lectin wsmol isolated from seeds showed high antioxidant 59 25 60 and insecticidal activity however its use in water bodies when nontarget organisms are present requires further evaluation 61 four isoforms of the chitin binding protein mo cbp3 a 14 kda protein have been isolated from mo seeds namely mo cbp3 1 mo cbp3 2 mo cbp3 3 and mo cbp3 4 62 specifically mo cbp3 1 is a thermostable antifungal antibacterial flocculating 2s albumin that is widely used in water treatment mo cbp3 1 has also been reported to bind chitin by different mechanisms 63 and achieve pollutant removal depending on its chemical structure at a low concentration 0 2 wt 64 65 another active component extracted from mo seeds using salt in aqueous medium has been reported to be an organic polyelectrolyte with a molecular mass of approximately 3 kda 40 which has also shown highly efficient coagulant effects 49 despite all the available information more detailed research is needed to accurately determine the mo seed components involved in c f processes as well as the major variables involved that may affect their efficiency for example using phytochemical procedures to isolate and identify major and minor secondary metabolites in mo seeds is a significant knowledge gap that should be systematically researched along with the effect that other water parameters such as ionic strength and the presence of natural organic matter nom may have on process performance using modern analytical tools to identify the main components of the mo seed extracts seems to be another major knowledge gap for example only few reports on the analysis of some specific components in mo using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms are available 66 68 all of which mostly focus on biologically active or nutrimental metabolites using advanced mass spectrometry ms technologies such as triple quadrupole qqq and ion trap it in the chemical analysis of the coagulant active components from mo seed extracts may allow for the identification of unknown secondary metabolites that may have significant effects on c f processes other more recent technologies such as linear ion trap lit quadrupole quadrupole time of flight qqtof and quadrupole linear ion trap qqlit could be used for structure elucidation pretreating the extract sample for metabolite isolation is also a potential research gap as described in section 2 1 because mo seed extraction procedures involve distilled water and some specific saline solutions as solvents further extract partition analysis is needed 15 it is possible that using more accurate partition procedures such as solid phase extraction capillary electrophoresis or preparative ion or liquid chromatography to identify and isolate other components in the extract may help explain the reported behavior for water treatment processes 3 3 coagulation flocculation mechanisms the conventional zeta potential versus ph curve positive at low ph values and negative at high ph values is usually reported for mo seeds and the same trend has been reported for products from major purification processes using delipidated mo seeds as well as moc sc extracts moc sc pc or moc dw extracts moc dw pc it has been found that the zeta potential value increased for concentrated extracts and decreased for filtered extracts 69 71 the predominant mechanisms for pollutant removal using mo are adsorption charge neutralization and destabilized colloids particles as shown in fig 2 72 for nonprotein organic components the coagulation mechanism proposed is described as a cross linked structure with a network form like that proposed for sweep coagulation processes further related studies on coagulation using mo seeds 73 suggest that increasing ph values within the aqueous system results in the release of hydroxyl groups which shift the solution ph to alkaline values 74 75 and allow for colloid destabilization in some cases some authors have proposed that binding sites in mo proteins could be related with ph changes because of competition between h h3o and oh 76 in the case of low ph values h3o or h depending on the ph will compete with metal cationic ions for binding sites on mo proteins 76 77 or any other available active site previous studies also showed that at very low ph values e g 2 5 cationic ions such as cr 6 and as 5 are removed better than cr 3 and as 3 78 80 this can be explained by the schulze hardy rule nevertheless it seems contrary to the double layer compression coagulation method because charge neutralization could be present because of a major h presence in solution which is the same charge as the cations used in the experiments therefore another mechanism must be present besides charge neutralization in the case of organic pollutants specifically dyes no significant impact on biosorption were reported by a change in ph values 81 85 except when dyes were mixed with other species and then treated such as in distillery spent wash for this type of treatment lower ph values were reported to achieve higher dye removals 86 nevertheless tannery wastewater was an exception for which low ph conditions did not achieve the best removals 38 probably because of the presence of other organic compounds related with leather organic wastes previous reports on the real scale use of mo to treat wastewater suggest that ph values do not significantly affect the efficiency of the c f processes because of its complex cationic and anionic species mixture other components in mo seeds may also aid in coagulation to destabilize colloids in fact the hydrophobic effect between mo proteins and hydrophobic colloids in the wastewater could play an important part in c f processes 87 88 the removal of other organic compounds using mo seeds was also tested for example disinfection by products e g haloethers trihalomethanes and haloketones were successfully removed from water by adsorption using batch and fixed bed column experiments polar functional groups such as oh co and cn were found to be involved in the removal processes following the langmuir model at the main active sites which suggests that mo seed flour has a higher adsorption capacity than other reported sorbents 89 tetracycline removal using mo seed preparations has also been reported to be feasible 90 the authors suggested that coagulation was the mechanism that removed tetracycline from water through its interaction with lectin binding sites which was closely related with the zeta potential and ph in the process understanding the removal mechanisms is probably one of the most interesting gaps identified for water treatment processes using mo seeds particularly in the case of organic contaminants the processes involved in removing ionic species such as metallic ions or metalloids has been most widely studied and it is better understood in the case of organic contaminants for which ionic structures are almost nonexistent but polar and nonpolar structures should be considered the amount of available information is practically null as stated previously some reports have been published on using mo seeds to remove cod but the behavior of such a gross parameter can hardly be compared with those for the individual pollutants contributing to the overall cod first systematic studies on the potential of mo seeds to remove priority and emerging contaminants are needed few studies on the removal of emerging pollutants such as surfactants 91 92 pharmaceuticals 93 posttreatment chemicals 89 and detergents 94 are available as an example a research on agricultural and urban wastewater treatment using chitosan and mo seed flour to remove mn pb and turbidity concluded that pollutant removal mechanism does not depend on the nature of the water submitted to remediation when mo seed flour was analized nevertheless they acknowledge the impact of emerging contaminants on mo behavior 95 considering the growing amount of compounds that are proposed to be included in the list of emerging contaminants the feasibility of using mo seeds for treating water contaminated with these compounds is a gap that is worth exploring new research avenues should focus on real wastewater samples that contain the target pollutants and or the overall characterization of the mechanisms involved in the removal processes as well as potential pre and posttreatment processes that can be coupled with mo seeds to find the best technology available 4 mo for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment 4 1 livestock and food industry wastewater for treating livestock effluents with mo seed 64 cod removal 96 has been achieved using a dose of 7 g l table 6 for removing turbidity no improvement was reported for porcine wastewater treatment but total and thermotolerant coliforms were significantly removed 96 and 94 respectively 97 for treating synthetic dairy industry wastewater mo was also reported to have better removal results using an increased dose of coagulant under basic conditions 50 removal of cod and 95 removal of color and turbidity 4 achieving high cod removal using mo seeds is difficult because some organic compounds in mo seeds can be transferred to the effluent to solve this problem some studies used filters as a complementary process for example an increase in cod removal from 40 to 99 was reported using mo coagulation followed by ultrafiltration 98 however statistical analysis demonstrated that mo seeds did not increase the removal efficiency of total solids in wastewater 34 different organic filter materials i e coal sawdust gliricidia branches and eucalyptus and bamboo leaves were tested after mo application and bamboo leaves were found to provide the best results 35 for synthetic dairy wastewater no significant difference was found between the total suspended solids total solids and cod removal values when different the filtration materials were tested after mo treatment 34 suhartini et al 99 proposed using mo seeds 150 mg l in a primary sedimentation tank followed by two stage settling with natural filters i e coconut fiber followed by sand to remove organic matter and coliforms in tapioca starch wastewater the removal results were good for biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and cod table 7 but the coliform content slightly increased which was probably because of the higher bod values in tapioca starch wastewater compared with other wastewater types making detention time in sedimentation tanks favorable to microorganism growth wastewater from the coffee industry was tested for turbidity removal using mo seed water extract and turbidity removal higher than 90 was achieved as shown in table 7 100 the moc dw was found to be ph dependent achieving 100 of insoluble cod and total nitrogen removal but with a low efficiency of tss and total cod removal of 54 and 25 respectively 101 bhatia et al 102 achieved a high removal of suspended solids 99 3 by mixing mo seed flour after lipid extraction with a liquid dispersion flocculant nalco 7751 but with poor cod removal efficiency these authors later used factorial experiment design and response surface methodology rsm to optimize the process and they found the optimum dose of mo to be 3469 mg l and the optimum does of nalco 7751 to be 6736 mg l 103 using mo to treat distillery waste effluents has been reported to remove 97 of color 90 of cod and 99 of turbidity by mixing ferric sulfate and moc sc 86 using rsm to optimize the process prasad 104 found that mo extracts made with 0 25 m potassium chloride are better at removing color than mo extracts made with sodium chloride 4 2 textile and dye industry wastewater the chemical structure specifically related to the number of sulfonic groups affects the behavior of dyes with respect to mo acting as a coagulant 81 it has been reported that changes in the ph value resulted in no significant changes in removing reactive dyes with only slightly better performance for processes taking place at ph 9 0 81 dyes with cationic and anionic properties such as methylene blue and acid orange 7 were removed in acidic conditions ph 2 5 5 as shown in table 8 temperature does not seem to be a significant factor when mo seeds are used as a coagulant the best coagulant dose changed depending on the initial dye concentration table 8 although in general reactive dyes require higher coagulant doses to be removed most of the studies on dye removal focus on using mo seed flour as an extract with salts including anionic dyes evidence shows these extracts improved dye removal compared with using only mo seed flour the mo extracts obtained by stirring the seed flour into a saline solution achieved over 94 of dye removal for all solutions except acid orange 7 when just water was used in the extraction solution only 80 of dye removal was achieved nevertheless other authors have suggested that adding salt could be unnecessary because textile wastewater contains high levels of salt 81 table 9 shows that treating real dye effluents is more difficult because lower removal percentages have been achieved compared with those obtained for synthetic sample studies which is probably related to the higher loads of organic and inorganic residuals occurring in real wastewater compared with the synthetic wastewater samples the partially delipidated shelled mo seed powder was able to coagulate 200 l of real textile wastewater which proved to be the most effective coagulant when compared with moc sc and moc dw in this framework improving the removal capability of mo seed flour by adding a second treatment and also using organic materials as active components in the treatment similar to the organic filters used before is desirable a solid state fermentation composting reactor using sunflower head waste shw disks was used after mo seed flour and the results were less toxic than the supernatant obtained after coagulation with only mo 105 adding a second treatment process improves the performance of the water treatment after using mo seeds and makes the process suitable to treat wastewater from the textile industry which is of particular interest for asia africa and the americas where mo plants can be easily harvested and textile wastewater production is highly significant such as in china india and brazil 106 4 3 municipal wastewater effluents the mo seeds and their extracts have been tested for their potential to remove pollutants from municipal wastewater effluents the reported results showed that primary treatment using water mo extracts achieved higher removal efficiency for lead and chromium compared with mo seed flour but using mo seed flour decreased electric conductivity and maintained better ph stability 56 table 10 shows detailed information on using different mo related products for municipal wastewater effluents combining commercial coagulants with mo has been reported to be a common practice for improving the treatment results for municipal effluents using a combination of 100 mg l of mo and 10 mg l of aluminum sulfate followed by sand filtration removed 64 of cod and decreased the amount of sludge generated during the treatment process 3 the highest reduction in turbidity 96 8 was obtained using aluminum sulfate followed by wsmol compared with its simultaneous application 91 3 107 the mo treatment showed the highest efficiency in reducing total bacterial population compared with aluminum sulfate and sand filters applied in a stabilization pond 108 4 4 treatment of specific wastewater contaminants 4 4 1 turbidity and microorganisms removal the mo seed flour is efficient in removing turbidity which significantly correlates with the removal of helminth eggs in turbid wastewater 109 however the efficiency of mo extract decreases with turbidity reduction yarahmadi et al 2009 compared the efficiency of mo extract with polyaluminium chloride and the later had greater efficiency in low turbid water 72 chaudhuri et al 2009 also concluded that mo seed extract was effective as a primary coagulant and as an adjuvant coagulant for clarifying turbid or colored water 110 noor et al 2015 achieved 96 removal of turbidity in wastewater using mo seed flour and kcl based extracts 37 an antimicrobial factor called glucomoringin gmg has been found in mo seeds which is estimated to remove three log 99 99 of coliforms in water 111 113 other studies have stated that the antimicrobial qualities of mo seed protein is attributable to membrane fusion 114 moringa oleifera seed flour is commonly used to clarify turbid water but table 11 shows that different contaminant removal values are achieved using mo seed products obtained with different treatments mainly moc sc and moc dw the general trend shows that the mo seed flour itself achieves the best results although a major coagulant dose is needed it also seems that moc sc is best for achieving removals but a selective microorganism removal behavior is present there seems to be very little difference in the removal values of mo extracts and therefore statistical studies are needed to determine whether the difference is significant as described previously filtration is an alternative option for an additional water treatment after using mo related products in this case removing microorganisms in water and using mo seed flour as a coagulant in slow filtration processes seems to lower the coagulant dose and improve removal values however more research is needed to determine whether or not slow filtration process generate an increase in microorganism loads as reported previously 115 previous works have found that mo seed extracts possesses low antimicrobial effectiveness against vibrio spp compared with extracts made of mo tree pods leaves and flowers 116 additionally if mo seed flour is used to purify drinking water the organic matter content in the treated water promotes microbial recontamination therefore the storage time of water treated with mo seed flour should be less than 24 h and at a low temperature 80 more research is needed to determine whether or not water that is free from microorganisms can be obtained using mo related products 117 even if this is possible another issue is that microorganisms may be making their way into sewage sludge along with suspended solids 57 this could cause an increase in pathogen antibiotic resistance ar or antibiotic multiresistance amr for which standard treatments become inefficient which increases the risk of propagation 118 because some popular antibiotics e g fluoroquinolones fqs have a high affinity to sludge and sediments 119 for example rosas et al 2015 found that 16 of the total bacteria load in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp presented amr 12 of the amr bacteria was transported into sediment where treated wastewater was discharged and 7 of the amr bacteria was transported to the lake water 120 because the bacteria are not inactivated they remain active in the sludge 57 and make sludge and sediments unusable for agriculture purposes this presents another knowledge gap that needs to be studied to determine whether using mo seed flour and their related products are an ecologically feasible wastewater treatment 4 4 2 trace metals removal table 12 shows the main metals and metalloids removed with mo seeds that have been reported in literature cadmium cd was removed 85 from water using a batch and continuous flow system in a fixed bed column 121 by adding 20 g l of mo seed flour at an initial ph of 6 5 122 fourier transform infrared spectrometry ftir was used to demonstrate that cd removal with mo seed flour in water proceeded through cd amino acid interactions that are responsible for the adsorption of the contaminant 78 123 124 the removal of cd and zinc zn has been shown to fit the langmuir model with significantly higher correlation coefficients 0 98 in both cases establishing that zn2 was highly bioadsorbed up to 60 which was greater than cd2 76 because the zn removal process is more sensitive to ph changes than cd2 the ph was found to affect zn removal with mo seed flour because of the pronounced increase of zn biosorption with the increase of the initial ph value in the solution 123 the use of encapsulated mo seed flour achieved 61 of zn removal which increased to 84 removal using a 4 5 cm internal diameter 55 cm high packed column made of pyrex glass 77 in the case of copper cu adsorption using mo seed flour was affected by particle size 30 in particular the removal of heavy metals using mo seed flour improved with particle sizes in the range of 250 mm to 106 mm 123 using encapsulated moringa oleifera beads emb in batch experiments dose 10 g l at ph 2 0 a 99 removal of cu was achieved but no significant improvement in cu removal was found when the packed column process was tested 77 the removal of trivalent chromium cr iii using mo seed flour has been reported to be in the range of 81 to 97 78 124 125 whereas removals as high as 88 are reported for hexavalent chromium cr vi the removal efficiency in the case of cr iii and vi has been suggested to be closely related with the seed flour posttreatment the presence of other metals 78 124 125 and the ph 78 125 the removal of lead pb has been tested using mo and moringa stenopetala seed flour moringa stenopetala showed better coagulant performance in the removal of pb with 15 g l being the best removal conditions at 100 c and ph 10 0 9 however other authors have found different operating conditions obtaining 95 removal of pb using only mo seed flour and mild operation conditions ph 2 0 coagulant dose 5 g l and 22 c 123 in summary it can be stated that the general tendency of mo seed flour is that it performs better as a coagulant for metal ions when present as small particles approximately 106 Œºm and under acidic conditions except in the case of nickel ni and manganese mn 123 removal efficiency decreases 10 20 when treating different metal ions simultaneously which can be rationalized by the decrease in available adsorption sites 124 hydrogen ion and metal cation exchange mechanisms may be involved in the removal process and result in metal hydroxide precipitation which is suggested by the extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafss analysis 8 the results obtained from regenerating the material used in different cycles show that exhausted mo biomaterial could be effectively used for up to five cycles for sorption 78 as stated previously further studies on treating real metal wastewater that focus on toxicity in treated water and sludge are needed to determine the capability of mo seed flour to be reused 5 conclusions the number of information gaps identified in this research area are significant despite the encouraging reported results for using mo to treat wastewater and the lack of systematic research that has been conducted is one of the most important because of the wide variety of content in mo seeds and the different wastewater types it is difficult to use the available information to determine the coagulation mechanisms taking place when mo seed flour or any of its derivatives are used for wastewater treatment nevertheless some important information regarding using mo related products in wastewater treatment has been determined although ph seems to have significant effects on specific contaminants being removed from synthetic wastewater changes in ph have not been found to affect mo related coagulant performance in real wastewater treatment mo seed flour shows good results for removing turbidity and real wastewater pollutants although purification and protein extraction of mo seed flour show a significant improvement in some pollutant removal in general these improvements are mainly seen when specific pollutants are studied alone in synthetic wastewater samples although purification is not needed to use mo seed flour to treat wastewater it is usually used to avoid increasing organic matter after wastewater treatment the main reason to avoid increasing organic matter after wastewater treatment is because organic matter allows for microorganism growth although mo seed flour has antimicrobial effects these effects have not been found to significantly overcome microbial growth for long detention time periods wastewater treatment using mo seed flour is a highly interesting alternative method in developing countries specifically for small wastewater treatment plants of the several advantages of using mo seed flour high cost efficiency and low toxicity are the most important additionally when mo is used in conjunction with chemical coagulants to enhance water treatment processes it improves efficiency and lowers the final toxicity of the treated water other beneficial aspects of using mo related products in wastewater treatment are their larvicidal and antimicrobial effects which are most obvious when mo products are used without processing techniques more studies are needed to determine how the contents of mo seeds interact with colloids present in wastewater and understand their behavior and stability acknowledgments this material is based upon work supported in part by the national science foundation grant iia 1301726 the authors are also

14558,in the current paper microporous nanohybrids of carbon xerogel and multi walled carbon nanotubes cx mwcnts with different loadings of mwcnts 1 2 and 4 g l were synthesized scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem assessed the decoration of microspheres of carbon particles in cx matrix with bundles of mwcnts nitrogen adsorption at 196 c revealed that the n2 uptake was enhanced when cx was decorated with mwcnts and the specific surface area sbet increased from 192 to 643 m2 g the resulting hybrids are mainly microporous materials rising the amount of mwcnts from 1 to 4 g l led to a decrease in the sbet from 643 to 515 m2 g i e decreased approximately 20 fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and boehm s titration showed that both acidic and basic oxygen functional groups were equally distributed while carboxylic groups were increased considerably by increasing the amount of mwcnts the efficiency of adsorption and catalytic oxidation properties of cx mwcnts nanohybrids towards removal of rhodamine b rb was examined adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed using five different adsorption isotherms i e langmuir freundlich flory huggins halsey and elovich models the equilibrium adsorption results proved that adsorption of rb dye onto these nanohybrids can be well fitted using langmuir and halsey isotherms these nanohybrids exhibited considerable adsorption capacities that varied from 154 to 256 mg g the catalytic performance indicated that the investigated nanohybrids could eventually be used for the removal of rb dye in presence of h2o2 and visible light within 60 min affirming that the cx mwcnts obtained are effective materials in liquid phase applications for treating dye contaminated industrial wastewater keywords microporous nanohybrids carbon xerogels multi walled carbon nanotubes porosity adsorption catalytic oxidation 1 introduction synthesis of organic gels and their carbon gels i e xerogels aerogels and cryogels by sol gel polycondensation was first reported by pekala 1 these materials are classified as one class of nanostructure carbon materials 2 due to their fascinating properties such as low mass density high surface area continuous porosities three dimensional network interconnected nodules and high conductivity they are also recognized as unique materials for high temperature thermal insulation 3 and capacitive deionization systems 4 furthermore such materials contain a hierarchical structure of pores formed during two stages of their synthesis the first stage associated by the formation of mesoporous structure during sol gel process as a result of phase separation while microporous structure is created as a result of carbonization in the second step furthermore the possibility of easy alteration in their textural and structural properties towards particular applications declares their use as adsorbents catalyst supports and electrode materials for supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries 5 14 in order to expand the potential applications of these unique materials some additives such as metals and carbon nanotubes cnts can be incorporated into the carbon gels matrix 15 in recent years cnts are emerged as one of the best additives in the design of carbon carbon nanohybrids due to their intrinsic properties such as electrical conductivities as high as 106 sm 1 16 thermal conductivities as high as 3000 wm 1 k 1 17 and elastic moduli on the order of 1 tpa and being extremely flexible 18 also the large surface to volume ratio of cnts 100 1000 making low addition of cnts less than 1 vol can produce a composite with novel properties 19 particularly worsley et al 20 synthesized a monolithic of double walled carbon nanotubes dwcnts carbon aerogels nanocomposites during sol gel polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant stabilized dispersion of dwcnts 20 in a further investigation they studied properties of single walled carbon nanotubes based carbon aerogels as a function of nanotube loading 0 55 wt 21 earlier research by haghgoo et al 22 documented the preparation of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts dispersed in resorcinol formaldehyde rf aerogel using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and studied the dispersion effect of mwcnts on the final properties of rf matrix also haghgoo and coworkers 23 studied the correlation between morphology and electrical conductivity of dried and carbonized multi walled carbon nanotube resorcinol formaldehyde xerogel composites where the maximum surface area of the mwcnts carbon xerogels cxs reached to 685 m2 g fathy et al 24 synthesized carbon nanotube carbon xerogel hybrid cnt cx during chemical vapor decomposition of camphor in presence of rf xerogel loaded with nickel catalyst results showed that this hybrid exhibited a specific surface area of 95 m2 g and a maximum capacitance of 50 f g however the chemical activation of this hybrid with phosphoric acid led to an enhancement in both the specific surface area and electrochemical capacitance reaching to 215 m2 g and 151 f g respectively therefore incorporating of cnts into the carbon gels matrix through sol gel step can produce valuable nanohybrids accompanying with an improvement in their chemical electrical thermal and mechanical properties on the basis of these promising findings the nanohybrids consisting of carbon xerogel and carbon nanotubes cx cnts were used effectively as electrodes in an energy storage application 24 26 these studies indicated that good dispersion of cnts through preparation of organic gels could enhance the capacitance performance of cx cnts electrodes rather than the individual component alone cx or cnts the most likely explanation of this finding is due to the presence of mesopores through cnts bundles and the micropores developed on the cx surface that could serve as active sites for fast electrolyte ions transfer which strengthened the electrochemical performance of electric double layer capacitors edlcs accordingly to the author s knowledge the use of cx cnts nanohybrids in liquid phase adsorption and catalysis processes has not yet been published recently few studies were carried out to prepare low cost cnts using agricultural wastes 27 28 in this study synthesized multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts from chemical vapor deposition of both rice straw as natural substrate and camphor as carbonaceous gas source 27 were successfully used as additives with carbon xerogel in sum the aim of this paper was to investigate the adsorptive and catalytic oxidation behaviors of carbon xerogels and mwcnts microporous nanohybrids towards removal of rhodamine b dye rb to find the optimum conditions different concentrations of mwcnts that well dispersed in sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant were performed during sol gel of resorcinol formaldehyde reactants to evaluate their effect on the adsorption and catalytic properties of obtained nanohybrids further investigation using sem tem n2 adsorption and ftir was also carried out rhodamine b rb dye is a synthetic dye and used extensively in textile leather paper and cosmetic industries and its resistance to biological and chemical degradation implies that it is an excellent compound for this study adsorption and catalytic experiments for the removal of rhodamine b rb dye from aqueous solutions were employed 2 experimental 2 1 materials resorcinol c6h6o panreac 99 formaldehyde hcho adwic 36 38 methanol ch3oh sigma aldrich 99 sodium

purification 2 2 preparation of mwcnts fathy 27 prepared laboratory multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts via chemical vapor deposition of camphor as carbon source onto as catalyst support of a hydrothermally treated rice straw loading with iron and nickel oxides at 850 c for 30 min prior to preparation of nanohybrids the produced mwcnts were purified with a mixture solution of hno3 h2so4 3 1 v v at 100 c for 4 h followed by washing for several times with distilled water till ph of filtrate becomes 6 then the sample was dried in an air oven at 80 c overnight the outer diameters of mwcnts were between 22 and 66 nm and the specific surface area of mwcnts was about a 35 m2 g 2 3 preparation of carbon xerogels mwcnts nanohybrids a sol gel procedure of resorcinol formaldehyde sodium dodecyl sulfate r f sds was carried out according to the following recipe reactants of r sds and na2co3 as alkaline catalyst c were dissolved in distilled water w and then formaldehyde solution f stabilized by 10 methanol was added into this mixture under vigorous stirring to form the hydrogel the hydrogel was obtained after 30 min at 80 c the molar ratios of the used reactants with respect to resorcinol were calculated as r f 0 5 r c 500 r w 0 027 and r sds 9 36 10 6 the ph of the sol was adjusted to 6 0 by 0 1 m naoh solution the prepared hydrogel was then transferred into a stoppered glass bottle and heated in an air oven at 80 c for 24 h to complete curing and gelling process afterwards the sealed bottle was opened to allow the gel obtained for drying at the same temperature for another 48 h after cooling the obtained xerogel was carbonized as follows the carbonization of xerogel prepared from sol gel of resorcinol formaldehyde sds was carried out at 350 c for 1 h and gradually raised up to 750 c for 2 h under flowing of n2 gas heating rate 10 min finally the carbon xerogel produced was washed thoroughly with hot distilled water for several times filtered dried and denoted as cx in preparation route of cx mwcnts nanohybrids initially three different concentrations of mwcnts 1 2 and 4 g l were dispersed in an aqueous surfactant solution containing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and water with a fixed weight ratio of mwcnts sds 2 3 22 this mixture was thoroughly stirred for 30 min followed by sonication for 1 h to form homogeneous solution a solution of r f and c with the same fixed molar ratios as abovementioned was added to mwcnts sds under stirring and heated at 80 c for 30 min the sol gel mixture was transferred into sealable glass moulds and kept in an air oven at 80 c for 1 day to complete polymerization process brownish black monolithic gels were formed and dried by evaporation at 80 c for 2 days and then exposed to carbonization process a vertical tubular reactor was used to carry out the pyrolysis of dried gel composites at two subsequent temperatures of 350 c for 1 h and 750 c at 2 h under passing n2 gas the resulting samples were denoted as the following cx 1 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively arabic numerals in the notations refer to the concentrations of mwcnts incorporated into cx matrix 2 4 characterization of the prepared samples the surface morphology and content of elements in the obtained nanohybrids were determined using field emission scanning electron microscope fei sem quanta feg 250 attached to energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction edax the structure of the prepared samples was estimated deeply by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jem 1230 japan the textural parameters such as brunauer emmett teller surface area sbet m2 g total pore volume vp cm3 g and average pore diameter r √• were determined using nitrogen adsorption analysis at 196 c bel sorp microtrac bel crop japan 29 in addition some textural parameters were evaluated using Œ±s method such as total surface area st Œ± m2 g non microporous surface area sn Œ± m2 g and the micropore volume vo Œ± cm3 g 30 to estimate the pore size distributions n2 gas adsorption data were analyzed using nldft method which allows the quantification of both micro and mesopores 31 the most important surface functional groups of the prepared samples were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir using kbr pellets jasco ft ir 460 plus determination of ph at point of zero charge phpzc was evaluated by mixing 0 05 g of each sample with 25 ml of nacl solution 0 1 m the phinitial was adjusted between 2 and 12 using 0 1 m of either hcl or naoh solution the final ph was measured after 24 h under stirring at room temperature the phpzc value of each sample was determined when the curve Œ¥ph phinitial phfinal vs phinitial crosses the line of x axis phinitial at its origin it is well known that the point of zero charge determines the surface charge of the adsorbent at a given ph and its knowledge informs about the possible electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate species in liquid phase the surface oxygen groups on a carbon material with acidic carboxyl lactone phenol as well as basic properties can be determined by using the boehm method 32 the acidic sites were determined by mixing small quantities 0 05 g of each carbon material with 20 ml of different bases 0 1 m naoh 0 1 m na2co3 and 0 1 m nahco3 in 25 ml beakers the beakers were sealed and shaken for 24 h the solutions were then filtered and titrated with 0 1 m hcl solution similarly the basic sites were determined by mixing 0 05 g of each carbon material with 20 ml of 0 1 m hcl solution the obtained solutions were titrated with 0 1 m naoh iodine adsorption test for the prepared carbons was performed according to the astm d4607 94 standard 2006 33 this method estimates the ability of adsorbents to adsorb molecules that have the size close to that of iodine molecules 1 nm from the liquid phase about 0 1 g of the sample was charged in 50 ml of 0 1 mol l potassium iodide aqueous solution shaking for 24 h at 25 c the uptaken amount was evaluated by titration of iodine solution against sodium thiosulfate solution 2 5 batch equilibrium experiments rhodamine b dye a cationic dye was selected to evaluate the adsorption and catalytic activities of the prepared samples a stock solution of rhodamine b dye rb c28h31o3n2cl 479 02 g mol containing 500 mg l was prepared by double distilled water adsorption experiments were carried out through batch mode in which a fixed amount of the adsorbent 0 05 g was added to 50 ml of dye solution of varying concentrations the solutions of dye and solid were placed in well closed flasks and left for 24 under shaking at 200 rpm the solutions were carefully separated by filtration to be analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu pc 2401 at a maximum wavelength of 553 nm the amount of rb adsorbed was calculated based on the following equation 1 q e c o c e v m where qe is the amount of adsorbed dye mg g co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of rb solutions mg l m the amount of adsorbent g and v is the volume of solution l adsorption equilibrium data which express the relationship between mass of adsorbate adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent and liquid phase equilibrium concentration of adsorbate are represented by adsorption isotherms and provide important design data of adsorption system the equilibrium data for the removal of rb were analyzed using the two parameter models such as langmuir 34 freundlich 35 flory huggins 36 halsey 37 and elovich 38 adsorption isotherms the langmuir isotherm 34 applies to localized adsorption of monolayer surface coverage assuming that each adsorbed molecule occupies one adsorption site the mathematical formula is given as 2 c e q e 1 k l q m 1 q m c e where qm is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity mg g and kl is the equilibrium constant which is related to the adsorption energy l mg which quantitatively reflects the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate a plot of ce qe versus ce gives a straight line while q m and kl were determined from the intercept and the slope respectively the essential characteristic of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant called equilibrium parameter 3 r l 1 1 c o k l where kl is the langmuir constant and co is the highest initial dye concentration mg l the value of rl indicates the type of isotherm to be either favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the freundlich equation 35 is an empirical model that considers heterogeneous adsorptive energies on the adsorbent surface this equation is characterized by two fitting parameters kf and n and represented by 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf is the freundlich isotherm constant mg g mg l 1 n which is an indicator of the adsorptive capacity of an adsorbent for a solute and n is a measure of the intensity of the adsorption or surface heterogeneity a value closer to zero for 1 n represents a more heterogeneous surface however the freundlich exponent n should have values lying in the range of 1 10 for classification as a preferable adsorption flory huggins isotherm 36 describes the degree of surface coverage characteristics of the adsorbate on the adsorbent the linear form of the flory huggins equation is expressed as 5 ln Œ∏ c o ln k f h n f h ln 1 Œ∏ where Œ∏ is the degree of surface coverage Œ∏ 1 ce co nfh is the number of adsorbates occupying adsorption sites and kfh is flory huggins equilibrium constant l g this model can also express the feasibility and spontaneous nature of an adsorption process the equilibrium constant kfh is used to calculate the spontaneity free gibbs energy by using the following equation 6 Œ¥ g o r t ln k f h where Œ¥go is standard free energy change r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is absolute temperature the halsey isotherm 37 is used to evaluate multilayer adsorption at a relatively large distance from the surface and the fitting of the experimental data to this equation attest to the heterogeneous surface nature of the adsorbent the adsorption isotherm

isotherm equation 38 is based on a kinetic principle which assumes that adsorption sites increase exponentially with adsorption leading to a multilayer adsorption the linear form of the elovich model is expressed as follows 8 ln q e c e ln k e q m q e q m two parameters called elovich maximum adsorption capacity qm mg g and elovich constant ke l mg can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln qe ce versus qe 2 6 catalytic oxidation experiments using h2o2 visible light the catalytic oxidation performance of each sample was tested toward degradation of a cationic dye rhodamine b rb as a model organic compound under dark and h2o2 visible light source prior to visible irradiation the carbon sample and rb dye solution mixture was magnetically stirred in the darkness for 20 min at room temperature 25 c in order to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium and to ensure that the removal of dye was acted by catalytic oxidation only the catalytic oxidation experiments were performed by adding 100 mg samples in 50 ml of rb dye solution with initial concentration of 50 mg l and initial ph 6 then 0 139 mol l of h2o2 1 ml was added and the visible light was irradiated using house hold fluorescent lamp of 44watt philips this lamp irradiates outside at a distance of 10 cm from the surface of dye solution the temperature of the solution was maintained constant throughout the reaction then 1 ml of an aliquot solution of the dye was withdrawn at regular interval times after dilution into 10 ml the dye solution was separated from carbon solid by filtration using whatman filter paper no 41 the remaining concentration of rb dye in the supernatant solution was estimated using the spectrophotometer at its Œªmax value in order to assess the reproducibility and error of adsorption and photodegradation tests the absorbance of dye was carried out in triplicate measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and texture characteristics in order to identify the microstructure of the pristine carbon xerogel cx and their nanohybrids with mwcnts prepared via chemical vapor deposition of camphor in presence of rice straw loaded nickel and iron scanning electron microscopy sem was used sem photographs of cx and cx 4 mwcnt highest volume of mwcnts in samples are shown in fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1a the network structure of the cx sample consists of interconnected spheres of primary carbon particles as a result of sol gel reaction formulation 1 an inset picture in fig 1a outlines that the surface of pristine carbon xerogels is composed of carbon spheres with irregular diameter size ranging from 5 to 28 nm also tem images in fig 1c and d illustrates the formation of carbon nodules in the pristine cx sample and their average sized varied approximately from 8 to 22 nm as well it indicated that mwcnts can be existed through interconnected nodules i e carbon spheres along network of cx as shown in fig 1c the outer diameters of mwcnts was measured and ranged from 20 to 30 nm in addition both sem and tem micrographs of cx 1 mwcnts nanohybrids depicts that large volume of mwcnts located at the surface of cx could be connected to the internal pores in cx upon increasing the amount of mwcnts to 4 g l led to aggregation of mwcnts bundles with forming orthogonal bundles like plane shape on the cx surface as depicted in fig 1d therefore the highest volume of mwcnts caused a remarkable decrease in the internal porosity while generated a lot of micropores in cx 4 mwcnts as seen in fig 2 a and table 1 to identify the presence of impurities like metal catalysts in the investigated samples the obtained mwcnts and cx 1 mwcnts samples were analyzed using edax as follows in fig 2 no metal catalysts in both samples were detected it can be seen that two samples consist mainly of c and o atoms nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms using the prepared samples are shown in fig 3 a eventually the incorporation of mwcnts into the matrix of cx contributed significantly in the evolution of porosity the resulting samples show a steep increase in the uptake of n2 at relative pressures lower than 0 01 in the following order cx cx 4 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts cx 1 mwcnts confirming the filling of both narrow micropores ultra micropores 0 7 nm and wide micropores super micropores 0 7 nm the adsorption of nitrogen on the cx sample is the lowest as compared to the other cx mwcnts composites according to iupac classification 29 adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 using cx shows combination of both type i and ii confirming that the adsorption of nitrogen occurs on micropores and non micropores this isotherm is typical for non porous or meso macroporous adsorbents in other composites except cx 4 mwcnts the isotherm established using cx 1 mwcnts and cx 2 mwcnts samples belong to combination type of i and iv with different extent of mesopores which is an indicative to the preparation of micro mesoporous solids while raising the concentration of mwcnts to 4 g l the adsorption desorption of nitrogen isotherm showed typically type i isotherm which is really corresponded to microporous solids with narrow and uniformity micropores 0 7 nm fig 3b shows the corresponding pore size distributions psds in the obtained samples using nldft model these plots show gradual increase in the pore volumes and their corresponding pore width with the incorporation of mwcnts into cx network structure however cx cx 1 mwcnts and cx 2 mwcnts samples exhibited broad pore size distributions even though the narrowing of hysteresis loop for these carbons may be reasoned by the fact that it mainly consists mesopores with size of 2 nm and closed at one end furthermore the pore widths varied from 0 5 to 3 5 nm 0 5 4 2 0 5 4 2 nm and from 0 to 2 5 nm in cx cx 1 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively the main heights of these peaks are centered at 1 99 2 15 2 15 and 0 73 nm in cx cx 1 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively the data concerning the textural properties of the prepared samples are presented in table 1 as a function of the mwcnts concentration in the matrix of cx the prepared nanohybrids were found to have larger total surface areas sbet than that of the pristine cx sample thus the incorporation of mwcnts during sol gel process of resorcinol formaldehyde followed by carbonization promotes well developed porosity the total surface area calculated from bet model increased from 192 to 643 m2 g the total pore volume increased from 0 149 to 0 545 cm3 g and the pore diameter increased slightly from 31 to 37 √• and then decreased to 18 √• for cx 4 mwcnts additionally the porous characteristics calculated from the Œ±s plot such as the total surface area st Œ± m2 g the non microporous surface area sn Œ± m2 g and the micropore volume vo Œ± cm3 g revealed that the addition of mwcnts with different concentrations increased the development of microporosity at the expense of mesopores on the other hand the cx 4 mwcnts sample showed the higher microporosity than other hybrids following by a decrease in the total surface area this result is probably attributed to the aggregation of mwcnts on the surface of cx as confirmed from tem previously the total surface area was decreased approximately about 4 and 8 for cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively according it can be concluded that the addition of cnts into the sol of resorcinol formaldehyde before gelling process could be modified easily the porous structure of cx 3 2 surface group features qualitative and quantitative measurements of the functional surface groups derived on the surface of cx and their composites with mwcnts were estimated using ftir and boehm s titration respectively as shown in fig 4 a and b in addition the kind of charges on the developed materials was determined by measuring the ph at point of zero charge as listed in table 2 the amount of iodine uptake mg g which is considered as an indicative parameter for the presence of micropores was calculated and presented also in table 2 however the decrease in iodine number is matched parallel with the decrease in the total surface area which is contrary to increase in micropores with increasing amount of mwcnts this result may be attributed to the creation of narrower micropores 0 73 nm cf table 1 which are not accessible to adsorb iodine particles compacting bundles of mwcnts on cx surface in case of loading high amount of mwcnt led to formation of such micropores with decreasing in the total surface area the major characteristics of absorption bands in ftir spectra of cx and cx 1 mwcnts are illustrated in fig 4a it can be seen that both samples show identical absorption bands with a slight shift in the intensity of bands addition of mwcnts increased the intensity of some bands at 1422 1084 and 470 cm 1 39 40 these bands are assigned to cc stretching vibration in aromatic rings co skeletal vibrations in ethers esters hydroxyls and phenol groups and out of plane vibration of ch moieties of aromatic structure confirming the incorporation of mwcnts into cx matrix whereas bands located at 3430 and 1632 cm 1 are shifted to a lower absorbance the former one is ascribed to oh stretching in adsorbed water or phenol molecules where the latter band is assigned to cc stretching in the backbone of cnts moreover the appearance of sharp bands at 470 cm 1 in the ftir of cx 1 mwcnts is related to ch out of plane bending vibrations in the aromatic ring this corroborates the generation of some oxygenated functional groups on the surface of cx 1 mwcnts that is introduced throughout the carbonization process two shoulder bands were observed at 2921 and 2855 cm 1 which are characteristic for ch asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations in ch2 ch3 groups on cx and cx 1 mwcnts boehm s titration was used to account for the amount of oxygenated functional groups mmol g formed on the surface of cx and their composites with mwcnts fig 4b elucidates that the surface of prepared samples consists of both acidic and basic oxygen functional groups it is noteworthy that the presence of mwcnts increased the amount of basic groups from 29 to 36 mmol g while the content of acidic groups from 31 to 34 mmol g c f table 2 this result confirms that the mwcnts have surface oxygen groups functionalized the cx surface the surface of these carbon materials seems to be neutral in nature since their phs at point of zero charge phpzc lies between 7 1 and 6 8 except for the cx 4 mwcnts that exhibits slightly acidic ph 6 2 it was noticed also that the carboxylic groups are increased remarkably with increasing the amount of mwcnts as evident also from ftir results 3 3 adsorption isotherm studies adsorption isotherm studies are important to identify the adsorption behavior between the solid and liquid phases at equilibrium state the adsorption isotherms of rb dye onto the samples were investigated at 25 c and ph 6 50 500 mg l of rb dye solutions were conducted with 0 05 g of sample the equilibrium data for the removal of rb dye in the present investigation were analyzed using five adsorption isotherms such as langmuir freundlich flory huggins halsey and elovich analysis of isotherm data and fitting it to the different isotherm models by comparing the correlation coefficients r2 is a vital step to propose the suitable model which can be used according to the values of r2 deduced from application of isotherms the adsorption of rb dye onto samples can be described in the following order langmuir halsey freundlich flory huggins elovich the shape of isotherms is depicted in fig 5 and is important to diagnose the nature of adsorption giles et al 41 have classified the isotherm s shape of adsorption into four main groups l s h and c according to this classification the isotherms of rb dye onto all samples displayed an l type such type means that there is no strong competition between solvent i e h2o and adsorbate molecules rb dye to occupy the adsorbent surface sites in this case the longitudinal axes of the adsorbed molecules are parallel to the adsorbent surface 42 the corresponding parameters calculated from the five isotherms are summarized also in table 3 inspection of table 3 reveals that the highest values of correlation coefficients r2 0 953 0 998 were obtained from langmuir and halsey isotherm models this confirms the occurrence of monolayer and multilayer adsorption of rb dye with different extent on the surface of the prepared samples due to the presence of various active sites regarding the values of adsorption capacity q0 mg g derived from langmuir isotherm model the adsorption ability of cx increased from 3 to 5 folds after incorporating mwcnts into its network the cx sample decorated with lowest amount of mwcnts cx 1 mwcnts showed the highest adsorption capacity 256 mg g while an excess increase in the amount of mwcnts e g cx 2 mwcnts or cx 4 mwcnts decreased the capacity from 256 to 154 mg g this trend in adsorption capacity is in good agreement with the previously mentioned results concerning the decrease in both surface area and total pore volume upon loading amount of mwcnts more than 1 g l as indicated in table 1 nevertheless this sample is considered as the most suitable adsorbent material for adsorbing rb dye from wastewater however freundlich model exhibited relatively lower correlation coefficients r2 0 921 0 946 the values of the freundlich adsorption intensity n ranges from 2 22 to 2 43 indicating that rb dye adsorption is favorably adsorbed on all prepared samples i e cx and cx mwcnts nanohybrids values of r2 0 783 0 919 computed from flory huggins and elovich isotherms are much lower than other models meaning that both models are not valid to describe the rb adsorption onto the surface of samples the calculated values of Œ¥g0 from eq 6 are listed in table 3 the negative sign of Œ¥go shows that rhodamine b adsorption is a spontaneous and feasible process the obtained adsorption capacities of cx mwcnts nanohybrids towards rhodamine b rb dye were compared with those of other reported carbon based adsorbents in the literature as listed in table 4 results of adsorption capacities appeared that the cx mwcnts nanohybrids synthesized in this study can yield higher adsorption capacity towards rb dye than the other reported carbon adsorbents therefore these nanohybrids are considered to be efficient adsorbents in remediation of dye contaminated industrial wastewater 3 4 catalytic oxidation performance demonstration of catalytic oxidation performance of cx mwcnts as metal catalysts free of known metal oxides such as mno2 fe2o3 cuo tio2 zno etc has received considerable attention as a new approach in the industrial applications in order to minimize the cost of process 10 47 49 fig 6 a displays the removal of rb dye solution onto the best adsorbent cx 1 mwcnts in either dark or visible light h2o2 for sake of comparison the removal of dye was examined also in presence of light h2o2 only in such condition the maximum removal i e degradation of rb dye was found to be 12 at 150 min in dark the adsorption process attained removal of 90 from rb dye molecules at 90 min while almost 100 removal of the rb dye could be achieved during 60 min using 0 139 mol l h2o2 in presence of visible light hence the removal of rb molecules onto cx 1 mwcnts in presence of light h2o2 is faster than in dark therefore the prepared nanohybrids of metal free catalysts can remove rb dye efficiently in presence of h2o2 and visible light to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of the prepared samples as a function of their textural properties catalytic oxidation experiments were performed over all the prepared samples keeping other parameters constant e g ph carbon dose h2o2 dose and temperature results are shown in fig 6b again the nanohybrid of cx 1 mwcnts exhibits superior catalytic oxidation performance than that obtained by other samples toward removal of rb dye when light h2o2 is present from this figure the maximum removal efficiencies were calculated and found to be 78 85 99 and 100 over cx cx 4 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 1 mwcnts respectively within 150 min it can be turning out that the synergistic effect between the cx 1 mwcnts and light h2o2 is conducive to the enhancement in removal of rb dye from aqueous solution more rapidly than adsorption process only the reason for the catalytic activity of the cx mwcnts may be interpreted to the outstanding graphitic structure including surface functional surface groups and delocalized œÄ electrons at the basal of graphitic structure it has been previously reported that catalytic behavior of carbon materials depends on their surface properties which may act as active sites for specific catalytic operations 47 48 particularly the basic oxygen groups present on the surface of carbon materials can increase not only the h2o2 degradation rate but also the yield of ho formation the œÄ electrons in the basal planes also contribute to the basicity of the carbon material affecting its adsorption and catalytic properties 47 as well the visible light accelerates the formation rate of hydroxyl radicals ho when h2o2 molecules are adsorbed on the surface of cx mwcnts as expressed in the following equations 49 9 h2o2 hŒΩ 2 ho 10 upon addition of h2o2 h2o2 molecules are readily adsorbed and the catalyzed reaction occurs when exposed directly to visible light on the surface of cx mwcnts in order to form ho radicals these radicals will attack the adsorbed dye molecules on the surface of sample and the remained dye molecules in the aqueous solution in order to decompose them into harmless substances 9 10 49 moreover uv vis adsorption spectra for the dye before and after removing either by adsorption or catalytic oxidation using the best sample cx 1 mwcnts as an example are shown in fig 7 this figure elucidates that the full removal of rb dye using the selected sample was achieved through catalytic oxidation h2o2 visible light as compared with removal of dye by adsorption in dark 4 conclusions in summary nanohybrids of carbon xerogels decorated with different concentrations of mwcnts were synthesized the physico chemical characteristics of resulting samples were investigated using sem tem n2 adsorption and ftir the amount of oxygen functional groups was identified by boehm s titration adsorption capacity and catalytic activity of these samples were studied during removal of rhodamine dye from aqueous solution adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed using five different adsorption isotherms which are langmuir freundlich flory huggins halsey and elovich models it was found that the n2 uptake was enhanced when cx was decorated with mwcnts and the specific surface area sbet increased from 192 to 643 m2 g the resulting hybrids are mainly microporous materials hence the introduction of mwcnts through sol gel process of resorcinol formaldehyde which was prepared from chemical vapor deposition of camphor onto rice straw developed new pores and slight amounts of acidic and basic groups after carbonization equilibrium adsorption results proved that adsorption of rb dye onto the prepared hybrids can be described preferably by langmuir and halsey isotherms the prepared nanohybrids exhibited considerably high adsorption capacity as high as 154 256 mg g prepared nanohybrids of metal free catalysts could remove rb dye completely in presence of h2o2 and visible light at 60 min overall the basic surface oxygen and textural characteristics controlled the removal of rb dye molecules from aqueous solutions onto nanohybrids through either adsorption in dark or catalytic oxidation in presence of h2o2 and light acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports provided by the national research centre egypt under the project no 11090201 
14558,in the current paper microporous nanohybrids of carbon xerogel and multi walled carbon nanotubes cx mwcnts with different loadings of mwcnts 1 2 and 4 g l were synthesized scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem assessed the decoration of microspheres of carbon particles in cx matrix with bundles of mwcnts nitrogen adsorption at 196 c revealed that the n2 uptake was enhanced when cx was decorated with mwcnts and the specific surface area sbet increased from 192 to 643 m2 g the resulting hybrids are mainly microporous materials rising the amount of mwcnts from 1 to 4 g l led to a decrease in the sbet from 643 to 515 m2 g i e decreased approximately 20 fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and boehm s titration showed that both acidic and basic oxygen functional groups were equally distributed while carboxylic groups were increased considerably by increasing the amount of mwcnts the efficiency of adsorption and catalytic oxidation properties of cx mwcnts nanohybrids towards removal of rhodamine b rb was examined adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed using five different adsorption isotherms i e langmuir freundlich flory huggins halsey and elovich models the equilibrium adsorption results proved that adsorption of rb dye onto these nanohybrids can be well fitted using langmuir and halsey isotherms these nanohybrids exhibited considerable adsorption capacities that varied from 154 to 256 mg g the catalytic performance indicated that the investigated nanohybrids could eventually be used for the removal of rb dye in presence of h2o2 and visible light within 60 min affirming that the cx mwcnts obtained are effective materials in liquid phase applications for treating dye contaminated industrial wastewater keywords microporous nanohybrids carbon xerogels multi walled carbon nanotubes porosity adsorption catalytic oxidation 1 introduction synthesis of organic gels and their carbon gels i e xerogels aerogels and cryogels by sol gel polycondensation was first reported by pekala 1 these materials are classified as one class of nanostructure carbon materials 2 due to their fascinating properties such as low mass density high surface area continuous porosities three dimensional network interconnected nodules and high conductivity they are also recognized as unique materials for high temperature thermal insulation 3 and capacitive deionization systems 4 furthermore such materials contain a hierarchical structure of pores formed during two stages of their synthesis the first stage associated by the formation of mesoporous structure during sol gel process as a result of phase separation while microporous structure is created as a result of carbonization in the second step furthermore the possibility of easy alteration in their textural and structural properties towards particular applications declares their use as adsorbents catalyst supports and electrode materials for supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries 5 14 in order to expand the potential applications of these unique materials some additives such as metals and carbon nanotubes cnts can be incorporated into the carbon gels matrix 15 in recent years cnts are emerged as one of the best additives in the design of carbon carbon nanohybrids due to their intrinsic properties such as electrical conductivities as high as 106 sm 1 16 thermal conductivities as high as 3000 wm 1 k 1 17 and elastic moduli on the order of 1 tpa and being extremely flexible 18 also the large surface to volume ratio of cnts 100 1000 making low addition of cnts less than 1 vol can produce a composite with novel properties 19 particularly worsley et al 20 synthesized a monolithic of double walled carbon nanotubes dwcnts carbon aerogels nanocomposites during sol gel polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant stabilized dispersion of dwcnts 20 in a further investigation they studied properties of single walled carbon nanotubes based carbon aerogels as a function of nanotube loading 0 55 wt 21 earlier research by haghgoo et al 22 documented the preparation of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts dispersed in resorcinol formaldehyde rf aerogel using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and studied the dispersion effect of mwcnts on the final properties of rf matrix also haghgoo and coworkers 23 studied the correlation between morphology and electrical conductivity of dried and carbonized multi walled carbon nanotube resorcinol formaldehyde xerogel composites where the maximum surface area of the mwcnts carbon xerogels cxs reached to 685 m2 g fathy et al 24 synthesized carbon nanotube carbon xerogel hybrid cnt cx during chemical vapor decomposition of camphor in presence of rf xerogel loaded with nickel catalyst results showed that this hybrid exhibited a specific surface area of 95 m2 g and a maximum capacitance of 50 f g however the chemical activation of this hybrid with phosphoric acid led to an enhancement in both the specific surface area and electrochemical capacitance reaching to 215 m2 g and 151 f g respectively therefore incorporating of cnts into the carbon gels matrix through sol gel step can produce valuable nanohybrids accompanying with an improvement in their chemical electrical thermal and mechanical properties on the basis of these promising findings the nanohybrids consisting of carbon xerogel and carbon nanotubes cx cnts were used effectively as electrodes in an energy storage application 24 26 these studies indicated that good dispersion of cnts through preparation of organic gels could enhance the capacitance performance of cx cnts electrodes rather than the individual component alone cx or cnts the most likely explanation of this finding is due to the presence of mesopores through cnts bundles and the micropores developed on the cx surface that could serve as active sites for fast electrolyte ions transfer which strengthened the electrochemical performance of electric double layer capacitors edlcs accordingly to the author s knowledge the use of cx cnts nanohybrids in liquid phase adsorption and catalysis processes has not yet been published recently few studies were carried out to prepare low cost cnts using agricultural wastes 27 28 in this study synthesized multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts from chemical vapor deposition of both rice straw as natural substrate and camphor as carbonaceous gas source 27 were successfully used as additives with carbon xerogel in sum the aim of this paper was to investigate the adsorptive and catalytic oxidation behaviors of carbon xerogels and mwcnts microporous nanohybrids towards removal of rhodamine b dye rb to find the optimum conditions different concentrations of mwcnts that well dispersed in sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant were performed during sol gel of resorcinol formaldehyde reactants to evaluate their effect on the adsorption and catalytic properties of obtained nanohybrids further investigation using sem tem n2 adsorption and ftir was also carried out rhodamine b rb dye is a synthetic dye and used extensively in textile leather paper and cosmetic industries and its resistance to biological and chemical degradation implies that it is an excellent compound for this study adsorption and catalytic experiments

hydrothermally treated rice straw loading with iron and nickel oxides at 850 c for 30 min prior to preparation of nanohybrids the produced mwcnts were purified with a mixture solution of hno3 h2so4 3 1 v v at 100 c for 4 h followed by washing for several times with distilled water till ph of filtrate becomes 6 then the sample was dried in an air oven at 80 c overnight the outer diameters of mwcnts were between 22 and 66 nm and the specific surface area of mwcnts was about a 35 m2 g 2 3 preparation of carbon xerogels mwcnts nanohybrids a sol gel procedure of resorcinol formaldehyde sodium dodecyl sulfate r f sds was carried out according to the following recipe reactants of r sds and na2co3 as alkaline catalyst c were dissolved in distilled water w and then formaldehyde solution f stabilized by 10 methanol was added into this mixture under vigorous stirring to form the hydrogel the hydrogel was obtained after 30 min at 80 c the molar ratios of the used reactants with respect to resorcinol were calculated as r f 0 5 r c 500 r w 0 027 and r sds 9 36 10 6 the ph of the sol was adjusted to 6 0 by 0 1 m naoh solution the prepared hydrogel was then transferred into a stoppered glass bottle and heated in an air oven at 80 c for 24 h to complete curing and gelling process afterwards the sealed bottle was opened to allow the gel obtained for drying at the same temperature for another 48 h after cooling the obtained xerogel was carbonized as follows the carbonization of xerogel prepared from sol gel of resorcinol formaldehyde sds was carried out at 350 c for 1 h and gradually raised up to 750 c for 2 h under flowing of n2 gas heating rate 10 min finally the carbon xerogel produced was washed thoroughly with hot distilled water for several times filtered dried and denoted as cx in preparation route of cx mwcnts nanohybrids initially three different concentrations of mwcnts 1 2 and 4 g l were dispersed in an aqueous surfactant solution containing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and water with a fixed weight ratio of mwcnts sds 2 3 22 this mixture was thoroughly stirred for 30 min followed by sonication for 1 h to form homogeneous solution a solution of r f and c with the same fixed molar ratios as abovementioned was added to mwcnts sds under stirring and heated at 80 c for 30 min the sol gel mixture was transferred into sealable glass moulds and kept in an air oven at 80 c for 1 day to complete polymerization process brownish black monolithic gels were formed and dried by evaporation at 80 c for 2 days and then exposed to carbonization process a vertical tubular reactor was used to carry out the pyrolysis of dried gel composites at two subsequent temperatures of 350 c for 1 h and 750 c at 2 h under passing n2 gas the resulting samples were denoted as the following cx 1 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively arabic numerals in the notations refer to the concentrations of mwcnts incorporated into cx matrix 2 4 characterization of

micropore volume vo Œ± cm3 g 30 to estimate the pore size distributions n2 gas adsorption data were analyzed using nldft method which allows the quantification of both micro and mesopores 31 the most important surface functional groups of the prepared samples were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir using kbr pellets jasco ft ir 460 plus determination of ph at point of zero charge phpzc was evaluated by mixing 0 05 g of each sample with 25 ml of nacl solution 0 1 m the phinitial was adjusted between 2 and 12 using 0 1 m of either hcl or naoh solution the final ph was measured after 24 h under stirring at room temperature the phpzc value of each sample was determined when the curve Œ¥ph phinitial phfinal vs phinitial crosses the line of x axis phinitial at its origin it is well known that the point of zero charge determines the surface charge of the adsorbent at a given ph and its knowledge informs about the possible electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate species in liquid phase the surface oxygen groups on a carbon material with acidic carboxyl lactone phenol as well as basic properties can be determined by using the boehm method 32 the acidic sites were determined by mixing small quantities 0 05 g of each carbon material with 20 ml of different bases 0 1 m naoh 0 1 m na2co3 and 0 1 m nahco3 in 25 ml beakers the beakers

estimates the ability of adsorbents to adsorb molecules that have the size close to that of iodine molecules 1 nm from the liquid phase about 0 1 g of the sample was charged in 50 ml of 0 1 mol l potassium iodide aqueous solution shaking for 24 h at 25 c the uptaken amount was evaluated by titration of iodine solution against sodium thiosulfate solution 2 5 batch equilibrium experiments

vis spectrophotometer shimadzu pc 2401 at a maximum wavelength of 553 nm the amount of rb adsorbed was calculated based on the following equation 1 q e c o c e v m where qe is the amount of adsorbed dye mg g co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of rb solutions mg l m the amount of adsorbent g and v is the volume of solution l adsorption equilibrium data which express the relationship between mass of adsorbate adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent and liquid phase equilibrium concentration of adsorbate are represented by adsorption isotherms and provide important design data of adsorption system the equilibrium data for the removal of rb were analyzed using the two parameter models such as langmuir 34 freundlich 35 flory huggins 36 halsey 37 and elovich 38 adsorption isotherms the langmuir isotherm 34 applies to localized adsorption of monolayer surface coverage assuming that each adsorbed molecule occupies one adsorption site the mathematical formula is given as 2 c e q e 1 k l q m 1 q m c e where qm is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity mg g and kl is the equilibrium constant which is related to the adsorption energy l mg which quantitatively reflects the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate a plot of ce qe versus ce gives a straight line while q m and kl were determined from the intercept and the slope respectively the essential characteristic of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant called equilibrium parameter 3 r l 1 1 c o k l where kl is the langmuir constant and co is the highest initial dye concentration mg l the value of rl indicates the type of isotherm to be either favorable 0 rl 1 linear rl 1 unfavorable rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the freundlich equation 35 is an empirical model that considers heterogeneous adsorptive energies on the adsorbent surface this equation is characterized by two fitting parameters kf and n and represented by 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf is the freundlich isotherm constant mg g mg l 1 n which is an indicator of the adsorptive capacity of an adsorbent for a solute and n is a measure of the intensity of the adsorption or surface heterogeneity a value closer to zero for 1 n represents a more heterogeneous surface however the freundlich exponent n should have values lying in the range of 1 10 for classification as a preferable adsorption flory huggins isotherm 36 describes the degree of surface coverage characteristics of the adsorbate on the adsorbent the linear form of the flory huggins equation is expressed as 5 ln Œ∏ c o ln k f h n f h ln 1 Œ∏ where Œ∏ is the degree of surface coverage Œ∏ 1 ce co nfh is the number of adsorbates occupying adsorption sites and kfh is flory huggins equilibrium constant l g this model can also express the feasibility and spontaneous nature of an adsorption process the equilibrium constant kfh is used to calculate the spontaneity free gibbs energy by using the following equation 6 Œ¥ g o r t ln k f h where Œ¥go is standard free energy change r is universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is absolute temperature the halsey isotherm 37 is used to evaluate multilayer adsorption at a relatively large distance from the surface and the fitting of the experimental data to this equation attest to the heterogeneous surface nature of the adsorbent the adsorption isotherm can be given as follows 7 ln q e 1 n h ln k h 1 n h ln c e where kh and nh are halsey isotherm constants and they can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln qe versus ln ce elovich isotherm equation 38 is based on a kinetic principle which assumes that adsorption sites increase exponentially with adsorption leading to a multilayer adsorption the linear form of the elovich model is expressed as follows 8 ln q e c e ln k e q m q e q m two parameters called elovich maximum adsorption capacity qm mg g and elovich constant ke l mg can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ln qe ce versus qe 2 6 catalytic oxidation experiments using h2o2 visible light the catalytic oxidation performance of each sample was tested toward degradation of a cationic dye rhodamine b rb as a model organic compound under dark and h2o2 visible light source prior to visible irradiation the carbon sample and rb dye solution mixture was magnetically stirred in the darkness for 20 min at room temperature 25 c in order to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium and to ensure that the removal of dye was acted by catalytic oxidation only the catalytic oxidation experiments were performed by adding 100 mg samples in 50 ml of rb dye solution with initial concentration of 50 mg l and initial ph 6 then 0 139 mol l of h2o2 1 ml was added and the visible light was irradiated using house hold fluorescent lamp of 44watt philips this lamp irradiates outside at a distance of 10 cm from the surface of dye solution the temperature of the solution was maintained constant throughout the reaction then 1 ml of an aliquot solution of the dye was withdrawn at regular interval times after dilution into 10 ml the dye solution was separated from carbon solid by filtration using whatman filter paper no 41 the remaining concentration of rb dye in the supernatant solution was estimated using the spectrophotometer at its Œªmax value in order to assess the reproducibility and error of adsorption and photodegradation tests the absorbance of dye was carried out in triplicate measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and texture characteristics in order to identify the microstructure of the pristine carbon xerogel cx and their nanohybrids with mwcnts prepared via chemical vapor deposition of camphor in presence of rice straw loaded nickel and iron scanning electron microscopy sem was used sem photographs of cx and cx 4 mwcnt highest volume of mwcnts in samples are shown in fig 1 as illustrated in fig 1a the network structure of the cx sample consists of interconnected spheres of primary carbon particles as a result of sol gel reaction formulation 1 an inset picture in fig 1a outlines that the surface of pristine carbon xerogels is composed of carbon spheres with irregular diameter size ranging from 5 to 28 nm also tem images in fig 1c and d illustrates the formation of carbon nodules in the pristine cx sample and their average sized varied approximately from 8 to 22 nm as well it indicated that mwcnts can be existed through interconnected nodules i e carbon spheres along network of cx as shown in fig 1c the outer diameters of mwcnts was measured and ranged from 20 to 30 nm in addition both sem and tem micrographs of cx 1 mwcnts nanohybrids depicts that large volume of mwcnts located at the surface of cx could be connected to the internal pores in cx upon increasing the amount of mwcnts to 4 g l led to aggregation of mwcnts bundles with forming orthogonal bundles like plane shape on the cx surface as depicted in fig 1d therefore the highest volume of mwcnts caused a remarkable decrease in the internal porosity while generated a lot of micropores in cx 4 mwcnts as seen in fig 2 a and table 1 to identify the presence of impurities like metal catalysts in the investigated samples the obtained mwcnts and cx 1 mwcnts samples were analyzed using edax as follows in fig 2 no metal catalysts in both samples were detected it can be seen that two samples consist mainly of c and o atoms nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms using the prepared samples are shown in fig 3 a eventually the incorporation of mwcnts into the matrix of cx contributed significantly in the evolution of porosity the resulting samples show a steep increase in the uptake of n2 at relative pressures lower than 0 01 in the following order cx cx 4 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts cx 1 mwcnts confirming the filling of both narrow micropores ultra micropores 0 7 nm and wide micropores super micropores 0 7 nm the adsorption of nitrogen on the cx sample is the lowest as compared to the other cx mwcnts composites according to iupac classification 29 adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 using cx shows combination of both type i and ii confirming that the adsorption of nitrogen occurs on micropores and non micropores this isotherm is typical for non porous or meso macroporous adsorbents in other composites except cx 4 mwcnts the isotherm established using cx 1 mwcnts and cx 2 mwcnts samples belong to combination type of i and iv with different extent of mesopores which is an indicative to the preparation of micro mesoporous solids while raising the concentration of mwcnts to 4 g l the adsorption desorption of nitrogen isotherm showed typically type i isotherm which is really corresponded to microporous solids with narrow and uniformity micropores 0 7 nm fig 3b shows the corresponding pore size distributions psds in the obtained samples using nldft model these plots show gradual increase in the pore volumes and their corresponding pore width with the incorporation of mwcnts into cx network structure however cx cx 1 mwcnts and cx 2 mwcnts samples exhibited broad pore size distributions even though the narrowing of hysteresis loop for these carbons may be reasoned by the fact that it mainly consists mesopores with size of 2 nm and closed at one end furthermore the pore widths varied from 0 5 to 3 5 nm 0 5 4 2 0 5 4 2 nm and from 0 to 2 5 nm in cx cx 1 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively the main heights of these peaks are centered at 1 99 2 15 2 15 and 0 73 nm in cx cx 1 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively the data concerning the textural properties of the prepared samples are presented in table 1 as a function of the mwcnts concentration in the matrix of cx the prepared nanohybrids were found to have larger total surface areas sbet than that of the pristine cx sample thus the incorporation of mwcnts during sol gel process of resorcinol formaldehyde followed by carbonization promotes well developed porosity the total surface area calculated from bet model increased from 192 to 643 m2 g the total pore volume increased from 0 149 to 0 545 cm3 g and the pore diameter increased slightly from 31 to 37 √• and then decreased to 18 √• for cx 4 mwcnts additionally the porous characteristics calculated from the Œ±s plot such as the total surface area st Œ± m2 g the non microporous surface area sn Œ± m2 g and the micropore volume vo Œ± cm3 g revealed that the addition of mwcnts with different concentrations increased the development of microporosity at the expense of mesopores on the other hand the cx 4 mwcnts sample showed the higher microporosity than other hybrids following by a decrease in the total surface area this result is probably attributed to the aggregation of mwcnts on the surface of cx as confirmed from tem previously the total surface area was decreased approximately about 4 and 8 for cx 2 mwcnts and cx 4 mwcnts respectively according it can be concluded that the addition of cnts into the sol of resorcinol formaldehyde before gelling process could be modified easily the porous structure of cx 3 2 surface group features qualitative and quantitative measurements of the functional surface groups derived on the surface of cx and their composites with mwcnts were estimated using ftir and boehm s titration respectively as shown in fig 4 a and b in addition the kind of charges on the developed materials was determined by measuring the ph at point of zero charge as listed in table 2 the amount of iodine uptake mg g which is considered as an indicative parameter for the presence of micropores was calculated and presented also in table 2 however the decrease in iodine number is matched parallel with the decrease in the total surface area which is contrary to increase in micropores with increasing amount of mwcnts this result may be attributed to the creation of narrower micropores 0 73 nm cf table 1 which are not accessible to adsorb iodine particles compacting bundles of mwcnts on cx surface in case of loading high amount of mwcnt led to formation of such micropores with decreasing in the total surface area the major characteristics of absorption bands in ftir spectra of cx and cx 1 mwcnts are illustrated in fig 4a it can be seen that both samples show identical absorption bands with a slight shift in the intensity of bands addition of mwcnts increased the intensity of some bands at 1422 1084 and 470 cm 1 39 40 these bands are assigned to cc stretching vibration in aromatic rings co skeletal vibrations in ethers esters hydroxyls and phenol groups and out of plane vibration of ch moieties of aromatic structure confirming the incorporation of mwcnts into cx matrix whereas bands located at 3430 and 1632 cm 1 are shifted to a lower absorbance the former one is ascribed to oh stretching in adsorbed water or phenol molecules where the latter band is assigned to cc stretching in the backbone of cnts moreover the appearance of sharp bands at 470 cm 1 in the ftir of cx 1 mwcnts is related to ch out of plane bending vibrations in the aromatic ring this corroborates the generation of some oxygenated functional groups on the surface of cx 1 mwcnts that is introduced throughout the carbonization process two shoulder bands were observed at 2921 and 2855 cm 1 which are characteristic for ch asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations in ch2 ch3 groups on cx and cx 1 mwcnts boehm s titration was used to account for the amount of oxygenated functional groups mmol g formed on the surface of cx and their composites with mwcnts fig 4b elucidates that the surface of prepared samples consists of both acidic and basic oxygen functional groups it is noteworthy that the presence of mwcnts increased the amount of basic groups from 29 to 36 mmol g while the content of acidic groups from 31 to 34 mmol g c f table 2 this result confirms that the mwcnts have surface oxygen groups functionalized the cx surface the surface of these carbon materials seems to be neutral in nature since their phs at point of zero charge phpzc lies between 7 1 and 6 8 except for the cx 4 mwcnts that exhibits slightly acidic ph 6 2 it was noticed also that the carboxylic groups are increased remarkably with increasing the amount of mwcnts as evident also from ftir results 3 3 adsorption isotherm studies adsorption isotherm studies are important to identify the adsorption behavior between the solid and liquid phases at equilibrium state the adsorption isotherms of rb dye onto the samples were investigated at 25 c and ph 6 50 500 mg l of rb dye solutions were conducted with 0 05 g of sample the equilibrium data for the removal of rb dye in the present investigation were analyzed using five adsorption isotherms such as langmuir freundlich flory huggins halsey and elovich analysis of isotherm data and fitting it to the different isotherm models by comparing the correlation coefficients r2 is a vital step to propose the suitable model which can be used according to the values of r2 deduced from application of isotherms the adsorption of rb dye onto samples can be described in the following order langmuir halsey freundlich flory huggins elovich the shape of isotherms is depicted in fig 5 and is important to diagnose the nature of adsorption giles et al 41 have classified the isotherm s shape of adsorption into four main groups l s h and c according to this classification the isotherms of rb dye onto all samples displayed an l type such type means that there is no strong competition between solvent i e h2o and adsorbate molecules rb dye to occupy the adsorbent surface sites in this case the longitudinal axes of the adsorbed molecules are parallel to the adsorbent surface 42 the corresponding parameters calculated from the five isotherms are summarized also in table 3 inspection of table 3 reveals that the highest values of correlation coefficients r2 0 953 0 998 were obtained from langmuir and halsey isotherm models this confirms the occurrence of monolayer and multilayer adsorption of rb dye with different extent on the surface of the prepared samples due to the presence of various active sites regarding the values of adsorption capacity q0 mg g derived from langmuir isotherm model the adsorption ability of cx increased from 3 to 5 folds after incorporating mwcnts into its network the cx sample decorated with lowest amount of mwcnts cx 1 mwcnts showed the highest adsorption capacity 256 mg g while an excess increase in the amount of mwcnts e g cx 2 mwcnts or cx 4 mwcnts decreased the capacity from 256 to 154 mg g this trend in adsorption capacity is in good agreement with the previously mentioned results concerning the decrease in both surface area and total pore volume upon loading amount of mwcnts more than 1 g l as indicated in table 1 nevertheless this sample is considered as the most suitable adsorbent material for adsorbing rb dye from wastewater however freundlich model exhibited relatively lower correlation coefficients r2 0 921 0 946 the values of the freundlich adsorption intensity n ranges from 2 22 to 2 43 indicating that rb dye adsorption is favorably adsorbed on all prepared samples i e cx and cx mwcnts nanohybrids values of r2 0 783 0 919 computed from flory huggins and elovich isotherms are much lower than other models meaning that both models are not valid to describe the rb adsorption onto the surface of samples the calculated values of Œ¥g0 from eq 6 are listed in table 3 the negative sign of Œ¥go shows that rhodamine b adsorption is a spontaneous and feasible process the obtained adsorption capacities of cx mwcnts nanohybrids towards rhodamine b rb dye were compared with those of other reported carbon based adsorbents in the literature as listed in table 4 results of adsorption capacities appeared that the cx mwcnts nanohybrids synthesized in this study can yield higher adsorption capacity towards rb dye than the other reported carbon adsorbents therefore these nanohybrids are considered to be efficient adsorbents in remediation of dye contaminated industrial wastewater 3 4 catalytic oxidation performance demonstration of catalytic oxidation performance of cx mwcnts as metal catalysts free of known metal oxides such as mno2 fe2o3 cuo tio2 zno etc has received considerable attention as a new approach in the industrial applications in order to minimize the cost of process 10 47 49 fig 6 a displays the removal of rb dye solution onto the best adsorbent cx 1 mwcnts in either dark or visible light h2o2 for sake of comparison the removal of dye was examined also in presence of light h2o2 only in such condition the maximum removal i e degradation of rb dye was found to be 12 at 150 min in dark the adsorption process attained removal of 90 from rb dye molecules at 90 min while almost 100 removal of the rb dye could be achieved during 60 min using 0 139 mol l h2o2 in presence of visible light hence the removal of rb molecules onto cx 1 mwcnts in presence of light h2o2 is faster than in dark therefore the prepared nanohybrids of metal free catalysts can remove rb dye efficiently in presence of h2o2 and visible light to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of the prepared samples as a function of their textural properties catalytic oxidation experiments were performed over all the prepared samples keeping other parameters constant e g ph carbon dose h2o2 dose and temperature results are shown in fig 6b again the nanohybrid of cx 1 mwcnts exhibits superior catalytic oxidation performance than that obtained by other samples toward removal of rb dye when light h2o2 is present from this figure the maximum removal efficiencies were calculated and found to be 78 85 99 and 100 over cx cx 4 mwcnts cx 2 mwcnts and cx 1 mwcnts respectively within 150 min it can be turning out that the synergistic effect between the cx 1 mwcnts and light h2o2 is conducive to the enhancement in removal of rb dye from aqueous solution more rapidly than adsorption process only the reason for the catalytic activity of the cx mwcnts may be interpreted to the outstanding graphitic structure including surface functional surface groups and delocalized œÄ electrons at the basal of graphitic structure it has been previously reported that catalytic behavior of carbon materials depends on their surface properties which may act as active sites for specific catalytic operations 47 48 particularly the basic oxygen groups present on the surface of carbon materials can increase not only the h2o2 degradation rate but also the yield of ho formation the œÄ electrons in the basal planes also contribute to the basicity of the carbon material affecting its adsorption and catalytic properties 47 as well the visible light accelerates the formation rate of hydroxyl radicals ho when h2o2 molecules are adsorbed on the surface of cx mwcnts as expressed in the following equations 49 9 h2o2 hŒΩ 2 ho 10 upon addition of h2o2 h2o2 molecules are readily adsorbed and the catalyzed reaction occurs when exposed directly to visible light on the surface of cx mwcnts in order to form ho radicals these radicals will attack the adsorbed dye molecules on the surface of sample and the remained dye molecules in the aqueous solution in order to decompose them into harmless substances 9 10 49 moreover uv vis adsorption spectra for the dye before and after removing either by adsorption or catalytic oxidation using the best sample cx 1 mwcnts as an example are shown in fig 7 this figure elucidates that the full removal of rb dye using the selected sample was achieved through catalytic oxidation h2o2 visible light as compared with removal of dye by adsorption in dark 4 conclusions in summary nanohybrids of carbon xerogels decorated with different concentrations of mwcnts were synthesized the physico chemical characteristics of resulting samples were investigated using sem tem n2 adsorption and ftir the amount of oxygen functional groups was identified by boehm s titration adsorption capacity and catalytic activity of these samples were studied during removal of rhodamine dye from aqueous solution adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed using five different adsorption isotherms which are langmuir freundlich flory huggins halsey and elovich models it was found that the n2 uptake was enhanced when cx was decorated with mwcnts and the specific surface area sbet increased from 192 to 643 m2 g the resulting hybrids are mainly microporous materials hence the introduction of mwcnts through sol gel process of resorcinol formaldehyde which was prepared from chemical vapor deposition of camphor onto rice straw developed new pores and slight amounts of acidic and basic groups after carbonization equilibrium adsorption results proved that adsorption of rb dye onto the prepared hybrids can be described preferably by langmuir and halsey isotherms the prepared nanohybrids exhibited considerably high adsorption capacity as high as 154 256 mg g prepared nanohybrids of metal free catalysts could remove rb dye completely in presence of h2o2 and visible light at 60 min overall the basic surface oxygen and textural characteristics controlled the removal of rb dye molecules from aqueous solutions onto nanohybrids through either adsorption in dark or catalytic oxidation in presence of h2o2 and light acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports provided by the national

14559,an indigenous bacterium brevibacillus panacihumi c17 was isolated from agrochemical waste effluent kolkata area india the isolate showed an efficient degradation capacity of a toxic fungicide carbendazim cbz 300 mg l 1 frequently used in agricultural field in that area the present research is one of the very few growth dynamics studies showing the substrate utilization rate us 0 91 of the bacterium also the specific growth rate which was observed to be 0 173 h 1 degradation studies revealed the maximum degradation 87 25 was obtained at 100 mg l 1 at incubation time of 36 h ph 7 0 and speed of 180 rpm beyond this the degradation was found to decline the kinetic growth parameter modeling indicated that the process showed best fitting of the experimental data in logistic function r2 0 94 as compared to others analytical studies of sem ftir and xrd revealed the cbz degradation mechanism by bio sorption process occurring on the outer cell surface using adsorption energy it was observed that the bio sorption process followed the dkr isotherm model r2 0 921 strain brevibacillus sp c17 was observed to reduce chemical oxygen demand cod by 85 2 5 of the agrochemical waste effluent cod 880 mg l 1 within 50 h of batch treatment one of the important observations is the toxicity analysis of the real effluent and aqueous solution of cbz after the bacterial treatment which indicated the environmental friendly behavior of the bio treatment keywords brevibacillus sp c17 carbendazim reduction cod reduction utilization rate adsorption isotherm toxicity analysis 1 introduction the intensifying use of fungicides poses widespread disturbances in aquatic as well as terrestrial domains 1 these agrochemicals contaminate surface waters largely due to runoffs improper drainage and chemical leaching causing harmful effects on environment and population 2 untreated agrochemical effluents released from the agricultural fields have become a big concern to the environment globally due to its significant cod chemical oxygen demand bod biological oxygen demand value 3 4 these effluents primarily containing a heavy amount of xenobiotics heavy metals trace metals ions organics is an increasing hazard to aquatic life and ecosystem on the whole the amount of pesticides used in agricultural fields of kolkata india at large is a threat due to their carcinogenic teratogenic as well as mutagenic properties 5 7 carbendazim cbz a representative benzimidazole carbamate complex is a systemic fungicide widely used as a plant protection chemical from chronic fungal diseases like leaf spot brown spot sheath blight etc as they are manufactured to combat the biochemical action of the specific phytopathogenic fungi 8 the basic mode of action of this toxic carbamate complex is to bind to a distinct site on tubulin and block the dynamic microtubule assembly resulting in arrest of cell cycle at the g2 phase and an initiation of apoptosis 9 cbz complex is by far an active constituent in certain commercial agents namely cerezim funaben occidor bavistin and arrest etc often available as white to grey powder or as crystalline composite 10 11 it is also the primary metabolite of certain other systemic fungicides like methyl thiophanate and benomyl 12 it has comprehensively powerful application worldwide with the global manufacturing worth over 300 million at user level which is equivalent to about 13000 tones at active constituent level in india itself about 2000 tons of cbz is manufactured annually and its application has reached over 800 tons per year 13 carbendazim has got a severe environmental impact in fact it takes about 25 months to get decomposed in water bodies 6 7 months on turf soil and about 12 18 months on bare soil equally under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as such it is a stable complex with a long half life 14 as a result in the aquatic environment there is a high risk of long term exposure of such toxic chemical at concentrations up to a high level of 5 5 Œºg l to target or non target organisms cbz moreover is a chief contaminant of runoff water from agro fields and a renowned geno toxicant to natural flora and fauna the existence of such carbamate complexes in lucerne planted soil cause inhibition of beneficial microorganisms a considerable inhibition effect has been reported by pattanasupong et al 15 on soil nitrification ammonification and dehydrogenase activity following the npirsd data 2016 cbz is reported to cause gradual genetic lesions endocrine disruption mutation damaging fertility by passing through the food chain and entering into humans by biomagnifications 16 several research was conducted which confirmed physiological immunological and neurological disorders due to cbz toxicity 17 20 as a result elimination of this toxicant is utmost necessary from environment for the protection of living organisms the conventional chemical technological approaches are found to be intensely rapid and robust including methods like chemical transformation in aqueous solution by uv tio2 ion exchange reverse osmosis photocatalysis evaporation volatilization hydrolysis oxidation respectively 21 are also observed to have large extent of production sludge improper disposal of intermediates along with the requirement of excess amount of energy alternatively the climate dependent strategies like phyto remediation have portability problems 22 the bioremediation or biodegradation strategies have several advantages on comparison with the conventional chemical approaches including complete breakdown of organic toxicants into less non toxic products very less requirement of excessive scientific instruments or chemicals or equipments and therefore minimal expense of production cost per unit volume of water or sediment or soil in comparison with other degradation strategies also such bio based treatment techniques can be performed as an in situ or ex situ scheme depending on the conditions 23 in general the degradation of carbendazim cbz by abiotic chemical and physical methods are reviewed to be time consuming with bacterial metabolism being the chief remediating factor in natural sediment and soil very few cbz degrading bacterial strains have been previously studied very highly potential and ecologically competitive bacterial strains are needed to degrade this complex benzimidazole carbamate range of contaminated environments 24 26 from the literature reviewed certain aerobic microbial strains of nocardioides sp 27 rhodococcus sp 28 bacillus subtilis paracoccus sp flavobacterium and pseudomonas sp are reported to degrade cbz to benzimidazole and 2 aminobenzimidazole via synthetic pathways and utilize them as sole carbon and hydrogen sources their degradation rates however are very minimal hydrolyzing about 83 3 cbz in the initial 32 days 29 the highest rate of cbz degradation observed in aqueous solution was 20 days by epiphytic bacteria 32 and about 17 by neustonic bacteria 30 consequently bioremediation with isolated potent bacterial strains could definitely establish as a cost effective ecologically efficient eco friendly alternative to any other technique so biodegradation has surely developed as a special area of research to scientists worldwide therefore the rationale of the present research is to explore the bioremediation approach to treat the harmful effluent containing toxic fungicide cbz using a new bacterial strain brevibacillus sp c17 capable of removing cbz and reducing bod cod from the effluent one of the important objectives in this study was to determine the best fitted adsorption isotherm for cbz biosorption on the isolated bacterial strain very few original research works have been reported in this regard in whole world in general and in india in particular 31 in the present investigation the biosorptive behavior of cbz on isolated bacterial strain b panacihumi t4 has been described in detail and the results of the study were fitted to different adsorption isotherm models the study also emphasizes the testing of efficiency of the isolate for degrading heavy metals organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides present in the effluent also certain important environmental toxicants like phenol and catechol the authors have also attempted detailed analysis of the cbz degradation mechanism by the prospective isolate the eco toxicological study has also been carried out using a cepa roots and p mungo seeds 32 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and media all the reagents chemicals and microbiological media required in the present study were of analytical grade luria bertani lb broth and agar hi media was used as supplied analytical grade fungicide carbendazim was obtained from sigma aldrich about 1000 mg l 1 stock solution of cbz was prepared sterilized using syringe driven micro filter unit millipore millex gv pvdf 0 22 Œºm and added in the required concentration to media before inoculation m9 mineral salt media ph 7 0 was used as selective media containing 3 0 g l 1 na2hpo4 2 5 g l 1 kh2po4 1 5 g l 1 nh4cl 1 0 g

were obtained either from merck or hi media 2 2 characterization of agrochemical effluent the agrochemical effluent sample was collected from an agricultural area near kolkata west bengal india that has a history of applying carbendazim cbz for crop protection for several years samples were stored at 4 c for the research works standard protocol was followed for the physico chemical characterization of the effluent 33 for assessment of ph sartorius professional meter pb 11 ph meter equipped with glass electrode was used and for salinity testing inolab analyzer probe was used the standard apha method was followed for bod 5 measurement and open reflux method was followed for cod estimation using cod analyzer digester spectroquant tr 320 merck 2 3 screening and acclimatization for carbendazim cbz resistant bacteria the culturable bacterial species present in the agrochemical effluent was isolated using standard serial dilution procedure in luria bertani lb agar plates two bacterial colonies with specific color characters likely cream yellow and golden yellow were obtained after 48 h of incubation at a temperature of 35 c ph 7 0 at 180 rpm both the bacterial colonies obtained were purified as single cell colony in lb agar plates when further screened for resistance to the fungicide cbz only one potential isolate designated as t4 showed well tolerance to about 100 mg l 1 cbz in both m9 minimal salt media and lb agar media this particular cbz tolerant isolate t4 was then acclimatized in increasing concentrations of the toxic fungicide to check its biodegradation potential 2 4 characterization and identification of the isolate the specific selected bacterium was characterized on the source of gram staining colony morphology and biochemical testing using definite established protocols 34 genetic identification using 16s rdna sequencing was performed blast alignment tool was examined using the consensus gene sequences of 16s rdna this was in accordance with the database of ncbi genbank clustal w program was used for multiple alignments and identity score analysis of the first fifteen selected sequences rdp database was used for creating the matrices of distance between the sequences and mega 5 software program was used for generating the phylogenetic tree 2 5 kinetics of bioremediation study of the isolate for agrochemical waste water and cbz the bod 5 and cod reduction of agrochemical effluent and the toxic cbz degradation from the simulated aqueous solution were analyzed using the cbz resistant isolate t4 in separate batch scale studies individually to 100 ml agrochemical effluent and 100 ml m9 mineral salt media both containing different concentrations of the fungicide cbz about 10 inoculum volume of strain t4 was added and kept for acclimatization for different time periods at 37 c ph 7 0 and agitation of 180 rpm in bod incubator shaker scigenics biotech here the fungicide cbz was the sole source of nutrient carbon hydrogen nitrogen and energy for the strain t4 upon reaching equilibrium the inoculum biomass were separated by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 mins superspin r v fm plasto crafts and filtered using whatman 42 to calculate the remaining cod in the supernatant using automated cod analyzer digester spectroquant tr 320 merck the residual cbz concentration in supernatant was then observed by monitoring the change in absorbance value at maximum wavelength Œªmax using uv visible spectrometer lambda 350 uv vis spectrometer perkin elmer the pellet constituting cell biomass was washed and re suspended in pbs the growth kinetics of the selected strain was then measured at an absorbance of 600 nm the different process parameter optimization was achieved at a fixed cbz concentration with different experimental conditions of ph temperature rpm and inoculum age and biomass weight also the various kinetic order models were experimented to define the biodegradation of cbz in m9 media along with substrate inhibitory models for fitting the data 35 the results were analyzed as the degrading efficiency d of cbz by the potential isolate or the cbz consumption which was examined using the following equation 1 d 100 a 0 a f a 0 where a0 is the initial concentration of cbz mg l 1 af is the concentration of cbz after degradation mg l 1 2 6 physiological and cellular interaction of the isolate growing on cbz for the scanning electron microscopic sem evo ls 15 zeiss germany study monoculture of isolate t4 grown in the presence and absence of the fungicide cbz was collected by centrifugation superspin r v fm plasto crafts the cell pellet was suspended in phosphate buffer fixed with 1 5 glutaraldehyde kept in a refrigerator 4 c for 2 h and washed again with phosphate buffer the samples were then dehydrated with different concentrations of ethanol for 15 min the cells were coated in gold on an electron microscope stub for sem study for assessing the involvement of functional groups associated with the cell surface of isolate t4 monoculture of the isolate in the presence and absence of the fungicide cbz was collected by centrifugation superspin r v fm plasto crafts at 5000 g for 15 mins at 4 c following the standard protocol the cell pellet was dried at 40 c kept with potassium bromide kbr and examined by ftir spectroscopy iraffinity 1 ftir shimadzu 36 to investigate phase identification of the isolate t4 x ray diffraction analysis xrd bruker d 8 advance diffractometer usa was carried out 37 the monoculture of the isolate in the presence and absence of the fungicide cbz was collected by centrifugation superspin r v fm plasto crafts at 5000 g for 15 mins at 4 c following the standard protocol the cellular pellet was suspended in lyophilization buffer the samples were then vacuum freeze at 20 c and prepared in freeze dried powder form using freeze dryer lyodel freeze dryer lyo1855 2 7 geno toxicity and phyto toxicity analysis standard growth inhibition and mitotic index assay with allium cepa root cells along with phyto toxicity analysis with phaseolus mungo seeds were performed separately with certain modifications 32 this was done for observing the safety and efficacy of the bio treatment of cbz solution and agrochemical waste effluent using the isolate t4 and its un inoculated control the bulb of onion was thoroughly washed with ultrapure reagent grade water and kept for growth in dark for 24 h the growing bulbs were acclimatized with bacterial treated and untreated agrochemical effluent and cbz solutions for 24 h in a plant growth incubator maintained at 28 c the variations in root length of onion were examined after 24 h for the chromosome aberration study the conventional fuelgen squash process was carried out 38 the mitotic index mi and chromosome aberration study were determined in about 100 telophase cells per onion root related to about 500 cells per testing conditions separately for phyto toxicity study phaseolus mungo seeds were sterilized with ethanol 70 and sodium hypochlorite 1 5 followed by exposure with bacterial treated and untreated agrochemical effluent and cbz solutions for 24 h in a plant growth incubator maintained at 28 c the variations in germination length of radical cm and shoot length cm were calculated after 7 days of exposure 32 3 results and analysis 3 1 characterization of agrochemical effluent the physico chemical characteristics of the raw agrochemical effluent was tested and summarized in table 1 the results indicated that bod cod heavy metal pesticides was significant with respect to the acceptable level by regulatory authorities the run off water from the agricultural field experimental sample gets mixed with the bagjhola lake water east kolkata area india and due to its high percentage of pollutants contaminate the entire lake whose water is often used for irrigation domestic utility and small fish cultivation these toxicants cause an all around pollution to the water ecosystem the characterization results clearly indicate the need for right treatment before its release in the lake waters the trends of heavy metals present in the agrochemical effluent according to average concentration during the dry and wet seasons was as cu co ni mn fe pb cd ba zn hg and as fe zn mn pb cu co cd ba ni hg respectively because of seasonal rainfall dilution and other run off during the wet season heavy metals from the upper layer of soil were flushed out to a great extent into the wetland waters from where the sample have been collected and hence all the values were higher in the wet season compared to that of the dry season accordingly the concentration of heavy metals that was obtained from the waste agrochemical effluent was observed to be 0 08 mg l 1 as 0 078 mg l 1 cu 0 0763 mg l 1 co 0 076 mg l 1 ni 0 0759 mg l 1 mn 0 0753 mg l 1 fe 0 0721 mg l 1 pb 0 0687 mg l 1 cd 0 0654 mg l 1 ba 0 0622 mg l 1 zn 0 0383 mg l 1 hg there are several trace metals which were detected usually less than a few mg l 1 in agrochemical effluent sample including 0 0008 mg l 1 berillium be 0 000765 mg l 1molybdenum mo 0 000735 mg l 1manganese mn 0 000605 mg l 1 0 000510 mg l 1 selenium se 0 000482 mg l 1 titanium ti 0 000319 mg l 1 tungsten w and 0 000110 mg l 1 vanadium v respectively aas atomic adsorption spectrophotometer spectra a analyst 200 perkin elmer usa was used to quantify the metal ions in experimental reaction mixtures since the present research is focused on the batch scale degradation study of carbendazim fungicide therefore detail biodegradation study of heavy metals using the isolated strain has not been shown here 3 2 effect of acclimatization and characterization of cbz resistant isolate carbendazim is a typical carbamate fungicide fig 1 that attaches with the haeme portion of fungal cytochrome p450 39 inhibiting their synthesis of ergosterol and demethylase activity thereby blocking the synthesis of fungal cell wall chitin 40 the recent research related to cbz is primarily focused on its activity to various bacterial strains it is by far having rigid broad spectrum bactericidal properties and as a fungicide it has a polluting effect on the environment that cannot be put aside therefore our aim was to isolate a potential cbz resistant strain which could also help in environmental management among the isolated strains from the agro effluent only one bacterium t4 was observed to be efficient and resistant to cbz when screened on m9 agar plates with various concentrations of cbz 50 500 mg l 1 from the colonies observed in m9 plates they were raised round entire glistening smooth pale yellow in color and about 5 6 mm in diameter they were observed to be gram positive rod shaped bacteria the isolate can produce greenish yellow color pigment in m9 agar media with cbz as constituent within 72 h of incubation the strain t4 is mesophillic growing best in temperature between 30 c 40 c at a ph range of 7 7 5 and can tolerate about 20 25 nacl solution which makes it evidently halophilic on the biochemical point of view strain t4 was observed to be positive for tests of citrate methyl red catalase and urease production and showed negative results for coagulase and oxidase table 2 the phylogenetic tree analysis of the 16s rdna consensus gene sequence 1452 bp for the strain t4 was performed fig 2 it suggested that it was a member of the genus brevibacillus showing 99 close homology with brevibacillus panacihumi about 1 5 kb 16s rdna gene fragment was amplified from the total dna of the isolated strain and sequenced the evolutionary history and the distance matrix were computed using the neighbor joining method and kimura 2 parameter method respectively evolutionary studies were conducted in mega5 software 3 3 growth rate profile of strain t4 in different concentration of cbz at an initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 acclimatized cells of strain t4 at 1 0 o d a600 was capable of removing cbz within 36 h and tolerating agrochemical effluent at 37 c ph 7 0 and 180 rpm with a growth yield and percent degradation of 0 72 0 05 g of bacterial cells g 1 and 86 respectively at higher concentration of the fungicide cbz 100 500 mg l 1 the isolate also gave promising result fig 3 a plots showing time course growth curve using t4 cells in m9 media indicated minimum period of lag phase during growth exponential phase were found in the range of 18 28 h and up to 40 h fig 3b for growth in real sample of agrochemical effluent the exponential period ranges between 20 and 26 h up to 32 h the biomass was observed to increase from 1 0 o d to 2 89 o d units for all the studies the abiotic loss of substrate cbz in the controlled untreated samples was in the range of 0 12 the results showed that strain t4 was both cbz and also ocp and opp resistant it was able to grow in agrochemical effluent and cbz containing simulated m9 media 3 4 effect of bioremediation parameters of cbz and cod reduction using strain t4 it has been observed that cells growing exponentially are metabolically very active therefore age of inoculums used for any parameter study is an important factor determining rate and percent degradation process 41 the percent degradation of cbz with the culture age of 12 18 24 32 48 and 72 h was estimated to be 82 16 88 94 84 22 71 57 63 82 and 57 41 respectively fig 4 a accordingly it was found that strain t4 worked best in 18 24 h age with a low lag phase period and rapid exponential period moreover the tolerance of raw effluent was observed up to 32 h using the exponential culture age of 18 24 h it was observed that with the increase in biomass weight of the inoculums culture even at a high concentration of 100 mg l 1 of cbz there is an increase in the percentage degradation of the substrate fig 4b it is evident that acclimatized cells of strain t4 at 1 0 o d 2 1 mg dry wt l 1 showed the highest degradation percentage of 86 82 the increase in weight or amount of inoculums 2 6 mg dry wt l 1 did not enhance the degradation percent nor the tolerance to the native effluent this is possibly due to reaching the substrate toxicity level for strain t4 the optimum ph was detected to be 7 0 when the maximum cbz degradation obtained at 87 12 fig 4c this observation indicated that ph of the raw effluent sample must be adjusted to 7 0 for obtaining maximum degradation efficiency of t4 similarly the optimum temperature was detected to be 35 c when the maximum cbz degradation obtained at 86 74 fig 4d it has been reported that for degradation of various organic or inorganic toxicants the optimum temperature range of most microorganisms is between 35 c 40 c 41 in this study it was found that with increase in temperature from 35 c the degradation efficiency of t4 reduces with probable reasons of denaturation of protein deactivation of amino acids and lipids present on the surface of the cell below 35 c clearly the barrier activation energy cannot be crossed also with varying agitation speed strain t4 showed variations in percent cbz and raw effluent tolerance the optimum cbz degradation of 87 30 was detected at a speed of 180 rpm fig 4e the presence of organics in agrochemical effluent increases the bod 5 whereas the presence of chemicals in agriculture namely pesticides including toxic fungicide heavy metals ions increases the cod to a significant extent the gradual and safe degradation of such harmful fungicide like carbendazim cbz will eventually lower the cod level in solution with reduction of pollution in water for the cod reduction analysis utilizing the monoculture of the strain t4 experimental values of cod reduction in percentage is plotted against time taken h fig 4f it was seen that the initial value of cod for raw agrochemical effluent was 880 mg l 1 the strain t4 have been capable of reducing the cod value to almost about 40 23 of the initial value this analysis clearly depicts that the degradation of cbz has been competently performed by indigenously isolated t4 it can be inferred that the strain t4 can not only degrade the toxic cbz in simulated aqueous m9 media but is also able to tolerate the real agrochemical waste effluent containing different toxicants and hazardous substances apart from specific fungicide cbz table 3 lists the comparative study of strain t4 with that of reported strains on cbz degradation and cod reduction from the agrochemical effluent 3 5 kinetic modeling and parameter assessment for strain t4 in the presence of cbz in the present research for different initial concentration of cbz the specific growth rate of strain t4 is taken as Œº and the substrate utilization rate is taken as us fig 5 it was observed that initially Œº showed an increasing trend with the increase in cbz concentration up to a specific level and then followed a decreasing trend with the increase in cbz concentration strain t4 when grown in cbz simulated aqueous m9 media the highest tested specific growth rate Œº was 0 173 h 1 at 200 mg l 1 the decreasing curve of Œº beyond this specific concentration determined the substrate toxicity process due to the paucity of research literature comparison studies could not be listed although the data s affirm with those studied previously for various other inhibitory substances by different microorganisms 47 50 thus far only certain information is available regarding specific growth rate Œº while very limited data actually exists about substrate utilization rate us as a result utilization rates of substrate us was estimated and plotted against the initial concentration of cbz in this case the initial rate of substrate utilization showed an increasing trend with the concentration of cbz reaching a highest level and then showed a decreasing trend due to substrate toxicity accumulation the maximum rate of utilization and specific growth rate were calculated at 200 mg l 1 these data are pertinent because the primary aim of this study is to treat the toxic agrochemical effluent and degrade the toxic substrate cbz the data showing kinetic constants for utilization of cbz using three kinetic growth models are summarized in table 4 on assessing the goodness of fit tests the logistic growth model evidently showed a much better fit to a significant level of accuracy than others with the correlation coefficient r 2 for Œº is 0 94 and for us is 0 91 3 6 effect of cellular and physiological response of strain t4 with cbz the sem evo ls 15 zeiss germany images of strain t4 grown in the presence and absence of fungicide cbz were shown in fig 6 from the figure it was observed that in the absence of cbz the isolate revealed smooth uniform cellular surface with a definite rod shaped structure while in the presence of cbz the bacteria showed uneven rough cellular surface with slightly shrink and deform cellular structure moreover definite geometrically shaped crystal structures adsorbed over the cell surface of strain t4 were also detected in the sem images these crystals are the possible biodegraded intermediates of complex cbz compound by strain t4 which were further tested and confirmed using ftir and xrd analytical studies the cell wall also appeared rough and deformed which was possibly due to toxic chemical stress as reported with bacteria e cloacae for chromium metal 51 for studying the involvement of functional groups in the bio adsorption of cbz on the cell surface of the isolate strain t4 ftir iraffinity 1 ftir shimadzu analysis was performed the ftir spectra of strain t4 grown in m9 mineral media in the presence and absence of 100 mg l 1 simulated cbz solution was investigated in the range of 500 4000 wavenumber cm 1 from the figure fig 7 it is clearly seen that the strain t4 biomass spectra revealed a number of different absorption peaks depicting the complex biomass feature considerable shifts in the ftir spectra were observed with 3427 85 cm 1 1633 41 cm 1 1407 78 cm 1 and 1119 48 cm 1 in the absence of cbz fig 7b while in the presence of 100 mg l 1 cbz solution the peaks were detected at 3308 57 cm 1 1621 3 cm 1 1306 82 cm 1 and 1078 98 cm 1 respectively the shifting of peaks suggests cbz complex hydrocarbon binding mechanism occurred on the cell surface of strain t4 with the involvement of certain functional groups like amide groups hydroxyl groups oh amines primary and secondary amino group and sulfur groups the changes in the spectral peaks can also be due to adsorption of biodegraded cbz metabolites on the surface of the cell observed changes could be due to biomass oxidation during cbz biosorption process 52 for studying the geometrical pattern crystal structures aggregated on the cell surface of strain t4 x ray diffraction xrd bruker d 8 advance diffractometer usa analysis was performed the xrd of freeze dried form of strain t4 grown in m9 mineral media in the presence and absence of 100 mg l 1 simulated cbz solution was investigated at 50 kv voltage and 50 ma current and calibrated with 0 16312 nm radiation Œª Œ± a standard silicon sample using ni filtered cu k at a rate of 4 per minute using 2Œ∏ value range of 0 80 from the figure fig 8 the longest peak was observed at 2Œ∏ value of 32 4215 which showed an intensity count of 2162 a u the second longest peak was observed at 2Œ∏ value of 46 5127 showed an intensity count of 1658 a u two fairly smaller peaks were observed at 2Œ∏ values of 57 1138 and 76 4828 with respective intensity counts of 509 and 326 a u which denoted the formation of the secondary intermediate the bioremediation batch scale study of cbz degradation and analysis of sem ftir and xrd support that strain t4 has the efficiency to remove cbz in an extensive manner and the possible process could be bio adsorption such bio adsorption mechanisms are commercially and industrially very acceptable due to the fact of safe and proper detoxification of toxic chemicals from waste effluent also degradation and reusability of resourceful chemicals which can be used for certain purposes hence this potential strain t4 can be industrially utilized for hazardous chemical detoxification 3 7 modeling of the adsorption isotherm on cbz degradation by strain t4 monoculture a rising focus has been made on the application of biosorption technique for their effectiveness in the elimination of contaminants from aqueous solutions 53 a vast category of less expensive materials including agro and industrial waste products have been employed to eliminate agrochemicals from aqueous solution for their proper disposal into the environment it has been reported that hydrocarbon toxicants can be reduced to less hazardous oxidation states or can be eliminated by adsorption or accumulation process 30 as a result significant contributions have been made in utilizing plenty of agro based solid waste material including coffee and tea wastes pinus bark wool fibres rice husks hazelnut straws corncobs banana and orange peels apple wastes peanut hull mango integuments papaya wood maize leaf grape stalk wastes sugarcane bagasse and modified substances including sunflower stalk cotton sugar beet pulp etc 54 57 in order to compare the various sorbent materials an important parameter to consider is expense although information on the commercial expense is seldom mentioned in research reports also the cost of individual adsorbents differs according to the processing requirement and easy availability here the images of sem and analysis of ftir and xrd techniques substantially indicated that degradation of cbz in simulated aqueous solution is by bio sorption process occurring on the external cell surface of strain t4 for investigating the adsorption isotherm three standard models have been chosen for the study the qualitative equations for the three adsorption models are given as follows langmuir model 2 e c q e 1 q m r l e c q m where qm mg g is the maximum amount of cbz adsorbed forming a complete distinct aggregate on the cell surface ec is the maximum concentration mg l 1 and rl 1 mg is the langmuir constant showing the adsorption energy freundlich model 3 log q e log c f 1 n l o g e c where cf mg g is the freundlich constant showing bonding energy n is the heterogeneity exponent representing the intensity of adsorption process for indicating a favorable affinity of bacterial biomass with the substrate value of n should be greater than 1 dubinin kaganer radushkevich dkr model 4 log q e log s m a Œµ 2 where sm mg g is the highest capacity of substrate adsorption a mol2 kj2 is the activity coefficient showing the mean energy of adsorption and Œµ is polanyi potential which can be expressed in the following form 5 Œµ r t ln 1 1 e c the given equation eq 2 if followed by the strain t4 biomass system plot of 1 qe against 1 ec should have a linear fitting trend in order to satisfy the langmuir model similarly if strain t4 biomass system satisfies freundlich model then plot of log qe against log ec should have linear fit also if strain t4 biomass system satisfies dkr models then the plot of log qe against polanyi potential Œµ 2 should have linear fit from the figure fig 9 the experimental values plotted on log qe against log ec did not show a good linear fit therefore freundlich model is not satisfied also the tested values plotted on the reciprocal form of 1 qe against 1 ec did not show a good linear fit however when the tested values plotted on log qe against Œµ 2 it is observed to have a good linear fit with r2 value 0 921 and therefore it followed the dkr model hence from the figure fig 9c it is evident that adsorption isotherm model of cbz on strain t4 followed the dkr model table 5 summarizes the comparison studies of the three isotherm models the suitability of the dkr model in this research indicates the live bacterial monoculture can remove cbz under adsorption energy condition consequently strain t4 mediated cbz degradation appears to be through biosorption mechanism determination of the cbz carbendazim fungicide degradation mechanism through biosorption is a novel approach for this study using an indigenous single bacteria strain t4 which is not yet available in literature 3 8 genotoxicity and phyto toxicity study of strain t4 monoculture in waste effluent treatment process via microbiological route the necessity of an adequate risk assessment is a chief concern since the effluent contains several toxic organic chemicals metals and xenobiotics which can be carcinogenic and pollute the environment the metabolites or intermediates generated as a result of degradation treatment must be examined with regard to the toxicity of the environment in order to investigate the eco friendly and safe disposal of bio treated agrochemical effluent with contaminant cbz 100 mg l 1 cytological and ecological toxicity assays were carried out table 6 compile the results of inhibitions and mi studies with a cepa roots and phyto toxicity study with p mungo seeds compared with the raw effluent and cbz aqueous solution from the study about 2 fold enhancement in length of roots of a cepa was determined using strain t4 treated cbz solution and agrochemical effluent compared to the real samples the variations in mitotic index mi was also determined after the bio treatment of cbz and effluent solution with the increase in the level of cytotoxicity it is known that level of mi decreases 58 59 here this concept has been justified since with hazardous raw agrochemical effluent and cbz solution the cytotoxicity level increased and mi decreased alternatively strain t4 treated cbz solution and agrochemical effluent caused increase in mi enhance root growth thereby proving that the toxic chemical substance and hazardous components have reduced from the effluent and it is without any other noxious by product which might have form during the time driven bio treatment process further the effect of strain t4 biotreated effluent and cbz simulated solution was studied on p mungo seeds to determine the phenotype phytotoxicity result of the intermediates formed after the treatment the changes in percent germination length of radical and shoot cm were observed after 7 days study table 6 it was observed that the germination percent along with the length of shoot and root of p mungo seeds in presence of strain t4 treatment was improved and comparably higher than with the untreated real waste effluent and cbz samples this confirmed the reduced toxicity of the intermediates produced after the adsorption treatment which did not impede the growth and germination of the plant 4 conclusion the present investigation was undertaken to isolate a potential indigenous microbial strain capable of degrading hazardous fungicide carbendazim from synthetic and real agrochemical waste effluent it is identified to be brevibacillus sp strain c17 t4 and exhibited significant efficiency in decreasing cod 880 mg l and bod from the effluent and removing about 300 mg l 1 cbz from simulated media thereby proving microbial treatment to be economically helpful analysis of sem ftir and xrd studies disclosed that strain t4 mediated cbz degradation was by biosorption mechanism the substantial lowering of toxicity of real agrochemical effluent and cbz simulated solution as observed from the geno toxicity and phyto toxicity studies confirm the environmental and industrial usefulness of strain t4 biomass mediated waste treatment considering the environmental impact point of view it is known that the biomass after the end of biodegradation mechanism will contain a certain amount of cbz the bacterial biomass subsequently can be sonicated centrifuged and cells can be ruptured to identify the hydrolase or reductase present inside the cell which can degrade the substrate to further simpler and safer forms thereby establishing an environmental friendly process the future scope of effective bioremediation strategy should have the subsequent steps in connection with the present research though not covered here for the treatment of agrochemical effluent it has been accentuated that the bio based approaches provide an eco sustainable and low cost alternative to physic chemical techniques in several cases the monoculture of bacterial isolate upon introduction to polluted sites often fall short to degrade the toxicants possibly due to their reduced activity in the environment or low resistance or low survival capacity 60 besides bacterial bioremediation is a time consuming process takes week to month to accomplish required remediation and it is unsuitable for treating polluted water due to reduced aeration and nutrient content of the water alternatively the prologue of a bacterial consortium surely has a greater probability of success in bioremediation than that of a monoculture isolate since such a consortium has a greater capability to adapt to these stresses also a bacterial consortium contains both the degraders of selected compounds and also strains that can use the metabolic intermediate products of the selected compounds the harmful intermediate products often become persistent when using a single pure isolate 61 additionally there has been a rising demand in the concept of utilizing formulated enzymes as compared to live strains as effective bioremediation agents in a strategy called enzymatic bioremediation 62 this technique is mainly improvised for water treatment functions where robust and rapid remediation is required and bacterial growth survival and proliferation are not intended therefore the bacterial gene product in charge of such bioremediation ability is cloned and expressed in suitable vector for fast degradation for instance the reported cognate gene mhel responsible for cbz hydrolyzing esterase has been extracted from nocardioles sp strain sg 4g and expressed heterologously in e coli which has indications of higher bioremediation ability 27 moreover the competence of the following protocols could be effectively measured using stirred tank or membrane or column bioreactors with biologically modified monoculture of bacterial isolate or with non modified bacterial consortium for complete and fast biodegradation of toxic agrochemical like carbendazim cbz from both synthetically spiked and real environmentally toxic effluents 63 acknowledgement the author tk received fellowship of upe phase ii scheme of university grants commission india it has been acknowledged accordingly 
14559,an indigenous bacterium brevibacillus panacihumi c17 was isolated from agrochemical waste effluent kolkata area india the isolate showed an efficient degradation capacity of a toxic fungicide carbendazim cbz 300 mg l 1 frequently used in agricultural field in that area the present research is one of the very few growth dynamics studies showing the substrate utilization rate us 0 91 of the bacterium also the specific growth rate which was observed to be 0 173 h 1 degradation studies revealed the maximum degradation 87 25 was obtained at 100 mg l 1 at incubation time of 36 h ph 7 0 and speed of 180 rpm beyond this the degradation was found to decline the kinetic growth parameter modeling indicated that the process showed best fitting of the experimental data in logistic function r2 0 94 as compared to others analytical studies of sem ftir and xrd revealed the cbz degradation mechanism by bio sorption process occurring on the outer cell surface using adsorption energy it was observed that the bio sorption process followed the dkr isotherm model r2 0 921 strain brevibacillus sp c17 was observed to reduce chemical oxygen demand cod by 85 2 5 of the agrochemical waste effluent cod 880 mg l 1 within 50 h of batch treatment one of the important observations is the toxicity analysis of the real effluent and aqueous solution of cbz after the bacterial treatment which indicated the environmental friendly behavior of the bio treatment keywords brevibacillus sp c17 carbendazim reduction cod reduction utilization rate adsorption isotherm toxicity analysis 1 introduction the intensifying use of fungicides poses widespread disturbances in aquatic as well as terrestrial domains 1 these agrochemicals contaminate surface waters largely due to runoffs improper drainage and chemical leaching causing harmful effects on environment and population 2 untreated agrochemical effluents released from the agricultural fields have become a big concern to the environment globally due to its significant cod chemical oxygen demand bod biological oxygen demand value 3 4 these effluents primarily containing a heavy amount of xenobiotics heavy metals trace metals ions organics is an increasing hazard to aquatic life and ecosystem on the whole the amount of pesticides used in agricultural fields of kolkata india at large is a threat due to their carcinogenic teratogenic as well as mutagenic properties 5 7 carbendazim cbz a representative benzimidazole carbamate complex is a systemic fungicide widely used as a plant protection chemical from chronic fungal diseases like leaf spot brown spot sheath blight etc as they are manufactured to combat the biochemical action of the specific phytopathogenic fungi 8 the basic mode of action of this toxic carbamate complex is to bind to a distinct site on tubulin and block the dynamic microtubule assembly resulting in arrest of cell cycle at the g2 phase and an initiation of apoptosis 9 cbz complex is by far an active constituent in certain commercial agents namely cerezim funaben occidor bavistin and arrest etc often available as white to grey powder or as crystalline composite 10 11 it is also the primary metabolite of certain other systemic fungicides like methyl thiophanate and benomyl 12 it has comprehensively powerful application worldwide with the global manufacturing worth over 300 million at user level which is equivalent to about 13000 tones at active constituent level in india itself about 2000 tons of cbz is manufactured annually and its application has reached over 800 tons per year 13 carbendazim has got a severe environmental impact in fact it takes about 25 months to get decomposed in water bodies 6 7 months on turf soil and about 12 18 months on bare soil equally under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as such it is a stable complex with a long half life 14 as a result in the aquatic environment there is a high risk of long term exposure of such toxic chemical at concentrations up to a high level of 5 5 Œºg l to target or non target organisms cbz moreover is a chief contaminant of runoff water from agro fields and a renowned geno toxicant to natural flora and fauna the existence of such carbamate complexes in lucerne planted soil cause inhibition of beneficial microorganisms a considerable inhibition effect has been reported by pattanasupong et al 15 on soil nitrification ammonification and dehydrogenase activity following the npirsd data 2016 cbz is reported to cause gradual genetic lesions endocrine disruption mutation damaging fertility by passing through the food chain and entering into humans by biomagnifications 16 several research was conducted which confirmed physiological immunological and neurological disorders due to cbz toxicity 17 20 as a result elimination of this toxicant is utmost necessary from environment for the protection of living organisms the conventional chemical technological approaches are found to be intensely rapid and robust including methods like chemical transformation in aqueous solution by uv tio2 ion exchange reverse osmosis photocatalysis evaporation volatilization hydrolysis oxidation respectively 21 are also observed to have large extent of production sludge improper disposal of intermediates along with the requirement of excess amount of energy alternatively the climate dependent strategies like phyto remediation have portability problems 22 the bioremediation or biodegradation strategies have several advantages on comparison with the conventional chemical approaches including complete breakdown of organic toxicants into less non toxic products very less requirement of excessive scientific instruments or chemicals or equipments and therefore minimal expense of production cost per unit volume of water or sediment or soil in comparison with other degradation strategies also such bio based treatment techniques can be performed as an in situ or ex situ scheme depending on the conditions 23 in general the degradation of carbendazim cbz by abiotic chemical and physical methods are reviewed to be time consuming with bacterial metabolism being the chief remediating factor in natural sediment and soil very few cbz degrading bacterial strains have been previously studied very highly potential and ecologically competitive bacterial strains are needed to degrade this complex benzimidazole carbamate range of contaminated environments 24 26 from the literature reviewed certain aerobic microbial strains of nocardioides sp 27 rhodococcus sp 28 bacillus subtilis paracoccus sp flavobacterium and pseudomonas sp are reported to degrade cbz to benzimidazole and 2 aminobenzimidazole via synthetic pathways and utilize them as sole carbon and hydrogen sources their degradation rates however are very minimal hydrolyzing about 83 3 cbz in the initial 32 days 29 the highest rate of cbz degradation observed in aqueous solution was 20 days by epiphytic bacteria 32 and about 17 by neustonic bacteria 30 consequently bioremediation with isolated potent bacterial strains could definitely establish as a cost effective ecologically efficient eco friendly alternative to any other technique so biodegradation has surely developed as a special area of research to scientists worldwide therefore the rationale of the present research is to explore the bioremediation approach to treat the harmful effluent containing toxic fungicide cbz using a new bacterial strain brevibacillus sp c17 capable of removing cbz and reducing bod cod from the effluent one of the important objectives in this study was to determine the best fitted adsorption isotherm for cbz biosorption on the isolated bacterial strain very few original research works have been reported in this regard in whole world in general and in india in particular 31 in the present investigation the biosorptive behavior of cbz on isolated bacterial strain b panacihumi t4 has been described in detail and the results of the study were fitted to different adsorption isotherm models the study also emphasizes the testing of efficiency of the isolate for degrading heavy metals organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides present in the effluent also certain important environmental toxicants like phenol and catechol the authors have also attempted detailed analysis of the cbz degradation mechanism by the prospective isolate the eco toxicological study has also been carried out using a cepa roots and p mungo seeds 32 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and media all the reagents chemicals and microbiological media required in the present study were of analytical grade luria bertani lb broth and agar hi media was used as supplied

bacterial colonies with specific color characters likely cream yellow and golden yellow were obtained after 48 h of incubation at a temperature of 35 c ph 7 0 at 180 rpm both the bacterial colonies obtained were purified as single cell colony in lb agar plates when further screened for resistance to the fungicide cbz only one potential isolate designated as t4 showed well tolerance to about 100 mg l 1 cbz in both m9 minimal salt media and lb agar media this particular cbz tolerant isolate t4 was then acclimatized in increasing concentrations of the toxic fungicide to check its biodegradation potential 2 4 characterization and identification of the isolate the specific selected bacterium was characterized on the source of gram staining colony morphology and biochemical testing using definite established protocols 34 genetic identification using 16s rdna sequencing was performed blast alignment tool was examined using the consensus gene sequences of 16s rdna this was in accordance with the database of ncbi genbank clustal w program was used for multiple alignments and identity score analysis of the first fifteen selected sequences rdp database was used for creating the matrices of distance between the sequences and mega 5 software program was used for generating the phylogenetic tree 2 5 kinetics of bioremediation study of the isolate for agrochemical waste water and cbz the bod 5 and cod reduction of agrochemical effluent and the toxic cbz degradation from the simulated aqueous solution were analyzed using the cbz resistant isolate t4 in separate batch scale studies individually to 100 ml agrochemical effluent and 100 ml m9 mineral salt media both containing different concentrations of the fungicide cbz about 10 inoculum volume of strain t4 was added and kept for acclimatization for different time periods at 37 c ph 7 0 and agitation of 180 rpm in bod incubator shaker scigenics biotech here the fungicide cbz was the sole source of nutrient carbon hydrogen nitrogen and energy for the strain t4 upon reaching equilibrium the inoculum biomass were separated by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 mins superspin r v fm plasto crafts and filtered using whatman 42 to calculate the remaining cod in the supernatant using automated cod analyzer digester spectroquant tr 320 merck the residual cbz concentration in supernatant was then observed by monitoring the change in absorbance value at maximum wavelength Œªmax using uv visible spectrometer lambda 350 uv vis spectrometer perkin elmer the pellet constituting cell biomass was washed and re suspended in pbs the growth kinetics of the selected strain was then measured at an absorbance of 600 nm the different process parameter optimization was achieved at a fixed cbz concentration with different experimental conditions of ph temperature rpm and inoculum age and biomass weight also the various kinetic order models were experimented to define the biodegradation of cbz in m9 media along with substrate inhibitory models for fitting the data 35 the results were analyzed as the degrading efficiency d of cbz by the potential isolate or the cbz consumption which was examined using the following equation 1 d 100 a 0 a f a 0 where a0 is the initial concentration of cbz mg l 1 af is the concentration of cbz after degradation mg l 1 2 6 physiological and cellular interaction of the isolate growing on cbz for the scanning electron microscopic sem evo ls 15 zeiss germany study monoculture of isolate t4 grown in the presence and absence of the fungicide cbz was collected by centrifugation superspin r v fm plasto crafts the cell pellet was suspended in phosphate buffer fixed with 1 5 glutaraldehyde kept in a refrigerator 4 c for 2 h and washed again with phosphate buffer the samples were then dehydrated with different concentrations of ethanol for 15 min the cells were coated in gold on an electron microscope stub for sem study for assessing the involvement of functional groups associated with the cell surface of isolate t4 monoculture of the isolate in the presence and absence of the fungicide cbz was collected by centrifugation superspin r v fm plasto crafts at 5000 g for 15 mins at 4 c following the standard protocol the cell pellet was dried at 40 c kept with potassium bromide kbr and examined by ftir spectroscopy iraffinity 1 ftir shimadzu 36 to investigate phase identification of the isolate t4 x ray diffraction analysis xrd bruker d 8 advance diffractometer usa was carried out 37 the monoculture of the isolate in the presence and absence of the fungicide cbz was collected by centrifugation superspin r v fm plasto crafts at 5000 g for 15 mins at 4 c following the standard protocol the cellular pellet was suspended in lyophilization buffer the samples were then vacuum freeze at 20 c and prepared in freeze dried powder form using freeze dryer lyodel freeze dryer lyo1855 2 7 geno toxicity and phyto toxicity analysis standard growth inhibition and mitotic index assay with allium cepa root cells along with phyto toxicity analysis with phaseolus mungo seeds were performed separately with certain modifications 32 this was done for observing the safety and efficacy of the bio treatment of cbz solution and agrochemical waste effluent using the isolate t4 and its un inoculated control the bulb of onion was thoroughly washed with ultrapure reagent grade water and kept for growth in dark for 24 h the growing bulbs were acclimatized with bacterial treated and untreated agrochemical effluent and cbz solutions for 24 h in a plant growth incubator maintained at 28 c the variations in root length of onion were examined after 24 h for the chromosome aberration study the conventional fuelgen squash process was carried out 38 the mitotic index mi and chromosome aberration study were determined in about 100 telophase cells per onion root related to about 500 cells per testing conditions separately for phyto toxicity study phaseolus mungo seeds were sterilized with ethanol 70 and sodium hypochlorite 1 5 followed by exposure with bacterial treated and untreated agrochemical effluent and cbz solutions for 24 h in a plant growth incubator maintained at 28 c the variations in germination length of radical cm and shoot length cm were calculated after 7 days of exposure 32 3 results and analysis 3 1 characterization of agrochemical effluent the physico chemical characteristics of the raw agrochemical effluent was tested and summarized in table 1 the results indicated that bod cod heavy metal pesticides was significant with respect to the acceptable level by regulatory authorities the run off water from the agricultural field experimental sample gets mixed with the bagjhola lake water east kolkata area india and due to its high percentage of pollutants contaminate the entire lake whose water is often used for irrigation domestic utility and small fish cultivation these toxicants cause an all around pollution to the water ecosystem the characterization results clearly indicate the need for right treatment before its release in the lake waters the trends of heavy metals present in the agrochemical effluent according to average concentration during the dry and wet seasons was as cu co ni mn fe pb cd ba zn hg and as fe zn mn pb cu co cd ba ni hg respectively because of seasonal rainfall dilution and other run off during the wet season heavy metals from the upper layer of soil were flushed out to a great extent into the wetland waters from where the sample have been collected and hence all the values were higher in the wet season compared to that of the dry season accordingly the concentration of heavy metals that was obtained from the waste agrochemical effluent was observed to be 0 08 mg l 1 as 0 078 mg l 1 cu 0 0763 mg l 1 co 0 076 mg l 1 ni 0 0759 mg l 1 mn 0 0753 mg l 1 fe 0 0721 mg l 1 pb 0 0687 mg l 1 cd 0 0654 mg l 1 ba 0 0622 mg l 1 zn 0 0383 mg l 1 hg there are several trace metals which were detected usually less than a few mg l 1 in agrochemical effluent sample including 0 0008 mg l 1 berillium be 0 000765 mg l 1molybdenum mo 0 000735 mg l 1manganese mn 0 000605 mg l 1 0 000510 mg l 1 selenium se 0 000482 mg l 1 titanium ti 0 000319 mg l 1 tungsten w and 0 000110 mg l 1 vanadium v respectively aas atomic adsorption spectrophotometer spectra a analyst 200 perkin elmer usa was used to quantify the metal ions in experimental reaction mixtures since the present research is focused on the batch scale degradation study of carbendazim fungicide therefore detail biodegradation study of heavy metals using the isolated strain has not been shown here 3 2 effect of acclimatization and characterization of cbz resistant isolate carbendazim is a typical carbamate fungicide fig 1 that attaches with the haeme portion of fungal cytochrome p450 39 inhibiting their synthesis of ergosterol and demethylase activity thereby blocking the synthesis of fungal cell wall chitin 40 the recent research related to cbz is primarily focused on its activity to various bacterial strains it is by far having rigid broad spectrum bactericidal properties and as a fungicide it has a polluting effect on the environment that cannot be put aside therefore our aim was to isolate a potential cbz resistant strain which could also help in environmental management among the isolated strains from the agro effluent only one bacterium t4 was observed to be efficient and resistant to cbz when screened on m9 agar plates with various concentrations of cbz 50 500 mg l 1 from the colonies observed in m9 plates they were raised round entire glistening smooth pale yellow in color and about 5 6 mm in diameter they were observed to be gram positive rod shaped bacteria the isolate can produce greenish yellow color pigment in m9 agar media with cbz as constituent within 72 h of incubation the strain t4 is mesophillic growing best in temperature between 30 c 40 c at a ph range of 7 7 5 and can tolerate about 20 25 nacl solution which makes it evidently halophilic on the biochemical point of view strain t4 was observed to be positive for tests of citrate methyl red catalase and urease production and showed negative results for coagulase and oxidase table 2 the phylogenetic tree analysis of the 16s rdna consensus gene sequence 1452 bp for the strain t4 was performed fig 2 it suggested that it was a member of the genus brevibacillus showing 99 close homology with brevibacillus panacihumi about 1 5 kb 16s rdna gene fragment was amplified from the total dna of the isolated strain and sequenced the evolutionary history and the distance matrix were computed using the neighbor joining method and kimura 2 parameter method respectively evolutionary studies were conducted in mega5 software 3 3 growth rate profile of strain t4 in different concentration of cbz at an initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 acclimatized cells of strain t4 at 1 0 o d a600 was capable of removing cbz within 36 h and tolerating agrochemical effluent at 37 c ph 7 0 and 180 rpm with a growth yield and percent degradation of 0 72 0 05 g of bacterial cells g 1 and 86 respectively at higher concentration of the fungicide cbz 100 500 mg l 1 the isolate also gave promising result fig 3 a plots showing time course growth curve using t4 cells in m9 media indicated minimum period of lag phase during growth exponential phase were found in the range of 18 28 h and up to 40 h fig 3b for growth in real sample of agrochemical effluent the exponential period ranges between 20 and 26 h up to 32 h the biomass was observed to increase from 1 0 o d to 2 89 o d units for all the studies the abiotic loss of substrate cbz in the controlled untreated samples was in the range of 0 12 the results showed that strain t4 was both cbz and also ocp and opp resistant it was able to grow in agrochemical effluent and cbz containing simulated m9 media 3 4 effect of bioremediation parameters of cbz and cod reduction using strain t4 it has been observed that cells growing exponentially are metabolically very active therefore age of inoculums used for any parameter study is an important factor determining rate and percent degradation process 41 the percent degradation of cbz with the culture age of 12 18 24 32 48 and 72 h was estimated to be 82 16 88 94 84 22 71 57 63 82 and 57 41 respectively fig 4 a accordingly it was found that strain t4 worked best in 18 24 h age with a low lag phase period and rapid exponential period moreover the tolerance of raw effluent was observed up to 32 h using the exponential culture age of 18 24 h it was observed that with the increase in biomass weight of the inoculums culture even at a high concentration of 100 mg l 1 of cbz there is an increase in the percentage degradation of the substrate fig 4b it is evident that acclimatized cells of strain t4 at 1 0 o d 2 1 mg dry wt l 1 showed the highest degradation percentage of 86 82 the increase in weight or amount of inoculums 2 6 mg dry wt l 1 did not enhance the degradation percent nor the tolerance to the native effluent this is possibly due to reaching the substrate toxicity level for strain t4 the optimum ph was detected to be 7 0 when the maximum cbz degradation obtained at 87 12 fig 4c this observation indicated that ph of the raw effluent sample must be adjusted to 7 0 for obtaining maximum degradation efficiency of t4 similarly the optimum temperature was detected to be 35 c when the maximum cbz degradation obtained at 86 74 fig 4d it has been reported that for degradation of various organic or inorganic toxicants the optimum temperature range of most microorganisms is between 35 c 40 c 41 in this study it was found that with increase in temperature from 35 c the degradation efficiency of t4 reduces with probable reasons of denaturation of protein deactivation of amino acids and lipids present on the surface of the cell below 35 c clearly the barrier activation energy cannot be crossed also with varying agitation speed strain t4 showed variations in percent cbz and raw effluent tolerance the optimum cbz degradation of 87 30 was detected at a speed of 180 rpm fig 4e the presence of organics in agrochemical effluent increases the bod 5 whereas the presence of chemicals in agriculture namely pesticides including toxic fungicide heavy metals ions increases the cod to a significant extent the gradual and safe degradation of such harmful fungicide like carbendazim cbz will eventually lower the cod level in solution with reduction of pollution in water for the cod reduction analysis utilizing the monoculture of the strain t4 experimental values of cod reduction in percentage is plotted against time taken h fig 4f it was seen that the initial value of cod for raw agrochemical effluent was 880 mg l 1 the strain t4 have been capable of reducing the cod value to almost about 40 23 of the initial value this analysis clearly depicts that the degradation of cbz has been competently performed by indigenously isolated t4 it can be inferred that the strain t4 can not only degrade the toxic cbz in simulated aqueous m9 media but is also able to tolerate the real agrochemical waste effluent containing different toxicants and hazardous substances apart from specific fungicide cbz table 3 lists the comparative study of strain t4 with that of reported strains on cbz degradation and cod reduction from the agrochemical effluent 3 5 kinetic modeling and parameter assessment for strain t4 in the presence of cbz in the present research for different initial concentration of cbz the specific growth rate of strain t4 is taken as Œº and the substrate utilization rate is taken as us fig 5 it was observed that initially Œº showed an increasing trend with the increase in cbz concentration up to a specific level and then followed a decreasing trend with the increase in cbz concentration strain t4 when grown in cbz simulated aqueous m9 media the highest tested specific growth rate Œº was 0 173 h 1 at 200 mg l 1 the decreasing curve of Œº beyond this specific concentration determined the substrate toxicity process due to the paucity of research literature comparison studies could not be listed although the data s affirm with those studied previously for various other inhibitory substances by different microorganisms 47 50 thus far only certain information is available regarding specific growth rate Œº while very limited data actually exists about substrate utilization rate us as a result utilization rates of substrate us was estimated and plotted against the initial concentration of cbz in this case the initial rate of substrate utilization showed an increasing trend with the concentration of cbz reaching a highest level and then showed a decreasing trend due to substrate toxicity accumulation the maximum rate of utilization and specific growth rate were calculated at 200 mg l 1 these data are pertinent because the primary aim of this study is to treat the toxic agrochemical effluent and degrade the toxic substrate cbz the data showing kinetic constants for utilization of cbz using three kinetic growth models are summarized in table 4 on assessing the goodness of fit tests the logistic growth model evidently showed a much better fit to a significant level of accuracy than others with the correlation coefficient r 2 for Œº is 0 94 and for us is 0 91 3 6 effect of cellular and physiological response of strain t4 with cbz the sem evo ls 15 zeiss germany images of strain t4 grown in the presence and absence of fungicide cbz were shown in fig 6 from the figure it was observed that in the absence of cbz the isolate revealed smooth uniform cellular surface with a definite rod shaped structure while in the presence of cbz the bacteria showed uneven rough cellular surface with slightly shrink and deform cellular structure moreover definite geometrically shaped crystal structures adsorbed over the cell surface of strain t4 were also detected in the sem images these crystals are the possible biodegraded intermediates of complex cbz compound by strain t4 which were further tested and confirmed using ftir and xrd analytical studies the cell wall also appeared rough and deformed which was possibly due to toxic chemical stress as reported with bacteria e cloacae for chromium metal 51 for studying the involvement of functional groups in the bio adsorption of cbz on the cell surface of the isolate strain t4 ftir iraffinity 1 ftir shimadzu analysis was performed the ftir spectra of strain t4 grown in m9 mineral media in the presence and absence of 100 mg l 1 simulated cbz solution was investigated in the range of 500 4000 wavenumber cm 1 from the figure fig 7 it is clearly seen that the strain t4 biomass spectra revealed a number of different absorption peaks depicting the complex biomass feature considerable shifts in the ftir spectra were observed with 3427 85 cm 1 1633 41 cm 1 1407 78 cm 1 and 1119 48 cm 1 in the absence of cbz fig 7b while in the presence of 100 mg l 1 cbz solution the peaks were detected at 3308 57 cm 1 1621 3 cm 1 1306 82 cm 1 and 1078 98 cm 1 respectively the shifting of peaks suggests cbz complex hydrocarbon binding mechanism occurred on the cell surface of strain t4 with the involvement of certain functional groups like amide groups hydroxyl groups oh amines primary and secondary amino group and sulfur groups the changes in the spectral peaks can also be due to adsorption of biodegraded cbz metabolites on the surface of the cell observed changes could be due to biomass oxidation during cbz biosorption process 52 for studying the geometrical pattern crystal structures aggregated on the cell surface of strain t4 x ray diffraction xrd bruker d 8 advance diffractometer usa analysis was performed the xrd of freeze dried form of strain t4 grown in m9 mineral media in the presence and absence of 100 mg l 1 simulated cbz solution was investigated at 50 kv voltage and 50 ma current and calibrated with 0 16312 nm radiation Œª Œ± a standard silicon sample using ni filtered cu k at a rate of 4 per minute using 2Œ∏ value range of 0 80 from the figure fig 8 the longest peak was observed at 2Œ∏ value of 32 4215 which showed an intensity count of 2162 a u the second longest peak was observed at 2Œ∏ value of 46 5127 showed an intensity count of 1658 a u two fairly smaller peaks were observed at 2Œ∏ values of 57 1138 and 76 4828 with respective intensity counts of 509 and 326 a u which denoted the formation of the secondary intermediate the bioremediation batch scale study of cbz degradation and analysis of sem ftir and xrd support that strain t4 has the efficiency to remove cbz in an extensive manner and the possible process could be bio adsorption such bio adsorption mechanisms are commercially and industrially very acceptable due to the fact of safe and proper detoxification of toxic chemicals from waste effluent also degradation and reusability of resourceful chemicals which can be used for certain purposes hence this potential strain t4 can be industrially utilized for hazardous chemical detoxification 3 7 modeling of the adsorption isotherm on cbz degradation by strain t4 monoculture a rising focus has been made on the application of biosorption technique for their effectiveness in the elimination of contaminants from aqueous solutions 53 a vast category of less expensive materials including agro and industrial waste products have been employed to eliminate agrochemicals from aqueous solution for their proper disposal into the environment it has been reported that hydrocarbon toxicants can be reduced to less hazardous oxidation states or can be eliminated by adsorption or accumulation process 30 as a result significant contributions have been made in utilizing plenty of agro based solid waste material including coffee and tea wastes pinus bark wool fibres rice husks hazelnut straws corncobs banana and orange peels apple wastes peanut hull mango integuments papaya wood maize leaf grape stalk wastes sugarcane bagasse and modified substances including sunflower stalk cotton sugar beet pulp etc 54 57 in order to compare the various sorbent materials an important parameter to consider is expense although information on the commercial expense is seldom mentioned in research reports also the cost of individual adsorbents differs according to the processing requirement and easy availability here the images of sem and analysis of ftir and xrd techniques substantially indicated that degradation of cbz in simulated aqueous solution is by bio sorption process occurring on the external cell surface of strain t4 for investigating the adsorption isotherm three standard models have been chosen for the study the qualitative equations for the three adsorption models are given as follows langmuir model 2 e c q e 1 q m r l e c q m where qm mg g is the maximum amount of cbz adsorbed forming a complete distinct aggregate on the cell surface ec is the maximum concentration mg l 1 and rl 1 mg is the langmuir constant showing the adsorption energy freundlich model 3 log q e log c f 1 n l o g e c where cf mg g is the freundlich constant showing bonding energy n is the heterogeneity exponent representing the intensity of adsorption process for indicating a favorable affinity of bacterial biomass with the substrate value of n should be greater than 1 dubinin kaganer radushkevich dkr model 4 log q e log s m a Œµ 2 where sm mg g is the highest capacity of substrate adsorption a mol2 kj2 is the activity coefficient showing the mean energy of adsorption and Œµ is polanyi potential which can be expressed in the following form 5 Œµ r t ln 1 1 e c the given equation eq 2 if followed by the strain t4 biomass system plot of 1 qe against 1 ec should have a linear fitting trend in order to satisfy the langmuir model similarly if strain t4 biomass system satisfies freundlich model then plot of log qe against log ec should have linear fit also if strain t4 biomass system satisfies dkr models then the plot of log qe against polanyi potential Œµ 2 should have linear fit from the figure fig 9 the experimental values plotted on log qe against log ec did not show a good linear fit therefore freundlich model is not satisfied also the tested values plotted on the reciprocal form of 1 qe against 1 ec did not show a good linear fit however when the tested values plotted on log qe against Œµ 2 it is observed to have a good linear fit with r2 value 0 921 and therefore it followed the dkr model hence from the figure fig 9c it is evident that adsorption isotherm model of cbz on strain t4 followed the dkr model table 5 summarizes the comparison studies of the three isotherm models the suitability of the dkr model in this research indicates the live bacterial monoculture can remove cbz under adsorption energy condition consequently strain t4 mediated cbz degradation appears to be through biosorption mechanism determination of the cbz carbendazim fungicide degradation mechanism through biosorption is a novel approach for this study using an indigenous single bacteria strain t4 which is not yet available in literature 3 8 genotoxicity and phyto toxicity study of strain t4 monoculture in waste effluent treatment process via microbiological route the necessity of an adequate risk assessment is a chief concern since the effluent contains several toxic organic chemicals metals and xenobiotics which can be carcinogenic and pollute the environment the metabolites or intermediates generated as a result of degradation treatment must be examined with regard to the toxicity of the environment in order to investigate the eco friendly and safe disposal of bio treated agrochemical effluent with contaminant cbz 100 mg l 1 cytological and ecological toxicity assays were carried out table 6 compile the results of inhibitions and mi studies with a cepa roots and phyto toxicity study with p mungo seeds compared with the raw effluent and cbz aqueous solution from the study about 2 fold enhancement in length of roots of a cepa was determined using strain t4 treated cbz solution and agrochemical effluent compared to the real samples the variations in mitotic index mi was also determined after the bio treatment of cbz and effluent solution with the increase in the level of cytotoxicity it is known that level of mi decreases 58 59 here this concept has been justified since with hazardous raw agrochemical effluent and cbz solution the cytotoxicity level increased and mi decreased alternatively strain t4 treated cbz solution and agrochemical effluent caused increase in mi enhance root growth thereby proving that the toxic chemical substance and hazardous components have reduced from the effluent and it is without any other noxious by product which might have form during the time driven bio treatment process further the effect of strain t4 biotreated effluent and cbz simulated solution was studied on p mungo seeds to determine the phenotype phytotoxicity result of the intermediates formed after the treatment the changes in percent germination length of radical and shoot cm were observed after 7 days study table 6 it was observed that the germination percent along with the length of shoot and root of p mungo seeds in presence of strain t4 treatment was improved and comparably higher than with the untreated real waste effluent and cbz samples this confirmed the reduced toxicity of the intermediates produced after the adsorption treatment which did not impede the growth and germination of the plant 4 conclusion the present investigation was undertaken to isolate a potential indigenous microbial strain capable of degrading hazardous fungicide carbendazim from synthetic and real agrochemical waste effluent it is identified to be brevibacillus sp strain c17 t4 and exhibited significant efficiency in decreasing cod 880 mg l and bod from the effluent and removing about 300 mg l 1 cbz from simulated media thereby proving microbial treatment to be economically helpful analysis of sem ftir and xrd studies disclosed that strain t4 mediated cbz degradation was by biosorption mechanism the substantial lowering of toxicity of real agrochemical effluent and cbz simulated solution as observed from the geno toxicity and phyto toxicity studies confirm the environmental and industrial usefulness of strain t4 biomass mediated waste treatment considering the environmental impact point of view it is known that the biomass after the end of biodegradation mechanism will contain a certain amount of cbz the bacterial biomass subsequently can be sonicated centrifuged and cells can be ruptured to identify the hydrolase or reductase present inside the cell which can degrade the substrate to further simpler and safer forms thereby establishing an environmental friendly process the future scope of effective bioremediation strategy should have the subsequent steps in connection with the present research though not covered here for the treatment of agrochemical effluent it has been accentuated that the bio based approaches provide an eco sustainable and low cost alternative to physic chemical techniques in several cases the monoculture of bacterial isolate upon introduction to polluted sites often fall short to degrade the toxicants possibly due to their reduced activity in the environment or low resistance or low survival capacity 60 besides bacterial bioremediation is a time consuming process takes week to month to accomplish required remediation and it is unsuitable for treating polluted water due to reduced aeration and nutrient content of the water alternatively the prologue of a bacterial consortium surely has a greater probability of success in bioremediation than that of a monoculture isolate since such a consortium has a greater capability to adapt to these stresses also a bacterial consortium contains both the degraders of selected compounds and also strains that can use the metabolic intermediate products of the selected compounds the harmful intermediate products often become persistent when using a single pure isolate 61 additionally there has been a rising demand in the concept of utilizing formulated enzymes as compared to live strains as effective bioremediation agents in a strategy called enzymatic bioremediation 62 this technique is mainly improvised for water treatment functions where robust and rapid remediation is required and bacterial growth survival and proliferation are not intended therefore the bacterial gene product in charge of such bioremediation ability is cloned and expressed in suitable vector for fast degradation for instance the reported cognate gene mhel responsible for cbz hydrolyzing esterase has been extracted from nocardioles sp strain sg 4g and expressed heterologously in e coli which has indications of higher bioremediation ability 27 moreover the competence of the following protocols could be effectively measured using stirred tank or membrane or column bioreactors with biologically modified monoculture of bacterial isolate or with non modified bacterial consortium for complete and fast biodegradation of toxic agrochemical like carbendazim cbz from both synthetically spiked and real environmentally toxic effluents 63 acknowledgement the author tk received fellowship of upe phase ii
