introduction thin walled cylinders commonly known as tubes are frequently chosen as a preform in ocean engineering fields with the increase of underwater structure research designers have more thinking about the processing and manufacturing of pressure hulls to improve the process efficiency and product quality bulging can increase the yield strength of a material and reduce the out of roundness of thin walled shells of revolution zhang et al 2018 the cylinders are then internally pressurised into various atypical geometries with or without the use of dies xiong et al 2019 bulging realizes a good trade off between geometrical and material properties notably leading to an optically distributed loading resistance on the shell yuan and fan 2019 the properties of thin walled cylinders subjected to bulging with a die have been extensively studied using several geometrical shapes of thin walled tubes for example song and hui 2019 adopted plastic incremental theory to determine the stress strain curves of the material used in thin walled tubes and the final hydroforming pressure of thin walled tubes constrained by a corrugated die they found that local free bulging

between the preform and the die internal pressure and material properties were the three interactive major factors that influenced the bulging process jorge carlos león anaya et al 2019 on the other hand the free bulging process of thin walled tubes in an open die has attracted a considerable amount of attention for example velasco and boudeau 2008 studied the thickness variations and internal pressure profile of a bulged tube in an open die they proposed an analytical approach to determine the midpoint thickness at the midpoint of the bulged zone based on the arc bulged geometry and plastic incompressibility such an approach was well benchmarked against the experimental and numerical ones yang et al 2006 focused on the bulging properties of a tube in an open die a series of analytical equations were derived to determine the loading path thickness reduction and material volume based on the elliptical bulged geometry and typical plastic shell theory djavanroodi et al 2008 analytically and numerically investigated the free bulging properties of a tube subjected to open die hydroforming an analytical model was derived to determine the decrease in thickness based on a

of the hydroforming process and discussed the major factors that have an effect on the hydroforming process such as material parameters fabrication equipment and interaction between the preform and the die the review mainly focused on the forming limits koç and altan 2002 and material properties sokolowski et al 2000 in the thin walled tube bulging process most studies have mainly focused on the expensive method of die bulging of thin walled cylinders and little attention has been paid to the more economic method of dieless free bulging of thin walled cylinders this bulging technology was first proposed by yuan et al 2004 and it has been successfully used to bulge various polyhedron preforms into spheres zhang and wang 2015 prolate ellipsoids zhang and yuan 2017 and oblate ellipsoids yuan et al 2015 in this study the free bulging of thin walled cylinders closed by two heavy plates is investigated section 2 presents the analytical and numerical modelling methods employed for studying the bulging process of thin walled cylinders section 3 presents the results of the geometrical and mechanical properties obtained from the analytical and numerical analyses we then discuss the results of an experiment conducted using three thin walled cylinders the experiment was conducted to validate the theoretical data this research provides a theoretical approach for evaluating the free bulging of thin walled cylinders this study can be used as a reference for investigating the free bulging of other geometries such as cones plates and their combinations 2 material and methods a sketch of a preformed thin walled cylinder is shown in fig 1 the cylinder is made of stainless steel and its thickness length and radius are t 0 2 l and r 0 respectively the cylinder is closed by two rigid heavy plates made of mild steel each of which has a thickness of t t 0 to build a theoretical analytical model of the free bulging of a thin walled cylinder closed by two heavy plates we make the following assumptions 1 the bulged shell is axisymmetric owing to the axisymmetry of the applied pressure and the pre bulged cylinder cylinder before bulging 2 during the bulging process the material volume is constant and the length 2 l of the bulged shell does not change after bulging 3 the meridian of the bulged shell is a circular arc with a radius of r 1 which is dependent on the bulging magnitude h 4 radical stress is absent because the ratio of the thickness to radius is only 1 50 a thin walled membrane theory is employed hence the radical stress can be ignored 5 the bulged object is isotropic continuous homogeneous elastic plastic and not under any initial stress 6 there is no dynamic influence quasi static analysis is implemented without considering the dynamic influence because of the slow internal hydroforming loading 7 the rigid closed heavy plates are not deformed because of their extremely large wall thickness 2 1 analytical modelling based on the assumptions 1 3 the meridian of the external surface of the bulged shell in can be defined in cartesian coordinates as follows 1 y r 1 2 x 2 r 1 h r 0 according to the calculus theory of advanced mathematics the external surface area s and closed internal capacity v can be determined as follows 2 s l l 2 π y 1 y 2 d x and 3 v l l π y 2 d x respectively in line with the current thickness distribution rule song and hui 2019 given by equation 4 and on the basis of the constant material volume assumption 2 the thickness can be determined by using the modified thickness formula in equation 5 4 t r 0 t 0 r and 5 t k r 0 t 0 r where k is the material volume coefficient under the assumption that the material volume is constant during the bulging process 6 v 0 v v where v 0 is the volume of the material of the initial thin walled cylinder and v is the internal capacity of the bulged shell they can be determined as follows 7 v 0 2 π l r 0 2 r 0 t 0 2 and 8 v l l π r 1 t 2 x 2 r 1 t h t r 0 2 d x respectively combining equations 5 8 the material volume coefficient k which is dependent on the bulging magnitude can be determined 9 k a h 3 b h 2 c h 1 when h 0 k 1 in this case the bulged shell corresponds to the initial thin walled cylinder with equally distributed thickness the coefficients a c in equation 9 can be determined by solving the following linear equations 10 k 1 a h 1 3 b h 1 2 c h 1 1 k 2 a h 2 3 b h 2 2 c h 2 1 k 3 a h 3 3 b h 3 2 c h 3 1 where k 1 k 2 and k 3 are the material volume coefficients under the bulging magnitudes h 1 h 2 and h 3 respectively using the general theory of shells of revolution and assumptions 4 7 we can determine the radical strain ε t and circumferential strain ε θ of the bulged shell as follows 11 ε t ln t t 0 and 12 ε θ ln r 1 r 0 respectively according to the constant volume assumption in equation 13 the meridional strain ε ϕ of the bulged shell can be determined in equation 14 13 ε ϕ ε t ε θ 0 14 ε ϕ ε t ε θ substituting equation 14 into the equivalent strain given by equation 15 of a general shell the equivalent strain ε e q of the bulged shell can be determined equation 16 15 ε e q 2 3 ε θ ε t 2 ε ϕ ε θ 2 ε t ε ϕ 2 16 ε e q ε θ 2 ε θ ε ϕ ε ϕ 2 similarly the circumferential stress σ ϕ and meridional stress σ θ of the bulged shell are given by 17 σ ϕ p r 2 2 t and 18 σ θ r 2 p t σ ϕ r 1 respectively here r 1 is the meridional radius of curvature and r 2 is the circumferential radius of curvature they can be determined as follows 19 r 1 h 2 l 2 2 h and 20 r 2 r 0 h because a thin walled cylinder is considered the radical stress σ t is assumed to be zero in this case substituting equations 17 and 18 into the equivalent stress given by equation 21 of a general shell the equivalent stress σ e q of the bulged shell can be determined from equation 22 21 σ e q 2 2 σ θ σ t 2 σ ϕ σ θ 2 σ t σ ϕ 2 22 σ e q σ θ 2 σ θ σ ϕ σ ϕ 2 according to hencky s theory and the von mises yield criterion the following stress strain relationships are obtained 23 ε θ ε e q σ e q σ θ σ ϕ 2 and 24 ε ϕ ε e q σ e q σ ϕ σ θ 2 elastic plastic material modelling is adopted in the mechanical analysis where the material properties are determined through a uniaxial tensile test conducted on several flat coupons using iso 6892 1 iso 2016 the obtained stress strain curves are presented in fig 2 from these curves we obtain a linear constitutive equation 25 σ e q σ y e 1 ε e q where σ y is the yield point determined by 0 2 proof stress and e 1 is the strength coefficient obtained from the slope of the curve for the second plastic segment moreover the slope of the curve for the first elastic segment corresponds to young s modulus e and the ratio of the transverse strain to the longitudinal strain during the elastic stage corresponds to poisson s ratio μ the detailed material properties are listed in table 1 combining equations 17 18 22 and 25 we attain the bulging pressure p 26 p 2 t σ y e 1 ε e q r 2 3 3 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 2 for the preformed cylindrical shell r 1 ε e q 0 r 2 r 0 and t t 0 the initial plastic pressure is given by 27 p 2 3 t σ y r 2 2 3 t 0 σ y r 0 this formula represents the typical initial plastic pressure of tubes with constrained ends the midpoint shown in fig 1 is the weakest point of the bulged shell because at this point the bulging magnitude is maximum and the wall thickness is minimum therefore the bulging pressure at this midpoint is considered in this analysis by substituting equations 5 and 11 14 and 19 and 20 into equation 26 the bulging pressure can be rewritten as 28 p 2 σ y k r 0 t 0 r 0 h 4 3 ln 2 r 0 k r 0 h ln r 0 k r 0 h ln r 0 h r 0 ln 2 r 0 h r 0 r 0 h 3 3 2 h r 0 h h 2 l 2 2 h r 0 h h 2 l 2 2 as a result the bulging pressure is only a function of the bulging magnitude h 2 2 numerical modelling to validate the geometrical and analytical data a nonlinear numerical model is established for the dieless bulging of a thin walled cylinder closed by two heavy plates this is done using abaqus software which is used for finite element analysis the detailed dimensions of the cylinder and plates are listed in table 2 as seen in fig 3 an axisymmetric deformable shell is used to model the cylinder the element type is a 2 node linear axisymmetric thin or thick shell sax1 the mesh convergence evaluation results in a total of 101 sax1 elements the elastic plastic material model is defined using the material properties listed in table 1 to simplify the numerical modelling the two heavy plates are removed and replaced by the following boundary conditions all degrees of freedom at both ends of the cylinder are constrained only the axial degree of freedom at one end of the cylinder is released and applied by a concentrated load f π p r 0 2 an internal pressure of p 16 mpa is applied during the numerical analysis the geometrical and mechanical nonlinear analysis is carried out using the newton raphson method available in abaqus standard the automatic increment algorithm is employed and the solving parameters are as follows initial increment size of 0 002 maximum increment size of 0 02 period of 1 and maximum number of increments of 10 000 3 results and discussion 3 1 geometrical analysis the surface area s closed internal capacity v and wall thickness t of the bulged shell can be obtained from equations 2 3 and 5 respectively the material volume coefficient k can be determined by combining equations 5 10 as follows 29 k 2 79154 e 06 h 3 2 92802 e 04 h 2 1 39745 e 04 h 1 the obtained analytical results are presented along with the corresponding numerical data in figs 4 6 as shown in figs 4 6 the analytical and numerical results are in good agreement with each other both the surface area and closed internal capacity increase monotonically with the bulging magnitude owing to the continuous internally pressurised plastic bulging of the cylinder the bulged shell shape is considered to have a large inner space and reserve buoyancy which makes it suitable for use in an underwater pressure hull zhang et al 2017 the thickness distributions of the bulged shell are shown in fig 6 as seen in fig 6 the thickness of the bulged shell decreases with an increase in the bulging magnitude the thickness exhibits a symmetric distribution along the axis of revolution the thickness is minimum at the midpoint and maximum at the two ends relatively large deviations are found between the analytical and numerical data at both ends because of the boundary effect of ends being constrained by the heavy plates the deviation between the analytical and numerical data is very large at high bulging magnitudes interestingly the thickness at the midpoint decreases linearly with an increase in the bulging magnitude the numerically obtained length is shown in fig 7 to verify the assumption of unchanged length of the bulged shell the length remains almost constant when the bulging magnitude is 16 mm which is the bulging limit beyond the bulging magnitude of 16 mm the length increases considerably possibly because of the instability of the bulged shell these findings indicate that the analytical data are suitable valid only for a relatively small bulging magnitude the bulging magnitude corresponds to the intersection of the meridional and circumferential radii of curvature in fig 8 before the intersection the bulged shell resembles a prolate ellipsoid at the intersection the bulged shell corresponds to a sphere and after the intersection the bulged shell resembles an oblate ellipsoid the numerically obtained meridians under five bulging loadings are shown in fig 9 to confirm the assumption that the bulged shell has a circular geometry each meridian is well fitted with a circular arc using the data analysis software origin the r square varies from 0 99737 to 0 99999 after geometrical analysis it is necessary to examine the mechanical performance of the bulged shell 3 2 mechanical analysis the midpoint equivalent strain ε e q midpoint equivalent stress σ e q and bulging pressure p are calculated using equations 16 22 and 28 respectively the obtained analytical results along with the corresponding numerical data are presented in figs 10 13 as shown in fig 10 the equivalent strain bulging magnitude curves obtained with the analytical and numerical results are in good agreement with each other because of the displacement based solution the numerical analysis software provides only the equivalent plastic strain whereas the analytical equivalent strain includes elastic and plastic strain the numerical data are slightly lower than the analytical data nevertheless the effect of elastic strain on the bulging is neglected in the analysis because the shell undergoes a large plastic deformation on the other hand as seen in figs 11 and 12 the equivalent stress and bulging pressure obtained using the analytical model agree well with those obtained using the numerical model only when the bulging magnitude is less than the threshold of 16 mm beyond that the deviation between the analysis and numerical results tend to increase because the analytical formulae are determined based on the assumption that the length of the shell does not change after bulging as shown in figs 11 and 12 before the bulging threshold the midpoint equivalent stress and bulging pressure increase linearly with the bulging magnitude unlike the thickness the midpoint equivalent strain increases linearly with bulging magnitude during the entire bulging process the equivalent strain and equivalent stress distributions of the bulged shell under several typical loading cases are also plotted in fig 13 as seen in fig 13 the equivalent strain and equivalent stress increase from the two end points to the midpoint because the shell is constrained by the heavy plates this indicates that significant hardening of the material occurs in the middle thinning area of the bulged shell in general increasing the yield strength and meridian curvature increases the load carrying capacity whereas decreasing the thickness decreases the load carrying capacity therefore because the bulged zone of the shell is subjected to significant material hardening and large thickness reduction the load carrying capacity of the bulged shell can be maintained this phenomenon will be explored in future work 3 3 experiment to validate the theoretical and numerical data three nominally identical thin walled cylinders are tentatively fabricated geometrically measured and hydrostatically bulged fig 14 the cylinders are cut from a long thin walled cylinder and each cylinder is closed by two heavy plates that are welded on either side of it the dimensions of the cylinder and plates are listed in table 2 an opening is made in one plate to allow water to flow as a means to apply internal pressure before bulging the external surface of each sample is optically scanned using a three dimensional scanner with a measurement accuracy of 0 02 mm then the thicknesses of each bulged sample are ultrasonically obtained using a thickness instrument with a measurement accuracy of 0 002 mm the total number of points measured for each sample is 144 9 in the meridional direction and 16 in the circumferential direction therefore the geometrical properties of the samples can be determined with their fabrication accuracy after the geometrical measurements of the samples were taken each cylinder is filled with water and gradually pressurised to a fixed value with the use of a hand operated pump the pressure is monitored using an analogue pressure gauge installed in the pump prior to the application of hydrostatic pressure a load of 1 mpa is applied to the cylinder and maintained for a while to check the weld quality and tightness of each sample after the buckling of the cylinder the thicknesses of each bulged sample are ultrasonically measured and the exterior surface of each bulged sample is optically scanned to compare the results of this experiment with the numerical and analytical results we plotted the values of the external surface area closed internal capacity midpoint thickness length and bulging magnitude obtained in the experiment in figs 4 7 and 12 as seen in these figures there is a good agreement among the experiment numerical and analytical results validating the theoretical approaches the thickness distributions of the bulged cylinders and their deviations from the perfect geometries are shown in figs 15 18 the thicknesses of the samples before bulging demonstrate good uniformity fig 15 a varying only slightly from 0 9 to 0 91 mm meanwhile the geometries of the fabricated samples correspond well to the perfect geometries of fig 17 these geometrical properties indicate a high accuracy in fabrication as shown in fig 15 b and 16 the thickness of each bulged cylinder is reduced considerably owing to the increase in external surface area and the principle of mass conservation the thickness has a good symmetry around the axis of revolution and it decreases significantly from the ends to the midpoint the higher the applied internal pressure the greater is the reduction in thickness the experiment results are in good agreement with the analytical and numerical results as shown in fig 18 the geometries of the bulged cylinders deviate slightly from the perfect geometries mainly because of the slight nonuniformity in the thickness of the cylinders before bulging fig 15 a and the initial geometric imperfections fig 17 nevertheless the bulged cylinders demonstrate a reasonable symmetry around the axis of revolution the geometries of the bulged cylinder are similar to the perfect geometries 4 conclusion we conducted a study on the free bulging properties of thin walled cylinders closed by two heavy plates through analytical and numerical modelling and an experiment the main conclusions are as follows 1 good agreement was observed among the analytical numerical and experimental data validating the adopted theoretical methodology and the several basic assumptions made for deriving the analytical model this showed that the current expensive technique for bulging thin walled cylinders can be replaced with a more economical dieless free bulging technique 2 a bulging magnitude threshold existed during the free bulging of thin walled cylinders before the threshold the length 2 l of the bulged shell was nearly constant so analytical modelling can be carried out up to this point after the threshold the bulged cylinder becomes unstable 3 the cylinder varied from a prolate ellipsoid to a sphere because the increasing bulging magnitude h changes the meridional and circumferential radii of curvature the sphere bulging point corresponds to the instability bulging threshold 4 the bulging properties including the surface area internal capacity thickness distribution equivalent strain and bulging pressure were effectively evaluated using the proposed analytical formulae the analytical results were in good agreement with the numerical results 5 the bulged zone of the shell was subjected to significant material hardening and large thickness reduction such material hardening and thickness reduction may help maintain the load carrying capacity of a bulged shell this however requires to be confirmed in a future study credit authorship contribution statement jian zhang supervision project administration writing original draft feng wang data

following boundary conditions all degrees of freedom at both ends of the cylinder are constrained only the axial degree of freedom at one end of the cylinder is released and applied by a concentrated load f π p r 0 2 an internal pressure of p 16 mpa is applied during the numerical analysis the geometrical and mechanical nonlinear analysis is carried out using the newton raphson method available in abaqus standard the automatic increment algorithm is employed and the solving parameters are as follows initial increment size of 0 002 maximum increment size of 0 02 period of 1 and maximum number of increments of 10 000 3 results and discussion 3 1 geometrical analysis the surface area s closed internal capacity v and wall thickness t of the bulged shell can be obtained from equations 2 3 and 5 respectively the material volume coefficient k can be determined by combining equations 5 10 as follows 29 k 2 79154 e 06 h 3 2 92802 e 04 h 2 1 39745 e 04 h 1 the obtained analytical results are presented along with the corresponding numerical data in figs 4 6 as shown in figs 4 6 the analytical and numerical results are in good agreement with each other both the surface area and closed internal capacity increase monotonically with the bulging magnitude owing to the continuous internally pressurised plastic bulging of the cylinder the bulged shell shape is considered to have a large inner space and reserve buoyancy which makes it suitable for use in an underwater pressure hull zhang et al 2017 the thickness distributions of the bulged shell are shown in fig 6 as seen in fig 6 the thickness of the bulged shell decreases with an increase in the bulging magnitude the thickness exhibits a symmetric distribution along the axis of revolution the thickness is minimum at the midpoint and maximum at the two ends relatively large deviations are found between the analytical and numerical data at both ends because of the boundary effect of ends being constrained by the heavy plates the deviation between the analytical and numerical data is very large at high bulging magnitudes interestingly the thickness at the midpoint decreases linearly with an increase in the bulging magnitude the numerically obtained length is shown in fig 7 to verify the assumption of unchanged length of the bulged shell the length remains almost constant when the bulging magnitude is 16 mm which is the bulging limit beyond the bulging magnitude of 16 mm the length increases considerably possibly because of the instability of the bulged shell these findings indicate that the analytical data are suitable valid only for a relatively small bulging magnitude the bulging magnitude corresponds to the intersection of the meridional and circumferential radii of curvature in fig 8 before the intersection the bulged shell resembles a prolate ellipsoid at the intersection the bulged shell corresponds to a sphere and after the intersection the bulged shell resembles an oblate ellipsoid the numerically obtained meridians under five bulging loadings are shown in fig 9 to confirm the assumption that the bulged shell has a circular geometry each meridian is well fitted with a circular arc using the data analysis software origin the r square varies from 0 99737 to 0 99999 after geometrical analysis it is necessary to examine the mechanical performance of the bulged shell 3 2 mechanical analysis the midpoint equivalent strain ε e q midpoint equivalent stress σ e q and bulging pressure p are calculated using equations 16 22 and 28 respectively the obtained analytical results along with the corresponding numerical data are presented in figs 10 13 as shown in fig 10 the equivalent strain bulging magnitude curves obtained with the analytical and numerical results are in good agreement with each other because of the displacement based solution the numerical analysis software provides only the equivalent plastic strain whereas the analytical equivalent strain includes elastic and plastic strain the numerical data are slightly lower than the analytical data nevertheless the effect of elastic strain on the bulging is neglected in the analysis because the shell undergoes a large plastic deformation on the other hand as seen in figs 11 and 12 the equivalent stress and bulging pressure obtained using the analytical model agree well with those obtained using the numerical model only when the bulging magnitude is less than the threshold of 16 mm beyond that the deviation between the analysis and numerical results tend to increase because the analytical formulae are determined based on the assumption that the length of the shell does not change after bulging as shown in figs 11 and 12 before the bulging threshold the midpoint equivalent stress and bulging pressure increase linearly with the bulging magnitude unlike the thickness the midpoint equivalent strain increases linearly with bulging magnitude during the entire bulging process the equivalent strain and equivalent stress distributions of the bulged shell under several typical loading cases are also plotted in fig 13 as seen in fig 13 the equivalent strain and equivalent stress increase from the two end points to the midpoint because the shell is constrained by the heavy plates this indicates that significant hardening of the material occurs in the middle thinning area of the bulged shell in general increasing the yield strength and meridian curvature increases the load carrying capacity whereas decreasing the thickness decreases the load carrying capacity therefore because the bulged zone of the shell is subjected to significant material hardening and large thickness reduction the load carrying capacity of the bulged shell can be maintained this phenomenon will be explored in future work 3 3 experiment to validate the theoretical and numerical data three nominally identical thin walled cylinders are tentatively fabricated geometrically measured and hydrostatically bulged fig 14 the cylinders are cut from a long thin walled cylinder and each cylinder is closed by two heavy plates that are welded on either side of it the dimensions of the cylinder and plates are listed in table 2 an opening is made in one plate to allow water to flow as a means to apply internal pressure before bulging the external surface of each sample is optically scanned using a three dimensional scanner with a measurement accuracy of 0 02 mm then the thicknesses of each bulged sample are ultrasonically obtained using a thickness instrument with a measurement accuracy of 0 002 mm the total number of points measured for each sample is 144 9 in the meridional direction and 16 in the circumferential direction therefore the geometrical properties of the samples can be determined with their fabrication accuracy after the geometrical measurements of the samples were taken each cylinder is filled with water and gradually pressurised to a fixed value with the use of a hand operated pump the pressure is monitored using an analogue pressure gauge installed in the pump prior to the application of hydrostatic pressure a load of 1 mpa is applied to the cylinder and maintained for a while to check the weld quality and tightness of each sample after the buckling of the cylinder the thicknesses of each bulged sample are ultrasonically measured and the exterior surface of each bulged sample is optically scanned to compare the results of this experiment with the numerical and analytical results we plotted the values of the external surface area closed internal capacity midpoint thickness length and bulging magnitude obtained in the experiment in figs 4 7 and 12 as seen in these figures there is a good agreement among the experiment numerical and analytical results validating the theoretical approaches the thickness distributions of the bulged cylinders and their deviations from the perfect geometries are shown in figs 15 18 the thicknesses of the samples before bulging demonstrate good uniformity fig 15 a varying only slightly from 0 9 to 0 91 mm meanwhile the geometries of the fabricated samples correspond well to the perfect geometries of fig 17 these geometrical properties indicate a high accuracy in fabrication as shown in fig 15 b and 16 the thickness of each bulged cylinder is reduced considerably owing to the increase in external surface area and the principle of mass conservation the thickness has a good symmetry around the axis of revolution and it decreases significantly from the ends to the midpoint the higher the applied internal pressure the greater is the reduction in thickness the experiment results are in good agreement with the analytical and numerical results as shown in fig 18 the geometries of the bulged cylinders deviate slightly from the perfect geometries mainly because of the slight nonuniformity in the thickness of the cylinders before bulging fig 15 a and the initial geometric imperfections fig 17 nevertheless the bulged cylinders demonstrate a reasonable symmetry around the axis of revolution the geometries of the bulged cylinder are similar to the perfect geometries 4 conclusion we conducted a study on the free bulging properties of thin walled cylinders closed by two heavy plates through analytical and numerical modelling and an experiment the main conclusions are as follows 1 good agreement was observed among the analytical numerical and experimental data validating the adopted theoretical methodology and the several basic assumptions made for deriving the analytical model this showed that the current expensive technique for bulging thin walled cylinders can be replaced with a more economical dieless free bulging technique 2 a bulging magnitude threshold existed during the free bulging of thin walled cylinders before the threshold the length 2 l of the bulged shell was nearly constant so analytical modelling can be carried out up to this point after the threshold the bulged cylinder becomes unstable 3 the cylinder varied from a prolate ellipsoid to a sphere because the increasing bulging magnitude h changes the meridional and circumferential radii of curvature the sphere bulging point corresponds to the instability bulging threshold 4 the bulging properties including the surface area internal capacity thickness distribution equivalent strain and bulging pressure were effectively evaluated using the proposed analytical formulae the analytical results were in good agreement with the numerical results 5 the bulged zone of the shell was subjected to significant material hardening and large thickness reduction such material hardening and thickness reduction may help maintain the load carrying capacity of a bulged shell this however requires to be confirmed in a future study credit authorship contribution statement jian zhang supervision project administration writing original draft feng wang data

21006,sound is generated by the wind at sea when waves break due to the interaction of air and sea surface bubbles are generated in the water when waves break due to the impact on the sea surface and a large amount of small bubbles form a bubble cloud within a few meters below the sea level underwater bubbles generated by wind propagate sound in all directions which greatly affects noise in the low frequency band 1 khz the objective of this study is to understand the dependence of the fluctuation in generated noise on the strength of the wind speed in coastal waters an acoustic experiment was conducted using a self recording hydrophone to measure wind driven noise levels nls the measured nls which filtered out the effect of ship noise were compared with the modeled wind nls over time in terms of bubble cloud depth and wind induced source level depending on the observed local wind speed although a small discrepancy was observed at low wind speeds the trend of the change in both results was in good agreement this finding suggests that the modeling technique for estimating the wind nl using wind speed can reflect the wind driven environment of the ocean keywords underwater acoustic numerical modeling ambient noise wind driven noise level 1 introduction wind noise in oceans is caused by breaking waves that result from the interaction of wind and sea surface knudsen et al 1948 medwin and beaky 1989 hollett 1994 as wind blows air is entrapped in the sea by the breaking waves and small bubbles are formed woolf 2001 cho and choi 2010 the large quantities of small bubbles generated in the water then form a cloud farmer and vagle 1988 anguelova and huq 2012 moreover as the wind speed increases the wind stress acting on the sea surface increases and the bubble clouds become distributed at increasing water depths hanson 1993 consequently the noise source generated by the wind occupies a spatial volume depending on the depth below the sea surface which is spatially propagated through the ocean waveguide and acts as a major factor that affects the noise level nl in the water the research on the dependence of ocean ambient noise on wind speed has a long historical literature knudsen et al 1948 reported the effect of local wind on ambient noise at a frequency band of 100 hz 25 khz wenz 1962 and urick 1983 classified the noise sources that affect each frequency bands in the ocean and published that the dependence of ambient noise on wind speed is a function of frequency recently the relationship between ambient nl and wind speed was established using a vertical line array deployed at deep ocean sites in the northeast pacific ocean chapman and cornish 1993 farrokhrooz et al 2017 these nls are affected by the intensity of the noise source in the subsurface that is the source level sl and the magnitude of the nl are determined in accordance with the physical and geophysical properties of the region of interest several experimental studies measured the sl of local wind noise in deep and shallow waters using the directional characteristics of a vertical line array and a bottom mounted hydrophone respectively burgess and kewley 1983 kuperman and ferla 1985 schmidt and kuperman 1988 combining the abovementioned results with the findings of other researchers kewley et al 1990 established the wind induced sl as a function of frequency 0 1 3000 hz carey and evans 2011 conducted a numerical modeling of wind driven ambient noise on the basis of the bearing and elevation angles for the spatially distributed wind noise sources in the gulf of alaska however few studies analyze and verify the reliability of the results of previous studies through the direct comparison of the modeled wind nl and the nl based on the observed wind speed in the sea therefore modeling the spatiotemporal nl at sea with consideration of the oceanographic characteristics of a specific region of interest based on observed wind speed data is necessary the objective of this study is to quantitatively compare and evaluate the observed nl against the estimated wind driven nl wnl by applying an acoustic modeling method based on the wind speed data obtained from a weather buoy in the coastal waters of the korean east sea to estimate the wnl the sls that depend on the wind speed and depth distribution of bubble clouds should be considered as a source of sea surface noise the wind dependent sls as a function of frequency were estimated by applying the measured wind speed data to the sl curves based on the analysis of kewley et al 1990 hanson 1993 reported that bubble clouds which are the major source of wind noise were distributed several meters below sea surface the wind speed measured using the weather buoy was applied to the empirical formula presented by hanson 1993 the depth of the bubble cloud distribution during the experiment was 2 4 m in the present study the spatial distribution of bubble clouds below sea surface was regarded as the depth of the integral section of sl for wnl estimation furthermore a normal mode acoustic propagation model was used to calculate the transmission loss tl of the sound transmitted from the spatially distributed noise source below the surface to a hydrophone location jensen et al 2011 the wnls at the receiver point were modeled by incoherently summing the differences between the sls and tls in terms of distance direction and source depths to verify the proposed method for modeling wnl based on wind speed the results were compared with measured nls at frequencies of 500 630 800 and 1000 hz in accordance with time changes this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the field measurements of the acoustic and meteorological data of the study site section 3 presents the methodology for estimating wnls using wind speed information section 4 discusses the observed acoustic data and the modeling results as well as the differences in such results section 5 provides the summary and conclusion 2 field measurements 2 1 acoustic recordings an acoustic experiment was conducted which involves recording underwater noises by mooring a self recording hydrophone srh in water from april 20 27 2018 south korea local time utc 09 00 to measure the changes in the ambient nls based on the wind speed in the ocean the hydrophone was moored approximately 9 km latitude 37 0558 n longitude 129 5174 e from the port of jukbyeon in the east coast of south korea at a depth of 135 m red dot in fig 1 a and deployed at a depth of 70 m which was within the mid depth of the total water column fig 1b the depth distribution around the experimental area had a well developed isobath lines along the coast continental shelves existed up to 300 m and the continental slope extended to approximately 2000 m an sm3m wildlife acoustics inc maynard ma submersible recorder was used to measure the ambient noise the hydrophone mounted on the recorder was manufactured by high tech inc long beach ms which has a receiving voltage sensitivity of approximately 165 4 db re 1 v μpa at frequencies of 100 hz 10 khz the sm3m was set to measure 5 min for every 10 min intervals duty cycle 50 with a received gain of 12 db and a sampling frequency of 24 khz fig 2 a shows a spectrogram frequency of interest below 1 2 khz of ambient noise established using the acoustic data measured during the experimental period the power spectral density in db re 1 μpa2 hz of individual time series segments with a duration of 1 s was calculated by applying a 24 000 point fourier transform with a 50 window overlap using a rectangular window the spectrogram was derived by averaging the power spectral density of 300 s intermittent shipping noise in the entire spectrogram caused a rapid occurrence of broadband acoustic energy some of which spanned the entire frequency range the spectral energy of shipping noise was mostly concentrated in the frequency range below 200 hz the power spectral density at 500 hz was extracted to confirm the change in the nls with time fig 2b in this frequency nls were distributed within 45 86 db during the observation period and the average value over the measured period was 69 1 db continuous ship activities occur in the experimental area for instances small fishing boats leave and return to jukbyeon port and commercial ships travel back and forth between the southern region of south korea and the port of donghae previous research results showed that the underwater noise data measured in the ocean include the shipping noise that depends on the presence or absence of ships merchant et al 2012 bassett et al 2012 to obtain the desired results the noise periods contaminated by shipping noise were removed from the measured noise field subsequently the extracted nls and modeled wnls were compared fig 3 a and b shows the 5 min spectrograms of the acoustic data arrows ① and ② in fig 2b indicate the relatively high nl peaks broadband interference patterns typically occur when the ship passes the hydrophone mckenna et al 2012 brooker and humphrey 2016 peng et al 2018 the nl peaks in fig 2b were mostly caused by ships passing around the hydrophone by contrast fig 3c and d depict that no shipping signature was observed in the spectrogram for the time points indicated by arrows ③ and ④ in fig 2b in addition since the experimental area where underwater noise was observed is located 9 km away from the coast the measured signal may be contaminated due to the noise caused by the breaking surf on the shore as in the study published by wilson et al 1985 under heavy surf conditions however the wind speed observed during the experiment corresponds to low surf conditions the noise caused by breaking surf on the shore is not large enough to affect the measured signal and no intermittent wave breaking events were found in fig 3c and d therefore the nls at these time points might be caused by the wind fig 2c presents the mean and standard deviation of the extracted nls 500 hz by separating the shipping noise through visual inspection during the entire acoustic experiment the averaged nls at 500 hz excluding shipping noise were distributed within 45 72 db over time the average of the standard deviations at all points was estimated as 5 6 db which means that the extracted nls could be affected by random and natural noise sources abbot et al 2002 as shown in fig 2c the nl changes by more than 30 db despite the absence of shipping noise in conclusion wind noise can affect nls within the frequency range of 500 hz 1 khz therefore the variation in the nls fig 2c can be ascribed to the fluctuations in the wind speed around the experimental area in this study the wnls were modeled based on the measured wind speed and subsequently compared with the measured nls 2 2 weather data the local weather data were collected using a weather buoy while conducting the acoustic measurement the weather buoy was operated by the korea institute of ocean science and technology and moored close to an srh fig 1b weather information e g wind direction and wind speed and sea surface physical variables e g wave height and wave period were collected using the weather buoy solar panels supplied electrical power to the weather buoy and the measured data were transmitted continuously to the operating server in 10 min cycles the wind speed direction and wave height data are illustrated in fig 4 the wind speeds were distributed within 0 8 3 m s during the observation period fig 4a and the wind direction was mostly directed toward south 170 180 or northwest 310 330 fig 4b when the wind direction was constant the wind speeds were 2 m s or faster however this speed decreased to below 2 m s when the wind direction abruptly changed the wave heights changed with the variations in the wind speed fig 4c the wave height was higher when the wind came from the south than when it came from the northwest moreover wave heights were affected by the difference in wind drift distance which occurs depending on whether the wind direction in the experimental area is coastal or seaward in this experiment the wind blowing from the northwest was blocked by the mountain along the east coast which weakened the wind speed and shortened the wind drift distance the wind drift distance in the south was relatively long as a result the waves developed more easily when the wind blew from the south than when it blew from the northwest 3 modeling of the wind noise wnls were modeled using the wind speed data measured at the weather buoy by adding the differences between sls and tls sls were calculated using the wind speeds measured during the observation period and tls were determined with respect to the sea surface noise sources using a normal mode propagation model 3 1 sl as previously mentioned breaking waves make bubble clouds in the subsurface water column when wind blows over the sea woolf 2001 farmer and vagle 1988 anguelova and huq 2012 the bubble clouds generated by wind not only exist at a single water depth but also extend from the sea surface to several meters below hanson 1993 therefore the sls should be defined considering the spatial distribution of the noise sources that are distributed vertically and horizontally below the sea level in the experimental area baseline curves of the noise source intensity were obtained from the context of wind induced sl proposed by kewley et al 1990 and shown as sl per unit area db m2 with respect to frequency and wind speed given that the sls at frequencies corresponding to wind speeds of 2 57 5 14 10 28 15 23 and 20 58 m s were provided in the work of kewley et al 1990 interpolation was applied for other wind speeds to calculate the spatial distribution of sls caused by wind the distance from the hydrophone location was divided into 10 m intervals up to 100 km and the direction was divided into grids in 5 intervals up to 360 starting from the north subsequently the spatially distributed sls sl a below the sea surface were calculated by considering the area of each spatial grid corresponding to the depth at which bubble clouds exists an example of sl a at a frequency of 500 hz and wind speed of 5 m s is shown in fig 5 a as the area of the grid increased with distance from the hydrophone the sl a of the corresponding grid increased 3 2 tl the calculation for the wnls in the study area using the spatially distributed noise source intensity must consider the tls between each source patch and a receiver point the tls from the location of a sound source to the receiver were calculated using a kraken normal mode program which can consider a range dependent environment by applying the adiabatic approximation jensen 1982 porter 2001 jensen et al 2011 in addition reciprocity theorem was applied to the tl from the receiver to each source area to achieve computational efficiency carey and evans 2011 to obtain the basic input data for the acoustic model the range dependent bathymetry etopo1 fig 1a distributed at 1 arc min intervals and provided by the national geophysical data center ngdc was used as the water depth at the sea bottom amante and eakins 2009 the conductivity temperature depth data provided by the korea oceanographic data center kodc were used to obtain the vertical sound speed profile of the study area fig 1c on the basis of the previously obtained bottom sediment database the bottom composition of the experimental area where the receiver was deployed was mostly composed of sand in the present study the mean grain size of sand m z was classified based on the distribution from 1 φ to 4 φ which were set as the lower and upper limits respectively the sediment velocity density and attenuation coefficients were derived using geoacoustic relationships with the mean grain size jackson and richardson 2007 and these estimates was used as the input for the acoustic model fig 5b shows the tls frequency 500 hz at a water depth of 3 m within 100 km from the hydrophone the mean grain size of the sediment was set as 1 φ the tl was determined by setting the depth of the source i e where the hydrophone was deployed and estimated for the same grid of sl a as 70 m the tls propagating in the coastal and isobath directions were relatively higher than those propagating in the deep sea direction this phenomenon occurred because the depth of the seabed in both directions is low so the number of reflections at the interface increases and the transmission of sound waves in these directions increases the energy reduction due to the bottom loss caused by multiple reflections 3 3 wind driven nl the wnl at the receiver point can be calculated as the incoherent sum of the difference between the spatial distribution of sl a and the tls that change with wind speed the resulting wnl can be obtained as equation1 w n l τ ω 10 log 10 n 1 n m 1 m l 1 l 10 s l a τ ω γ n θ m z l t l τ ω γ n θ m z l 10 where w n l denotes the wind noise level at the receiver point s l a is the sl for each grid area t l is the transmission loss τ is the time ω is the angular frequency γ is the distance θ represents the direction z is the depth of the noise source and n m and l are the distance direction and depth indices respectively the bubble cloud i e noise source was considered not to exist only at a specific depth by wind but to possess a specific thickness to calculate wnl using equation 1 a plurality of summations for the depth of the thickness layer of the bubble cloud is required hanson 1993 proposed a fitting curve equation by measuring the depth of the bubble clouds based on wind speed using this equation the depth of the bubble cloud at the measured wind speed in the experimental area was calculated to be 2 4 m s l a was assumed constant at each depth and the tl for calculating wnl was modeled at 1 m intervals up to the depth of the bubble cloud on the basis of the curves of the wind generated sl below 1 khz presented by kewley et al 1990 the wnls were modeled with respect to time at frequencies of 500 630 800 and 1000 hz using the wind speeds measured during the observation period wnls below 500 hz were considered contaminated by distant shipping noise and therefore excluded from the analysis the modeled wnls in the frequency band of interest were then compared to those measured in the experimental area 4 results and discussions as previously stated in the previous section the wnls modeled based on the observed wind speed data and those measured using the hydrophone were compared at 500 630 800 and 1000 hz which are the center frequencies of the 1 3 octave band fig 6 for each frequency result the wnls modeled at a mean grain size of 1 φ which is a hard seabed are 4 4 3 8 3 6 and 3 5 db higher than those modeled at 4 φ the measured wnl converges with the modeled one at the mean grain size within 1 4 φ however several inconsistencies are observed in the modeled and measured wnls the values of the latter at all frequencies are lower than those of the former from 22 00 on april 21 to 02 00 on april 22 utc 09 00 the reason for such discrepancy is the weak sea wave formation which is caused by the relatively low wind speed and rapidly changing wind direction during that period fig 4 as a result of these conditions the breaking waves that form bubble clouds did not sufficiently develop in the subsurface the south wind continues to blow from 07 00 on april 22 to 14 00 on april 25 fig 4 this condition is beneficial for the sea waves in the study area and the resulting breaking waves generate the desired noise in the sea during this period the trends of the modeled and measured wnl are similar fig 6 the wnl measured at 500 hz is equal to the wnl modeled at 1 φ as the frequency increases the wnls measured at other frequencies gradually match the wnl modeled at 4 φ the difference between the modeled and measured wnls can be attributed to the following reasons first the concept of wind induced sl per unit area as a function of frequency kewley et al 1990 is only suitable at wind speeds of 2 6 5 1 10 3 15 2 and 20 6 m s interpolation was performed on the basis of measured wind speed values to calculate the sl based on the wind speed fig 4a measured by the weather buoy this calculation process is a method for estimating the approximate value which can cause small errors in the modeled wnl second the depths of the noise sources in the research region when the wnls were modeled are set as 2 4 m which is the value obtained by hanson 1993 if the wave height is several meters high fig 4c the depth of the noise source applied in the model may be different from the actual one in addition the bubble clouds generated by the breaking waves will not be distributed at a constant depth therefore the water depth of noise sources in oceans may differ from this value moreover errors may occur because of the difference between the water depth of the model and that of real noise sources lastly errors might be present in the calculated tls due to the differences between the actual ocean conditions and the parameters inputted to the acoustic propagation model the results show that the variation in the wnls modeled based on the mean grain size of the sediment in the frequency band of interest ranges from 3 5 to 4 4 db if the input parameters are based on the actual environmental conditions the discrepancies can be greatly reduced kodc 5 summary and conclusion in this study wnls were modeled using wind speed observations to model the wnls the wind noise source intensity level curves per unit area proposed by kewley et al 1990 was applied to estimate the baseline sls based on wind speed the tls from each source patch area to the hydrophone for water depths of 2 4 m were calculated using a propagation model kraken the wnls were determined by incoherently summing the differences in sls and tls in terms of distance direction and bubble cloud depth several uncertainties in the approximately interpolated sls depth of actual noise source and ocean conditions induced differences between the measured and modeled wnls in most of the modeling issues for indirect understanding of the real ocean a practically difficult problem stems from trying to model natural phenomena without reflecting all the information about the real ocean which changes in time and space in this paper the application of the interpolation to sl according to the wind speed and the modeling parameters derived from the observation based empirical equation are uncertainty factors that affect the results nevertheless in order to scientifically interpret the natural phenomena that change spatiotemporally by applying the modeling technique it is considered desirable to have an approach to reduce uncertainty by constructing model input data using minimum assumptions and available marine environment data in particular in studies comparing measured and modeled results it is necessary to present a significant amount of statistical change in the measured results in order to trust the uncertainty of the modeled results although the modeled wnls demonstrated discrepancies in some intervals compared with the measured ones the change in the former ranged within 5 6 db of the standard deviation of the latter and the trends of the change over time were in good agreement therefore the proposed method can be used to estimate wnls the results can be improved by addressing the previously enumerated issues in the future study ship and wind noises will be modeled together based on weather and ship navigation data and comparative analysis will be performed on the measured acoustic data credit

vertical line array deployed at deep ocean sites in the northeast pacific ocean chapman and cornish 1993 farrokhrooz et al 2017 these nls are affected by the intensity of the noise source in the subsurface that is the source level sl and the magnitude of the nl are determined in accordance with the physical and geophysical properties of the region of interest several experimental studies measured the sl of local wind noise in deep and shallow waters using the directional characteristics of a vertical line array and a bottom mounted hydrophone respectively burgess and kewley 1983 kuperman and ferla 1985 schmidt and kuperman 1988 combining the abovementioned results with the findings of other researchers kewley et al 1990 established the wind induced sl as a function of frequency 0 1 3000 hz carey and evans 2011 conducted a numerical modeling of wind driven ambient noise on the basis of the bearing and elevation angles for the spatially distributed wind noise sources in the gulf of alaska however few studies analyze and verify the reliability of the results of previous studies through the direct comparison of the modeled wind nl and the nl based on the observed wind speed in the sea therefore modeling the spatiotemporal nl at sea with consideration of the oceanographic characteristics of a specific region of interest based on observed wind speed data is necessary the objective of this study is to quantitatively compare and evaluate the observed nl against the estimated wind driven nl wnl by applying an acoustic modeling method based on the wind speed data obtained from a weather buoy in the coastal waters of the korean east sea to estimate the wnl the sls that depend on the wind speed and depth distribution of bubble clouds should be considered as a source of sea surface noise the wind dependent sls as a function of frequency were estimated by applying the measured wind speed data to the sl curves based on the analysis of kewley et al 1990 hanson 1993 reported that bubble clouds which are the major source of wind noise were distributed several meters below sea surface the wind speed measured using the weather buoy was applied to the empirical formula presented by hanson 1993 the depth of the bubble cloud distribution during the experiment was 2 4 m in the present study the spatial distribution of bubble clouds below sea surface was regarded as the depth of the integral section of sl for wnl estimation furthermore a normal mode acoustic propagation model was used to calculate the transmission loss tl of the sound transmitted from the spatially distributed noise source below the surface to a hydrophone location jensen et al 2011 the wnls at the receiver point were modeled by incoherently summing the differences between the sls and tls in terms of distance direction and source depths to verify the proposed method for modeling wnl based on wind speed the results were compared with measured nls at frequencies of 500 630 800 and 1000 hz in accordance with time changes this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the field measurements of the acoustic and meteorological data of the study site section 3 presents the methodology for estimating wnls using wind speed information section 4 discusses the observed acoustic data and the modeling results as well as the differences in such results section 5 provides the summary and conclusion 2 field measurements 2 1 acoustic recordings an acoustic experiment was conducted which involves recording underwater noises by mooring a self recording hydrophone srh in water from april 20 27 2018 south korea local time utc 09 00 to measure the changes in the ambient nls based on the wind speed in the ocean the hydrophone was moored approximately 9 km latitude 37 0558 n longitude 129 5174 e from the port of jukbyeon in the east coast of south korea at a depth of 135 m red dot in fig 1 a and deployed at a depth of 70 m which was within the mid depth of the total water column fig 1b the depth distribution around the experimental area had a well developed isobath lines along the coast continental shelves existed up to 300 m and the continental slope extended to approximately 2000 m an sm3m wildlife acoustics inc maynard ma submersible recorder was used to measure the ambient noise the hydrophone mounted on the recorder was manufactured by high tech inc long beach ms which has a receiving voltage sensitivity of approximately 165 4 db re 1 v μpa at frequencies of 100 hz 10 khz the sm3m was set to measure 5 min for every 10 min intervals duty cycle 50 with a received gain of 12 db and a sampling frequency of 24 khz fig 2 a shows a spectrogram frequency of interest below 1 2 khz of ambient noise established using the acoustic data measured during the experimental period the power spectral density in db re 1 μpa2 hz of individual time series segments with a duration of 1 s was calculated by applying a 24 000 point fourier transform with a 50 window overlap using a rectangular window the spectrogram was derived by averaging the power spectral density of 300 s intermittent shipping noise in the entire spectrogram caused a rapid occurrence of broadband acoustic energy some of which spanned the entire frequency range the spectral energy of shipping noise was mostly concentrated in the frequency range below 200 hz the power spectral density at 500 hz was extracted to confirm the change in the nls with time fig 2b in this frequency nls were distributed within 45 86 db during the observation period and the average value over the measured period was 69 1 db continuous ship activities occur in the experimental area for instances small fishing boats leave and return to jukbyeon port and commercial ships travel back and forth between the southern region of south korea and the port of donghae previous research results showed that the underwater noise data measured in the ocean include the shipping noise that depends on the presence or absence of ships merchant et al 2012 bassett et al 2012 to obtain the desired results the noise periods contaminated by shipping noise were removed from the measured noise field subsequently the extracted nls and modeled wnls were compared fig 3 a and b shows the 5 min spectrograms of the acoustic data arrows ① and ② in fig 2b indicate the relatively high nl peaks broadband interference patterns typically occur when the ship passes the hydrophone mckenna et al 2012 brooker and humphrey 2016 peng et al 2018 the nl peaks in fig 2b were mostly caused by ships passing around the hydrophone by contrast fig 3c and d depict that no shipping signature was observed in the spectrogram for the time points indicated by arrows ③ and ④ in fig 2b in addition since the experimental area where underwater noise was observed is located 9 km away from the coast the measured signal may be contaminated due to the noise caused by the breaking surf on the shore as in the study published by wilson et al 1985 under heavy surf conditions however the wind speed observed during the experiment corresponds to low surf conditions the noise caused by breaking surf on the shore is not large enough to affect the measured signal and no intermittent wave breaking events were found in fig 3c and d therefore the nls at these time points might be caused by the wind fig 2c presents the mean and standard deviation of the extracted nls 500 hz by separating the shipping noise through visual inspection during the entire acoustic experiment the averaged nls at 500 hz excluding shipping noise were distributed within 45 72 db over time the average of the standard deviations at all points was estimated as 5 6 db which means that the extracted nls could be affected by random and natural noise sources abbot et al 2002 as shown in fig 2c the nl changes by more than 30 db despite the absence of shipping noise in conclusion wind noise can affect nls within the frequency range of 500 hz 1 khz therefore the variation in the nls fig 2c can be ascribed to the fluctuations in the wind speed around the experimental area in this study the wnls were modeled based on the measured wind speed and subsequently compared with the measured nls 2 2 weather data the local weather data were collected using a weather buoy while conducting the acoustic measurement the weather buoy was operated by the korea institute of ocean science and technology and moored close to an srh fig 1b weather information e g wind direction and wind speed and sea surface physical variables e g wave height and wave period were collected using the weather buoy solar panels supplied electrical power to the weather buoy and the measured data were transmitted continuously to the operating server in 10 min cycles the wind speed direction and wave height data are illustrated in fig 4 the wind speeds were distributed within 0 8 3 m s during the observation period fig 4a and the wind direction was mostly directed toward south 170 180 or northwest 310 330 fig 4b when the wind direction was constant the wind speeds were 2 m s or faster however this speed decreased to below 2 m s when the wind direction abruptly changed the wave heights changed with the variations in the wind speed fig 4c the wave height was higher when the wind came from the south than when it came from the northwest moreover wave heights were affected by the difference in wind drift distance which occurs depending on whether the wind direction in the experimental area is coastal or seaward in this experiment the wind blowing from the northwest was blocked by the mountain along the east coast which weakened the wind speed and shortened the wind drift distance the wind drift distance in the south was relatively long as a result the waves developed more easily when the wind blew from the south than when it blew from the northwest 3 modeling of the wind noise wnls were modeled using the wind speed data measured at the weather buoy by adding the differences between sls and tls sls were calculated using the wind speeds measured during the observation period and tls were determined with respect to the sea surface noise sources using a normal mode propagation model 3 1 sl as previously mentioned breaking waves make bubble clouds in the subsurface water column when wind blows over the sea woolf 2001 farmer and vagle 1988 anguelova and huq 2012 the bubble clouds generated by wind not only exist at a single water depth but also extend from the sea surface to several meters below hanson 1993 therefore the sls should be defined considering the spatial distribution of the noise sources that are distributed vertically and horizontally below the sea level in the experimental area baseline curves of the noise source intensity were obtained from the context of wind induced sl proposed by kewley et al 1990 and shown as sl per unit area db m2 with respect to frequency and wind speed given that the sls at frequencies corresponding to wind speeds of 2 57 5 14 10 28 15 23 and 20 58 m s were provided in the work of kewley et al 1990 interpolation was applied for other wind speeds to calculate the spatial distribution of sls caused by wind the distance from the hydrophone location was divided into 10 m intervals up to 100 km and the direction was divided into grids in 5 intervals up to 360 starting from the north subsequently the spatially distributed sls sl a below the sea surface were calculated by considering the area of each spatial grid corresponding to the depth at which bubble clouds exists an example of sl a at a frequency of 500 hz and wind speed of 5 m s is shown in fig 5 a as the area of the grid increased with distance from the hydrophone the sl a of the corresponding grid increased 3 2 tl the calculation for the wnls in the study area using the spatially distributed noise source intensity must consider the tls between each source patch and a receiver point the tls from the location of a sound source to the receiver were calculated using a kraken normal mode program which can consider a range dependent environment by applying the adiabatic approximation jensen 1982 porter 2001 jensen et al 2011 in addition reciprocity theorem was applied to the tl from the receiver to each source area to achieve computational efficiency carey and evans 2011 to obtain the basic input data for the acoustic model the range dependent bathymetry etopo1 fig 1a distributed at 1 arc min intervals and provided by the national geophysical data center ngdc was used as the water depth at the sea bottom amante and eakins 2009 the conductivity temperature depth data provided by the korea oceanographic data center kodc were used to obtain the vertical sound speed profile of the study area fig 1c on the basis of the previously obtained bottom sediment database the bottom composition of the experimental area where the receiver was deployed was mostly composed of sand in the present study the mean grain size of sand m z was classified based on the distribution from 1 φ to 4 φ which were set as the lower and upper limits respectively the sediment velocity density and attenuation coefficients were derived using geoacoustic relationships with the mean grain size jackson and richardson 2007 and these estimates was used as the input for the acoustic model fig 5b shows the tls frequency 500 hz at a water depth of 3 m within 100 km from the hydrophone the mean grain size of the sediment was set as 1 φ the tl was determined by setting the depth of the source i e where the hydrophone was deployed and estimated for the same grid of sl a as 70 m the tls propagating in the coastal and isobath directions were relatively higher than those propagating in the deep sea direction this phenomenon occurred because the depth of the seabed in both directions is low so the number of reflections at the interface increases and the transmission of sound waves in these directions increases the energy reduction due to the bottom loss caused by multiple reflections 3 3 wind driven nl the wnl at the receiver point can be calculated as the incoherent sum of the difference between the spatial distribution of sl a and the tls that change with wind speed the resulting wnl can be obtained as equation1 w n l τ ω 10 log 10 n 1 n m 1 m l 1 l 10 s l a τ ω γ n θ m z l t l τ ω γ n θ m z l 10 where w n l denotes the wind noise level at the receiver point s l a is the sl for each grid area t l is the transmission loss τ is the time ω is the angular frequency γ is the distance θ represents the direction z is the depth of the noise source and n m and l are the distance direction and depth indices respectively the bubble cloud i e noise source was considered not to exist only at a specific depth by wind but to possess a specific thickness to calculate wnl using equation 1 a plurality of summations for the depth of the thickness layer of the bubble cloud is required hanson 1993 proposed a fitting curve equation by measuring the depth of the bubble clouds based on wind speed using this equation the depth of the bubble cloud at the measured wind speed in the experimental area was calculated to be 2 4 m s l a was assumed constant at each depth and the tl for calculating wnl was modeled at 1 m intervals up to the depth of the bubble cloud on the basis of the curves of the wind generated sl below 1 khz presented by kewley et al 1990 the wnls were modeled with respect to time at frequencies of 500 630 800 and 1000 hz using the wind speeds measured during the observation period wnls below 500 hz were considered contaminated by distant shipping noise and therefore excluded from the analysis the modeled wnls in the frequency band of interest were then compared to those measured in the experimental area 4 results and discussions as previously stated in the previous section the wnls modeled based on the observed wind speed data and those measured using the hydrophone were compared at 500 630 800 and 1000 hz which are the center frequencies of the 1 3 octave band fig 6 for each frequency result the wnls modeled at a mean grain size of 1 φ which is a hard seabed are 4 4 3 8 3 6 and 3 5 db higher than those modeled at 4 φ the measured wnl converges with the modeled one at the mean grain size within 1 4 φ however several inconsistencies are observed in the modeled and measured wnls the values of the latter at all frequencies are lower than those of the former from 22 00 on april 21 to 02 00 on april 22 utc 09 00 the reason for such discrepancy is the weak sea wave formation which is caused by the relatively low wind speed and rapidly changing wind direction during that period fig 4 as a result of these conditions the breaking waves that form bubble clouds did not sufficiently develop in the subsurface the south wind continues to blow from 07 00 on april 22 to 14 00 on april 25 fig 4 this condition is beneficial for the sea waves in the study area and the resulting breaking waves generate the desired noise in the sea during this period the trends of the modeled and measured wnl are similar fig 6 the wnl measured at 500 hz is equal to the wnl modeled at 1 φ as the frequency increases the wnls measured at other frequencies gradually match the wnl modeled at 4 φ the difference between the modeled and measured wnls can be attributed to the following reasons first the concept of wind induced sl per unit area as a function of frequency kewley et al 1990 is only suitable at wind speeds of 2 6 5 1 10 3 15 2 and 20 6 m s interpolation was performed on the basis of measured wind speed values to calculate the sl based on the wind speed fig 4a measured by the weather buoy this calculation process is a method for estimating the approximate value which can cause small errors in the modeled wnl second the depths of the noise sources in the research region when the wnls were modeled are set as 2 4 m which is the value obtained by hanson 1993 if the wave height is several meters high fig 4c the depth of the noise source applied in the model may be different from the actual one in addition the bubble clouds generated by the breaking waves will not be distributed at a constant depth therefore the water depth of noise sources in oceans may differ from this value moreover errors may occur because of the difference between the water depth of the model and that of real noise sources lastly errors might be present in the calculated tls due to the differences between the actual ocean conditions and the parameters inputted to the acoustic propagation model the results show that the variation in the wnls modeled based on the mean grain size of the sediment in the frequency band of interest ranges from 3 5 to 4 4 db if the input parameters are based on the actual environmental conditions the discrepancies can be greatly reduced kodc 5 summary and conclusion in this study wnls were modeled using wind speed observations to model the wnls the wind noise source intensity level curves per unit area proposed by kewley et al 1990 was applied to estimate the baseline sls based on wind speed the tls from each source patch area to the hydrophone for water depths of 2 4 m were calculated using a propagation model kraken the wnls were determined by incoherently summing the differences in sls and tls in terms of distance direction and bubble cloud depth several uncertainties in the approximately interpolated sls depth of actual noise source and ocean conditions induced differences between the measured and modeled wnls in most of the modeling issues for indirect understanding of the real ocean a practically difficult problem stems from trying to model natural phenomena without reflecting all the information about the real ocean which changes in time and space in this paper the application of the interpolation to sl according to the wind speed and the modeling parameters derived from the observation based empirical equation are uncertainty factors that affect the results nevertheless in order to scientifically interpret the natural phenomena that change spatiotemporally by applying the modeling technique it is considered desirable to have an approach to reduce uncertainty by constructing model input data using minimum assumptions and available marine environment data in particular in studies comparing measured and modeled results it is necessary to present a significant amount of statistical change in the measured results in order to trust the uncertainty of the modeled results although the modeled wnls demonstrated discrepancies in some intervals compared with the measured ones the change in the former ranged within 5 6 db of the standard deviation of the latter and the trends of the change over time were in good agreement therefore the proposed method can be used to estimate wnls the results can be improved by addressing the previously enumerated issues in the future study ship and wind noises will be modeled together based on weather and ship navigation data and comparative analysis will be performed on the measured acoustic data credit

21007,in this paper consideration was given to the numerical prediction of free surface wave behavior in trapezoidal open channels the mac cormack scheme was implemented for the numerical discretization of the 1 d extended st venant equations based on the prandtl power law as a momentum correction coefficient to verify the validity of the used numerical technique the computed results were compared with experimental data and alternative numerical solutions quoted in the literature these comparisons demonstrated that the results issued from the discretization of the 1 d extended st venant equations led to a more realistic description of the wave behavior than the ones obtained from the discretization of the 1 d conventional st venant equations furthermore the results obtained by the developed numerical solver agreed well with those obtained by the finite element method however the former solver was more advantageous than the latter with regard to computational time saving the test cases addressed the trapezoidal particular shape of the open channel cross section the findings highlighted that the adequate selection of the geometric characteristics of the open channel cross section could improve significantly the efficiency of these structures particularly results demonstrated that the selection of an optimum side slope of the trapezoidal cross section led to a maximum flow rate while preserving a low value of the wetted cross section area keywords extended st venant equations mac cormack open channel optimal hydraulic section prandtl power law transient trapezoidal

attractive topic for scientists and engineers seeing its great importance in conveying water for human living for exemplification purposes fig 1 a and b elucidate a photographed hydropower plant sayano shushenskay and an irrigation canal respectively chaudhry 2008 the geometric shape of the irrigation canals is an important design parameter for an open channel construction in this regard pioneering research evoked interest in the parabolic cross section shape of open channels and canals e g mahmood and yevjevich 1975 mironenko et al 1984 loganathan 1991 froehlich 1994 2008 han et al 2017 katopodes 2019 in fact canals with parabolic cross section shapes are quite similar to natural channels however this section shape is not widely accepted in the construction of artificial canals due to design difficulties mironenko et al 1984 incidentally channel cross section optimization for hydraulic efficiency is another important task in the design stage of canals and open channels in particular the best hydraulic section of open channel is an important parameter for open channel design specifically referring to the manning equation for a given canal feature i e roughness coefficient bed slope and flow area the best hydraulic section corresponds to a maximum discharge value under a minimum flow area value easa 2009 yan cheng et al 2017 for example the best hydraulic section of a rectangular channel corresponds to a half square while the best hydraulic section of a trapezoidal channel corresponds to a half hexagon jain 2004 in this respect it is worth delineating that the best hydraulic sections are not equally efficient douglas et al 2001 in particular the best hydraulic section of the trapezoidal cross section case is more efficient than the case involved by a rectangular cross section precisely for a given flow rate the former case provides less important values of the flow area and wetted perimeter than the latter incidentally a semicircular cross section shape proves to be the most efficient despite presenting difficulties in the actual construction of man made canals to overcome these difficulties the semicircular shape can be assumed as a composite cross section consisting of a lower trapezoidal section and an upper rectangular one from a numerical standpoint the unsteady free surface flow which takes place in natural or man made rivers is usually considered as being a complex physical and environmental process chaudhry 2008 szymkiewicz 2010 these complexities arise from i the adequate selection of the correct mathematical model to describe the physical flow processes and ii the numerical tool used to solve the derived model numerous texts relating to the numerical and experimental treatment of surge wave propagation in free surface flows are summarized in the literature predictions of free surface flows have been widely based on the one dimensional st venant equations hereby referred to as the conventional st venant equations 1d sveqs this model has commonly been applied in long rivers and open channels with additional equations for hydraulic structures thanks to its computational efficiency soares frazão and zech 2008 toro 2004 ata et al 2013 however the 1d sveqs are no longer relevant in modeling fast transients and high pulsating frequency flows such as water hammer and resonance phenomena since this model is based on the assumption of a cross sectional hydrostatic distribution of pressure favre treske 1994 prüser and zielek 1994 argued the need for further research to assess the potential impact of vertical velocity variation that might arise from these fast transients indeed the latter requires a more accurate representation of the vertical velocity distribution in order to address these shortcomings several unsteady formulations were developed by boussinesq treske 1994 who added extra terms to the saint venant momentum equation assuming a linear distribution of the vertical velocity profile from zero at the bottom of the channel until it reaches a maximum at the free surface gharangik and chaudry 1991 triki 2014a 2016 2017 2021 he subsequently performed a more realistic model referred to as the extended st venant equations 1d esveqs using a momentum correction factor to improve the representation of the vertical velocity distribution in fast transient flow problems chow 1959 the momentum correction factor collectively called the boussinesq momentum coefficient is evaluated theoretically in order to use accurately the cross section averaged velocity in the momentum equations of unidirectional flow besides chen 1991 developed a complete analysis of the velocity distribution coefficient in open channel and pressurized pipe flows with reference to flow resistance he 1992 also demonstrated that for practice cases the velocity distribution coefficient could be derived from a laminar flow equation for the laminar flow regimes and the prandtl power law velocity distribution expressed in terms of the darcy weisbach resistance coefficient for turbulent flow regimes as regards the numerical solution of 1d esveqs first and second order numerical schemes yield satisfactory solutions for gradually varied flow equations fennema and chaudhry 1986 1987 shirkhani et al 2016 seyedashraf et al 2017a b 2018 shobeyri and rasti ardakani 2019 chahartaghi et al 2019 mnassri and triki 2020a zhang et al 2015 however equations describing a rapidly varied flow have third order terms therefore it is necessary to employ third or higher order accurate methods in order to provide an acceptable solution for the boussinesq equations and thereby to capture correctly the discontinuities involved in the rapidly varied flow regime framework as noted by abbott fennema and chaudhry 1986 1987 considerable effort must be expended to reduce the truncation errors introduced in the finite difference approximation of these terms in this regard previous investigations of the author addressed galerkin finite element based algorithms using single and multiple grid techniques the author showed that the finite element method based algorithm triki 2011 a b 2014 a b c 2016 b seyedashraf et al 2017a b 2018a b mnassri et al 2019 mnassri and triki 2020b requires a significant number of discretization points to avoid numerical oscillations due to the dissipative aspect of this method alternatively triki 2011 2013 2014 a 2016 b addressed an alternative algorithm based on a multiple grid discretization of the open channel to reduce the number of grid points accordingly the main objective of this study is to implement the mac cormack scheme which is second order accurate in time and space explicit finite difference schemes to discretize the extended st venant equations the investigation addresses the particular case of the trapezoidal cross sectioned open channel as being both a quite efficient shape of the best hydraulic section and also quite simple for practical construction this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the one dimensional extended st venant equations 1d esveqs which govern flows in open channels are presented along with the numerical discretization steps using the mac cormack scheme the validation of the numerical solver is also reported in this section in section 3 numerical examples are investigated to highlight the benefit of the proposed solver ultimately section 4 enumerates the concluding remarks of this study 2 2 methodology as pointed out in the introduction the one dimensional conventional st venant equations are based on the assumption of a hydrostatic distribution of the cross sectional pressure this approximation can be done if the vertical velocity profiles in the unsteady flow do not differ significantly from the one corresponding to the uniform flow if instead a noticeable difference exists fig 2 two effects will simultaneously arise i the inertial forces could not be valued referring only to the mean flow velocity and ii the wall friction stress would be different from the corresponding one in the steady state regime therefore it would be more appropriate to rewrite the momentum equation of the one dimensional free surface flow in a more complete form according to the model developed by chen 1991 1992 1 u t f x s in which u a q t designates the vector of hydraulic variables f

the energy correction factor in practical engineering applications a 1 6 t h prandtl power law corresponding to β 1 02 is reasonably representative of a transient distribution of the vertical velocity in smooth concrete channels chen 1992 it is interesting to point out herein that the equivalent roughness of open channels made of different material types also called the composite roughness may be estimated as a weighted average value of elementary roughness coefficients applied to the entire cross sectional perimeter as follows chow 1959 2 n e i n i 3 2 p i 2 3 p 2 3 moreover for a uniform flow regime the normal discharge corresponding to a given normal flow depth may be computed referring to manning s rule as follows 3 q η 1 n e b d z 1 z 2 d 2 2 5 3 s 0 z 1 2 1 z 2 2 1 d b 2 3 wherein η is a unit conversion constant η 1 or η 1 49 for si or cu units respectively subsequently a numerical procedure based on the mac cormack scheme is outlined to solve the 1 d sveqs 1 incidentally this scheme was recognized as being a popular numerical model to solve free surface transient flow problems thanks to its desirable attributes of accuracy and simplicity garcia navarroa et al 1992 however the dispersive property of this scheme has the disadvantage of producing spurious numerical oscillations near the steep gradients of the computed solution hence an artificial viscosity term is included in the numerical procedure to effectively dampen these numerical oscillations gharangik and chaudry 1991 and hence to overcome the aforementioned drawback of the conventional mac cormack scheme accordingly the numerical discretization of the 1 d esveqs 1 using the aforementioned technique is achieved in three steps 4 a u i u i k σ f i 1 k f i k δ t 2 s i 1 k s i k 5 b u i k 1 1 2 u i

t directions respectively and the single or double over bars pertain to the computed values in prediction and correction steps respectively it should be noted that steps a and b relate to the conventional mc cormack scheme while step c is a flux updating step used to dampen superior oscillations arising from the former steps incidentally in order to ensure the stability of the numerical solution the time step value is determined according to the courant friedrichs lewy criterion gharangik and chaudhry 1991 ultimately the stability condition of the 2 4 dissipative scheme is ensured basing on the courant friedrichs lewy criterion 8 δ t c r δ x max u c in which c r denotes the courant friedrichs lewy number cfl and c g d designates the celerity free surface wave in the following the numerical solver outlined above is validated against experimental observations quoted by gharangik and chaudhry 1991 the experimental apparatus investigated by these authors gharangik and chaudhry 1991 was composed of a horizontal rectangular flume supplied through a sharp edged sluice gate by a constant head tank and discharging under a downstream sluice gate the initial flow regime corresponds to a gradually varied regime characterized by a flow velocity value u x l 3 831 m s the transient regime involving a hydraulic jump is induced and adjusted by the downstream sluice gate

solvers this figure suggests that in the location close to the hydraulic jump the computed free surface profiles are located downstream of the observed one in this respect a slight shift is depicted between the observed signal and the computed one using the extended st venant model based mccormack scheme nonetheless a much more important shift is noticed between the observed signal and the computed one using the conventional st venant model based mccormack solver according to gharangik and chaudhry 1991 the shift between the free surface profiles computed based on the conventional and extended st venant models is mainly attributed to the non hydrostatic pressure distribution across the wetted area of the open channel cross section in the prediction on the other hand in the region far from the hydraulic jump fig 3 shows an agreement between the computed results obtained basing on the conventional and extended st venant equations this result suggests the validity of the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution in the regions of gradually varied regimes 3 3applications results and discussion 3 1 3 1case 1 the first test case fig 4 entails a trapezoidal open channel supplied by an upstream reservoir and delivering q 0 40 m 3 s to the head works of a hydroelectric power plant wylie et al 1993 triki 2014 a mnasri et al 2019 the main characteristics of the channel are length l 1500 m width b 10 m side slope z 0 5 h 1 v manning roughness n 0 016 and bottom slope s 0 0 0002 initially the flow regime in the channel is uniform corresponding to a normal flow depth value equal to d 0 2 8 m in this respect it is interesting to delineate that the normal discharge value may be determined according to manning s rule 3 9 q 0 η d 0 b d 0 z 5 3 s 0 n b d 0 2 1 z

a stationary flow regime at the reservoir level this transient condition may be coded as follows 10 d x 0 u x 0 2 2 g d r i f u x 0 0 e l s e d x 0 d r wherein d r designates the reservoir level above the channel bottom for such a transient case with zero initial flow in the system i e q 1 0 the discharge is increased linearly to the full flow rate value q f 40 m s 3 during t f 2 mn in other words the flow rate at the channel outlet may be expressed as 11 q q 1 q f q 1 t t f i f 0 t t f e l s e q q f f o r t t f as regards the mc cormack scheme calculations have been performed using a time step value δ t 0 1 s a number of grid points equal to n 100 and a courant number value c r 0 89 fig 5 a b and c display respectively the depth velocity and discharge signals versus time computed at different cross sections of the open channel jointly fig 6 illustrates the profiles of the free surface levels plotted at different time steps in general these curves reflect successive cycles of wave propagation and reflection mechanisms initiated by the shutdown event of the hydraulic power plant furthermore the figure indicates that this transient event induces a fluvial flow regime across the open channel precisely the free surface wave behavior may be described as follows following the shutdown event a negative free surface wave propagating upstream is developed across the open channel in this regard fig 5 a indicates that the depth at the downstream extremity first decreases linearly and rapidly to the depth value d x l 120 s 2 3 m during the shutdown event i e t f 120 s and then decreases until reaching the depth crest value d x l t 500 s 1 8 m during δ t 500 120 380 s meanwhile according to fig 5 b the velocity signal at the downstream extremity increases linearly to the value u x l 120 s 1 6 m s during t f 120 s and then increases until reaching the velocity peak value u x l t 500 s 2 m s during δ t 380 s it would be appropriate to note herein that the discharge signal plotted at the downstream extremity fig 5 c refers to the downstream boundary condition one recalls that the downstream discharge signal first increases linearly to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 during the shutdown event of the hydraulic power plant i e t f and subsequently remains constant at this value on this point it is worth highlighting that the first stage of the depth decrease or velocity increase characterized by a linear behavior is mainly attributed to the linear behavior of the downstream inflow while the second stage is due to water supply from the upstream reservoir on the other hand the depth signal computed at the upstream extremity remains constant at the initial value i e d 0 2 8 m during t 1 300 s while the upstream velocity and discharge signals remain null during this phase incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 60 s and t 200 s illustrated in fig 6 show a series of negative free surface waves propagating upstream with a velocity v w u g d across the open channel for example the celerity of the wave departure at t 60 s see profile corresponding to t 60 s in fig 6 is equal to v w u x l 60 s g d x l 60 s 0 63 10 2 7 4 57 m s subsequently after the reflection of the generated wave on the upstream reservoir at t 300 s a reflected negative surge wave traveling downstream is generated across the open channel specifically fig 5 a suggests that the depth signal predicted at the upstream extremity first decreases to the value d x 0 610 s 2 6 m and then remains constant at this value during the subsequent duration δ t 1170 610 560 s on the other hand the upstream velocity and discharge increase from zero to maximum values u x 0 t 610 s 1 9 m s and q x 0 610 s 53 m s 3 respectively and then remain constant during δ t 560 s fig 5 b and c conjointly the downstream depth signal rises from d x l 500 s 1 8 m to d x l 1380 s 2 8 m during δ t 1380 500 880 s inversely fig 5 c suggests that the velocity signals computed at the downstream extremity decrease from u x l 500 s 2 03 m s to u x l 1380 s 1 24 m s however the discharge signal remains constant equal to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 400 s and t 550 s shown in fig 6 illustrate a series of reflected negative free surface waves traveling to the downstream of the open channel for example the celerity of the wave departure at t 400 s see profile corresponding to t 400 s in fig 6 is equal to v w u x 0 400 s g d x 0 400 s 0 89 10 2 6 5 9 m s thereafter a second negative surge wave propagating upstream is initiated at the downstream extremity of the open channel in this regard the depth signal at this extremity decreases to the value d x l 2000 s 2 5 m and inversely the velocity signal increases slightly to the value u x l 2000 s 1 25 m s one notes that the discharge remains constant equal to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 subsequently after a second reflection on the upstream reservoir a negative surge wave is induced at the upstream extremity of the open channel at t 1830 s in this regard the upstream depth decreases to d x 0 2400 s 2 6 m concurrently the velocity signal increases slightly to the value u x l 2400 s 1 35 m s one notes that the discharge remains constant equal to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 800 s and t 1200 s shown in fig 6 illustrate a series of reflected free surface waves traveling to the downstream extremity of the open channel for example the celerity of the wave departure at t 1200 s see profile corresponding to t 1200 s in fig 6 is equal to v w u x l 1200 s g d x l 1200 s 1 29 10 2 7 3 9 m s finally after a series of wave propagation and reflection cycles the depth reaches the depth value of the upstream reservoir see profile corresponding to t 1800 s in fig 6 similar interpretations may be reported for the wave curves plotted at the intermediate open channel cross sections x 0 2 l x 0 4 l x 0 6 l and x 0 8 l it is interesting to point out herein that the phase shifts observed between the different signals are due to the duration of wave propagation and reflection mechanisms as regards the numerical robustness of the developed numerical solver fig 7 compares the downstream depth traces issued from the extended st venant model based mccormack solver δ t 0 1 n 100 and c r 0 78 and the one obtained by triki 2014 employing the conventional st venant model based finite element solver the figure reveals a close correspondence between the two numerical results however it should be highlighted herein that the mccormack solver allows about 43 less computational time than the finite element solver developed previously by triki 2014 3 2 3 2 case 2 the second test case relates to an irrigation open channel schematized in fig 8 das 2000 the channel length is l 1500 m and the slope of the longitudinal bed is s 0 0 0016 the shape of the channel cross section is trapezoidal corresponding to the geometric dimensions bottom width b 5 826 m side slopes z 1 0 247 h 1 v and z 2 0 265 h 1 v evaluated for the optimum design discharge and depth the manning roughness values of materials used for constructing the two side slopes and bed width are n 1 0 020 n 2 0 018 and n 3 0 015 respectively initially the steady state regime is uniform i e s f s 0 corresponding to the normal flow depth values equal to d 0 4 052 m thereupon the equivalent roughness of the open channel corresponding to the initial uniform flow regime is equal to eq 3 12 n e 0 02 3 2 1 0 247 2 0 018 3

concentrated at the channel inlet for 60 min i e t f 3600 s while a uniform flow condition is maintained at the channel outlet cooley and moin 1976 triki et al 2011 a b mnassri and triki 2020 a b specifically the lateral flow rate at the channel inlet is increased linearly reaching the double of the original value i e q max 2 q 0 during the 20 first minutes i e t 1 1200 s and subsequently decreases linearly until it is equal to the initial value i e q f q 0 during the 40 additional minutes in other words the inlet flow may be expressed as 14 q l q 0 q max q 0 t t 1 i f 0 t t 1 q l q

discharge signals obtained by using the extended st venant model based mccormack scheme at different sections of the open channel jointly fig 10 illustrates the profiles of the free surface levels plotted at different time steps as per these figures the following observations may be drawn for the first cycle of free surface wave oscillation first a positive wave propagating downstream is induced during the rainfall in fact the upstream depth increases continuously due to water supply at this extremity until reaching a maximum value d x 0 t 1200 s 6 1 m during t f 1200 s conjointly the upstream velocity signal increases to the values u x l t 1200 s 1 6 m s fig 9 b on this point it is interesting to recall that the discharge signal plotted at the upstream extremity fig 5 c describes the rainfall occurring at the upstream extremity of the canal the generated positive wave is then reflected on the downstream extremity of the canal at t 310 s and induces a positive wave propagating upstream in this regard the downstream depth increases continuously to a maximum value d x l t 1870 s 5 9 m similarly the upstream velocity and discharge signal increase to the values u x l t 1870 s 3 6 m s and q x l t 1870 s 156 0 m 3 s respectively fig 9 b and c subsequently this generated wave is reflected again on the upstream extremity of the canal as a positive wave propagating downstream meanwhile the upstream discharge decreases to the initial value i e 86 54 m 3 s during t 2400 s consequently the depth decreases until reaching the initial value i e d x 0 t 1870 s 4 5 m on the other hand the velocity signal first decreases to a minimum value and subsequently increases to the value of the initial uniform flow i e u x 0 t 1870 s 4 5 m s similar interpretations may be reported for the wave curves plotted at the intermediate open channel cross sections x 0 2 l x 0 4 l x 0 6 l and x 0 8 l it is interesting to point out herein that the phase shifts observed between the different signals are due to the wave propagation duration and reflection mechanisms incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 120 s t 300 s t 900 s and t 1200 s shown in fig 10 illustrate a series of positive free surface waves propagating downstream likewise the depth corresponding to t 1600 s t 1800 s and t 3600 s shows a series of positive free surface waves traveling to the upstream extremity of the canal as a second investigation step the aforesaid channel is redesigned with side slope values corresponding to z 1 z 2 1 0 h 1 v in such a case the optimal value of the width of the channel bottom corresponds to b 3 776 m das 2000 fig 11 a b and c compare respectively the behaviors of depth velocity and discharge signals involved by the original and redesigned canals jointly table 1 lists the maximum values reached by the aforementioned signals clearly fig 11 a proves that the redesigned canal allows less important values of depth magnitudes than the original one specifically referring to table 1 the depth peaks involved by the redesigned channel at the upstream and downstream extremity are equal to d x 0 m max 5 5 m and d x l max 5 6 m respectively while their counterparts involved in the original canal are equal to d x 0m max 6 1 m and d x l max 5 5 m respectively furthermore according to fig 11 c and table 1 the redesigned canal allows more important discharge than the original one indeed the maximum discharge values allowed by the original canal at the upstream and downstream extremity are equal to q x 0 m max 173 13 m 3 s and q x l max 156 18 m 3 s respectively however more important discharge rates are involved in the redesigned canal i e q x 0 m max 280 98 m 3 s and q x l max 261 97 m 3 s hence it may be concluded that the redesigned canal allows more important discharge while providing less important free surface level 4 4 conclusion ultimately the present study illustrates that the 1 d extended st venant equations based on the prandtl power law as a momentum correction coefficient leads to a more realistic description of free surface wave behavior in trapezoidal open channels furthermore the mac cormack scheme based solver outlined in this study can be successfully applied for practical problems as an alternative to the finite element method based solver thanks to its implementation simplicity and computational time saving furthermore the findings demonstrate that the optimum side slope of the trapezoidal cross section of canals allows a maximum flow rate while preserving a low value of the wetted cross section area

21007,in this paper consideration was given to the numerical prediction of free surface wave behavior in trapezoidal open channels the mac cormack scheme was implemented for the numerical discretization of the 1 d extended st venant equations based on the prandtl power law as a momentum correction coefficient to verify the validity of the used numerical technique the computed results were compared with experimental data and alternative numerical solutions quoted in the literature these comparisons demonstrated that the results issued from the discretization of the 1 d extended st venant equations led to a more realistic description of the wave behavior than the ones obtained from the discretization of the 1 d conventional st venant equations furthermore the results obtained by the developed numerical solver agreed well with those obtained by the finite element method however the former solver was more advantageous than the latter with regard to computational time saving the test cases addressed the trapezoidal particular shape of the open channel cross section the findings highlighted that the adequate selection of the geometric characteristics of the open channel cross section could improve significantly the efficiency of these structures particularly results demonstrated that the selection of an optimum side slope of the trapezoidal cross section led to a maximum

attractive topic for scientists and engineers seeing its great importance in conveying water for human living for exemplification purposes fig 1 a and b elucidate a photographed hydropower plant sayano shushenskay and an irrigation canal respectively chaudhry 2008 the geometric shape of the irrigation canals is an important design parameter for an open channel construction in this regard pioneering research evoked interest in the parabolic cross section shape of open channels and canals e g mahmood and yevjevich 1975 mironenko et al 1984 loganathan 1991 froehlich 1994 2008 han et al 2017 katopodes 2019 in fact canals with parabolic cross section shapes are quite similar to natural channels however this section shape is not widely accepted in the construction of artificial canals due to design difficulties mironenko et al 1984 incidentally channel cross section optimization for hydraulic efficiency is another important task in the design stage of canals and open channels in particular the best hydraulic section of open channel is an important parameter for open channel design specifically referring to the manning equation for a given canal feature i e roughness coefficient bed slope and flow area the best hydraulic section corresponds to a maximum discharge value under a minimum flow area value easa 2009 yan cheng et al 2017 for example the best hydraulic section of a rectangular channel corresponds to a half square while the best hydraulic section of a trapezoidal channel corresponds to a half hexagon jain 2004 in this respect it is worth delineating that the best hydraulic sections are not equally efficient douglas et al 2001 in particular the best hydraulic section of the trapezoidal cross section case is more efficient than the case involved by a rectangular cross section precisely for a given flow rate the former case provides less important values of the flow area and wetted perimeter than the latter incidentally a semicircular cross section shape proves to be the most efficient despite presenting difficulties in the actual construction of man made canals to overcome these difficulties the semicircular shape can be assumed as a composite cross section consisting of a lower trapezoidal section and an upper rectangular one from a numerical standpoint the unsteady free surface flow which takes place in natural or man made rivers is usually considered as being a complex physical and environmental process chaudhry 2008 szymkiewicz 2010 these complexities arise from i the adequate selection of the correct mathematical model to describe the physical flow processes and ii the numerical tool used to solve the derived model numerous texts relating to the numerical and experimental treatment of surge wave propagation in free surface flows are summarized in the literature predictions of free surface flows have been widely based on the one dimensional st venant equations hereby referred to as the conventional st venant equations 1d sveqs this model has commonly been applied in long rivers and open channels with additional equations for hydraulic structures thanks to its computational efficiency soares frazão and zech 2008 toro 2004 ata et al 2013 however the 1d sveqs are no longer relevant in modeling fast transients and high pulsating frequency flows such as water hammer and resonance phenomena since this model is based on the assumption of a cross sectional hydrostatic distribution of pressure favre treske 1994 prüser and zielek 1994 argued the need for further research to assess the potential impact of vertical velocity variation that might arise from these fast transients indeed the latter requires a more accurate representation of the vertical velocity distribution in order to address these shortcomings several unsteady formulations were developed by boussinesq treske 1994 who added extra terms to the saint venant momentum equation assuming a linear distribution of the vertical velocity profile from zero at the bottom of the channel until it reaches a maximum at the free surface gharangik and chaudry 1991 triki 2014a 2016 2017 2021 he subsequently performed a more realistic model referred to as the extended st venant equations 1d esveqs using a momentum correction factor to improve the representation of the vertical velocity distribution in fast transient flow problems chow 1959 the momentum correction factor collectively called the boussinesq momentum coefficient is evaluated theoretically in order to use accurately the cross section averaged velocity in the momentum equations of unidirectional flow besides chen 1991 developed a complete analysis of the velocity distribution coefficient in open channel and pressurized pipe flows with reference to flow resistance he 1992 also demonstrated that for practice cases the velocity distribution coefficient could be derived from a laminar flow equation for the laminar flow regimes and the prandtl power law velocity distribution expressed in terms of the darcy weisbach resistance coefficient for turbulent flow regimes as regards the numerical solution of 1d esveqs first and second order numerical schemes yield satisfactory solutions for gradually varied flow equations fennema and chaudhry 1986 1987 shirkhani et al 2016 seyedashraf et al 2017a b 2018 shobeyri and rasti ardakani 2019 chahartaghi et al 2019 mnassri and triki 2020a zhang et al 2015 however equations describing a rapidly varied flow have third order terms therefore it is necessary to employ third or higher order accurate methods in order to provide an acceptable solution for the boussinesq equations and thereby to capture correctly the discontinuities involved in the rapidly varied flow regime framework as noted by abbott fennema and chaudhry 1986 1987 considerable effort must be expended to reduce the truncation errors introduced in the finite difference approximation of these terms in this regard previous investigations of the author addressed galerkin finite element based algorithms using single and multiple grid techniques the author showed that the finite element method based algorithm triki 2011 a b 2014 a b c 2016 b seyedashraf et al 2017a b 2018a b mnassri et al 2019 mnassri and triki 2020b requires a significant number of discretization points to avoid numerical oscillations due to the dissipative aspect of this method alternatively triki 2011 2013 2014 a 2016 b addressed an alternative algorithm based on a multiple grid discretization of the open channel to reduce the number of grid points accordingly the main objective of this study is to implement the mac cormack scheme which is second order accurate in time and space explicit finite difference schemes to discretize the extended st venant equations the investigation addresses the particular case of the trapezoidal cross sectioned open channel as being both a quite efficient shape of the best hydraulic section and also quite simple for practical construction this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the one dimensional extended st venant equations 1d esveqs which govern flows in open channels are presented along with the numerical discretization steps using the mac cormack scheme the validation of the numerical solver is also reported in this section in section 3 numerical examples are investigated to highlight the benefit of the proposed solver ultimately section 4 enumerates the concluding remarks of this study 2 2 methodology as pointed out in the introduction the one dimensional conventional st venant equations are based on the assumption of a hydrostatic distribution of the cross sectional pressure this approximation can be done if the vertical velocity profiles in the unsteady flow do not differ significantly from the one corresponding to the uniform flow if instead a noticeable difference exists fig 2 two effects will simultaneously arise i the inertial forces could not be valued referring only to the mean flow velocity and ii the wall friction stress would be different from the corresponding one in the steady state regime therefore it would be more appropriate to rewrite the momentum equation of the one dimensional free surface flow in a more complete form according to the model developed by chen 1991 1992 1 u t f x s in which u a q t designates the vector of hydraulic variables f

the energy correction factor in practical engineering applications a 1 6 t h prandtl power law corresponding to β 1 02 is reasonably representative of a transient distribution of the vertical velocity in smooth concrete channels chen 1992 it is interesting to point out herein that the equivalent roughness of open channels made of different material types also called the composite roughness may be estimated as a weighted average value of elementary roughness coefficients applied to the entire cross sectional perimeter as follows chow 1959 2 n e i n i 3 2 p i 2 3 p 2 3 moreover for a uniform flow regime the normal discharge corresponding to a given normal flow depth may be computed referring to manning s rule as follows 3 q η 1 n e b d z 1 z 2 d 2 2 5 3 s 0 z 1 2 1 z 2 2 1 d b 2 3 wherein η is a unit conversion constant η 1 or η 1 49 for si or cu units respectively subsequently a numerical procedure based on the mac cormack scheme is outlined to solve the 1 d sveqs 1 incidentally this scheme was recognized as being a popular numerical model to solve free surface transient flow problems thanks to its desirable attributes of accuracy and simplicity garcia navarroa et al 1992 however the dispersive property of this scheme has the disadvantage of producing spurious numerical oscillations near the steep gradients of the computed solution hence an artificial viscosity term is included in the numerical procedure to effectively dampen these numerical oscillations gharangik and chaudry 1991 and hence to overcome the aforementioned drawback of the conventional mac cormack scheme accordingly the numerical discretization of the 1 d esveqs 1 using the aforementioned technique is achieved in three steps 4 a u i u i k σ f i 1 k f i k δ t 2 s i 1 k s i k 5 b u i k 1 1 2 u i

t directions respectively and the single or double over bars pertain to the computed values in prediction and correction steps respectively it should be noted that steps a and b relate to the conventional mc cormack scheme while step c is a flux updating step used to dampen superior oscillations arising from the former steps incidentally in order to ensure the stability of the numerical solution the time step value is determined according to the courant friedrichs lewy criterion gharangik and chaudhry 1991 ultimately the stability condition of the 2 4 dissipative scheme is ensured basing on the courant friedrichs lewy criterion 8 δ t c r δ x max u c in which c r denotes the courant friedrichs lewy number cfl and c g d designates the celerity free surface wave in the following the numerical solver outlined above is validated against experimental observations quoted by gharangik and chaudhry 1991 the experimental apparatus investigated by these authors gharangik and chaudhry 1991 was composed of a horizontal rectangular flume supplied through a sharp edged sluice gate by a constant head tank and discharging under a downstream sluice gate the initial flow regime corresponds to a gradually varied regime characterized by a flow velocity value u x l 3 831 m s the transient regime involving a hydraulic jump is induced and adjusted by the downstream sluice gate fig 3 illustrates the free surface profiles obtained from experimental observation and the computed ones obtained using the one dimensional conventional or extended st venant model based mccormack solvers this figure suggests that in the location close to the hydraulic jump the computed free surface profiles are located downstream of the observed one in this respect a slight shift is depicted between the observed signal and the computed one using the extended st venant model based mccormack scheme nonetheless a much more important shift is noticed between the observed signal and the computed one using the conventional st venant model based mccormack solver according to gharangik and chaudhry 1991 the shift between the free surface profiles computed based on the conventional and extended st venant models is mainly attributed to the non hydrostatic pressure distribution across the wetted area of the open channel cross section in the prediction on the other hand in the region far from the hydraulic jump fig 3 shows an agreement between the computed results obtained basing on the conventional and extended st venant equations this result suggests the validity of the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution in the regions of gradually varied regimes 3 3applications results and discussion 3 1 3 1case 1 the first test case fig 4 entails a trapezoidal open

a stationary flow regime at the reservoir level this transient condition may be coded as follows 10 d x 0 u x 0 2 2 g d r i f u x 0 0 e l s e d x 0 d r wherein d r designates the reservoir level above the channel bottom for such a transient case with zero initial flow in the system i e q 1 0 the discharge is increased linearly to the full flow rate value q f 40 m s 3 during t f 2 mn in other words the flow rate at the channel outlet may be expressed as 11 q q 1 q f q 1 t t f i f 0 t t f e l s e q q f f o r t t f as regards the mc cormack scheme calculations have been performed using a time step value δ t 0 1 s a number of grid points equal to n 100 and a courant number value c r 0 89 fig 5 a b and c display respectively the depth velocity and discharge signals versus time computed at different cross sections of the open channel jointly fig 6 illustrates the profiles of the free surface levels plotted at different time steps in general these curves reflect successive cycles of wave propagation and reflection mechanisms initiated by the shutdown event of the hydraulic power plant furthermore the figure indicates that this transient event induces a fluvial flow regime across the open channel precisely the free surface wave behavior may be described as follows following the shutdown event a negative free surface wave propagating upstream is developed across the open channel in this regard fig 5 a indicates that the depth at the downstream extremity first decreases linearly and rapidly to the depth value d x l 120 s 2 3 m during the shutdown event i e t f 120 s and then decreases until reaching the depth crest value d x l t 500 s 1 8 m during δ t 500 120 380 s meanwhile according to fig 5 b the velocity signal at the downstream extremity increases linearly to the value u x l 120 s 1 6 m s during t f 120 s and then increases until reaching the velocity peak value u x l t 500 s 2 m s during δ t 380 s it would be appropriate to note herein that the discharge signal plotted at the downstream extremity fig 5 c refers to the downstream boundary condition one recalls that the downstream discharge signal first increases linearly to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 during the shutdown event of the hydraulic power plant i e t f and subsequently remains constant at this value on this point it is worth highlighting that the first stage of the depth decrease or velocity increase characterized by a linear behavior is mainly attributed to the linear behavior of the downstream inflow while the second stage is due to water supply from the upstream reservoir on the other hand the depth signal computed at the upstream extremity remains constant at the initial value i e d 0 2 8 m during t 1 300 s while the upstream velocity and discharge signals remain null during this phase incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 60 s and t 200 s illustrated in fig 6 show a series of negative free surface waves propagating upstream with a velocity v w u g d across the open channel for example the celerity of the wave departure at t 60 s see profile corresponding to t 60 s in fig 6 is equal to v w u x l 60 s g d x l 60 s 0 63 10 2 7 4 57 m s subsequently after the reflection of the generated wave on the upstream reservoir at t 300 s a reflected negative surge wave traveling downstream is generated across the open channel specifically fig 5 a suggests that the depth signal predicted at the upstream extremity first decreases to the value d x 0 610 s 2 6 m and then remains constant at this value during the subsequent duration δ t 1170 610 560 s on the other hand the upstream velocity and discharge increase from zero to maximum values u x 0 t 610 s 1 9 m s and q x 0 610 s 53 m s 3 respectively and then remain constant during δ t 560 s fig 5 b and c conjointly the downstream depth signal rises from d x l 500 s 1 8 m to d x l 1380 s 2 8 m during δ t 1380 500 880 s inversely fig 5 c suggests that the velocity signals computed at the downstream extremity decrease from u x l 500 s 2 03 m s to u x l 1380 s 1 24 m s however the discharge signal remains constant equal to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 400 s and t 550 s shown in fig 6 illustrate a series of reflected negative free surface waves traveling to the downstream of the open channel for example the celerity of the wave departure at t 400 s see profile corresponding to t 400 s in fig 6 is equal to v w u x 0 400 s g d x 0 400 s 0 89 10 2 6 5 9 m s thereafter a second negative surge wave propagating upstream is initiated at the downstream extremity of the open channel in this regard the depth signal at this extremity decreases to the value d x l 2000 s 2 5 m and inversely the velocity signal increases slightly to the value u x l 2000 s 1 25 m s one notes that the discharge remains constant equal to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 subsequently after a second reflection on the upstream reservoir a negative surge wave is induced at the upstream extremity of the open channel at t 1830 s in this regard the upstream depth decreases to d x 0 2400 s 2 6 m concurrently the velocity signal increases slightly to the value u x l 2400 s 1 35 m s one notes that the discharge remains constant equal to the final value i e q f 40 m s 3 incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 800 s and t 1200 s shown in fig 6 illustrate a series of reflected free surface waves traveling to the downstream extremity of the open channel for example the celerity of the wave departure at t 1200 s see profile corresponding to t 1200 s in fig 6 is equal to v w u x l 1200 s g d x l 1200 s 1 29 10 2 7 3 9 m s finally after a series of wave propagation and reflection cycles the depth reaches the depth value of the upstream reservoir see profile corresponding to t 1800 s in fig 6 similar interpretations may be reported for the wave curves plotted at the intermediate open channel cross sections x 0 2 l x 0 4 l x 0 6 l and x 0 8 l it is interesting to point out herein that the phase shifts observed between the different signals are due to the duration of wave propagation and reflection mechanisms as regards the numerical robustness of the developed numerical solver fig 7 compares the downstream depth traces issued from the extended st venant model based mccormack solver δ t 0 1 n 100 and c r 0 78 and the one obtained by triki 2014 employing the conventional st venant model based finite element solver the figure reveals a close correspondence between the two numerical results however it should be highlighted herein that the mccormack solver allows about 43 less computational time than the finite element solver developed previously by triki 2014 3 2 3 2 case 2 the second test case relates to an irrigation open channel schematized in fig 8 das 2000 the channel length is l 1500 m and the slope of the longitudinal bed is s 0 0 0016 the shape of the channel cross section is trapezoidal corresponding to the geometric dimensions bottom width b 5 826 m side slopes z 1 0 247 h 1 v and z 2 0 265 h 1 v evaluated for the optimum design discharge and depth the manning roughness values of materials used for constructing the two side slopes and bed width are n 1 0 020 n 2 0 018 and n 3 0 015 respectively initially the steady state regime is uniform i e s f s 0 corresponding to the normal flow depth values equal to d 0 4 052 m thereupon the equivalent roughness of the open channel corresponding to the initial uniform flow regime is equal to eq 3 12 n e 0 02 3 2 1 0 247 2 0 018 3

concentrated at the channel inlet for 60 min i e t f 3600 s while a uniform flow condition is maintained at the channel outlet cooley and moin 1976 triki et al 2011 a b mnassri and triki 2020 a b specifically the lateral flow rate at the channel inlet is increased linearly reaching the double of the original value i e q max 2 q 0 during the 20 first minutes i e t 1 1200 s and subsequently decreases linearly until it is equal to the initial value i e q f q 0 during the 40 additional minutes in other words the inlet flow may be expressed as 14 q l q 0 q max q 0 t t 1 i f 0 t t 1 q l q max q 0 q max t t 1 t f t 1 i f t 1 t e l s e q l 0 f o r t t f the parameters used in the mccormack based algorithm are δ t 0 1 s n 100 c r 0 89 fig 9 a b and c illustrate the depth velocity and discharge signals obtained by using the extended st venant model based mccormack scheme at different sections of the open channel jointly fig 10 illustrates the profiles of the free surface levels plotted at different time steps as per these figures the following observations may be drawn for the first cycle of free surface wave oscillation first a positive wave propagating downstream is induced during the rainfall in fact the upstream depth increases continuously due to water supply at this extremity until reaching a maximum value d x 0 t 1200 s 6 1 m during t f 1200 s conjointly the upstream velocity signal increases to the values u x l t 1200 s 1 6 m s fig 9 b on this point it is interesting to recall that the discharge signal plotted at the upstream extremity fig 5 c describes the rainfall occurring at the upstream extremity of the canal the generated positive wave is then reflected on the downstream extremity of the canal at t 310 s and induces a positive wave propagating upstream in this regard the downstream depth increases continuously to a maximum value d x l t 1870 s 5 9 m similarly the upstream velocity and discharge signal increase to the values u x l t 1870 s 3 6 m s and q x l t 1870 s 156 0 m 3 s respectively fig 9 b and c subsequently this generated wave is reflected again on the upstream extremity of the canal as a positive wave propagating downstream meanwhile the upstream discharge decreases to the initial value i e 86 54 m 3 s during t 2400 s consequently the depth decreases until reaching the initial value i e d x 0 t 1870 s 4 5 m on the other hand the velocity signal first decreases to a minimum value and subsequently increases to the value of the initial uniform flow i e u x 0 t 1870 s 4 5 m s similar interpretations may be reported for the wave curves plotted at the intermediate open channel cross sections x 0 2 l x 0 4 l x 0 6 l and x 0 8 l it is interesting to point out herein that the phase shifts observed between the different signals are due to the wave propagation duration and reflection mechanisms incidentally the depth profiles corresponding to t 120 s t 300 s t 900 s and t 1200 s shown in fig 10 illustrate a series of positive free surface waves propagating downstream likewise the depth corresponding to t 1600 s t 1800 s and t 3600 s shows a series of positive free surface waves traveling to the upstream extremity of the canal as a second investigation step the aforesaid channel is redesigned with side slope values corresponding to z 1 z 2 1 0 h 1 v in such a case the optimal value of the width of the channel bottom corresponds to b 3 776 m das 2000 fig 11 a b and c compare respectively the behaviors of depth velocity and discharge signals involved by the original and redesigned canals jointly table 1 lists the maximum values reached by the aforementioned signals clearly fig 11 a proves that the redesigned canal allows less important values of depth magnitudes than the original one specifically referring to table 1 the depth peaks involved by the redesigned channel at the upstream and downstream extremity are equal to d x 0 m max 5 5 m and d x l max 5 6 m respectively while their counterparts involved in the original canal are equal to d x 0m max 6 1 m and d x l max 5 5 m respectively furthermore according to fig 11 c and table 1 the redesigned canal allows more important discharge than the original one indeed the maximum discharge values allowed by the original canal at the upstream and downstream extremity are equal to q x 0 m max 173 13 m 3 s and q x l max 156 18 m 3 s respectively however more important discharge rates are involved in the redesigned canal i e q x 0 m max 280 98 m 3 s and q x l max 261 97 m 3 s hence it may be concluded that the redesigned canal allows more important discharge while providing less important free surface level 4 4 conclusion ultimately the present study illustrates that the 1 d extended st venant equations based on the prandtl power law as a momentum correction coefficient leads to a more realistic description of free surface wave behavior in trapezoidal open channels furthermore the mac cormack scheme based solver outlined in this study can be successfully applied for practical problems as an alternative to the finite element method based solver thanks to its implementation simplicity and computational time saving furthermore the findings demonstrate that the optimum side slope of the trapezoidal cross section of canals allows a maximum flow rate while preserving a low value of the wetted cross section area

21008,collision accident accounts for the largest proportion among all types of maritime accidents emergency decision making is essential to reduce the consequence of such accidents this paper proposes a novel bayesian network based emergency decision making model for consequence reduction of individual ship ship collision in the yangtze river the kernel of this method is to propose a three layer decision making framework to develop the graphical structure for describing the accident process and to establish the conditional probability tables for the quantitative relationships the merits of the proposed method include the intuitive representation of accident development easy to implement ability to deal with incomplete information and updated information this proposed method is applied to a typical collision accident in the yangtze river consequently this paper provides a practical and novel decision making method for collision accidents keywords collision accidents decision making bayesian network maritime safety 1 introduction collision accident is a frequently occurring maritime accidents in open seas montewka et al 2014 goerlandt and kujala 2011 ports yip 2008 zhang et al 2016 straits zhang et al 2019 ulusçu et al 2009 qu et al 2011 uğurlu et al 2016 inland waterways zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2021 and arctic waters afenyo et al 2017 khan et al 2018 specifically in the gulf of finland the collision accidents ranked second among all types of accidents from twenty years of survey similarly in the port area the collision accident occurs frequently due to the high traffic density mou et al 2010 and complexity of marine traffic van westrenen and ellerbroek 2015 wen et al 2015 in hong kong port the collision accidents account for 54 yip 2008 and in tianjin port this type of accident accounts for 72 41 zhang et al 2016 in the strait of istanbul the collision accident also ranks first in the majority of years from 2000 to 2010 uğurlu et al 2016 in the yangtze river the collision accident account for 58 87 zhang et al 2013 this also ranks first according to the high traffic density owing to the nature of high occurrence and relatively serious consequence many studies have focused on the prevention of collision accidents these previous studies can be categorized into three types which are collision avoidance risk mitigation from the marine traffic perspective and risk analysis and root cause analysis perspective the first type mainly focuses on reducing the occurrence probability of ship ship collision micro perspective in the high sea the second type focuses on reducing the occurrence probability of collision of traffic flows macro perspective the third type focuses on reducing both the occurrence and consequence of collision accidents using historical data macro perspective the comparison of the three types is shown in table 1 in which five references are quoted for each category although many more studies can be found specifically previous studies on each category are compared in table 1 the first type is to reduce the occurrence probability by considering the individual ship ship and multiple ship collision avoidance recently ozturk and cicek 2019 systematically reviewed the individual ship ship collision risk assessment in ship navigation and compared their difference and overlaps i e navigation collision risk between maritime transportation risk analysis and collision avoidance 34 models associated with ship ship collision are analysed by comparing the aim and the measurement criteria in this study the maritime transportation risk analysis is considered as a special type of ship ship collision and is regarded as the third type moreover the five most used parameters for collision avoidance from previous studies are distance to closest point of approach dcpa 54 3 time to closest point of approach tcpa 51 4 relative bearing 37 1 distance 34 3 and speed 22 1 from this analysis it can be seen that the most widely used parameters of collision avoidance are from the individual ships and this type of study aims to reduce the occurrence of ship ship collisions the second type is to reduce the occurrence probability by considering the ship traffic flows chen et al 2019 when navigating in the fairways the traffic flow is complex owing to the typical three scenarios which are overtaking crossing and head on from previous studies a mathematical model by using several parameters has been used to address this problem by pedersen 1995 moreover the stochastic process models have been introduced to estimate geometric collision probability four typical waterway areas have introduced this method to estimate the collision probability which are the gulf of finland kujala et al 2009 in the singapore strait kang et al 2019 in portugal silveira et al 2013 and in the san francisco bay merrick et al 2003 from previous studies the different collision probabilities of these three scenarios have been estimated otto et al 2002 chai et al 2017 goerlandt and kujala 2011 and can be readily extended to other waterways to reduce the occurrence probability the third type is to reduce both the occurrence probability and consequence from a macro perspective this type often uses historical accident data to learn lessons from the existing failure patterns from the previous review on maritime safety yang et al 2013 it can be seen that many studies focused on the risk mitigation in the framework of formal safety assessment fsa which includes hazard identification risk estimation risk control options cost benefit analysis and recommendations for decision making in practice several quantitative methods have been proposed for such risk analysis for example fuzzy logic sii et al 2001 evidential reasoning zhang et al 2014 bayesian network bn fu et al 2016 wang and yang 2018 econometrics yip et al 2015 talley et al 2012 and the combination of these methods yang et al 2009 wang et al 2013 to address the problem of uncertainty moreover the root cause analysis kum and sahin 2015 is often conducted to address the deficiencies yang et al 2013 when using fsa in risk analysis the reduction of occurrence probability and consequence is carried out in a specific waterway and or in a period from the above analysis it can be seen that few studies focused on the consequence reduction of individual ship ship collision specifically the first type is to reduce occurrence probability but with few studies considering the consequence reduction the second and third types focused on the risk mitigation from a macro perspective and it cannot 1 be conducted in real time which is the requirement of the consequence reduction wu et al 2017b 2020 and 2 from an individual ship ship collision perspective moreover the third critical distinction is that the majority of the previous studies focused on the open sea montewka et al 2014 goerlandt and kujala 2011 while only a few studies analysis the ship collision in narrow channels and congested areas baksh et al 2018 khan et al 2020 using probabilistic methods bn is the most widely used method when analysing the maritime accidents from a probabilistic perspective wu et al 2021 inducing ship ice collision grounding ship ship collision etc specifically khan et al 2020 proposed a dynamic bn model to make routine safety driven operational decisions for risk mitigation and afenyo et al 2017 developed a bn model to identify the most significant causative factors for a vessel colliding with an iceberg moreover the bn has been applied to the grounding accident in the fluctuating backwater zone in the three gorges dam jiang et al 2021 where the water depth varies when the water level changes and it has also been applied to grounding risk analysis with special consideration on the human fatigue akhtar and utne 2014 ship ship collision risk has also been analysed by using bn such as collisions risk analysis involving ropax vessels in the gulf of finland montewka et al 2014 and ship collision risk analysis considering human factors sotiralis et al 2016 therefore this paper aims to develop a risk based decision making model using bn to select the best response action for collision accidents in real time as well as to consider the constraints of emergency response to maritime accidents in congested areas in order to build this model 942 collision accidents in the yangtze river from 2013 to 2016 are collected meanwhile the influencing factors related to response to collision accidents are also identified from both the historical data and existing studies including wind speed current dead slow ahead to prevent the separation of ships dead weight tonnage collision angle collision part of ship ship length collision speed arrival time of tug slope of shallow waters river sediment consistency of two ships and minimum freeboard the qualitative relationship among the influencing factors are derived from the previous studies and ship manoeuvring experience and the quantitative relationship are obtained from the historical data and extend if then method in this study the contribution of this paper is that the bn is developed and its attempts for the first time up the authors best knowledge to use bn in decision making of ship collision the model can reduce the consequence of collision accidents under the time limitation and resources constraint a it is intuitive to describe the relationships among the factors in the three layer framework which can help the decision maker have a well understanding on the accident development process of collision accidents wu et al 2017a yang et al 2008 b it is easy to make decisions because the decision maker only have to collect the prior information of the influencing factors wu et al 2017a c it is able to deal with uncertainty of the prior information fu et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 which is very useful as the collected information may be incomplete owing to the time limitation in emergency d it is able to update the new information including both the influencing factors and evaluation variables this is useful since the initial collected data may be incomplete and the utility values of two options may be approximately equal which makes the decision maker hard to make decisions zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the results of the study will provide important insights 1 for the crews on board ship to take quickly response action and 2 for the maritime authorities to suggest the response action in a collision accident and if the ship fails to take such feasible action the authorities will have time to help the ships involved in collision to reduce the consequence in the next step the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 analyse the statistical data of emergency response to collision accidents section 3 develops a decision support approach for collision accidents in yangtze river section 4 applies the proposed method to a typical scenario in the yangtze river discussions are carried out in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 statistical data of emergency response to collision accidents in this section the statistical data of emergency response to collision accidents will be analysed because it contributes to developing the bn model from two aspects first the data can be used to identify the influencing factors and response actions to the collision accidents second the data can be used to derive the conditional probabilities tables cpts when developing a bn model from 2012 to 2016 942 collision incidents occurred in the yangtze river two things should be mentioned about this data first the number of collision incidents is 963 during this period however considering some incidents involving the fishing boat which is not in the charge of maritime safety administration these incidents are excluded in this paper second this paper focused on the incidents which means the collision has been occurred but may cause minor or even no consequence in fact from fig 1 it can be seen that although around 189 collision incidents occurred each year in the yangtze river there are fewer than 19 shipwrecks and 11 fatalities this is because the emergency response to such incidents is relatively effective therefore the experience of emergency response to such accidents should be summarised and adopted for the emergency response to potential collision accidents in the future we need to stress that not all the collision incidents had taken effective and appropriate response actions but from the statistical data some incidents had not taken the best response action and finally caused shipwreck or fatality accidents from the statistical data there are often four options for collision accidents in the yangtze river which are continue sailing a1 beaching a2 tug assistance a3 and abandon ship a4 from fig 2 it can be seen that option a2 is the most widely used accounting for 42 of the 942 cases with a1 accounting for 27 a3 accounting for 25 and a4 accounting for 5 the detailed descriptions and explanations of these options are as follows continue sailing a1 the collided ship continues to navigate because the hull damage is slight and the ship can prevent flooding by leak stoppage and flooding discharge when the ships anchoring in the nearby anchorage is also treated as this option this is because after collision the ships should anchor in the anchorage with a distance of around 1 nm nautical miles for accident investigation and since the collided ship can navigate to the nearby anchorage it is believed to be in good condition in practice if the colliding and being collided ships can well adjust the collision speed and angle the hull damage is often not serious beaching a2 this option means the collided ships have to beach in the nearby shallow waters to avoid sink because the ship floods quickly even after taking the intervention measures i e leak stoppage and flooding discharge in the yangtze river the two way channel for ship navigating is 500 m width and with another special lane for the small sized ship with draught less than 7 0 m if the ship cannot prevent the flooding effectively the most widely used method is to beach the ship initiatively by taking this option although the collided ship has a risk of bottom damage it can be avoided from sinking in practice this option should be carefully handled owing to the following two reasons first in the yangtze river there are many wharfs bridges and anchorages the collided ships should avoid to collide with such infrastructures and nearby ships second the shallow waters should be suitable for beaching for example if the sediment of such shallow water is hard the ship bottom may be seriously damaged another example is that if the ship cannot be totally grounded i e only small part on the shallow waters the ship may have the risk of capsizing when the water levels fluctuate wu et al 2017a or the wind changes to strong moreover when taking this option the colliding ship should try to push the collided ship to the shallow water with dead slow ahead tug assistance a3 the collided ship is anchored or moored with the help of a tug if a collided ship is anchored with the help of a tug this scenario is treated as tug assistance rather than continue sailing a1 abandon ship a4 the crews have no choice but to abandon the ship note this is the last choice this can also be discovered from the statistical data 3 proposed decision support approach for collision accidents in the yangtze river 3 1 developing the three layer framework for collision accidents similar with the previous studies wu et al 2017a the generic three layer framework using bn for emergency decision making of collision accidents can be established take the beaching option as an example the developed three layer framework is shown in fig 3 note that the influencing factors are incomplete in this figure specifically the first layer is the influencing factors in practice they can be derived from the expert judgements or from the historical data hänninen et al 2014 fu et al 2016 wu et al 2017b the second layer is the evaluation factors these factors are introduced to facilitate the understanding on the influencing mechanism of the influencing factors note that one evaluation factor could be the parent node of another evaluation factor and this can be seen from fig 3 that the condition for slope is the parent node of the condition for beaching the last layer is the response options for collision accidents in practice by introducing this framework the decision maker only has to know the prior information of the influencing factors in the first layer and the optimum option for emergency response to such collision accident can be derived by introducing the generic three layer framework the flowchart of developing the bn based emergency decision making model is shown in fig 4 the detailed three steps are as follows the first step is to establish a graphical structure for the bn based model in this step previous studies and historical data are used to identify the influencing factors and evaluation factors after identifying the factors the complete graphical structure of the bn can be derived by introducing the generic three layer framework the second step is to derive the cpts to establish the quantitative part of the bn as some evaluation factors have been recorded in the database the cpts can be derived directly from the historical data however some evaluation factors are used for facilitating the modelling process and the corresponding cpts are derived by using the extended if then scheme the last step is to inference the posterior probability by introducing the prior information of the collision accident and finally the optimum option can be selected by introducing the utility value nodes 3 2 identifying the influencing factors for the emergency decision making the identification of influencing factors is a significant step for emergency decision making of collision accidents which is also the first step in the decision making modelling process in order to achieve a comprehensive evaluation on the ship condition and navigation situation majority of these factors are identified from previous studies and the references or reasons of choosing these factors are summarised as shown in table 2 it should be noted that some influencing factors are unique for emergency decision making of collision accidents which are dead slow ahead to prevent the separation of ships slope of shallow waters consistency of two ships and minimum freeboard the detailed explanations of choosing these factors are as follows 1 dead slow ahead to prevent the separation of ships the dead slow ahead is a good seamanship when handling the colliding ships which can be used to prevent the two ships from being separated in a previous study montewka et al 2014 this has also been considered the reason is that if the ship is damaged and the colliding ship quickly pulls out from the collided ship the flooding speed will be accelerated therefore the ship should try to push the collided ships until the flooding protection has been successfully carried out however note that the ship speed should not be high that s because the high speed may aggravate the damage of the collided ship therefore dead slow ahead which can prevent the two ship being separated is an effective method and should be considered when selecting the best option for emergency response to collision accidents 2 slope of shallow waters when the collided ship initiatively grounds on the shallow waters the conditions of the shallow water must be considered as from the previous study wu et al 2017a the river sediment is a significant factor to judge whether the bottom of ships will be damaged or not another significant factor is the slope of the shallow water this is because the ship should be totally grounded in the shallow waters and with the rudder and paddle not seriously damaged hence the appropriate slope will easy to manoeuvre the collided ship being grounded in good condition from the working experience of the captions the slope is a significant factor for this manoeuvring 3 consistency of two ships the consistency of two ships means that the colliding and collided ships can move consistently i e the two ships can move ahead or astern together with good coordination this is important to judge whether the colliding ship can push the collided ship to the shallow waters if the consistency of two ships is low the collided ship has to move to the shallow waters by herself which is very hard since the collided ship has been damaged 4 minimum freeboard the minimum freeboard is the index to judge whether the ship can float or not since the collided ship has been damaged the ship buoyancy will be decreased if the ship has been damaged seriously and flooding quickly the freeboard may not meet the safety requirements of ship buoyancy in practice this minimum freeboard is defined as 76 mm 3 3 establishing the graphical structure for collision accidents after identifying the influencing factors the states of these factors should be derived to develop the first layer of the bn based decision making model note that when defining the states of the influencing factors the number of the states should be carefully handled if there are too many states too many cpts should be developed which makes it impossible in practice for example if there are three parent nodes and each with five states 125 i e 5 5 5 125 conditional probabilities should be established yang et al 2008 wan et al 2019 however if there are only a few states e g two states it will be difficult to distinguish the difference among the states since some of the descriptions of the influencing factors are ambiguous or fuzziness therefore three states are used for describing the influencing factors and their explanations and the references of defining the states are shown in table 3 in order to facilitate the modelling process the evaluation variables are introduced specifically they can be derived from previous studies which are the natural environment wu et al 2016 leak stoppage wu et al 2017a flooding water montewka et al 2014 damage extent significant montewka et al 2014 hull damage prestileo et al 2013 mechanical damage montewka et al 2014 discharge ability santos and guedes soares 2009 actual flooding water wu et al 2017a condition for beaching wu et al 2017a in order to have a better understanding the evaluation variables the natural environment is explained in detail in this paper the parent nodes for the node of natural environment are wind speed and current which are two types of natural environment in reality moreover this variable is divided into three states to describe the condition of natural environment good means the natural environment will have slightly impact on the leak stoppage i e the child node for natural environment normal means the natural environment will have some impacts on the leak stoppage while bad means the natural environment will have some significant impact on the leak stoppage the summary of the evaluation variables in this decision making based model is shown in table 4 after defining the influencing factors and the corresponding states the three layer emergency decision making model for collision accidents can be derived which is shown in fig 5 3 4 use of the extended if then rules to derive the cpts after establishing the graphical structure another essential step is to derive the cpts for the bn based decision making model the most common and easy way to derive the cpt is by using historical data or from the previous studies for example the damage significant extent which has been used for the collision risk analysis by montewka et al 2014 the cpt can be easily derived from their study though the two studies have some slight differences and the established cpt is shown in table 5 from this table it can be seen that if the ship collides another ship with a close to the right angle and with a high speed this collision will be believed to be damage extent significant moreover if the ship collides another ship with a small angle this collision will be believed not to be damage extent significant in this paper discharge ability mechanical damage damage significant extent and natural environment are derived by the historical data however although more than 900 collision accidents have occurred in the yangtze river it is also hard to establish the cpts for all the evaluation variables owing to the two following reasons first some evaluation variables are introduced to facilitate the modelling process by reducing the number of cpts and better understanding on the accident development process therefore these evaluation variables did not have any records in the historical data which makes them hard to directly derive from the historical data second although the majority of collision accidents have taken effective response actions which can be seen from the fig 1 that few fatalities and shipwrecks have been caused some collision accidents have not been well treated and the response actions should be improved in order to address this problem the extended if then scheme which has been widely used for the decision support yang et al 2008 liu et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 nguyen 2020 is introduced in this paper to derive the cpts for the evaluation variables before using the extended if then rules the traditional if then rules which is used in the fuzzy logic based method zhou et al 2018 kuzu et al 2019 should be described for comparison take the evaluation variable of condition for slope as example the traditional if then rules can be established as if the ship length is less than 100m and the slope of shallow waters is less than 15 then the condition for slope is good however it can be seen that this traditional if then rule cannot accurately describe the output variable i e condition for slope in practice it is hard to judge that the slope is 100 good or bad therefore the belief degree is introduced and the extended if then rules can be established as if the ship length is less than 100m and the slope of shallow waters is less than 15 then the condition for slope is good with a belief degree of 0 9 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 1 by introducing this extended if then rules the cpts for the evaluation variables can be obtained four experts are invited for the judgment to derive the cpt and the detailed information is as follows a professor from university and he has been worked as chief officer on the ocean going ships an officer from the maritime safety administration and he has successfully handled more than 100 collision accidents in the jiangsu section a tug captain from the nanjin port tug and lighter company and he has often requested for tug assistance for maritime accidents a captain from the ocean going ship and he has worked more than 20 years in the nanjin tanker corporation the four experts are invited to make judgments on each rule and the average value is used for the cpts since the condition for beaching is a popular response option to collision accidents the cpts for two associated nodes a condition for slope and condition for beaching are given in table 6 as shown in table 6 it can be seen that when the ship length is less than 100 m it is better to beach the ship on the shallow waters with a slope of 15 if the ship length is from 100 m to 200 m the appropriate slope of shallow waters for such beaching is from 15 to 18 if the ship length is more than 200 m the appropriate slope of shallow waters for such beaching is from 18 to 24 moreover by introducing the extended if then rules it can well describe whether the slope of shallow waters is good or bad for beaching for example when the ship length is from 100 m to 200 m and the slope of shallow water is less than 15 it can be seen that the condition for slope is good with a belief degree of 0 3 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 7 from this result it can be seen that the condition for slope is relatively bad but it is not 100 bad which reflects the advantages of if then rules when describing the consequent similarly the cpt of condition for beaching can also be derived and the results are shown in table 7 from this table it can be seen that only 24 i e 2 2 2 3 24 combinations need to be judged however if the condition for slope is not introduced there will be 108 i e 3 3 2 2 3 108 combinations that need to be judged by the experts which is challenging in practice moreover by introducing the condition for slope it is easy to understand how the condition for slope is being influenced by the ship length and slope of shallow waters and also how the condition for beaching is being influenced by the river resident consistency of two ships and condition for slope note that the consistency of the river resident is another key factor to judge whether this shallow waters can be used for beaching or not specifically if the two ships cannot move consistently or the river resident is hard this shallow water is believed to be not good and this can be seen from the cpt of the condition for beaching in this paper the condition for slope condition for beaching flooding water leak stoppage actual flooding water and hull damage are derived by using this extended if then rules method 3 5 introducing utility value for response options selection the final decision making is carried out by introducing the utility value the quantitative relationship between the evaluation variables and the response actions are also derived by using the if then rules take the beaching action as example the established cpt for beaching is shown in table 8 it can be seen from this table that if the condition for beaching is favourable the beaching option can be taken however if the condition for beaching is not favourable it is difficult for a ship to take this option in practice similarly the cpt for other options i e continue sailing tug assistance and abandon ship can also be derived for the sake of space these cpts are not given but only some principles that can be discovered from the cpt tables are given the conditions for continue sailing is very rigorous and it can only be taken when the mechanical damage is undamaged the actual flooding water is not quick and the minimum freeboard is more than 76 mm this is owing to the following three reasons 1 if the mechanical damage is damaged the ship cannot use its rudder and paddle 2 if the actual flooding water is quickly the ship will suddenly be filled with flooding water and the stability will quickly decreased which may cause the ship capsizing 3 if the minimum freeboard is less than 76 mm the ship cannot safely float on the water the tug assistance option cannot be taken when the tug cannot arrive in a relatively short time and the flooding water is quickly the last choice for the response actions to collision accidents is to abandon the ship if there is no other better choices can be taken 4 case study of decision support for collision accidents in yangtze river 4 1 scenario description of collision accident on 7 march 2013 a collision accident occurred close to the no 65 buoy in the downstream of yangtze river the two ships were jinzeng 18 and kaihangxing 19 both ships were inbound and 35 crew members in total were on board the wind speed was around 5 beaufort scale the accidents caused the forepeak flooding of jinzeng 18 finally this ship beached on the shallow water close to no 66 buoy the detailed information of this collision accident is shown in table 9 note that the information is derived from the database in the jiangsu maritime safety administration 4 2 derivation of the state values of the evaluation variables after obtaining the prior information in table 9 it is easy to derive the state values of the evaluation variables of the emergency decision making model for collision accidents by using the genie software it is easy to achieve this by setting evidence on the input variables for example as the node of dead slow ahead to prevent the ships separation is feasible the decision maker only have to select set evidence on the feasible state after setting the evidence on all the input variables the result can be derived as shown in fig 6 the state values of the evaluation variables can be derived and the results are shown in table 10 from this table it can be seen that the natural environment is good with a belief degree of 0 50 is normal with a belief degree of 0 30 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 20 this is because both the wind speed and the current speed were moderate which makes the natural environment not very good but acceptable for the leak stoppage the mechanical damage was undamaged with a belief degree of 0 90 and was damaged with a belief degree of 0 10 this is because the collision part was in the stem from the accident development these two ships were not damaged with their rudders and paddles as both the collision speed and collision angle are moderate the hull damage is serious with a belief degree of 0 30 is moderate with a belief degree of 0 50 and is slight with a belief degree of 0 20 this agrees with the accident information only the jinzeng 18 ship was damaged with a hole in the forepeak after leak stoppage the actual flooding water is seriously with a belief degree of 0 08 is moderately with a belief degree of 0 35 and is slightly with a belief degree of 0 57 another thing should be mentioned is the state values of evaluation variables related to the beaching as the slope of the shallow water is suitable for the collided ship it is good with a belief degree of 0 90 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 10 after inference moreover the condition for beaching is also good in this scenario which is good with a belief degree of 0 88 is normal with a belief degree of 0 10 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 03 4 3 acquisition of the best response action for collision accident the final decisions can be made by deriving the utility value of each option which is shown in fig 6 and the comparison among four response actions are shown in table 11 from this table it can be seen that the best option is beaching in this scenario and the continuous sailing ranks second while the tug assistance and abandon ship rank third and fourth respectively the result is reasonable because the collided ship finally beached on the shallow water close to no 66 buoy in fact the beaching is taken because the ship flooding is not seriously therefore the ship will not have a large probability to capsize moreover the condition for beaching is good which can be seen from table 10 that the condition for beaching is good with a belief degree of 0 88 therefore the ship can beach on the shallow waters to avoid influencing the passing by ships since this waterway is very busy continuing to sail is another feasible option in this scenario when a ship is not seriously damaged and her rudder and propeller are not damaged the ship can navigate along its own proposition with good conditions or with some damage in the forepeak since beaching on the shallow waters is better than continuing to sail in this scenario this option is not selected in practice tug assistance ranks third because the tug can only arrive in around 30 min however as the collided ships should take response actions in a quite limited time which makes this option only rank third if the arrival time can be reduced to 15 min this can be easily implemented by changing the state value of arrival time of tug the utility value will be changed from 0 556 to 0 748 and this option will be ranked second this is because without the help of tug the damaged ship may have some limitation in manoeuvrability and the risk of maritime accidents may increase during the continue sailing process abandon ship is often the last choice when response options are considered in this scenario this option ranks fourth because there are other better choices as stated before this option can only be taken when the ship is flooding quickly after taking leak stoppage and the collided ship cannot beach on the shallow waters in fact when setting evidence on the actual flooding water as quickly and the condition for beaching as bad the utility value of abandon ship will be changed to 0 40 while the utility values for other options will be reduced which makes this option have to be taken 4 4 benchmarking validation of the developed decision making model the accuracy of the results of the response actions in the yangtze river and the reliability of the proposed decision making model can be tested using the benchmarking validation technique this is carried out by comparing the results of using the well established evidential reasoning method which is also used in the previous study yang et al 2008 to validate the reliability of the developed decision making model the evidential reasoning method is used to calculate the results of the four response actions given the same inputs the results based on the ids software are as shown in table 12 however it takes more than 20 min for an experienced user to calculate the results because the user has to build the influencing factors twice if it is associated with two evaluation variables the results indicate that the proposed decision making model is reliable in the case study because the results are consistent with the results using the well established evidential reasoning method compared with the evidential reasoning method the developed decision making method has prominent advantages in terms of the transparency and easiness in calculation that s because the graphical structure of bn is intuitive to describe the relationships among the influencing factors moreover the hierarchical structure in evidential reasoning requires the user to build it twice if the influencing factor is associated with two evaluation variables therefore the evidential reasoning is much more time consuming than the bn model 4 5 decision making for collision accident considering uncertainty as the emergency decision making is limited in time the decision maker i e captain may not collect the complete information i e 100 which includes uncertainty e g 10 for example the captain may have 10 belief degree doubt on the dead slow ahead to prevent ships separation is unfeasible which can be described by the dead slow ahead to prevent ships separation is feasible with a belief degree of 0 90 and is unfeasible with a belief degree of 0 10 in this case the developed model can also be used for decision making to illustrate this decision making process several state values of influencing factors have been changed to the information with uncertainty the detailed original and changed information are shown in table 13 by using the changed information it can be seen that the utility values for four response actions are changed see fig 7 the beaching option is changed from 0 85 to 0 74 which has reduced a lot because the condition for beaching has been changed to be a little bad the tug assistance ranked second under this new scenario though the utility value has only reduced by 0 02 this is because the utility value of continue sailing has reduced a lot i e from 0 57 to 0 45 for further analysis the minimum freeboard has changed with 30 uncertainty which makes it is hard to judge whether this ship can safely navigate with the forepeak damaged another merit of the bn based decision making model is that it can also change the values of the evaluation variables for example after inference the hull damage is seriously with a belief degree of 0 21 is moderately with a belief degree of 0 37 and is slightly with a belief degree of 0 43 which can be seen in fig 6 in practice if the captain discovers that the hull is seriously or slightly damaged the captain can directly change this state value by ignoring the inference result that considering the dwt and other factors in order to illustrate this an example is used in this section the detailed information is as follows 1 the mechanical damage is undamaged 2 hull damage is moderate 3 the condition for slope is good with a belief degree of 0 89 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 11 the result has been changed and shown in fig 8 by changing these values it can be seen that the utility value of beaching is 0 78 which has been increased and it means that the captain should be confident to select this response option therefore this merit will make the proposed model especially useful if there are two options with approximately equal utility value and the updated information can provide a practical tool to help the captain to make decisions 5 discussion in this paper the expert judgements are used to derive the cpts this is quite different from the data driven decision making model which only uses historical data to quantify the influencing factors wu et al 2016 two reasons for using expert judgements are as follows first the collision accident is different from the not under control incident the collision may cause some fatalities and shipwrecks from the historical data while the not under control incident has caused few fatalities this means some of the collision accidents have not been well handled and improvement are needed in this response process therefore the historical data which includes some data that has caused fatalities should be not considered second introducing expert judgements can have a well understanding on the accident development process moreover if the decision maker has new information on the evaluation variables it is easy for him to directly update the information on the evaluation variables which has been illustrated in subsection 4 5 and it is especially useful when the utility values of two or more options are approximately equal when developing the three layer decision making model for the collision accidents the historical data is used to derive the four options i e continuing to sail beaching tug assistance and abandon ship moreover from the statistical data the beaching option is the most popular option for emergency response to maritime accidents this is owing to the distinguishing characteristics of the yangtze river specifically there are a large amount of shallow waters along the yangtze river and if the condition for the shallow waters e g slope and river resident is suitable for beaching the majority of ships upon a collision will take this option however this might be quite different in the open sea because there will not be suitable shallow waters available for beaching and if the on board flooding cannot be effectively prevented the captain will have to abandon ship 6 concluding remarks in this paper a novel emergency decision making model is proposed for collision accidents when developing this three layer decision making model the bn method is introduced by developing the graphical structure and cpts to represent the qualitative and quantitative relationships the merits of the proposed method include the intuitive representation of accident development easy to implement ability to deal with incomplete information and updated information from the case study by applying the proposed model to the yangtze river it can be seen the selected option is unanimous with the real case which means the proposed model is useful for emergency response to collision accidents however it should be mentioned that when applying this method to other waterways e g the open sea this decision making may be different for example compared with the yangtze river there will not be so many shallow waters for beaching and the crews have to prevent the ship from capsizing before the helicopter arrived credit

21008,collision accident accounts for the largest proportion among all types of maritime accidents emergency decision making is essential to reduce the consequence of such accidents this paper proposes a novel bayesian network based emergency decision making model for consequence reduction of individual ship ship collision in the yangtze river the kernel of this method is to propose a three layer decision making framework to develop the graphical structure for describing the accident process and to establish the conditional probability tables for the quantitative relationships the merits of the proposed method include the intuitive representation of accident development easy to implement ability to deal with incomplete information and updated information this proposed method is applied to a typical collision accident in the yangtze river consequently this paper provides a practical and novel decision making method for collision accidents keywords collision accidents decision making bayesian network maritime safety 1 introduction collision accident is a frequently occurring maritime accidents in open seas montewka et al 2014 goerlandt and kujala 2011 ports yip 2008 zhang et al 2016 straits zhang et al 2019 ulusçu et al 2009 qu et al 2011 uğurlu et al 2016 inland waterways zhang et al 2013 jiang et al 2021 and arctic waters afenyo et al 2017 khan et al 2018 specifically in the gulf of finland the collision accidents ranked second among all types of accidents from twenty years of survey similarly in the port area the collision accident occurs frequently due to the high traffic density mou et al 2010 and complexity of marine traffic van westrenen and ellerbroek 2015 wen et al 2015 in hong kong port the collision accidents account for 54 yip 2008 and in tianjin port this type of accident accounts for 72 41 zhang et al 2016 in the strait of istanbul the collision accident also ranks first in the majority of years from 2000 to 2010 uğurlu et al 2016 in the yangtze river the collision accident account for 58 87 zhang et al 2013 this also ranks first according to the high traffic density owing to the nature of high occurrence and relatively serious consequence many studies have focused on the prevention of collision accidents these previous studies can be categorized into three types which are collision avoidance risk mitigation from the marine traffic perspective and risk analysis and root cause analysis perspective the first type mainly focuses on reducing the occurrence probability of ship ship collision micro perspective in the high sea the second type focuses on reducing the occurrence probability of collision of traffic flows macro perspective the third type focuses on reducing both the occurrence and consequence of collision accidents using historical data macro perspective the comparison of the three types is shown in table 1 in which five references are quoted for each category although many more studies can be found specifically previous studies on each category are compared in table 1 the first type is to reduce the occurrence probability by considering the individual ship ship and multiple ship collision avoidance recently ozturk and cicek 2019 systematically reviewed the individual ship ship collision risk assessment in ship navigation and compared their difference and overlaps i e navigation collision risk between maritime transportation risk analysis and collision avoidance 34 models associated with ship ship collision are analysed by comparing the aim and the measurement criteria in this study the maritime transportation risk analysis is considered as a special type of ship ship collision and is regarded as the third type moreover the five most used parameters for collision avoidance from previous studies are distance to closest point of approach dcpa 54 3 time to closest point of approach tcpa 51 4 relative bearing 37 1 distance 34 3 and speed 22 1 from this analysis it can be seen that the most widely used parameters of collision avoidance are from the individual ships and this type of study aims to reduce the occurrence of ship ship collisions the second type is to reduce the occurrence probability by considering the ship traffic flows chen et al 2019 when navigating in the fairways the traffic flow is complex owing to the typical three scenarios which are overtaking crossing and head on from previous studies a mathematical model by using several parameters has been used to address this problem by pedersen 1995 moreover the stochastic process models have been introduced to estimate geometric collision probability four typical waterway areas have introduced this method to estimate the collision probability which are the gulf of finland kujala et al 2009 in the singapore strait kang et al 2019 in portugal silveira et al 2013 and in the san francisco bay merrick et al 2003 from previous studies the different collision probabilities of these three scenarios have been estimated otto et al 2002 chai et al 2017 goerlandt and kujala 2011 and can be readily extended to other waterways to reduce the occurrence probability the third type is to reduce both the occurrence probability and consequence from a macro perspective this type often uses historical accident data to learn lessons from the existing failure patterns from the previous review on maritime safety yang et al 2013 it can be seen that many studies focused on the risk mitigation in the framework of formal safety assessment fsa which includes hazard identification risk estimation risk control options cost benefit analysis and recommendations for decision making in practice several quantitative methods have been proposed for such risk analysis for example fuzzy logic sii et al 2001 evidential reasoning zhang et al 2014 bayesian network bn fu et al 2016 wang and yang 2018 econometrics yip et al 2015 talley et al 2012 and the combination of these methods yang et al 2009 wang et al 2013 to address the problem of uncertainty moreover the root cause analysis kum and sahin 2015 is often conducted to address the deficiencies yang et al 2013 when using fsa in risk analysis the reduction of occurrence probability and consequence is carried out in a specific waterway and or in a period from the above analysis it can be seen that few studies focused on the consequence reduction of individual ship ship collision specifically the first type is to reduce occurrence probability but with few studies considering the consequence reduction the second and third types focused on the risk mitigation from a macro perspective and it cannot 1 be conducted in real time which is the requirement of the consequence reduction wu et al 2017b 2020 and 2 from an individual ship ship collision perspective moreover the third critical distinction is that the majority of the previous studies focused on the open sea montewka et al 2014 goerlandt and kujala 2011 while only a few studies analysis the ship collision in narrow channels and congested areas baksh et al 2018 khan et al 2020 using probabilistic methods bn is the most widely used method when analysing the maritime accidents from a probabilistic perspective wu et al 2021 inducing ship ice collision grounding ship ship collision etc specifically khan et al 2020 proposed a dynamic bn model to make routine safety driven operational decisions for risk mitigation and afenyo et al 2017 developed a bn model to identify the most significant causative factors for a vessel colliding with an iceberg moreover the bn has been applied to the grounding accident in the fluctuating backwater zone in the three gorges dam jiang et al 2021 where the water depth varies when the water level changes and it has also been applied to grounding risk analysis with special consideration on the human fatigue akhtar and utne 2014 ship ship collision risk has also been analysed by using bn such as collisions risk analysis involving ropax vessels in the gulf of finland montewka et al 2014 and ship collision risk analysis considering human factors sotiralis et al 2016 therefore this paper aims to develop a risk based decision making model using bn to select the best response action for collision accidents in real time as well as to consider the constraints of emergency response to maritime accidents in congested areas in order to build this model 942 collision accidents in the yangtze river from 2013 to 2016 are collected meanwhile the influencing factors related to response to collision accidents are also identified from both the historical data and existing studies including wind speed current dead slow ahead to prevent the separation of ships dead weight tonnage collision angle collision part of ship ship length collision speed arrival time of tug slope of shallow waters river sediment consistency of two ships and minimum freeboard the qualitative relationship among the influencing factors are derived from the previous studies and ship manoeuvring experience and the quantitative relationship are obtained from the historical data and extend if then method in this study the contribution of this paper is that the bn is developed and its attempts for the first time up the authors best knowledge to use bn in decision making of ship collision the model can reduce the consequence of collision accidents under the time limitation and resources constraint a it is intuitive to describe the relationships among the factors in the three layer framework which can help the decision maker have a well understanding on the accident development process of collision accidents wu et al 2017a yang et al 2008 b it is easy to make decisions because the decision maker only have to collect the prior information of the influencing factors wu et al 2017a c it is able to deal with uncertainty of the prior information fu et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 which is very useful as the collected information may be incomplete owing to the time limitation in emergency d it is able to update the new information including both the influencing factors and evaluation variables this is useful since the initial collected data may be incomplete and the utility values of two options may be approximately equal which makes the decision maker hard to make decisions zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2018 the results of the study will provide important insights 1 for the crews on board ship to take quickly response action and 2 for the maritime authorities to suggest the response action in a collision accident and if the ship fails to take such feasible action the authorities will have time to help the ships involved in collision to reduce the consequence in the next step the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 analyse the statistical data of emergency response to collision accidents section 3 develops a decision support approach for collision accidents in yangtze river section 4 applies the proposed method to a typical scenario in the yangtze river discussions are carried out in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 statistical data of emergency response to collision accidents in this section the statistical data of emergency response to collision accidents will be analysed because it contributes to developing the bn model from two aspects first the data can be used to identify the influencing factors and response actions to the collision accidents second the data can be used to derive the conditional probabilities tables cpts when developing a bn model from 2012 to 2016 942 collision incidents occurred in the yangtze river two things should be mentioned about this data first the number of collision incidents is 963 during this period however considering some incidents involving the fishing boat which is not in the charge of maritime safety administration these incidents are excluded in this paper second this paper focused on the incidents which means the collision has been occurred but may cause minor or even no consequence in fact from fig 1 it can be seen that although around 189 collision incidents occurred each year in the yangtze river there are fewer than 19 shipwrecks and 11 fatalities this is because the emergency response to such incidents is relatively effective therefore the experience of emergency response to such accidents should be summarised and adopted for the emergency response to potential collision accidents in the future we need to stress that not all the collision incidents had taken effective and appropriate response actions but from the statistical data some incidents had not taken the best response action and finally caused shipwreck or fatality accidents from the statistical data there are often four options for collision accidents in the yangtze river which are continue sailing a1 beaching a2 tug assistance a3 and abandon ship a4 from fig 2 it can be seen that option a2 is the most widely used accounting for 42 of the 942 cases with a1 accounting for 27 a3 accounting for 25 and a4 accounting for 5 the detailed descriptions and explanations of these options are as follows continue sailing a1 the collided ship continues to navigate because the hull damage is slight and the ship can prevent flooding by leak stoppage and flooding discharge when the ships anchoring in the nearby anchorage is also treated as this option this is because after collision the ships should anchor in the anchorage with a distance of around 1 nm nautical miles for accident investigation and since the collided ship can navigate to the nearby anchorage it is believed to be in good condition in practice if the colliding and being collided ships can well adjust the collision speed and angle the hull damage is often not serious beaching a2 this option means the collided ships have to beach in the nearby shallow waters to avoid sink because the ship floods quickly even after taking the intervention measures i e leak stoppage and flooding discharge in the yangtze river the two way channel for ship navigating is 500 m width and with another special lane for the small sized ship with draught less than 7 0 m if the ship cannot prevent the flooding effectively the most widely used method is to beach the ship initiatively by taking this option although the collided ship has a risk of bottom damage it can be avoided from sinking in practice this option should be carefully handled owing to the following two reasons first in the yangtze river there are many wharfs bridges and anchorages the collided ships should avoid to collide with such infrastructures and nearby ships second the shallow waters should be suitable for beaching for example if the sediment of such shallow water is hard the ship bottom may be seriously damaged another example is that if the ship cannot be totally grounded i e only small part on the shallow waters the ship may have the risk of capsizing when the water levels fluctuate wu et al 2017a or the wind changes to strong moreover when taking this option the colliding ship should try to push the collided ship to the shallow water with dead slow ahead tug assistance a3 the collided ship is anchored or moored with the help of a tug if a collided ship is anchored with the help of a tug this scenario is treated as tug assistance rather than continue sailing a1 abandon ship a4 the crews have no choice but to abandon the ship note this is the last choice this can also be discovered from the statistical data 3 proposed decision support approach for collision accidents in the yangtze river 3 1 developing the three layer framework for collision accidents similar with the previous studies wu et al 2017a the generic three layer framework using bn for emergency decision making of collision accidents can be established take the beaching option as an example the developed three layer framework is shown in fig 3 note that the influencing factors are incomplete in this figure specifically the first layer is the influencing factors in practice they can be derived from the expert judgements or from the historical data hänninen et al 2014 fu et al 2016 wu et al 2017b the second layer is the evaluation factors these factors are introduced to facilitate the understanding on the influencing mechanism of the influencing factors note that one evaluation factor could be the parent node of another evaluation factor and this can be seen from fig 3 that the condition for slope is the parent node of the condition for beaching the last layer is the response options for collision accidents in practice by introducing this framework the decision maker only has to know the prior information of the influencing factors in the first layer and the optimum option for emergency response to such collision accident can be derived by introducing the generic three layer framework the flowchart of developing the bn based emergency decision making model is shown in fig 4 the detailed three steps are as follows the first step is to establish a graphical structure for the bn based model in this step previous studies and historical data are used to identify the influencing factors and evaluation factors after identifying the factors the complete graphical structure of the bn can be derived by introducing the generic three layer framework the second step is to derive the cpts to establish the quantitative part of the bn as some evaluation factors have been recorded in the database the cpts can be derived directly from the historical data however some evaluation factors are used for facilitating the modelling process and the corresponding cpts are derived by using the extended if then scheme the last step is to inference the posterior probability by introducing the prior information of the collision accident and finally the optimum option can be selected by introducing the utility value nodes 3 2 identifying the influencing factors for the emergency decision making the identification of influencing factors is a significant step for emergency decision making of collision accidents which is also the first step in the decision making modelling process in order to achieve a comprehensive evaluation on the ship condition and navigation situation majority of these factors are identified from previous studies and the references or reasons of choosing these factors are summarised as shown in table 2 it should be noted that some influencing factors are unique for emergency decision making of collision accidents which are dead slow ahead to prevent the separation of ships slope of shallow waters consistency of two ships and minimum freeboard the detailed explanations of choosing these factors are as follows 1 dead slow ahead to prevent the separation of ships the dead slow ahead is a good seamanship when handling the colliding ships which can be used to prevent the two ships from being separated in a previous study montewka et al 2014 this has also been considered the reason is that if the ship is damaged and the colliding ship quickly pulls out from the collided ship the flooding speed will be accelerated therefore the ship should try to push the collided ships until the flooding protection has been successfully carried out however note that the ship speed should not be high that s because the high speed may aggravate the damage of the collided ship therefore dead slow ahead which can prevent the two ship being separated is an effective method and should be considered when selecting the best option for emergency response to collision accidents 2 slope of shallow waters when the collided ship initiatively grounds on the shallow waters the conditions of the shallow water must be considered as from the previous study wu et al 2017a the river sediment is a significant factor to judge whether the bottom of ships will be damaged or not another significant factor is the slope of the shallow water this is because the ship should be totally grounded in the shallow waters and with the rudder and paddle not seriously damaged hence the appropriate slope will easy to manoeuvre the collided ship being grounded in good condition from the working experience of the captions the slope is a significant factor for this manoeuvring 3 consistency of two ships the consistency of two ships means that the colliding and collided ships can move consistently i e the two ships can move ahead or astern together with good coordination this is important to judge whether the colliding ship can push the collided ship to the shallow waters if the consistency of two ships is low the collided ship has to move to the shallow waters by herself which is very hard since the collided ship has been damaged 4 minimum freeboard the minimum freeboard is the index to judge whether the ship can float or not since the collided ship has been damaged the ship buoyancy will be decreased if the ship has been damaged seriously and flooding quickly the freeboard may not meet the safety requirements of ship buoyancy in practice this minimum freeboard is defined as 76 mm 3 3 establishing the graphical structure for collision accidents after identifying the influencing factors the states of these factors should be derived to develop the first layer of the bn based decision making model note that when defining the states of the influencing factors the number of the states should be carefully handled if there are too many states too many cpts should be developed which makes it impossible in practice for example if there are three parent nodes and each with five states 125 i e 5 5 5 125 conditional probabilities should be established yang et al 2008 wan et al 2019 however if there are only a few states e g two states it will be difficult to distinguish the difference among the states since some of the descriptions of the influencing factors are ambiguous or fuzziness therefore three states are used for describing the influencing factors and their explanations and the references of defining the states are shown in table 3 in order to facilitate the modelling process the evaluation variables are introduced specifically they can be derived from previous studies which are the natural environment wu et al 2016 leak stoppage wu et al 2017a flooding water montewka et al 2014 damage extent significant montewka et al 2014 hull damage prestileo et al 2013 mechanical damage montewka et al 2014 discharge ability santos and guedes soares 2009 actual flooding water wu et al 2017a condition for beaching wu et al 2017a in order to have a better understanding the evaluation variables the natural environment is explained in detail in this paper the parent nodes for the node of natural environment are wind speed and current which are two types of natural environment in reality moreover this variable is divided into three states to describe the condition of natural environment good means the natural environment will have slightly impact on the leak stoppage i e the child node for natural environment normal means the natural environment will have some impacts on the leak stoppage while bad means the natural environment will have some significant impact on the leak stoppage the summary of the evaluation variables in this decision making based model is shown in table 4 after defining the influencing factors and the corresponding states the three layer emergency decision making model for collision accidents can be derived which is shown in fig 5 3 4 use of the extended if then rules to derive the cpts after establishing the graphical structure another essential step is to derive the cpts for the bn based decision making model the most common and easy way to derive the cpt is by using historical data or from the previous studies for example the damage significant extent which has been used for the collision risk analysis by montewka et al 2014 the cpt can be easily derived from their study though the two studies have some slight differences and the established cpt is shown in table 5 from this table it can be seen that if the ship collides another ship with a close to the right angle and with a high speed this collision will be believed to be damage extent significant moreover if the ship collides another ship with a small angle this collision will be believed not to be damage extent significant in this paper discharge ability mechanical damage damage significant extent and natural environment are derived by the historical data however although more than 900 collision accidents have occurred in the yangtze river it is also hard to establish the cpts for all the evaluation variables owing to the two following reasons first some evaluation variables are introduced to facilitate the modelling process by reducing the number of cpts and better understanding on the accident development process therefore these evaluation variables did not have any records in the historical data which makes them hard to directly derive from the historical data second although the majority of collision accidents have taken effective response actions which can be seen from the fig 1 that few fatalities and shipwrecks have been caused some collision accidents have not been well treated and the response actions should be improved in order to address this problem the extended if then scheme which has been widely used for the decision support yang et al 2008 liu et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 nguyen 2020 is introduced in this paper to derive the cpts for the evaluation variables before using the extended if then rules the traditional if then rules which is used in the fuzzy logic based method zhou et al 2018 kuzu et al 2019 should be described for comparison take the evaluation variable of condition for slope as example the traditional if then rules can be established as if the ship length is less than 100m and the slope of shallow waters is less than 15 then the condition for slope is good however it can be seen that this traditional if then rule cannot accurately describe the output variable i e condition for slope in practice it is hard to judge that the slope is 100 good or bad therefore the belief degree is introduced and the extended if then rules can be established as if the ship length is less than 100m and the slope of shallow waters is less than 15 then the condition for slope is good with a belief degree of 0 9 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 1 by introducing this extended if then rules the cpts for the evaluation variables can be obtained four experts are invited for the judgment to derive the cpt and the detailed information is as follows a professor from university and he has been worked as chief officer on the ocean going ships an officer from the maritime safety administration and he has successfully handled more than 100 collision accidents in the jiangsu section a tug captain from the nanjin port tug and lighter company and he has often requested for tug assistance for maritime accidents a captain from the ocean going ship and he has worked more than 20 years in the nanjin tanker corporation the four experts are invited to make judgments on each rule and the average value is used for the cpts since the condition for beaching is a popular response option to collision accidents the cpts for two associated nodes a condition for slope and condition for beaching are given in table 6 as shown in table 6 it can be seen that when the ship length is less than 100 m it is better to beach the ship on the shallow waters with a slope of 15 if the ship length is from 100 m to 200 m the appropriate slope of shallow waters for such beaching is from 15 to 18 if the ship length is more than 200 m the appropriate slope of shallow waters for such beaching is from 18 to 24 moreover by introducing the extended if then rules it can well describe whether the slope of shallow waters is good or bad for beaching for example when the ship length is from 100 m to 200 m and the slope of shallow water is less than 15 it can be seen that the condition for slope is good with a belief degree of 0 3 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 7 from this result it can be seen that the condition for slope is relatively bad but it is not 100 bad which reflects the advantages of if then rules when describing the consequent similarly the cpt of condition for beaching can also be derived and the results are shown in table 7 from this table it can be seen that only 24 i e 2 2 2 3 24 combinations need to be judged however if the condition for slope is not introduced there will be 108 i e 3 3 2 2 3 108 combinations that need to be judged by the experts which is challenging in practice moreover by introducing the condition for slope it is easy to understand how the condition for slope is being influenced by the ship length and slope of shallow waters and also how the condition for beaching is being influenced by the river resident consistency of two ships and condition for slope note that the consistency of the river resident is another key factor to judge whether this shallow waters can be used for beaching or not specifically if the two ships cannot move consistently or the river resident is hard this shallow water is believed to be not good and this can be seen from the cpt of the condition for beaching in this paper the condition for slope condition for beaching flooding water leak stoppage actual flooding water and hull damage are derived by using this extended if then rules method 3 5 introducing utility value for response options selection the final decision making is carried out by introducing the utility value the quantitative relationship between the evaluation variables and the response actions are also derived by using the if then rules take the beaching action as example the established cpt for beaching is shown in table 8 it can be seen from this table that if the condition for beaching is favourable the beaching option can be taken however if the condition for beaching is not favourable it is difficult for a ship to take this option in practice similarly the cpt for other options i e continue sailing tug assistance and abandon ship can also be derived for the sake of space these cpts are not given but only some principles that can be discovered from the cpt tables are given the conditions for continue sailing is very rigorous and it can only be taken when the mechanical damage is undamaged the actual flooding water is not quick and the minimum freeboard is more than 76 mm this is owing to the following three reasons 1 if the mechanical damage is damaged the ship cannot use its rudder and paddle 2 if the actual flooding water is quickly the ship will suddenly be filled with flooding water and the stability will quickly decreased which may cause the ship capsizing 3 if the minimum freeboard is less than 76 mm the ship cannot safely float on the water the tug assistance option cannot be taken when the tug cannot arrive in a relatively short time and the flooding water is quickly the last choice for the response actions to collision accidents is to abandon the ship if there is no other better choices can be taken 4 case study of decision support for collision accidents in yangtze river 4 1 scenario description of collision accident on 7 march 2013 a collision accident occurred close to the no 65 buoy in the downstream of yangtze river the two ships were jinzeng 18 and kaihangxing 19 both ships were inbound and 35 crew members in total were on board the wind speed was around 5 beaufort scale the accidents caused the forepeak flooding of jinzeng 18 finally this ship beached on the shallow water close to no 66 buoy the detailed information of this collision accident is shown in table 9 note that the information is derived from the database in the jiangsu maritime safety administration 4 2 derivation of the state values of the evaluation variables after obtaining the prior information in table 9 it is easy to derive the state values of the evaluation variables of the emergency decision making model for collision accidents by using the genie software it is easy to achieve this by setting evidence on the input variables for example as the node of dead slow ahead to prevent the ships separation is feasible the decision maker only have to select set evidence on the feasible state after setting the evidence on all the input variables the result can be derived as shown in fig 6 the state values of the evaluation variables can be derived and the results are shown in table 10 from this table it can be seen that the natural environment is good with a belief degree of 0 50 is normal with a belief degree of 0 30 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 20 this is because both the wind speed and the current speed were moderate which makes the natural environment not very good but acceptable for the leak stoppage the mechanical damage was undamaged with a belief degree of 0 90 and was damaged with a belief degree of 0 10 this is because the collision part was in the stem from the accident development these two ships were not damaged with their rudders and paddles as both the collision speed and collision angle are moderate the hull damage is serious with a belief degree of 0 30 is moderate with a belief degree of 0 50 and is slight with a belief degree of 0 20 this agrees with the accident information only the jinzeng 18 ship was damaged with a hole in the forepeak after leak stoppage the actual flooding water is seriously with a belief degree of 0 08 is moderately with a belief degree of 0 35 and is slightly with a belief degree of 0 57 another thing should be mentioned is the state values of evaluation variables related to the beaching as the slope of the shallow water is suitable for the collided ship it is good with a belief degree of 0 90 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 10 after inference moreover the condition for beaching is also good in this scenario which is good with a belief degree of 0 88 is normal with a belief degree of 0 10 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 03 4 3 acquisition of the best response action for collision accident the final decisions can be made by deriving the utility value of each option which is shown in fig 6 and the comparison among four response actions are shown in table 11 from this table it can be seen that the best option is beaching in this scenario and the continuous sailing ranks second while the tug assistance and abandon ship rank third and fourth respectively the result is reasonable because the collided ship finally beached on the shallow water close to no 66 buoy in fact the beaching is taken because the ship flooding is not seriously therefore the ship will not have a large probability to capsize moreover the condition for beaching is good which can be seen from table 10 that the condition for beaching is good with a belief degree of 0 88 therefore the ship can beach on the shallow waters to avoid influencing the passing by ships since this waterway is very busy continuing to sail is another feasible option in this scenario when a ship is not seriously damaged and her rudder and propeller are not damaged the ship can navigate along its own proposition with good conditions or with some damage in the forepeak since beaching on the shallow waters is better than continuing to sail in this scenario this option is not selected in practice tug assistance ranks third because the tug can only arrive in around 30 min however as the collided ships should take response actions in a quite limited time which makes this option only rank third if the arrival time can be reduced to 15 min this can be easily implemented by changing the state value of arrival time of tug the utility value will be changed from 0 556 to 0 748 and this option will be ranked second this is because without the help of tug the damaged ship may have some limitation in manoeuvrability and the risk of maritime accidents may increase during the continue sailing process abandon ship is often the last choice when response options are considered in this scenario this option ranks fourth because there are other better choices as stated before this option can only be taken when the ship is flooding quickly after taking leak stoppage and the collided ship cannot beach on the shallow waters in fact when setting evidence on the actual flooding water as quickly and the condition for beaching as bad the utility value of abandon ship will be changed to 0 40 while the utility values for other options will be reduced which makes this option have to be taken 4 4 benchmarking validation of the developed decision making model the accuracy of the results of the response actions in the yangtze river and the reliability of the proposed decision making model can be tested using the benchmarking validation technique this is carried out by comparing the results of using the well established evidential reasoning method which is also used in the previous study yang et al 2008 to validate the reliability of the developed decision making model the evidential reasoning method is used to calculate the results of the four response actions given the same inputs the results based on the ids software are as shown in table 12 however it takes more than 20 min for an experienced user to calculate the results because the user has to build the influencing factors twice if it is associated with two evaluation variables the results indicate that the proposed decision making model is reliable in the case study because the results are consistent with the results using the well established evidential reasoning method compared with the evidential reasoning method the developed decision making method has prominent advantages in terms of the transparency and easiness in calculation that s because the graphical structure of bn is intuitive to describe the relationships among the influencing factors moreover the hierarchical structure in evidential reasoning requires the user to build it twice if the influencing factor is associated with two evaluation variables therefore the evidential reasoning is much more time consuming than the bn model 4 5 decision making for collision accident considering uncertainty as the emergency decision making is limited in time the decision maker i e captain may not collect the complete information i e 100 which includes uncertainty e g 10 for example the captain may have 10 belief degree doubt on the dead slow ahead to prevent ships separation is unfeasible which can be described by the dead slow ahead to prevent ships separation is feasible with a belief degree of 0 90 and is unfeasible with a belief degree of 0 10 in this case the developed model can also be used for decision making to illustrate this decision making process several state values of influencing factors have been changed to the information with uncertainty the detailed original and changed information are shown in table 13 by using the changed information it can be seen that the utility values for four response actions are changed see fig 7 the beaching option is changed from 0 85 to 0 74 which has reduced a lot because the condition for beaching has been changed to be a little bad the tug assistance ranked second under this new scenario though the utility value has only reduced by 0 02 this is because the utility value of continue sailing has reduced a lot i e from 0 57 to 0 45 for further analysis the minimum freeboard has changed with 30 uncertainty which makes it is hard to judge whether this ship can safely navigate with the forepeak damaged another merit of the bn based decision making model is that it can also change the values of the evaluation variables for example after inference the hull damage is seriously with a belief degree of 0 21 is moderately with a belief degree of 0 37 and is slightly with a belief degree of 0 43 which can be seen in fig 6 in practice if the captain discovers that the hull is seriously or slightly damaged the captain can directly change this state value by ignoring the inference result that considering the dwt and other factors in order to illustrate this an example is used in this section the detailed information is as follows 1 the mechanical damage is undamaged 2 hull damage is moderate 3 the condition for slope is good with a belief degree of 0 89 and is bad with a belief degree of 0 11 the result has been changed and shown in fig 8 by changing these values it can be seen that the utility value of beaching is 0 78 which has been increased and it means that the captain should be confident to select this response option therefore this merit will make the proposed model especially useful if there are two options with approximately equal utility value and the updated information can provide a practical tool to help the captain to make decisions 5 discussion in this paper the expert judgements are used to derive the cpts this is quite different from the data driven decision making model which only uses historical data to quantify the influencing factors wu et al 2016 two reasons for using expert judgements are as follows first the collision accident is different from the not under control incident the collision may cause some fatalities and shipwrecks from the historical data while the not under control incident has caused few fatalities this means some of the collision accidents have not been well handled and improvement are needed in this response process therefore the historical data which includes some data that has caused fatalities should be not considered second introducing expert judgements can have a well understanding on the accident development process moreover if the decision maker has new information on the evaluation variables it is easy for him to directly update the information on the evaluation variables which has been illustrated in subsection 4 5 and it is especially useful when the utility values of two or more options are approximately equal when developing the three layer decision making model for the collision accidents the historical data is used to derive the four options i e continuing to sail beaching tug assistance and abandon ship moreover from the statistical data the beaching option is the most popular option for emergency response to maritime accidents this is owing to the distinguishing characteristics of the yangtze river specifically there are a large amount of shallow waters along the yangtze river and if the condition for the shallow waters e g slope and river resident is suitable for beaching the majority of ships upon a collision will take this option however this might be quite different in the open sea because there will not be suitable shallow waters available for beaching and if the on board flooding cannot be effectively prevented the captain will have to abandon ship 6 concluding remarks in this paper a novel emergency decision making model is proposed for collision accidents when developing this three layer decision making model the bn method is introduced by developing the graphical structure and cpts to represent the qualitative and quantitative relationships the merits of the proposed method include the intuitive representation of accident development easy to implement ability to deal with incomplete information and updated information from the case study by applying the proposed model to the yangtze river it can be seen the selected option is unanimous with the real case which means the proposed model is useful for emergency response to collision accidents however it should be mentioned that when applying this method to other waterways e g the open sea this decision making may be different for example compared with the yangtze river there will not be so many shallow waters for beaching and the crews have to prevent the ship from capsizing before the helicopter arrived credit

21009,the most severe accidents in the maritime sector involve fire or stability loss due to flooding such accidents result in the loss of life and property as well as environmental pollution the prevention of such severe outcomes of maritime accidents requires fast and effective responses hence accurate accident information must be provided to decision makers to develop an emergency response furthermore information regarding an accident s development over time must be provided to formulate a targeted response this paper describes a performance based on board damage control system for ships instituted when a fire or flooding occurs a sensor network is adapted to detect fires and flooding the developed sensor network uses a digital inclinometer cctv network and real time locating system for the crew and wave radar system fire spread and ship behavior due to flooding in the time domain are simulated based on fire and flooding accident scenarios subsequently the results are compiled into a system database as an important information source for decision makers on board accident conditions and response actions can be communicated to on shore stations in real time via a long term evolution maritime network and satellite system the system can be used as an evaluative tool for accident response crew training keywords ship safety fire flooding on board damage control performance based system 1 introduction the initial on board response during a maritime accident is critical for minimizing damage as rapid support cannot yet be obtained from external sources the extent and scale of damage and loss of life increase rapidly when an initial response fails therefore good operational conditions must be maintained or the crew on a ship must remain safe through an efficient response in the initial stages of an accident to achieve this aim a rapid accident detection is required next the prediction of effects based on the location and scale of an accident as time passed must be provided to the decision maker particularly considering sea conditions in cases of flooding subsequently an appropriate response procedure must be established based on the present conditions and predictions finally imprudent decisions and actions by on board decision makers owing to urgency and fear must be prevented through real time communication via synchronized on board and on shore systems an on board damage control system that can support decision making was developed the system includes a sensor network emergency response procedures communication between on board and on shore teams training support and a control console furthermore it tracks crew locations and employs a database of fire and flooding accident simulations the developed system was installed on a training vessel for testing and verification a firefighting drill was performed on the vessel using the developed system from fire alarm initiation to fire suppression the system and procedures involved were operated well 2 current state of related technologies and systems 2 1 technologies for fire and damage safety studies regarding methods to improve fire safety performance in the ship design stage has primarily focused on cruise vessels hakkarainen 2009 fireproof 2012 kang et al 2017 the international maritime organization imo has introduced an alternative design and arrangements imo 2006 it is solutions which deviate from the prescriptive requirements of solas regulations but which are suitable to satisfy the intent of the respective regulations in the design stage of a large passenger ship e g the oasis of the seas an alternative design solas ch ii 2 reg 17 was applied levander 2010 extensive fire simulations and fire hazard analysis were used to verify that equal safety were achieved in the selected main vertical zone for that cruise ship the length and area of the selected main vertical zone were designed and approved based on a large size rather than a regulation requirement even though performance based fire simulation technologies are applied in the ship design stage on board damage control systems have not yet been adopted to achieve an optimal response to a flooding accident research was performed to obtain an optimal counter flooding tank or de ballasting tank reducing roll angle based on a knowledge based system and a case based system olcer and majumder 2006 lee 2006 a knowledge based decision support system kdds for on board damage control was researched calabrese et al 2012 a fuzzy distributed expert system singrar to decide repair priorities and resource assignment technology to response damage condition was developed and validated simões marques and pires 2003 nunes and simões marques 2013 furthermore research has been conducted regarding ship stability and behaviors in consideration of progressive flooding and waves soding 2002 santos et al 2002 emin et al 2004 lee et al 2007 varela et al 2014 choi et al 2014 performance based damage simulation technologies have been applied in the ship design stage to enhance ship safety in emergency situations based on damage scenarios lee et al 2012 recently after the costa concordia disaster studies regarding ship damage safety considering on board progressive flooding simulation have been performed braidotti and mauro 2019 2020 these studies focused on reducing the calculation time for on board use however the wave effect was disregarded and only the static condition was considered 2 2 current damage control systems damage control systems were initially developed for navy vessels particularly for battleships damage control systems ensure ships maintain engagement capabilities after being damaged through an enemy attack or by accident with the development of information and communication technologies this system now uses sensors networks databases remote control technologies and so on to support the decision making process for emergency response methodologies for the flooding extent and breach assessment of damaged passenger ships were investigated using coupling flooding level sensors and time domain flooding simulation technology pennanen et al 2015 ruponen et al 2017 rupone et al 2019 karolius et al 2020 the cruise line international association clia former iccl has sought the imo to develop on board damage control systems to improve ship safety and prevent the loss of life from maritime accidents imo 2002 such a system should allow one to monitor and control accessible fire safety systems damage control equipment and decision support systems furthermore the clia has emphasized the need for shore based emergency operation centers to provide full accident support to ships imo 2002 to improve the safety of large passenger ships in an emergency such damage control systems have been developed and implemented on numerous cruise ships on a voluntary basis martec 2020 the main functions of recently developed and reserved systems include accident detection by sensors monitoring control emergency shutdown functions crew locating stability calculation and decision making support 2 3 challenges existing systems only provide an ignition compartment in the case of a fire and ensure stability in calm waters in response to hull damage the spread of fire smoke and heat due to fire is critical for monitoring firefighting and evacuation purposes additionally ship behaviors with progressive flooding and wave effects in cases of hull damage are essential for maintaining ship stability such information is essential for a decision maker to develop an appropriate response in performance based simulations simulation tools must be applied immediately using the necessary on board data although time domain progressive flooding simulation technologies for on board tools to assess the damage stability and safety of passenger ships have been investigated most of them focused on static stability only to improve accuracy simulations should be updated frequently ruponen et al 2019 after a damage occurs only a limited amount of time is available to perform counter actions to mitigate the flooding risk of capsizing the instant estimation of the time to capsize or time to evacuation involves several uncertain variables and requires rapid computational methods if a rapid calculation method will be available in the near future it can then be installed as part of an on board damage control system while considering the wave effect the delphi emergency decision support system edss assumes and claims a database where a significant set of damage scenarios and their evolution in time obtained by numerical simulations under various loading and environmental conditions are stored trincas et al 2017 therefore in this study a database that stores performance based simulation results for on board emergency response was adapted to build a database accident scenarios based on ship characteristics such as ship size and internal arrangement as well as operational routes to determine environmental conditions such as waves can be evaluated for example hull damage cases involving grounding and collision can be investigated from casualty analysis data and ship characteristics subsequently performance based simulations can be performed for each case while considering various wave heights and directions the simulated wave data can be selected based on ship operational routes and ship sizes and types in cases of fire fire simulations can be performed while considering the characteristics of ship features such as the engine rooms galleys and cabins finally fire and flooding simulation results can be stored as part of a database subsequently similar accident cases can be referenced from this database such that a decision maker can establish a response plan when an accident occurs technologies for crew location tracking data sharing between on board and on shore systems and training support facilities were investigated and developed and the developed system was implemented and tested on a training vessel the system was investigated and developed over a 5 year project to improve maritime safety lee et al 2019 3 system development 3 1 sensor network a ship comprises many sensors such sensors are designed based on different specifications signal characteristics and interface protocols by manufacturers in the present study several types of sensors such as smoke flame and heat detectors for fires and flooding detectors as well as level gauges for flooding were analyzed for signal characteristics and interface protocols based on product specifications a cctv network was used to collect visual information a digital inclinometer was employed

execution time insufficient domain knowledge of general crew members and complexities of simulation software stability safety and ship behavior under hull damage conditions must be evaluated and predicted considering progressive flooding and real wave effects following an accident the total number of damage cases is affected by the ship size and its internal compartment and arrangement a large cruise ship with many compartments can result in many damage cases unlike tankers or bulk carriers with simple arrangements in this study 54 collision damage cases on the ship side shell yellow circle and 19 grounding damage cases at bottom green circles were analyzed while considering the internal arrangement of the training ship as shown fig 4 the main specifications of the ship hanbando are shown in table 2 it was assumed that the number of compartments damaged due to an accident ranged from one to four this number depends on the extent of damage to the sides and bottom of the ship the maximum damage extent and depth by collision and grounding were derived from imo mepc 110 49 imo 2003 three different damage sizes hole existed for each damage case the wave considered had eight angles with a 45 interval for the head beam following and quartering sea the wave height adopted for the simulation was the mean wave height 1 88 m 3 25 m and 5 m for sea states 4 5 and 6 where the

response procedures and actions from on board accident detection to completion were translated to on shore systems via long term evolution maritime lte maritime for coastal routes and via satellite for ocean routes the on board and on shore systems are basically the same but the on shore system does not connect the ship s sensor network and crew location tracking in other words the on shore system has the same console database and user interface as the on board system when an accident is detected by a sensor the sensed data are analyzed and transmitted to the console system in a simple and small sized format subsequently the console is activated by the received signal and accident information such as the location and type of accident display on the console with a user interface for example in the case of fire fire simulation results in the time domain are extracted from the database based on accident information and displayed on the console furthermore a response procedure including evacuation is suggested the information such as analyzed location and type of accident and analyzed crew location is transmitted to the on shore system via lte maritime or satellite simultaneously the on shore system is activated in the same manner if new events such as new sensor signals decision making injuries and actions occur in the ship then the event information is also transmitted to the on shore system therefore the console of the on board and on shore systems maintain and display the same information except for the cctv video because the data size is extremely large for transmission subsequently an on shore engineer or officer can advise when an on board decision maker has initiated an ineffective response 3 5 training support according to the emergency training and drills regulation 19 chapter iii of solas all crew members must participate in at least one abandoned ship drill and one fire drill every month and details of such on board training must be recorded in a log book prescribed by the administration imo 2009 the regulations rules and guidelines of administration and the documents of shipping companies and institutes for crew training were investigated to incorporate training support facilities into the developed system as shown in table 3 14 items were measured in the training scenario important information such as the dates times crew members involved equipment mobilized orders and procedures were recorded in the system during training subsequently an official document was produced to evaluate the training results after training the system was used to validate the injury due to fire scenario during a regular fire drill in the training ship 3 6 user interface and console we developed a simple user friendly interface to limit errors and improve response times based on our consultation with several hundred experts including crew members captains training instructors researchers and shipping company specialists the system

shown fig 7 c the large red circle indicates major events the green circle the completion status including the related response the yellow circle the partial completion with related actions and the white colored circle represents not responded yet it was reproduced by converting a screen shot from korean to english for the readers the zones or compartments affected by fire in the case of a fire accident are displayed at the middle and right upper parts of the ship plan as shown in fig 7 b the class a fire at the second deck forepart occurred and the system extracted simulation results such as the temperature smoke and evacuation time from the fire simulation database the spread of temperature and smoke from the fire origin to the upward and adjacent areas as time progressed occurred through the corridor vent and opened connection the risk of the zone being affected by fire in this was evaluated based on the temperature smoke height and available evacuation time as shown in table

validation the system components were tested for functionality from an on shore virtual signal processor after validating the system functionality the system was tested in a ship environment we can confirm that each component adapted well to the ship systems i e fire sensors cctv cameras communication protocols etc the data sharing between the on board and on shore systems operated well via lte maritime and satellite communication hence all components were integrated into the system which is known as the kriso damage control system we used a training ship to test the system in a real ship environment a 3 d model of hull form and arrangement was built and a performance based simulation for the database was performed for fire and flooding accident cases finally the system was installed into the ship s system a regular fire drill was performed on the ship based on the regulations fire sensors were activated by artificial smoke for training purposes and the system was activated from standby mode the locations of the activated sensor and compartment were shown on the screen of the system console subsequently the system yielded fire simulation results from the database cctv data

crew members involved in the fire drill was 19 i e 13 for fire suppression three for handling one injured person one system operator and one decision maker the system was effectively installed on an existing ship and operated well through a fire drill 4 concluding remarks when a maritime accident occurs it is imperative to respond quickly and efficiently based on accurate information hence all pertinent information available to a decision maker must be provided in a suitable form such information must be intuitive readable unambiguous and straightforward useful data include information regarding accident type fire and flooding locations expected accident developments and response procedures in this study a sensor network that immediately detects accidents through sensors a crew location tracking system a fire and flooding simulation database a system for information sharing between ship and on shore stations and a training support system was tested developed and installed on an existing ship we confirmed that the system operated well in a real ship environment fire detection crew tracking on shore communication and fire response based on response procedures and fire simulation database results operated normally during a fire drill maritime accidents are inevitable despite efforts to limit their occurrence therefore the developed system will be essential to limit

21009,the most severe accidents in the maritime sector involve fire or stability loss due to flooding such accidents result in the loss of life and property as well as environmental pollution the prevention of such severe outcomes of maritime accidents requires fast and effective responses hence accurate accident information must be provided to decision makers to develop an emergency response furthermore information regarding an accident s development over time must be provided to formulate a targeted response this paper describes a performance based on board damage control system for ships instituted when a fire or flooding occurs a sensor network is adapted to detect fires and flooding the developed sensor network uses a digital inclinometer cctv network and real time locating system for the crew and wave radar system fire spread and ship behavior due to flooding in the time domain are simulated based on fire and flooding accident scenarios subsequently the results are compiled into a system database as an important information source for decision makers on board accident conditions and response actions can be communicated to on shore stations in real time via a long term evolution maritime network and satellite system the system can be used as an evaluative tool for accident response crew training keywords ship safety fire flooding on board damage control performance based system 1 introduction the initial on board response during a maritime accident is critical for minimizing damage as rapid support cannot yet be obtained from external sources the extent and scale of damage and loss of life increase rapidly when an initial response fails therefore good operational conditions must be maintained or the crew on a ship must remain safe through an efficient response in the initial stages of an accident to achieve this aim a rapid accident detection is required next the prediction of effects based on the location and scale of an accident as time passed must be provided to the decision maker particularly considering sea conditions in cases of flooding subsequently an appropriate response procedure must be established based on the present conditions and predictions finally imprudent decisions and actions by on board decision makers owing to urgency and fear must be prevented through real time communication via synchronized on board and on shore systems an on board damage control system that can support decision making was developed the system includes a sensor network emergency response procedures communication between on board and on shore teams training support and a control console furthermore it tracks crew locations and employs a database of fire and flooding accident simulations the developed system was installed on a training vessel for testing and verification a firefighting drill was performed on the vessel using the developed system from fire alarm initiation to fire suppression the system and procedures involved were operated well 2 current state of related technologies and systems 2 1 technologies for fire and damage safety studies regarding methods to improve fire safety performance in the ship design stage has primarily focused on cruise vessels hakkarainen 2009 fireproof 2012 kang et al 2017 the international maritime organization imo has introduced an alternative design and arrangements imo 2006 it is solutions which deviate from the prescriptive requirements of solas regulations but which are suitable to satisfy the intent of the respective regulations in the design stage of a large passenger ship e g the oasis of the seas an alternative design solas ch ii 2 reg 17 was applied levander 2010 extensive fire simulations and fire hazard analysis were used to verify that equal safety were achieved in the selected main vertical zone for that cruise ship the length and area of the selected main vertical zone were designed and approved based on a large size rather than a regulation requirement even though performance based fire simulation technologies are applied in the ship design stage on board damage control systems have not yet been adopted to achieve an optimal response to a flooding accident research was performed to obtain an optimal counter flooding tank or de ballasting tank reducing roll angle based on a knowledge based system and a case based system olcer and majumder 2006 lee 2006 a knowledge based decision support system kdds for on board damage control was researched calabrese et al 2012 a fuzzy distributed expert system singrar to decide repair priorities and resource assignment technology to response damage condition was developed and validated simões marques and pires 2003 nunes and simões marques 2013 furthermore research has been conducted regarding ship stability and behaviors in consideration of progressive flooding and waves soding 2002 santos et al 2002 emin et al 2004 lee et al 2007 varela et al 2014 choi et al 2014 performance based damage simulation technologies have been applied in the ship design stage to enhance ship safety in emergency situations based on damage scenarios lee et al 2012 recently after the costa concordia disaster studies regarding ship damage safety considering on board progressive flooding simulation have been performed braidotti and mauro 2019 2020 these studies focused on reducing the calculation time for on board use however the wave effect was disregarded and only the static condition was considered 2 2 current damage control systems damage control systems were initially developed for navy vessels particularly for battleships damage control systems ensure ships maintain engagement capabilities after being damaged through an enemy attack or by accident with the development of information and communication technologies this system now uses sensors networks databases remote control technologies and so on to support the decision making process for emergency response methodologies for the flooding extent and breach assessment of damaged passenger ships were investigated using coupling flooding level sensors and time domain flooding simulation technology pennanen et al 2015 ruponen et al 2017 rupone et al 2019 karolius et al 2020 the cruise line international association clia former iccl has sought the imo to develop on board damage control systems to improve ship safety and prevent the loss of life from maritime accidents imo 2002 such a system should allow one to monitor and control accessible fire safety systems damage control equipment and decision support systems furthermore the clia has emphasized the need for shore based emergency operation centers to provide full accident support to ships imo 2002 to improve the safety of large passenger ships in an emergency such damage control systems have been developed and implemented on numerous cruise ships on a voluntary basis martec 2020 the main functions of recently developed and reserved systems include accident detection by sensors monitoring control emergency shutdown functions crew locating stability calculation and decision making support 2 3 challenges existing systems only provide an ignition compartment in the case of a fire and ensure stability in calm waters in response to hull damage the spread of fire smoke and heat due to fire is critical for monitoring firefighting and evacuation purposes additionally ship behaviors with progressive flooding and wave effects in cases of hull damage are essential for maintaining ship stability such information is essential for a decision maker to develop an appropriate response in performance based simulations simulation tools must be applied immediately using the necessary on board data although time domain progressive flooding simulation technologies for on board tools to assess the damage stability and safety of passenger ships have been investigated most of them focused on static stability only to improve accuracy simulations should be updated frequently ruponen et al 2019 after a damage occurs only a limited amount of time is available to perform counter actions to mitigate the flooding risk of capsizing the instant estimation of the time to capsize or time to evacuation involves several uncertain variables and requires rapid computational methods if a rapid calculation method will be available in the near future it can then be installed as part of an on board damage control system while considering the wave effect the delphi emergency decision support system edss assumes and claims a database where a significant set of damage scenarios and their evolution in time obtained by numerical simulations under various loading and environmental conditions are stored trincas et al 2017 therefore in this study a database that stores performance based simulation results for on board emergency response was adapted to build a database accident scenarios based on ship characteristics such as ship size and internal arrangement as well as operational routes to determine environmental conditions such as waves can be evaluated for example hull damage cases involving grounding and collision can be investigated from casualty analysis data and ship characteristics subsequently performance based simulations can be performed for each case while considering various wave heights and directions the simulated wave data can be selected based on ship operational routes and ship sizes and types in cases of fire fire simulations can be performed while considering the characteristics of ship features such as the engine rooms galleys and cabins finally fire and flooding simulation results can be stored as part of a database subsequently similar accident cases can be referenced from this database such that a decision maker can establish a response plan when an accident occurs technologies for crew location tracking data sharing between on board and on shore systems and training support facilities were investigated and developed and the developed system was implemented and tested on a training vessel the system was investigated and developed over a 5 year

training and drills regulation 19 chapter iii of solas all crew members must participate in at least one abandoned ship drill and one fire drill every month and details of such on board training must be recorded in a log book prescribed by the administration imo 2009 the regulations rules and guidelines of administration and the documents of shipping companies and institutes for crew training were investigated to incorporate training support facilities into the developed system as shown in table 3 14 items were measured in the training scenario important information such as the dates times crew members involved equipment mobilized orders and procedures were recorded in the system during training subsequently an official document was produced to evaluate the training results after training the system was used to validate the injury due to fire scenario during a regular fire drill in the training ship 3 6 user interface and console we developed a simple user friendly interface to limit errors and improve response times based on our consultation with several hundred experts including crew members captains training instructors researchers and shipping company specialists the system requirements including the console user interface redundancy functional and interlocking requirement response strategy and decision support were categorized and evaluated based on consultation the items related to the user interface and console are shown in table 4 according to the four principles of user interface design intuitiveness efficiency learnability and flexibility the items were designed with a console considering almost all requirements in the initial research stage a console with two screens was designed developed and tested recently to reduce weight and occupied space and to improve visibility a new console with a single 55 inch touchscreen was adapted a user can use the touchscreen to create a single or partitioned screen fig 7 shows screenshots of the console the left part in fig 7 a shows the ship plan view the red vertical line indicates the watertight bulkhead and the sky blue vertical line indicates the main vertical zone the cctv images in the ship s major compartments and positions are confirmed in the upper right part the monitoring system for water mist systems in the ship display are shown as rectangles at the right lower part under the cctv images whereas the monitor for co2 systems are shown as circles as shown in fig 7 a fig 7 b shows the fire accident response screen and the procedure involved the left part in the screen shows the response procedure all activities such as recognition and confirmation for fire location and type evacuation deployment of firefighting team injuries and operation of automatic firefighting equipment from beginning to termination are shown the operator of the system should mark the response events during the response process to improve visibility and readability they were represented as a graph as shown fig 7 c the large red circle indicates major events the green circle the completion status including the related response the yellow circle the partial completion with related actions and the white colored circle represents not responded yet it was reproduced by converting a screen shot from korean to english for the readers the zones or compartments affected by fire in the case of a fire accident are displayed at the middle and right upper parts of the ship plan as shown in fig 7 b the class a fire at the second deck forepart occurred and the system extracted simulation results such as the temperature smoke and evacuation time from the fire simulation database the spread of temperature and smoke from the fire origin to the upward and adjacent areas as time progressed occurred through the corridor vent and opened connection the risk of the zone being affected by fire in this was evaluated based on the temperature smoke height and available evacuation time as shown in table 5 and fig 8 aset and rset in table 5 indicate the available safe egress time and required safe egress time respectively in fig 7 b the red zone indicates very danger amber indicates danger and yellow green indicates caution the graphical symbols for accident response are shown in the lower right part of fig 7 b and the symbols are marked at the lowest position of the middle part automatically or by the user for example the symbols are marked to denote fire occurrence black smoke spread thermal diffusion insensible injury etc in the white rectangular box in fig 7 b 3 7 system installation and validation the system components were tested for functionality from an on shore virtual signal processor after validating the system functionality the system was tested in a ship environment we can confirm that each component adapted well to the ship systems i e fire sensors cctv cameras communication protocols etc the data sharing between the on board and on shore systems operated well via lte maritime and satellite communication hence all components were integrated into the system which is known as the kriso damage control system we used a training ship to test the system in a real ship environment a 3 d model of hull form and arrangement was built and a performance based simulation for the database was performed for fire and flooding accident cases finally the system was installed into the ship s system a regular fire drill was performed on the ship based on the regulations fire sensors were activated by artificial smoke for training purposes and the system was activated from standby mode the locations of the activated sensor and compartment were shown on the screen of the system console subsequently the system yielded fire simulation results from the database cctv data and crew locations the ship commander controlled the entire process until fire suppression and all information collected during the fire drill was recorded in korean in the system the total number of crew members involved in the fire drill was 19 i e 13 for fire suppression three for handling one injured person one system operator and one decision maker the system was effectively installed on an existing ship and operated well through a fire drill 4 concluding remarks when a maritime accident occurs it is imperative to respond quickly and efficiently based on accurate information hence all pertinent information available to a decision maker must be provided in a suitable form such information must be intuitive readable unambiguous and straightforward useful data include information regarding accident type fire and flooding locations expected accident developments and response procedures in this study a sensor network that immediately detects accidents through sensors a crew location tracking system a fire and flooding simulation database a system for information sharing between ship and on shore stations and a training support system was tested developed and installed on an existing ship we confirmed that the system operated well in a real ship environment fire detection crew tracking on shore communication and fire response based on response procedures and fire simulation database results operated normally during a fire drill maritime accidents are inevitable despite efforts to limit their occurrence therefore the developed system will be essential to limit the loss of life maritime pollution and property loss from maritime accidents the system is not an absolute solution that addresses all types of accidents however it is applicable as an on board
