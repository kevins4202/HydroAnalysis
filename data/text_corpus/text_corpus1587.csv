7935,study region the area of interest comprises 1 6 million km² of the horn of africa extending 60 km offshore the gulf of aden and indian ocean and delimited by the tana river in kenya and the rift valley in ethiopia study focus deep 400 m groundwater resources are virtually unexplored in the horn of africa one of the main challenges in this vast and sparsely documented area is producing solid geological models this paper presents a first order assessment of the deep structure and water resources in the region based on the integration of data from hydrogeological and oil gas exploration public domain cross sections geological maps and satellite data are reinterpreted defining the extent of formations in the subsurface the data integration benefits from using a multi source modelling platform subsurface mapping software from the oil gas and hydrogeology sectors and proprietary scripts new hydrological insights the present study reveals new evidence of the presence of deep aquifer systems in the horn of africa the model outputs include the extent predicted thickness salinity and petrophysical properties of the potential aquifers the results of this first extensive 3d subsurface model for the region provide new hydrogeological insights into potential transboundary aquifers and can be used as a baseline for further investigations and ultimately for quantifying the total water resources in the region graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater resources somalia somaliland east africa geological model deep aquifers 1 introduction large parts of east africa are suffering from water scarcity driven by low precipitation high evapotranspiration and contamination of shallow resources fao swalim 2012 in these arid regions the available natural water resources are thus largely restricted to groundwater in somalia which is increasingly affected by drought and extreme weather events extraction of groundwater resources is generally limited to aquifers of up to a few 10 100 s of meters deep in the subsurface and the extent of aquifers deeper than 400 m is still largely unknown fao swalim 2012 if developed these deep aquifers could represent an additional source of fresh and low salinity water for local communities worldwide conventional hydrogeological boreholes generally focus on shallow and easily exploitable aquifers few 100 s of meters however there are examples of deeper fresh groundwater aquifers that have proved to be very productive margat and van der gun 2013 examples are the nubian sandstone aquifer el rawy and de smedt 2020 gonçalvès et al 2013 mazzoni et al 2018 ruden 2016 sultan et al 2007 which reaches depths of 3500 m the upper mega aquifer system at the arabian platform at more than 450 m depth abotalib et al 2019 and the great artesian basin in australia up to 3000 m deep fensham et al 2021 habermehl 2020 in east africa a groundwater exploration project based in tanzania used for the first time oil gas o g hereafter data to identify a deep aquifer which has since been exploited moe et al 2017 ruden 2007 this deep coastal aquifer extends over an area of approximately 1000 km2 and is ca 1000 m deep on average moe et al 2017 ruden 2007 in somalia the potential presence of deep freshwater aquifers has been indicated by previous authors quiroga 2020 quiroga et al 2022 and this offers a new opportunity to expand the concepts driving exploration for current groundwater resources however a regional model of the distribution of these deep aquifers is still lacking constructing a regional geological model for the horn of africa is the first fundamental step needed to evaluate the extent of these potential deep aquifers this task is challenging as data is scarce and its accessibility limited due to 1 the current social political situation which limits the opportunity to collect data from specific areas in the field and 2 the loss of data previously acquired and stored in the country due to the civil war in the 1990 s this study assembles the most updated and complete dataset of geological and hydrogeological data available in the wider region of the horn of africa including somalia and uses a specifically built workflow to filter and analyze the data the regional model builds upon the successful previous approach based on the integration of hydrogeological data and geophysical and geological data acquired by the o g industry this novel approach resulted in the discovery of the kimbiji aquifer in tanzania moe et al 2017 ruden 2007 ruden 2009 our new 3d model of the horn of africa is entirely based on public domain information and enables the prediction of potential deeper aquifers the initial literature analysis included documents containing 261 cross sections which were subsequently filtered for completeness and quality fig 1 the study workflow included the combined use of open access gis analytical software qgis and industry standard software for subsurface well seismic data interpretation available under license petrel in addition the data input was filtered and cleaned using a proprietary script and the data format was adapted to the requirements of the software the scale of the maps upon which this work was based ranges between 1 100 000 for local maps limited to a few locations and 1 2000 000 scale for regional maps abbate et al 1993 carmignani et al 1983a carmignani et al 1983b conti 1989 kazmin 1972 merla et al 1979 and the grid spacing amongst the cross sections varies from 5 km to 100 km therefore producing a variable resolution the key outputs of the model include the maps of 13 formations which are relevant for the hydrostratigraphic setting of the region further results are the analysis of freshwater indications in relation to the modelled surfaces the integration of hydraulic heads derived from pressure tests in o g wells quiroga et al 2022 and of the values formation porosity and permeability of the most relevant modelled surfaces or hydrostratigraphic units finally we use the model to predict the regional scale distribution of aquifers based on the extent of the formations and their predicted thickness and their lithological and petrophysical properties our approach to 3d geological modelling is applicable at a wide scale for mapping the potential for deep fresh aquifers in other regions worldwide 2 background studies 2 1 geographical climatic and hydrogeological setting the study area is approximately 1 6 million km2 and covers from west to east from the rift valley in ethiopia to 60 km into the indian ocean and from south to north from the lake and river tane in kenya to 60 km off the shoreline of the gulf of aden this region covers the whole of somalia and parts of eastern ethiopia and northern kenya representing the majority of the horn of africa fig 2 the area is characterized by relatively low relief in most of somalia and areas of higher relief in ethiopia with mountains that are more than 4000 m high in the eastern part of the ethiopian highlands appendix a in somalia the highest mountain is in the north along the gulf of aden coast 2400 m high there are only two perennial rivers in somalia the juba and shebelle which have vast seasonal variability and have their main catchments in the ethiopian highlands fao swalim 2012 elsewhere the rivers are ephemeral and only flow for a few hours or days per year at the present day the horn of africa has an arid to semi arid climate in somalia and coastal kenya and a savanna to sub tropical climate in the ethiopian highlands peel et al 2007 the horn of africa has frequent occurrences of severe droughts and is equally plagued by floods on average the annual rainfall in the north northeast and the central plateaus is up to 300 mm in the wettest places and between 500 mm and 600 mm in the ethiopian highlands o dochartaigh et al 2016 the precipitation is influenced by rainy seasons which normally occur from april to may and october to november in somalia however due to climate change these two rainy seasons are increasingly absent in the horn of africa shukla et al 2021 rainfall is not constant in time neither is groundwater recharge fleitmann and matter 2009 nicholson et al 2020 schaebitz et al 2021 tierney et al 2015 important recharge events most likely coincided with humid periods thousands to up to a million years ago therefore aquifers in arid regions can hold water that is dated to be thousands to millions of years old bierkens and wada 2019 ram et al 2020 sultan et al 2007 this is especially the case for aquifers that are at 400 m depth or even deeper as these aquifers are isolated from modern day climate change they could serve as a reliable water source when exploited sustainably therefore understanding the paleoclimate and climate predictions for the future are as important as understanding the present day recharge the geological model described in this paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the pathways of recharge to deeper aquifers 2 2 geological setting studies on the geology of the horn of africa started in the early 1900 s and until the post second world war years currie et al 1925 gregory 1900 gregory 1925 stefanini 1913 stefanini 1936 weir 1925 an increase in geological outputs followed the onset of o g exploration in the area azzaroli and merla 1957 azzaroli and de angelis 1965 merla et al 1979 merla et al 1979 significant contributions to understanding the regional geology of the study area were made by several authors before the civil war in 1991 barnes 1976 bosellini 1989 fantozzi et al 1990 kamen kaye and barnes 1979 piccoli et al 1986 purcell 1979 schunemann 1984 between 1987 and 1991 abbate and co authors compiled maps papers with regional and local maps marine and subsurface geology and subsequently published a comprehensive geological map abbate et al 1993 more recent local geological studies covered the anza basin bosworth and morley 1994 morley et al 1999 and daroor and nogal basins ali and lee 2019a ali and watts 2013 ali and watts 2021 ali and lee 2019b the geological history of the horn of africa is characterised by several rifting phases alternating with subsidence and tectonic quiescence this influenced the lithology and the permeability distribution of the sediments in the subsurface and hence of the aquifers with the mesozoic to early paleocene formations virtually unexplored for fresh groundwater most of the sedimentary units consist of marine and continental margin sedimentary rocks of mesozoic and tertiary age unconformably deposited on pre cambrian basement metamorphic and igneous rocks fig 2 the main sedimentary basins of the region include the lamu anza mandera lugh coastal ogaden nogal daroor and buban basins and the bur acaba high and nogal uplift areas abiikar 2012 purcell 1979 fig 3 alluvial and fluvial deposits of quaternary holocene ages cover most of the southeastern coastal area fig 2 2 3 stratigraphy the precambian basement outcrops mainly in the coastal regions in northern somalia and in the bur area in the south of somalia the bur area has two different complexes the olontole formation and the upper dinsor formation the olontole formation mainly has paragneisses and amphibolites where the dinso formation consists of metasediments where marbles and quartzites are dominant bakos and sassi 1980 d amico et al 1981 daniels 1965 in northern somalia basement rocks are uplifted and crop out on the surface sommavilla 1977 with two distinct units the upper inda ad formation and the lower older formation d amico et al 1981 daniels 1965 the upper inda ad formation is characterized by an abundance of meta sandstones occurrence of meta conglomerates and marbles and low grade metamorphism the older formation consists mainly of metasediments and acid to basic metamorphic igneous rocks some carbonate rocks occur locally d amico et al 1981 daniels 1965 during the late carboniferous to early permian the horn of africa had a predominantly continental setting where most of the land was exposed and therefore had locally widespread subaerial erosion bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 the oldest sedimentary unit present in the area is the adigrat formation late triassic to early jurassic fig 2 which was mostly deposited in fluvial fluvio lacustrine and deltaic environments upon a peneplained pre cambrian rock surface abbate et al 2015 mohr 1971 the adigrat formation represents the mesozoic pre rift sequence and is regionally widespread the basal contact with the underlying paleozoic basement and the karoo equivalent rift clastics in basal areas is erosional bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 luger et al 1990 as the formation lacks the abundance of fossils exact dating is difficult both the top and the base of the formation are interpreted to be diachronous the top of the formation is gradually younger towards the north and northeast reaching callovian to kimmeridgian age abbate et al 1993 merla et al 1979 piccoli et al 1986 the adigrat sandstone is exposed in the south of ethiopia and somalia along the northern coast of somalia st john 2015 and in smaller outcrops in the north of somalia fantozzi and ali kassim 2002 inland from the marine jurassic facies of east africa continental karoo type sediments were deposited mohr 1971 in the middle jurassic breakup of pangaea occurred a period of global highstand and a marine transgression resulted in the deposition of the limestones of the hamanlei formation conformable over the adigrat formation abbate et al 1993 merla et al 1979 st john 2016 fig 2 the hamanlei formation consists of fossiliferous marine shelf carbonates interbedded with shale and finer sand beds in southern somalia and in parts of ethiopia oolitic and coralline limestone beds are present in northern somalia anhydrite is interbedded with dolomite and limestone map in appendix c the formation is pliensbachian to kimmeridgian in age abbate et al 2015 ali and watts 2016 barnes 1976 bosellini 1989 in the north of the study area the berriasian barremian interval is generally absent and sediments of aptian age are transgressing over jurassic terrains from east to west the hamanlei formation is also referred to as the meregh bihen formation and baidoa formation ali and watts 2016 angelucci et al 1984 angelucci et al 1983 the upper parts of the hamanlei formation usually show a high degree of fracturing and karstic cavities the most extensive observed karst development is in the area near borama location in appendix c where the limestone has probably been exposed continuously since the jurassic fao swalim 2012 this formation provides a good shallow aquifer system in the awdal region location in appendix c with numerous springs originating from karstified jurassic limestones faillace 1983 fao swalim 2012 the separation of africa and madagascar marked the end of rifting and the onset of a steady phase of regional subsidence bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 a transgression related to this drifting phase resulted in the deposition of a shaly succession over most of east africa referred to as the uarandab formation fig 2 the uarandab formation is a marly and shaly limestone of callovian oxfordian to kimmeridgian age ali kassim et al 2002 st john 2016 and it is considered one of the main source rocks for hydrocarbons in the area hunegnaw et al 1998 plummer et al 1998 the formation is deposited in an open deep marine and low energy environment and it is also referred to as the anole formation bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 bruni and fazzuoli 1976 shigut 1998 st john 2016 the gabredarre formation overlies the uarandab formation and it consists of a shallowing upwards well bedded limestone composed of bioclastic calcarenites oolitic grainstones and thin shaly and marly interbeds which are prograding towards the east bosellini 1989 map in appendix c in the north of somalia the gabredarre formation is referred to as the gawan formation ali and lee 2019a macfadyen 1933 in the ogaden basin the gabredarre formation represents a passive margin sequence hunegnaw et al 1998 the gabredarre formation is only found in northern somalia due to the effects of post jurassic erosion ali and watts 2016 during the early cretaceous central somalia was a shallow gulf largely surrounded by land in this embayment dolostones and sulfates main gypsum formation fig 2 accumulated in sabkhas lagoons and shallow water abbate et al 2015 bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 this succession records several sea level oscillations and represents the final stages of the mesozoic flooding in the ogaden basin abbate et al 2015 the anhydrite and gypsum deposits are mostly in eastern ethiopia and parts of northern somalia in the coastal somalia to the indian ocean early cretaceous deposits are mostly shaly limestones and limestones purcell 1979 in the lamu embayment the lower cretaceous deposits are characterized by marine grey shale and shaly limestones peterson 1985 to the southeast a major fluviatile system the ambar sandstone prograded northeast into a wide restricted marine shelf bosellini 1989 the gumburo formation is composed of limestones with fossiliferous beds and shaly dolomitic and evaporite beds and was deposited between aptian turonian fig 2 the formation is also referred to as the mustahil ferfer and belet uen formations or the gira sequence bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 st john 2016 this period of deposition was marked by relative tectonic quiescence with a stable shallow marine carbonate shelf and open deep marine conditions in the most easterly part of the study area the transgressive jessoma sequence overlies a major early maastrichtian unconformity caused by regional uplift and faulting and the formation of east west trending horsts and grabens bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 tuck martin et al 2018 the jessoma formation gradually changes from sediments of fluvial and shallow marine origin with continental fluvial sandstones in the west through marginal shallow marine shelf carbonates to deep water basinal shales in the east bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 map in appendix c during the late paleocene to early eocene the transgression created an open shallow marine carbonate shelf across the horn of africa resulting in the deposition of the first marine deposits after the upper cretaceous to lower paleocene emersive phase the auradu formation fig 2 carbone et al 1993 macfadyen 1933 the auradu formation also marks the last major marine flooding of the africa craton carbone et al 1993 the auradu formation overlies the jessoma formation unconformably and covered the northeast of the area of interest and the daroor basin with shallow marine limestones bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 appendix d and c the auradu formation deposits are rich in corals mollusks and foraminifers and represent an important karstified shallow groundwater aquifer in north somalia fao swalim 2012 map in appendix c the base is diachronous and in most parts of central and nw somalia this is attributed to the paleocene or early eocene bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 while in the ne of somalia it contains marine faunas of maastrichtian age luger et al 1990 the regressive taleh formation deposited in eocene consists of mostly evaporites with shelf limestones and dolomite bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 massive to banded anhydrite was mostly deposited in the nogal and daroor basins whereas in the central and southern part of somalia deposited shelf limestones and shallow marine sands boeckelmann and schreiber 1990 the anhydrite is often altered to gypsum on the present day surface the taleh formation can be karstified with examples of karstic caves in the gypsum at sool plateau north somalia fao swalim 2012 the karkar formation deposited during a following transgression event in the late eocene depositing marly nodular limestones containing rich shallow marine fauna azzaroli 1950 stefanini 1925 the formation is characterized by alluvial and deltaic deposits in the northeast of the study area at the base there are laminated claystones interbedded with gypsum and anhydrite bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 the karkar formation is only deposited in the northeastern part of the study area indicating that probably most of the horn of africa was being uplifted and exposed at this time karstic springs exist in the karkar formation in northern somalia fao swalim 2012 the most recent rifting event related to the opening of the gulf of aden started in the oligocene in the early oligocene the eastern part of the study area was subaerially exposed most likely because of a major tectonic uplift and deformation the oligo miocene succession is now mostly restricted to a narrow and discontinuous coastal belt bosellini 1986 bosellini et al 1987 the oligo miocene syn and post rift sequences outcropping in the northeastern coast of somalia are referred to as the guban series azzaroli and merla 1957 fantozzi 1996 equivalent series are the duban formation and hafun series stefanini 1937 a regional marine transgression occurred in the late oligocene miocene followed by a miocene highstand bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 the quaternary deposits are characterized by alluvial deposits dune fields and beach deposits fantozzi and ali kassim 2002 these deposits outcrop in southern somalia around mogadishu and near the juba and shabelle rivers abbate et al 1993 3 material and methods the basis of the geological model shown in this study is the digitization and integration of several cross sections collected from earlier hydrocarbon exploration reports geological reviews and research studies of the horn of africa 152 documents were reviewed to extract 38 cross sections the formation tops from 63 oil wells fig 3 and the geologic maps the gathered data were integrated into the 3d model as shown in fig 3 and appendix e1 the spatial coverage of the data is variable with the daroor nogal east ogaden coastal and anza basins showing good coverage with an irregular grid of 5 100 km spacing fig 3 data coverage in the central regions is sparser with a spatial resolution between 10 km and 500 km the reliability of the references was rated based on the input information where the quality indicator a is given to studies that had access to seismic and or oil well drilling data b to publications based on previous studies but with little or no access to oil data and c when no documented sources were presented by authors with presumed access to relevant data appendix e2 a lithostratigraphic chronostratigraphic and facies review was carried out to ensure uniformity in formation names throughout the area of study for example in the ogaden basin the gumburo sandstone is part of the karoo sediments from the late permian early triassic while in northern somalia gumburo is a formation from the cretaceous which consists mainly of carbonates for this study the name gumburo refers to the carbonate formation from the cretaceous another example is the karoo and adigrat sandstones in the past the failure to recognize the permian sedimentary cycle in ethiopia and the presence of triassic continental sandstones in kenya have complicated regional and local correlations of this unit purcell 1979 in the coastal and lamu basins the sandstone sediments from the permian and triassic are named karoo while in the ogaden nogal and daroor basins these are referred to as adigrat in the literature for this study the authors refer the permian and triassic sandstones to the adigrat formation 3 1 workflow the main methodological challenge of this study was bridging the gap between the file types and proprietary formats used for reservoir interpretation and modelling in the o g industry software petrel and the ones handled by hydrogeological modflow and surface geospatial data software qgis in order to address this challenge and achieve the integration between the typical hydrogeological studies focused on surface and shallow geology and o g reservoir characterization data focused on deeper formations a specific workflow was created which includes python scripts to enable file format conversion data filtering and cleaning this workflow is repeatable and consists of iterative steps between qgis and petrel and python and visual modflow flex vmf software fig 4 to integrate o g well logs and seismic data e g in las format with hydrogeological data derived from images or text files two main sets of data were collected and used for the regional mapping geological and structural maps and cross sections these data are derived from hydrocarbon exploration reports geological reviews and research studies of the horn of africa including published papers and conference presentations appendix e2 maps and cross sections were extracted as pdf or image jpg png files and later georeferenced in qgis where the corner point coordinates were extracted subsequently maps were imported as surface images in petrel surface geology maps were also imported as shape files shp and converted to surfaces by using elevation data a similar approach was used with cross sections in addition the collection of cross sections was filtered by 1 area of interest 2 availability of location information that allowed georeferencing and 3 vertical units available in depth units rather than in two way travel time twt which is a common format for seismic data derived cross sections fig 4 the location maps of the selected cross sections were then georeferenced in qgis finally the selected cross sections were loaded into petrel with their location maps which were used for spatially locating the cross sections for each cross section the interpreted formation tops were digitized and reinterpreted where needed using the polygon tool in petrel while faults were interpreted or digitized from geological maps using the insert fault tool tops or horizons in terms of geological age e g top of jurassic were converted to formation tops based on their lithological and chronostratigraphic description and based on the correlation with well data where available finally the polygons were converted into surfaces to be used as an input for the 3d geological model faults from surface geology maps abbate et al 1993 kamen kaye and barnes 1979 and satellite imagery source google earth were digitized and included in the initial database appendix a as the aim was to produce a first pass large scale model only the faults that were likely to have an impact on the regional aquifer distribution and had been interpreted on cross sections were selected the number of faults therefore appearing in the 3d model appendix d is a much reduced subset of the total number of faults originally interpreted appendix a surface geology well tops and contour maps found in the literature were also integrated into the structural modelling process after the 3d geological model was built in petrel horizons were converted to structure surfaces and exported in ascii x y z format the resulting surfaces and faults were separately imported in visual modflow flex where the final hydrogeological model and grid were built 4 results the data collection and analysis allowed us to extract the building blocks of the 3d geological model consisting of mapping the extent of the main geological units associating them with the indications of freshwater in deep formations from o g wells the level of confinement and estimations of porosity and permeability in the mapped units the constructed model and resulting maps are very regional as the main purpose of the study is to introduce the methodology and the new hydrogeological insights of the potential cross boundary aquifers linked to the overall water recharge in the highlands of ethiopia ruden 2017 4 1 mapping of main surfaces the definition and correlation of the units across the entire horn of africa region pose a real challenge mostly due to differences in lithological description and interpretation e g different facies hiatuses and nomenclature assigned to time equivalent units in order to address this issue and minimize potential correlation errors we established a combination of several criteria for surface selection including stratigraphic relevance regional extent importance in the hydrogeological context and data control ultimately surface definition was primarily based on lithostratigraphy but where formations were coeval over the entire area also on geological age the reinterpretation of geological maps and cross sections across the regions allowed producing regional maps that show the extent and depth of the main formations in the 3d geological model these formations are considered the main hydrostratigraphic units that build our 3d model priority was given to the following formation tops which are from oldest to most recent see fig 2 the paleozoic weathered and fractured basement fig 5a appendix d and f this formation is one of the most important and prolific reservoirs of water in rural africa in the geological model one of the largest basement outcrops is in the bur acaba area absolute age 615 my the fissured zones of the crystalline rocks are a potential infiltration route for water however the quality of the water from fissures in the region is generally poor moreover wells with water of very good quality but with a limited yield are found in fault zones faillace 1983 for this study the top 300 m of the basement formation along the area of study fig 5a is assumed to be a potential aquifer with fair vertical permeability while the deeper basement is considered a confining bed aquitard the adigrat formation fig 5b appendix d and f this is a fine to coarse grained feldspathic sandstone with limestone intercalations of late triassic to early jurassic age in the highlands of ethiopia the adigrat sandstones represent a potential aquifer and also a pathway of deep groundwater to the east coast to reduce the complexity of the model the karoo and adigrat sandstone are modelled as a single unit as having similar lithology and petrophysical properties fig 5b the hamanlei formation fig 5c appendix d and f this formation was deposited in the late to middle jurassic and consists primarily of limestone with some intercalations of shale and sandstone this formation is expected to play an essential role in transporting water from the western highland recharge areas to the deep sedimentary basins hamanlei formation suggests that groundwater circulation takes place mainly in this zone karst normally conveys water at much higher flow velocities than traditional porous or fractured aquifers in hydrogeological terms karst aquifers are characterized by high flow velocities low residence time and low storage volumes ruden 2017 therefore water in karstic aquifers is less prone to mineralization than the slower moving counterpart in porous or fractured rocks the gabredarre formation fig 5d appendix d and f this is also referred to as dawan formation and it was deposited in the late jurassic in the lamu and ogaden basins this formation consists mainly of grey argillaceous and calcareous marlstones with interbedded argillaceous limestones and dolomites the lateral variation in lithology throughout the study area required independent modelling of the surface in order to assign the specific petrophysical properties according to the facies the main gypsum formation appendix d it outcrops over large areas of the western basin and extends into the mandera lugh trough where it consists of gypsum and limestone with interbedded shales the ambar sandstone in the mandera lugh basin and the gorrahei carbonates in ethiopia are chronostratigraphically equivalent the main gypsum is considered a potential aquitard because of its low porosity and permeability the gumburo formation fig 5e appendix d and f this includes the the belet uen ferfer and gira formations and was deposited in the late cretaceous fig 5e the formation consists mainly of highly fractured limestone in the nogal and part of daroor basins while in the western side of the model the lithology changes to siliciclastic shoreline and continental sediments purcell 1979 the secondary porosity of the gumburo formation in the carbonate facies makes it suitable for conveying and storing groundwater the jessoma formation fig 5f appendix d and f this formation underlies much of the ogaden basin and extends to the buban daroor and nogal basins and horn of africa it consists of fine grained sandstones in the east transitioning to shallow carbonates in the west from the late cretaceous to the early tertiary age in places this formation has a deep water table several 100 s meters holds saline water and is difficult to drill kebede 2012 kebede 2012 also reports potable water and frequent loss of circulation problems in this formation while drilling pathways for water transfer are still poorly understood and reside either in limestone members within the sandstone series or alternatively within fractures and faults networks kebede 2012 in either case the observed water circulation may imply significant water potential the auradu formation appendix d and f it consists of massive limestone beds alternating with chalky and gypsiferous beds and calcareous shales deposited since the paleocene drilling operations in the auradu formation are considered difficult due to circulation losses when drilling through karst kebede 2012 nonetheless other authors ullah 2016 highlight that the most productive water well of the northeast of the area of interest at 50 l s was drilled in this formation in ceerigabo the taleh formation appendix d this was deposited in the early eocene and it is a typical evaporitic formation deposited in a shallow sea in arid climate it consists of a sequence of massive and dense anhydrite beds with intercalations of limestone and gypsum lateral changes of facies from gypsum and anhydrite to limestone are known in some places fao swalim 2012 due to the low permeability of this formation the taleh formation is a potential aquitard the karkar late eocene and daban formations oligocene appendix d these formations are neogene and quaternary in age and have been modelled separately for the purposes of this study they are both considered part of the shallow aquifers system the interpretation and mapping of the basement adigrat and hamanlei formations is supported by good data coverage and distribution providing solid structural control for the base of the model fig 5 these formations have been extensively described in the literature except in the lamu basin and south of the mandera lugh basin where o g wells did not reach the jurassic the vertical extent of the jurassic and older formations in these two basins is instead based on gravimetry maps and interpretations published by previous authors abbate et al 2015 kamen kaye and barnes 1979 piccoli et al 1986 schunemann 1984 the top part of the model is controlled by the topography and the outcrops of formations as shown on geological maps these formations were digitized from surface geology maps and subsequently updated or reinterpreted using satellite imagery where needed 4 2 distribution of hydrostratigraphic units facies maps and predicted thickness the potential extent of the hydrostratigraphic units used in our model is defined by the current extent after erosion of the related formation and by the facies which is directly linked to their original depositional environment existing facies maps were used to characterise the expected lithology and quality of aquifer bosellini 1992 purcell 1979 while the thickness of the unit is derived from the interpretation of the related formation on the petrel 3d model figs 6 and 7 show such examples for the adigrat formation while facies and thickness maps for all the formations are presented in appendix c and g due to the size of the area of study and the limited data available the grid resolution of the constructed model was set to 10 10 km therefore input data with a spatial resolution higher than 10 km is not considered and smoothed by the model as a consequence in areas with high data coverage such as the nogal and daroor basins the resulting surfaces do not accurately cross the interpreted formation tops thus the regional thickness maps do not always represent the correct local thickness of formations and they should be used only as an indication of where there is a good chance of finding the targeted formations 4 3 freshwater indications in oil exploration data the distribution of the hydrostratigraphic units obtained with the 3d geological model was cross checked against the freshwater indications found in o g exploration wells in order to ground truth their potential as aquifers quiroga et al 2022 used the combination of resistivity gamma ray spontaneous potential density neutron porosity and photoelectric effect logs with drill stem dst and repeat formation tests rft to identify formations filled with freshwater in northern somalia and somaliland table 1 summarizes the findings of freshwater reported in the literature over the area of study for the purposes of this study water with a concentration of less than 5000 mg l tds total dissolved solids is considered freshwater water ranging from 5000 10 000 mg l tds is considered brackish water in excess of 10 000 mg l tds is considered saline from north to south the regions that reported the most freshwater indications in deep aquifers are the daroor the nogal the ogaden basin and the lamu basin a series of vertical cross sections extracted from the 3d model have been selected to indicate the structure of the geological formations together with the related freshwater indications in these key areas figs 8 to 11 location in fig 3 the northern part of the horn of africa is particularly rich in indications of deep freshwater aquifers but this could be due to a data bias as they are the basins with the highest data coverage occurrence of low salinity deep water in the nogal basin was documented in connection with o g exploration in the well nogal 1 ali and lee 2019b the jessoma formation was interpreted to be flushed by fresh water that could have migrated by juxtaposition from the auradu formation ali and lee 2019a ali and lee 2019b quiroga 2020 and quiroga et al 2022 report the potential for fresh deep groundwater in the daroor and nogal basins after analysing data from seven wells drilled for hydrocarbon exploration in the nogal and daroor basins table 1 and appendix b the formations that have indications of low salinity water are the auradu limestone jessoma sandstone and limestone gumburo highly fractured limestone sandstone and shale gabredarre limestone and anhydrite hamanlei limestone and sandstone and adigrat sandstone and interbedded limestone formations in the ogaden basin the gherbi 1 well drilled in 1974 by teneco on the northwest flank of the basin tested fresh water from the adigrat formation sandstone the upper hamanlei formation limestone and anhydrite in this well tested salt water purcell 1979 the gumburo 1 well drilled by the sinclair petroleum company in 1950 tested freshwater in the gumburo formation carbonate marl evaporites and brackish to salty water in the hamanlei formation carbonate piccoli et al 1986 in the eastern ogaden region the well abred 1 was drilled and abandoned in 1963 without significant hydrocarbons shows the cretaceous section tested fresh water and the hamanlei and adigrat formations yielded salt water purcell 1979 the cretaceous formations in the ogaden basin which are interpreted to be flushed with freshwater are present at greater depths in the lamu basin the offshore well pomboo 1 drilled by woodside in 2007 on a thrust anticline encountered a thick late cretaceous clastic sequence which included campanian sands and no hydrocarbons were encountered davison and steel 2018 4 4 hydraulic properties of the potential aquifers porosity and permeability data have been collected from o g studies and reports for the adigrat gumburo jessoma and auradu formations fig 12 the adigrat formation shows average porosities of 5 15 and values of up to 20 in ethiopia purcell 1979 in the northern part of the study area the well buran 1 encountered 2 5 md of horizontal permeability in the upper section of the adigrat formation up to 450 md for the middle and lower adigrat and a maximum of 50 md of vertical permeability in the nogal basin the well burhisso 1 reported a horizontal and vertical permeability of respectively 180 md and 125 md the gumburo formation has permeabilities of 0 5 8 md in buran 1 and 11 13 md in yaguri 1 in the lower gumburo the well burhisso 1 encountered a horizontal permeability of 9 md and a vertical permeability of 14 md fig 12 the well buran 1 encountered good reservoir properties in the jessoma formation with average porosities of 20 40 the well reported horizontal permeabilities of 280 840 md and vertical permeabilities of 140 920 md in the burhisso 1 well the permeabilities of the jessoma formation ranged from 260 to 510 md and up to 1200 md in shabeel north 1 in the same formation fig 11 limited information is available from the auradu formation as it is found at relatively shallow depths and therefore not a target for oil prospects in the buran 1 well permeabilities were reported between 81 and 145 md in the auradu carbonates fig 12 equivalent freshwater heads and distribution can be derived from pressure data recorded in onshore and offshore petroleum wells varma and michael 2012 the level of confinement of the potential aquifers in the nogal and daroor basins is determined from oil exploration data in quiroga et al 2022 table 2 although the aquifers are confined the pressure is not sufficient for the wells to be artesian in the two basins oil well exploration data on the other basins are necessary to derive further conclusions on the level of confinement of the rest of the system 4 5 potential extent of the deep aquifers the results from our analysis show the potential stacked aquifers in areas with significant data control based on the 3d geological model and on the data on freshwater occurrences from o g data shallow wells and springs faillace 1983 fao swalim 2012 quiroga 2020 quiroga et al 2022 ullah 2016 ah 2016 fig 13 significant aquifer potential is observed regionally for the adigrat hamanlei gabredarre gumburo jessoma auradu units of these units while the most recent and shallowest i e auradu and jessoma cretaceous to paleocene have been previously recognised as regional or local aquifers the oldest ones i e adigrat hamanlei gabredarre and gumburo jurassic to cretaceous are here reported for the first time as potential deep aquifers it should be considered that the predicted maps do not guarantee the presence of sufficient thickness of the formation far from the control points where the surfaces have been extrapolated to map viable aquifers in targeted follow up studies it is important to go back to the local data and or construct more localized models with higher grid resolution the recommended use of the maps is twofold for water resources exploitation only in areas close to the o g wells with indications of freshwater and for the definition of larger potential prospecting areas in areas far from oil wells control by re gridding and adding new data 5 discussion 5 1 aquifer potential of the hydrostratigraphic units the results of this study show that amongst the 13 geological units analysed regionally six are potential aquifers adigrat hamanlei gabredarre gumburo jessoma auradu appendix h and three are potential aquitards taleh main gypsum and uarandab fig 1 however lateral lithology variability in certain units such as the main gypsum might determine local changes to this regional hydrostratigraphic setting and should be addressed on a case by case basis the regional geological model presented in this study can be used as the initial input for groundwater simulations to understand the flow and pressure conditions at the boundaries of the more localized hydrogeological models and to select relevant focus areas in the horn of africa the basement outcrops extensively in the highlands of ethiopia where it is overlain by permeable carbonate formations this study confirms that this specific geological setting is especially suitable for deep groundwater storage and flow towards the east coast the high potential for deep 400 m freshwater has been demonstrated by a combination of low salinity water observations favorable physical properties and the extent of aquifers at considerable distance several 100 s of kilometers from the recharge areas the depth of recorded freshwater occurrences can be significant and reaches up to 2000 m tvd for values of 5 g l nacl quiroga 2020 quiroga et al 2022 however the regional extent of the aquifers as shown in the results of this study can provide a possible range of depths at various locations which can be explored in the context of other factors such as local water demand vs supply and socio economical and political considerations to define the exploitability of deep groundwater in a defined region the geological model shows regionally consistent good aquifer properties with high permeability and porosity values in the jessoma and auradu units lower values and less favorable aquifer properties were recorded for the adigrat and gumburo units however currently the information available is more limited for deeper units such as adigrat and gumburo if available further data on permeability and secondary porosity across the entire model could help determine the groundwater travel time and its preferential pathways and possibly more favorable physical property distribution for the deeper units currently data from the o g wells drilled in the region is only partly published and available if additional information is added to the model it can be used to provide further insights and help develop a complete hydrogeological model for the horn of africa region the data collected in this study also suggest the potential relevance of structural features such as faults to either facilitate or limit the flow of groundwater at depth by putting aquifers in juxtaposition or by compartmentalising them furthermore the extensive presence of carbonate formations points to karst development as a potential important feature for the creation of permeability and groundwater flow regionally ruden 2017 a thorough analysis of the timing of faults versus the age of sediments and of the degree and type of karstification of the units will be instrumental to understand the role of these two factors in facilitating vertical connection between aquifers if there is vertical communication between the aquitards and aquifers the high sulfate content so4 of gypsum and anhydrite rocks from the aquitards such as the main gypsum and taleh units could contaminate the underlying formations which further study will have to establish through the geochemical analysis of water samples from the deep aquifers 5 2 limitations to the model and way forward constructing a 3d geological model from data of the public domain in such a vast area where deep hydrogeology is sparsely documented has limitations due to the use of information from heterogeneous sources which are different in terms of coverage scales and accuracy even though a data quality assessment was performed in this study appendix e2 it only refers to the amount of data available for this study and it is inevitable that there is a large variation in the reliability of the cross sections and of the mapped geological units the main factor behind the uncertainty in data analysis is the heterogeneity of interpretations published by several sources given the fact that not all authors have access to the same data some interpretations used extrapolation and interpolation methods with limited source information for example in the case of the lamu basin a difference of more than 2000 m is observed for the top of the basement formation between two different sources piccoli et al 1986 schunemann 1984 this produces uncertainty in stratigraphic correlations and in the definition of physical properties derived from interdisciplinary sources as another example the differences between o g and hydrogeological methods used to calculate hydraulic heads from o g pressure tests carry an implicit uncertainty related to the density and viscosity of the water and should be addressed if any more exact data are needed in the planning stage for any drilling activities the spatial distribution of equivalent hydraulic heads assuming a homogeneous aquifer with water of uniform density can provide information on the regional groundwater flow paths which in turn could be used to calibrate the groundwater flow modelling in future work however in the case of a variable density formation water environment representing the flow of the water with hydraulic heads can be challenging and other factors should be considered such as aquifer geometry pressure temperature and salinity the buoyancy component porosity and permeability bachu 1995 bachu and michael 2002 davies 1987 jorgensen et al 1982 lusczynski 1961 oberlander 1989 post et al 2007 to provide further refinement to the 3d geological model future work should include the quantification of uncertainty and definition of acceptable error ranges by means of statistical analysis this is particularly relevant if the data points constitute a significant statistical sample the improvement of the compatibility of surfaces made in petrel with the hydrological modelling software modflow was chosen in this current study but as this software is not able to handle eroded or pinching out formations the geological units are currently modelled as continuous surfaces with zero thickness when absent which is not ideal as it may not represent the actual geology the estimation of daily water recharge and its geospatial distribution to assess the sustainability of the system in terms of extraction the integration of water chemistry composition and aquifer properties into the model to identify preferential groundwater flow paths and travel time the construction of more localized geological models e g for each basin with the definition of the boundary conditions and the initial conceptual model based on the results of the current regional groundwater modelling the implementation of a conceptual model which includes the vertical structure of the aquifers hydrostratigraphic sections proposing different case scenarios that could meet the actual boundary conditions additionally identifying new sources of water in arid and semi arid countries characterized by extreme poverty requires cross sectoral approaches the use of existing data and technology from the o g industry for the characterization of deeper aquifers can now be considered a potential solution next to the more conventional approaches such as water harvesting desalination and shallow groundwater however a thorough cost benefit analysis and feasibility of different solutions need to be considered when planning for the exploration and exploitation of these resources 6 conclusions this study illustrates the ability of defining a 3d geological model entirely based on published and open access data in vast and logistically challenging territories of the east african regions struck by water scarcity furthermore it paves the way to other regional hydrogeological studies where an interdisciplinary approach can provide new input data to models and improve their calibration the new 3d geological model of the horn of africa shows the full extent of a series of units that potentially host deep aquifers in the region after reviewing 152 documents of public domain the regional geological model was constructed based on 38 cross sections unpublished reports formation tops from 63 oil wells and open access geological maps the lithology variations with depth the facies maps of the horn of africa and the 3d model were used to define the vertical structure of the aquifers and to build a first regional deep hydrostratigraphic model importantly the workflow used is cross disciplinary integrating hydrogeological data with public domain data from o g exploration studies the differences in file formats stratigraphic units and measurements collected in the two disciplines have been overcome with a workaround to combine o g with hydrogeology software the results from this study can be used to build a full hydrogeological model of the region and ground truth it with the collected evidence for deep freshwater in deep wells previously drilled by the o g industry and with the values of hydraulic heads calculated from their pressure tests aquifer properties such as porosity permeability and pressure were transferred from the hydrocarbon context and used in the hydrogeology context with due considerations due to the deeper reach compared to conventional hydrogeological data geophysical and wells it is important to note that hydrocarbon exploration data is irreplaceable in the identification of deep aquifers based on the cross correlation of the mapped hydrostratigraphic units with the observed regional freshwater indications six regional units were identified as potential aquifers adigrat hamanlei gabredarre gumburo jessoma auradu of these units while the most recent and shallowest i e auradu and jessoma cretaceous to paleocene have been previously recognised as regional or local aquifers the oldest ones i e adigrat hamanlei gabredarre and gumburo jurassic to cretaceous are here reported for the first time as potential deep aquifers the recommended use of the maps is twofold 1 for water resources exploitation only in areas close to the o g wells with indications of freshwater 2 for the definition of larger potential prospecting areas in areas far from oil

7935,study region the area of interest comprises 1 6 million km² of the horn of africa extending 60 km offshore the gulf of aden and indian ocean and delimited by the tana river in kenya and the rift valley in ethiopia study focus deep 400 m groundwater resources are virtually unexplored in the horn of africa one of the main challenges in this vast and sparsely documented area is producing solid geological models this paper presents a first order assessment of the deep structure and water resources in the region based on the integration of data from hydrogeological and oil gas exploration public domain cross sections geological maps and satellite data are reinterpreted defining the extent of formations in the subsurface the data integration benefits from using a multi source modelling platform subsurface mapping software from the oil gas and hydrogeology sectors and proprietary scripts new hydrological insights the present study reveals new evidence of the presence of deep aquifer systems in the horn of africa the model outputs include the extent predicted thickness salinity and petrophysical properties of the potential aquifers the results of this first extensive 3d subsurface model for the region provide new hydrogeological insights into potential transboundary aquifers and can be used as a baseline for further investigations and ultimately for quantifying the total water resources in the region graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater resources somalia somaliland east africa geological model deep aquifers 1 introduction large parts of east africa are suffering from water scarcity driven by low precipitation high evapotranspiration and contamination of shallow resources fao swalim 2012 in these arid regions the available natural water resources are thus largely restricted to groundwater in somalia which is increasingly affected by drought and extreme weather events extraction of groundwater resources is generally limited to aquifers of up to a few 10 100 s of meters deep in the subsurface and the extent of aquifers deeper than 400 m is still largely unknown fao swalim 2012 if developed these deep aquifers could represent an additional source of fresh and low salinity water for local communities worldwide conventional hydrogeological boreholes generally focus on shallow and easily exploitable aquifers few 100 s of meters however there are examples of deeper fresh groundwater aquifers that have proved to be very productive margat and van der gun 2013 examples are the nubian sandstone aquifer el rawy and de smedt 2020 gonçalvès et al 2013 mazzoni et al 2018 ruden 2016 sultan et al 2007 which reaches depths of 3500 m the upper mega aquifer system at the arabian platform at more than 450 m depth abotalib et al 2019 and the great artesian basin in australia up to 3000 m deep fensham et al 2021 habermehl 2020 in east africa a groundwater exploration project based in tanzania used for the first time oil gas o g hereafter data to identify a deep aquifer which has since been exploited moe et al 2017 ruden 2007 this deep coastal aquifer extends over an area of approximately 1000 km2 and is ca 1000 m deep on average moe et al 2017 ruden 2007 in somalia the potential presence of deep freshwater aquifers has been indicated by previous authors quiroga 2020 quiroga et al 2022 and this offers a new opportunity to expand the concepts driving exploration for current groundwater resources however a regional model of the distribution of these deep aquifers is still lacking constructing a regional geological model for the horn of africa is the first fundamental step needed to evaluate the extent of these potential deep aquifers this task is challenging as data is scarce and its accessibility limited due to 1 the current social political situation which limits the opportunity to collect data from specific areas in the field and 2 the loss of data previously acquired and stored in the country due to the civil war in the 1990 s this study assembles the most updated and complete dataset of geological and hydrogeological data available in the wider region of the horn of africa including somalia and uses a specifically built workflow to filter and analyze the data the regional model builds upon the successful previous approach based on the integration of hydrogeological data and geophysical and geological data acquired by the o g industry this novel approach resulted in the discovery of the kimbiji aquifer in tanzania moe et al 2017 ruden 2007 ruden 2009 our new 3d model of the horn of africa is entirely based on public domain information and enables the prediction of potential deeper aquifers the initial literature analysis included documents containing 261 cross sections which were subsequently filtered for completeness and quality fig 1 the study workflow included the combined use of open access gis analytical software qgis and industry standard software for subsurface well seismic data interpretation available under license petrel in addition the data input was filtered and cleaned using a proprietary script and the data format was adapted to the requirements of the software the scale of the maps upon which this work was based ranges between 1 100 000 for local maps limited to a few locations and 1 2000 000 scale for regional maps abbate et al 1993 carmignani et al 1983a carmignani et al 1983b conti 1989 kazmin 1972 merla et al 1979 and the grid spacing amongst the cross sections varies from 5 km to 100 km therefore producing a variable resolution the key outputs of the model include the maps of 13 formations which are relevant for the hydrostratigraphic setting of the region further results are the analysis of freshwater indications in relation to the modelled surfaces the integration of hydraulic heads derived from pressure tests in o g wells quiroga et al 2022 and of the values formation porosity and permeability of the most relevant modelled surfaces or hydrostratigraphic units finally we use the model to predict the regional scale distribution of aquifers based on the extent of the formations and their predicted thickness and their lithological and petrophysical properties our approach to 3d geological modelling is applicable at a wide scale for mapping the potential for deep fresh aquifers in other regions worldwide 2 background studies 2 1 geographical climatic and hydrogeological setting the study area is approximately 1 6 million km2 and covers from west to east from the rift valley in ethiopia to 60 km into the indian ocean and from south to north from the lake and river tane in kenya to 60 km off the shoreline of the gulf of aden this region covers the whole of somalia and parts of eastern ethiopia and northern kenya representing the majority of the horn of africa fig 2 the area is characterized by relatively low relief in most of somalia and areas of higher relief in ethiopia with mountains that are more than 4000 m high in the eastern part of the ethiopian highlands appendix a in somalia the highest mountain is in the north along the gulf of aden coast 2400 m high there are only two perennial rivers in somalia the juba and shebelle which have vast seasonal variability and have their main catchments in the ethiopian highlands fao swalim 2012 elsewhere the rivers are ephemeral and only flow for a few hours or days per year at the present day the horn of africa has an arid to semi arid climate in somalia and coastal kenya and a savanna to sub tropical climate in the ethiopian highlands peel et al 2007 the horn of africa has frequent occurrences of severe droughts and is equally plagued by floods on average the annual rainfall in the north northeast and the central plateaus is up to 300 mm in the wettest places and between 500 mm and 600 mm in the ethiopian highlands o dochartaigh et al 2016 the precipitation is influenced by rainy seasons which normally occur from april to may and october to november in somalia however due to climate change these two rainy seasons are increasingly absent in the horn of africa shukla et al 2021 rainfall is not constant in time neither is groundwater recharge fleitmann and matter 2009 nicholson et al 2020 schaebitz et al 2021 tierney et al 2015 important recharge events most likely coincided with humid periods thousands to up to a million years ago therefore aquifers in arid regions can hold water that is dated to be thousands to millions of years old bierkens and wada 2019 ram et al 2020 sultan et al 2007 this is especially the case for aquifers that are at 400 m depth or even deeper as these aquifers are isolated from modern day climate change they could serve as a reliable water source when exploited sustainably therefore understanding the paleoclimate and climate predictions for the future are as important as understanding the present day recharge the geological model described in this paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the pathways of recharge to deeper aquifers 2 2 geological setting studies on the geology of the horn of africa started in the early 1900 s and until the post second world war years currie et al 1925 gregory 1900 gregory 1925 stefanini 1913 stefanini 1936 weir 1925 an increase in geological outputs followed the onset of o g exploration in the area azzaroli and merla 1957 azzaroli and de angelis 1965 merla et al 1979 merla et al 1979 significant contributions to understanding the regional geology of the study area were made by several authors before the civil war in 1991 barnes 1976 bosellini 1989 fantozzi et al 1990 kamen kaye and barnes 1979 piccoli et al 1986 purcell 1979 schunemann 1984 between 1987 and 1991 abbate and co authors compiled maps papers with regional and local maps marine and subsurface geology and subsequently published a comprehensive geological map abbate et al 1993 more recent local geological studies covered the anza basin bosworth and morley 1994 morley et al 1999 and daroor and nogal basins ali and lee 2019a ali and watts 2013 ali and watts 2021 ali and lee 2019b the geological history of the horn of africa is characterised by several rifting phases alternating with subsidence and tectonic quiescence this influenced the lithology and the permeability distribution of the sediments in the subsurface and hence of the aquifers with the mesozoic to early paleocene formations virtually unexplored for fresh groundwater most of the sedimentary units consist of marine and continental margin sedimentary rocks of mesozoic and tertiary age unconformably deposited on pre cambrian basement metamorphic and igneous rocks fig 2 the main sedimentary basins of the region include the lamu anza mandera lugh coastal ogaden nogal daroor and buban basins and the bur acaba high and nogal uplift areas abiikar 2012 purcell 1979 fig 3 alluvial and fluvial deposits of quaternary holocene ages cover most of the southeastern coastal area fig 2 2 3 stratigraphy the precambian basement outcrops mainly in the coastal regions in northern somalia and in the bur area in the south of somalia the bur area has two different complexes the olontole formation and the upper dinsor formation the olontole formation mainly has paragneisses and amphibolites where the dinso formation consists of metasediments where marbles and quartzites are dominant bakos and sassi 1980 d amico et al 1981 daniels 1965 in northern somalia basement rocks are uplifted and crop out on the surface sommavilla 1977 with two distinct units the upper inda ad formation and the lower older formation d amico et al 1981 daniels 1965 the upper inda ad formation is characterized by an abundance of meta sandstones occurrence of meta conglomerates and marbles and low grade metamorphism the older formation consists mainly of metasediments and acid to basic metamorphic igneous rocks some carbonate rocks occur locally d amico et al 1981 daniels 1965 during the late carboniferous to early permian the horn of africa had a predominantly continental setting where most of the land was exposed and therefore had locally widespread subaerial erosion bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 the oldest sedimentary unit present in the area is the adigrat formation late triassic to early jurassic fig 2 which was mostly deposited in fluvial fluvio lacustrine and deltaic environments upon a peneplained pre cambrian rock surface abbate et al 2015 mohr 1971 the adigrat formation represents the mesozoic pre rift sequence and is regionally widespread the basal contact with the underlying paleozoic basement and the karoo equivalent rift clastics in basal areas is erosional bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 luger et al 1990 as the formation lacks the abundance of fossils exact dating is difficult both the top and the base of the formation are interpreted to be diachronous the top of the formation is gradually younger towards the north and northeast reaching callovian to kimmeridgian age abbate et al 1993 merla et al 1979 piccoli et al 1986 the adigrat sandstone is exposed in the south of ethiopia and somalia along the northern coast of somalia st john 2015 and in smaller outcrops in the north of somalia fantozzi and ali kassim 2002 inland from the marine jurassic facies of east africa continental karoo type sediments were deposited mohr 1971 in the middle jurassic breakup of pangaea occurred a period of global highstand and a marine transgression resulted in the deposition of the limestones of the hamanlei formation conformable over the adigrat formation abbate et al 1993 merla et al 1979 st john 2016 fig 2 the hamanlei formation consists of fossiliferous marine shelf carbonates interbedded with shale and finer sand beds in southern somalia and in parts of ethiopia oolitic and coralline limestone beds are present in northern somalia anhydrite is interbedded with dolomite and limestone map in appendix c the formation is pliensbachian to kimmeridgian in age abbate et al 2015 ali and watts 2016 barnes 1976 bosellini 1989 in the north of the study area the berriasian barremian interval is generally absent and sediments of aptian age are transgressing over jurassic terrains from east to west the hamanlei formation is also referred to as the meregh bihen formation and baidoa formation ali and watts 2016 angelucci et al 1984 angelucci et al 1983 the upper parts of the hamanlei formation usually show a high degree of fracturing and karstic cavities the most extensive observed karst development is in the area near borama location in appendix c where the limestone has probably been exposed continuously since the jurassic fao swalim 2012 this formation provides a good shallow aquifer system in the awdal region location in appendix c with numerous springs originating from karstified jurassic limestones faillace 1983 fao swalim 2012 the separation of africa and madagascar marked the end of rifting and the onset of a steady phase of regional subsidence bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 a transgression related to this drifting phase resulted in the deposition of a shaly succession over most of east africa referred to as the uarandab formation fig 2 the uarandab formation is a marly and shaly limestone of callovian oxfordian to kimmeridgian age ali kassim et al 2002 st john 2016 and it is considered one of the main source rocks for hydrocarbons in the area hunegnaw et al 1998 plummer et al 1998 the formation is deposited in an open deep marine and low energy environment and it is also referred to as the anole formation bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 bruni and fazzuoli 1976 shigut 1998 st john 2016 the gabredarre formation overlies the uarandab formation and it consists of a shallowing upwards well bedded limestone composed of bioclastic calcarenites oolitic grainstones and thin shaly and marly interbeds which are prograding towards the east bosellini 1989 map in appendix c in the north of somalia the gabredarre formation is referred to as the gawan formation ali and lee 2019a macfadyen 1933 in the ogaden basin the gabredarre formation represents a passive margin sequence hunegnaw et al 1998 the gabredarre formation is only found in northern somalia due to the effects of post jurassic erosion ali and watts 2016 during the early cretaceous central somalia was a shallow gulf largely surrounded by land in this embayment dolostones and sulfates main gypsum formation fig 2 accumulated in sabkhas lagoons and shallow water abbate et al 2015 bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 this succession records several sea level oscillations and represents the final stages of the mesozoic flooding in the ogaden basin abbate et al 2015 the anhydrite and gypsum deposits are mostly in eastern ethiopia and parts of northern somalia in the coastal somalia to the indian ocean early cretaceous deposits are mostly shaly limestones and limestones purcell 1979 in the lamu embayment the lower cretaceous deposits are characterized by marine grey shale and shaly limestones peterson 1985 to the southeast a major fluviatile system the ambar sandstone prograded northeast into a wide restricted marine shelf bosellini 1989 the gumburo formation is composed of limestones with fossiliferous beds and shaly dolomitic and evaporite beds and was deposited between aptian turonian fig 2 the formation is also referred to as the mustahil ferfer and belet uen formations or the gira sequence bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 st john 2016 this period of deposition was marked by relative tectonic quiescence with a stable shallow marine carbonate shelf and open deep marine conditions in the most easterly part of the study area the transgressive jessoma sequence overlies a major early maastrichtian unconformity caused by regional uplift and faulting and the formation of east west trending horsts and grabens bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 tuck martin et al 2018 the jessoma formation gradually changes from sediments of fluvial and shallow marine origin with continental fluvial sandstones in the west through marginal shallow marine shelf carbonates to deep water basinal shales in the east bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 map in appendix c during the late paleocene to early eocene the transgression created an open shallow marine carbonate shelf across the horn of africa resulting in the deposition of the first marine deposits after the upper cretaceous to lower paleocene emersive phase the auradu formation fig 2 carbone et al 1993 macfadyen 1933 the auradu formation also marks the last major marine flooding of the africa craton carbone et al 1993 the auradu formation overlies the jessoma formation unconformably and covered the northeast of the area of interest and the daroor basin with shallow marine limestones bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 appendix d and c the auradu formation deposits are rich in corals mollusks and foraminifers and represent an important karstified shallow groundwater aquifer in north somalia fao swalim 2012 map in appendix c the base is diachronous and in most parts of central and nw somalia this is attributed to the paleocene or early eocene bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 while in the ne of somalia it contains marine faunas of maastrichtian age luger et al 1990 the regressive taleh formation deposited in eocene consists of mostly evaporites with shelf limestones and dolomite bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 massive to banded anhydrite was mostly deposited in the nogal and daroor basins whereas in the central and southern part of somalia deposited shelf limestones and shallow marine sands boeckelmann and schreiber 1990 the anhydrite is often altered to gypsum on the present day surface the taleh formation can be karstified with examples of karstic caves in the gypsum at sool plateau north somalia fao swalim 2012 the karkar formation deposited during a following transgression event in the late eocene depositing marly nodular limestones containing rich shallow marine fauna azzaroli 1950 stefanini 1925 the formation is characterized by alluvial and deltaic deposits in the northeast of the study area at the base there are laminated claystones interbedded with gypsum and anhydrite bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 the karkar formation is only deposited in the northeastern part of the study area indicating that probably most of the horn of africa was being uplifted and exposed at this time karstic springs exist in the karkar formation in northern somalia fao swalim 2012 the most recent rifting event related to the opening of the gulf of aden started in the oligocene in the early oligocene the eastern part of the study area was subaerially exposed most likely because of a major tectonic uplift and deformation the oligo miocene succession is now mostly restricted to a narrow and discontinuous coastal belt bosellini 1986 bosellini et al 1987 the oligo miocene syn and post rift sequences outcropping in the northeastern coast of somalia are referred to as the guban series azzaroli and merla 1957 fantozzi 1996 equivalent series are the duban formation and hafun series stefanini 1937 a regional marine transgression occurred in the late oligocene miocene followed by a miocene highstand bosellini 1989 bosellini 1992 the quaternary deposits are characterized by alluvial deposits dune fields and beach deposits fantozzi and ali kassim 2002 these deposits outcrop in southern somalia around mogadishu and near the juba and shabelle rivers abbate et al 1993 3 material and methods the basis of the geological model shown in this study is the digitization and integration of several cross sections collected from earlier hydrocarbon exploration reports geological reviews and research studies of the horn of africa 152 documents were reviewed to extract 38 cross sections the formation tops from 63 oil wells fig 3 and the geologic maps the gathered data were integrated into the 3d model as shown in fig 3 and appendix e1 the spatial coverage of the data is variable with the daroor nogal east ogaden coastal and anza basins showing good coverage with an irregular grid of 5 100 km spacing fig 3 data coverage in the central regions is sparser with a spatial resolution between 10 km and 500 km the reliability of the references was rated based on the input information where the quality indicator a is given to studies that had access to seismic and or oil well drilling data b to publications based on previous studies but with little or no access to oil data and c when no documented sources were presented by authors with presumed access to relevant data appendix e2 a lithostratigraphic chronostratigraphic and facies review was carried out to ensure uniformity in formation names throughout the area of study for example in the ogaden basin the gumburo sandstone is part of the karoo sediments from the late permian early triassic while in northern somalia gumburo is a formation from the cretaceous which consists mainly of carbonates for this study the name gumburo refers to the carbonate formation from the cretaceous another example is the karoo and adigrat sandstones in the past the failure to recognize the permian sedimentary cycle in ethiopia and the presence of triassic continental sandstones in kenya have complicated regional and local correlations of this unit purcell 1979 in the coastal and lamu basins the sandstone sediments from the permian and triassic are named karoo while in the ogaden nogal and daroor basins these are referred to as adigrat in the literature for this study the authors refer the permian and triassic sandstones to the adigrat formation 3 1 workflow the main methodological challenge of this study was bridging the gap between the file types and proprietary formats used for reservoir interpretation and modelling in the o g industry software petrel and the ones handled by hydrogeological modflow and surface geospatial data software qgis in order to address this challenge and achieve the integration between the typical hydrogeological studies focused on surface and shallow geology and o g reservoir characterization data focused on deeper formations a specific workflow was created which includes python scripts to enable file format conversion data filtering and cleaning this workflow is repeatable and consists of iterative steps between qgis and petrel and python and visual modflow flex vmf software fig 4 to integrate o g well logs and seismic data e g in las format with hydrogeological data derived from images or text files two main sets of data were collected and used for the regional mapping geological and structural maps and cross sections these data are derived from hydrocarbon exploration reports geological reviews and research studies of the horn of africa including published papers and conference presentations appendix e2 maps and cross sections were extracted as pdf or image jpg png files and later georeferenced in qgis where the corner point coordinates were extracted subsequently maps were imported as surface images in petrel surface geology maps were also imported as shape files shp and converted to surfaces by using elevation data a similar approach was used with cross sections in addition the collection of cross sections was filtered by 1 area of interest 2 availability of location information that allowed georeferencing and 3 vertical units available in depth units rather than in two way travel time twt which is a common format for seismic data derived cross sections fig 4 the location maps of the selected cross sections were then georeferenced in qgis finally the selected cross sections were loaded into petrel with their location maps which were used for spatially locating the cross sections for each cross section the interpreted formation tops were digitized and reinterpreted where needed using the polygon tool in petrel while faults were interpreted or digitized from geological maps using the insert fault tool tops or horizons in terms of geological age e g top of jurassic were converted to formation tops based on their lithological and chronostratigraphic description and based on the correlation with well data where available finally the polygons were converted into surfaces to be used as an input for the 3d geological model faults from surface geology maps abbate et al 1993 kamen kaye and barnes 1979 and satellite imagery source google earth were digitized and included in the initial database appendix a as the aim was to produce a first pass large scale model only the faults that were likely to have an impact on the regional aquifer distribution and had been interpreted on cross sections were selected the number of faults therefore appearing in the 3d model appendix d is a much reduced subset of the total number of faults originally interpreted appendix a surface geology well tops and contour maps found in the literature were also integrated into the structural modelling process after the 3d geological model was built in petrel horizons were converted to structure surfaces and exported in ascii x y z format the resulting surfaces and faults were separately imported in visual modflow flex where the final hydrogeological model and grid were built 4 results the data collection and analysis allowed us to extract the building blocks of the 3d geological model consisting of mapping the extent of the main geological units associating them with the indications of freshwater in deep formations from o g wells the level of confinement and estimations of porosity and permeability in the mapped units the constructed model and resulting maps are very regional as the main purpose of the study is to introduce the methodology and the new hydrogeological insights of the potential cross boundary aquifers linked to the overall water recharge in the highlands of ethiopia ruden 2017 4 1 mapping of main surfaces the definition and correlation of the units across the entire horn of africa region pose a real challenge mostly due to differences in lithological description and interpretation e g different facies hiatuses and nomenclature assigned to time equivalent units in order to address this issue and minimize potential correlation errors we established a combination of several criteria for surface selection including stratigraphic relevance regional extent importance in the hydrogeological context and data control ultimately surface definition was primarily based on lithostratigraphy but where formations were coeval over the entire area also on geological age the reinterpretation of geological maps and cross sections across the regions allowed producing regional maps that show the extent and depth of the main formations in the 3d geological model these formations are considered the main hydrostratigraphic units that build our 3d model priority was given to the following formation tops which are from oldest to most recent see fig 2 the paleozoic weathered and fractured basement fig 5a appendix d and f this formation is one of the most important and prolific reservoirs of water in rural africa in the geological model one of the largest basement outcrops is in the bur acaba area absolute age 615 my the fissured zones of the crystalline rocks are a potential infiltration route for water however the quality of the water from fissures in the region is generally poor moreover wells with water of very good quality but with a limited yield are found in fault zones faillace 1983 for this study the top 300 m of the basement formation along the area of study fig 5a is assumed to be a potential aquifer with fair vertical permeability while the deeper basement is considered a confining bed aquitard the adigrat formation fig 5b appendix d and f this is a fine to coarse grained feldspathic sandstone with limestone intercalations of late triassic to early jurassic age in the highlands of ethiopia the adigrat sandstones represent a potential aquifer and also a pathway of deep groundwater to the east coast to reduce the complexity of the model the karoo and adigrat sandstone are modelled as a single unit as having similar lithology and petrophysical properties fig 5b the hamanlei formation fig 5c appendix d and f this formation was deposited in the late to middle jurassic and consists primarily of limestone with some intercalations of shale and sandstone this formation is expected to play an essential role in transporting water from the western highland recharge areas to the deep sedimentary basins hamanlei formation suggests that groundwater circulation takes place mainly in this zone karst normally conveys water at much higher flow velocities than traditional porous or fractured aquifers in hydrogeological terms karst aquifers are characterized by high flow velocities low residence time and low storage volumes ruden 2017 therefore water in karstic aquifers is less prone to mineralization than the slower moving counterpart in porous or fractured rocks the gabredarre formation fig 5d appendix d and f this is also referred to as dawan formation and it was deposited in the late jurassic in the lamu and ogaden basins this formation consists mainly of grey argillaceous and calcareous marlstones with interbedded argillaceous limestones and dolomites the lateral variation in lithology throughout the study area required independent modelling of the surface in order to assign the specific petrophysical properties according to the facies the main gypsum formation appendix d it outcrops over large areas of the western basin and extends into the mandera lugh trough where it consists of gypsum and limestone with interbedded shales the ambar sandstone in the mandera lugh basin and the gorrahei carbonates in ethiopia are chronostratigraphically equivalent the main gypsum is considered a potential aquitard because of its low porosity and permeability the gumburo formation fig 5e appendix d and f this includes the the belet uen ferfer and gira formations and was deposited in the late cretaceous fig 5e the formation consists mainly of highly fractured limestone in the nogal and part of daroor basins while in the western side of the model the lithology changes to siliciclastic shoreline and continental sediments purcell 1979 the secondary porosity of the gumburo formation in the carbonate facies makes it suitable for conveying and storing groundwater the jessoma formation fig 5f appendix d and f this formation underlies much of the ogaden basin and extends to the buban daroor and nogal basins and horn of africa it consists of fine grained sandstones in the east transitioning to shallow carbonates in the west from the late cretaceous to the early tertiary age in places this formation has a deep water table several 100 s meters holds saline water and is difficult to drill kebede 2012 kebede 2012 also reports potable water and frequent loss of circulation problems in this formation while drilling pathways for water transfer are still poorly understood and reside either in limestone members within the sandstone series or alternatively within fractures and faults networks kebede 2012 in either case the observed water circulation may imply significant water potential the auradu formation appendix d and f it consists of massive limestone beds alternating with chalky and gypsiferous beds and calcareous shales deposited since the paleocene drilling operations in the auradu formation are considered difficult due to circulation losses when drilling through karst kebede 2012 nonetheless other authors ullah 2016 highlight that the most productive water well of the northeast of the area of interest at 50 l s was drilled in this formation in ceerigabo the taleh formation appendix d this was deposited in the early eocene and it is a typical evaporitic formation deposited in a shallow sea in arid climate it consists of a sequence of massive and dense anhydrite beds with intercalations of limestone and gypsum lateral changes of facies from gypsum and anhydrite to limestone are known in some places fao swalim 2012 due to the low permeability of this formation the taleh formation is a potential aquitard the karkar late eocene and daban formations oligocene appendix d these formations are neogene and quaternary in age and have been modelled separately for the purposes of this study they are both considered part of the shallow aquifers system the interpretation and mapping of the basement adigrat and hamanlei formations is supported by good data coverage and distribution providing solid structural control for the base of the model fig 5 these formations have been extensively described in the literature except in the lamu basin and south of the mandera lugh basin where o g wells did not reach the jurassic the vertical extent of the jurassic and older formations in these two basins is instead based on gravimetry maps and interpretations published by previous authors abbate et al 2015 kamen kaye and barnes 1979 piccoli et al 1986 schunemann 1984 the top part of the model is controlled by the topography and the outcrops of formations as shown on geological maps these formations were digitized from surface geology maps and subsequently updated or reinterpreted using satellite imagery where needed 4 2 distribution of hydrostratigraphic units facies maps and predicted thickness the potential extent of the hydrostratigraphic units used in our model is defined by the current extent after erosion of the related formation and by the facies which is directly linked to their original depositional environment existing facies maps were used to characterise the expected lithology and quality of aquifer bosellini 1992 purcell 1979 while the thickness of the unit is derived from the interpretation of the related formation on the petrel 3d model figs 6 and 7 show such examples for the adigrat formation while facies and thickness maps for all the formations are presented in appendix c and g due to the size of the area of study and the limited data available the grid resolution of the constructed model was set to 10 10 km therefore input data with a spatial resolution higher than 10 km is not considered and smoothed by the model as a consequence in areas with high data coverage such as the nogal and daroor basins the resulting surfaces do not accurately cross the interpreted formation tops thus the regional thickness maps do not always represent the correct local thickness of formations and they should be used only as an indication of where there is a good chance of finding the targeted formations 4 3 freshwater indications in oil exploration data the distribution of the hydrostratigraphic units obtained with the 3d geological model was cross checked against the freshwater indications found in o g exploration wells in order to ground truth their potential as aquifers quiroga et al 2022 used the combination of resistivity gamma ray spontaneous potential density neutron porosity and photoelectric effect logs with drill stem dst and repeat formation tests rft to identify formations filled with freshwater in northern somalia and somaliland table 1 summarizes the findings of freshwater reported in the literature over the area of study for the purposes of this study water with a concentration of less than 5000 mg l tds total dissolved solids is considered freshwater water ranging from 5000 10 000 mg l tds is considered brackish water in excess of 10 000 mg l tds is considered saline from north to south the regions that reported the most freshwater indications in deep aquifers are the daroor the nogal the ogaden basin and the lamu basin a series of vertical cross sections extracted from the 3d model have been selected to indicate the structure of the geological formations together with the related freshwater indications in these key areas figs 8 to 11 location in fig 3 the northern part of the horn of africa is particularly rich in indications of deep freshwater aquifers but this could be due to a data bias as they are the basins with the highest data coverage occurrence of low salinity deep water in the nogal basin was documented in connection with o g exploration in the well nogal 1 ali and lee 2019b the jessoma formation was interpreted to be flushed by fresh water that could have migrated by juxtaposition from the auradu formation ali and lee 2019a ali and lee 2019b quiroga 2020 and quiroga et al 2022 report the potential for fresh deep groundwater in the daroor and nogal basins after analysing data from seven wells drilled for hydrocarbon exploration in the nogal and daroor basins table 1 and appendix b the formations that have indications of low salinity water are the auradu limestone jessoma sandstone and limestone gumburo highly fractured limestone sandstone and shale gabredarre limestone and anhydrite hamanlei limestone and sandstone and adigrat sandstone and interbedded limestone formations in the ogaden basin the gherbi 1 well drilled in 1974 by teneco on the northwest flank of the basin tested fresh water from the adigrat formation sandstone the upper hamanlei formation limestone and anhydrite in this well tested salt water purcell 1979 the gumburo 1 well drilled by the sinclair petroleum company in 1950 tested freshwater in the gumburo formation carbonate marl evaporites and brackish to salty water in the hamanlei formation carbonate piccoli et al 1986 in the eastern ogaden region the well abred 1 was drilled and abandoned in 1963 without significant hydrocarbons shows the cretaceous section tested fresh water and the hamanlei and adigrat formations yielded salt water purcell 1979 the cretaceous formations in the ogaden basin which are interpreted to be flushed with freshwater are present at greater depths in the lamu basin the offshore well pomboo 1 drilled by woodside in 2007 on a thrust anticline encountered a thick late cretaceous clastic sequence which included campanian sands and no hydrocarbons were encountered davison and steel 2018 4 4 hydraulic properties of the potential aquifers porosity and permeability data have been collected from o g studies and reports for the adigrat gumburo jessoma and auradu formations fig 12 the adigrat formation shows average porosities of 5 15 and values of up to 20 in ethiopia purcell 1979 in the northern part of the study area the well buran 1 encountered 2 5 md of horizontal permeability in the upper section of the adigrat formation up to 450 md for the middle and lower adigrat and a maximum of 50 md of vertical permeability in the nogal basin the well burhisso 1 reported a horizontal and vertical permeability of respectively 180 md and 125 md the gumburo formation has permeabilities of 0 5 8 md in buran 1 and 11 13 md in yaguri 1 in the lower gumburo the well burhisso 1 encountered a horizontal permeability of 9 md and a vertical permeability of 14 md fig 12 the well buran 1 encountered good reservoir properties in the jessoma formation with average porosities of 20 40 the well reported horizontal permeabilities of 280 840 md and vertical permeabilities of 140 920 md in the burhisso 1 well the permeabilities of the jessoma formation ranged from 260 to 510 md and up to 1200 md in shabeel north 1 in the same formation fig 11 limited information is available from the auradu formation as it is found at relatively shallow depths and therefore not a target for oil prospects in the buran 1 well permeabilities were reported between 81 and 145 md in the auradu carbonates fig 12 equivalent freshwater heads and distribution can be derived from pressure data recorded in onshore and offshore petroleum wells varma and michael 2012 the level of confinement of the potential aquifers in the nogal and daroor basins is determined from oil exploration data in quiroga et al 2022 table 2 although the aquifers are confined the pressure is not sufficient for the wells to be artesian in the two basins oil well exploration data on the other basins are necessary to derive further conclusions on the level of confinement of the rest of the system 4 5 potential extent of the deep aquifers the results from our analysis show the potential stacked aquifers in areas with significant data control based on the 3d geological model and on the data on freshwater occurrences from o g data shallow wells and springs faillace 1983 fao swalim 2012 quiroga 2020 quiroga et al 2022 ullah 2016 ah 2016 fig 13 significant aquifer potential is observed regionally for the adigrat hamanlei gabredarre gumburo jessoma auradu units of these units while the most recent and shallowest i e auradu and jessoma cretaceous to paleocene have been previously recognised as regional or local aquifers the oldest ones i e adigrat hamanlei gabredarre and gumburo jurassic to cretaceous are here reported for the first time as potential deep aquifers it should be considered that the predicted maps do not guarantee the presence of sufficient thickness of the formation far from the control points where the surfaces have been extrapolated to map viable aquifers in targeted follow up studies it is important to go back to the local data and or construct more localized models with higher grid resolution the recommended use of the maps is twofold for water resources exploitation only in areas close to the o g wells with indications of freshwater and for the definition of larger potential prospecting areas in areas far from oil wells control by re gridding and adding new data 5 discussion 5 1 aquifer potential of the hydrostratigraphic units the results of this study show that amongst the 13 geological units analysed regionally six are potential aquifers adigrat hamanlei gabredarre gumburo jessoma auradu appendix h and three are potential aquitards taleh main gypsum and uarandab fig 1 however lateral lithology variability in certain units such as the main gypsum might determine local changes to this regional hydrostratigraphic setting and should be addressed on a case by case basis the regional geological model presented in this study can be used as the initial input for groundwater simulations to understand the flow and pressure conditions at the boundaries of the more localized hydrogeological models and to select relevant focus areas in the horn of africa the basement outcrops extensively in the highlands of ethiopia where it is overlain by permeable carbonate formations this study confirms that this specific geological setting is especially suitable for deep groundwater storage and flow towards the east coast the high potential for deep 400 m freshwater has been demonstrated by a combination of low salinity water observations favorable physical properties and the extent of aquifers at considerable distance several 100 s of kilometers from the recharge areas the depth of recorded freshwater occurrences can be significant and reaches up to 2000 m tvd for values of 5 g l nacl quiroga 2020 quiroga et al 2022 however the regional extent of the aquifers as shown in the results of this study can provide a possible range of depths at various locations which can be explored in the context of other factors such as local water demand vs supply and socio economical and political considerations to define the exploitability of deep groundwater in a defined region the geological model shows regionally consistent good aquifer properties with high permeability and porosity values in the jessoma and auradu units lower values and less favorable aquifer properties were recorded for the adigrat and gumburo units however currently the information available is more limited for deeper units such as adigrat and gumburo if available further data on permeability and secondary porosity across the entire model could help determine the groundwater travel time and its preferential pathways and possibly more favorable physical property distribution for the deeper units currently data from the o g wells drilled in the region is only partly published and available if additional information is added to the model it can be used to provide further insights and help develop a complete hydrogeological model for the horn of africa region the data collected in this study also suggest the potential relevance of structural features such as faults to either facilitate or limit the flow of groundwater at depth by putting aquifers in juxtaposition or by compartmentalising them furthermore the extensive presence of carbonate formations points to karst development as a potential important feature for the creation of permeability and groundwater flow regionally ruden 2017 a thorough analysis of the timing of faults versus the age of sediments and of the degree and type of karstification of the units will be instrumental to understand the role of these two factors in facilitating vertical connection between aquifers if there is vertical communication between the aquitards and aquifers the high sulfate content so4 of gypsum and anhydrite rocks from the aquitards such as the main gypsum and taleh units could contaminate the underlying formations which further study will have to establish through the geochemical analysis of water samples from the deep aquifers 5 2 limitations to the model and way forward constructing a 3d geological model from data of the public domain in such a vast area where deep hydrogeology is sparsely documented has limitations due to the use of information from heterogeneous sources which are different in terms of coverage scales and accuracy even though a data quality assessment was performed in this study appendix e2 it only refers to the amount of data available for this study and it is inevitable that there is a large variation in the reliability of the cross sections and of the mapped geological units the main factor behind the uncertainty in data analysis is the heterogeneity of interpretations published by several sources given the fact that not all authors have access to the same data some interpretations used extrapolation and interpolation methods with limited source information for example in the case of the lamu basin a difference of more than 2000 m is observed for the top of the basement formation between two different sources piccoli et al 1986 schunemann 1984 this produces uncertainty in stratigraphic correlations and in the definition of physical properties derived from interdisciplinary sources as another example the differences between o g and hydrogeological methods used to calculate hydraulic heads from o g pressure tests carry an implicit uncertainty related to the density and viscosity of the water and should be addressed if any more exact data are needed in the planning stage for any drilling activities the spatial distribution of equivalent hydraulic heads assuming a homogeneous aquifer with water of uniform density can provide information on the regional groundwater flow paths which in turn could be used to calibrate the groundwater flow modelling in future work however in the case of a variable density formation water environment representing the flow of the water with hydraulic heads can be challenging and other factors should be considered such as aquifer geometry pressure temperature and salinity the buoyancy component porosity and permeability bachu 1995 bachu and michael 2002 davies 1987 jorgensen et al 1982 lusczynski 1961 oberlander 1989 post et al 2007 to provide further refinement to the 3d geological model future work should include the quantification of uncertainty and definition of acceptable error ranges by means of statistical analysis this is particularly relevant if the data points constitute a significant statistical sample the improvement of the compatibility of surfaces made in petrel with the hydrological modelling software modflow was chosen in this current study but as this software is not able to handle eroded or pinching out formations the geological units are currently modelled as continuous surfaces with zero thickness when absent which is not ideal as it may not represent the actual geology the estimation of daily water recharge and its geospatial distribution to assess the sustainability of the system in terms of extraction the integration of water chemistry composition and aquifer properties into the model to identify preferential groundwater flow paths and travel time the construction of more localized geological models e g for each basin with the definition of the boundary conditions and the initial conceptual model based on the results of the current regional groundwater modelling the implementation of a conceptual model which includes the vertical structure of the aquifers hydrostratigraphic sections proposing different case scenarios that could meet the actual boundary conditions additionally identifying new sources of water in arid and semi arid countries characterized by extreme poverty requires cross sectoral approaches the use of existing data and technology from the o g industry for the characterization of deeper aquifers can now be considered a potential solution next to the more conventional approaches such as water harvesting desalination and shallow groundwater however a thorough cost benefit analysis and feasibility of different solutions need to be considered when planning for the exploration and exploitation of these resources 6 conclusions this study illustrates the ability of defining a 3d geological model entirely based on published and open access data in vast and logistically challenging territories of the east african regions struck by water scarcity furthermore it paves the way to other regional hydrogeological studies where an interdisciplinary approach can provide new input data to models and improve their calibration the new 3d geological model of the horn of africa shows the full extent of a series of units that potentially host deep aquifers in the region after reviewing 152 documents of public domain the regional geological model was constructed based on 38 cross sections unpublished reports formation tops from 63 oil wells and open access geological maps the lithology variations with depth the facies maps of the horn of africa and the 3d model were used to define the vertical structure of the aquifers and to build a first regional deep hydrostratigraphic model importantly the workflow used is cross disciplinary integrating hydrogeological data with public domain data from o g exploration studies the differences in file formats stratigraphic units and measurements collected in the two disciplines have been overcome with a workaround to combine o g with hydrogeology software the results from this study can be used to build a full hydrogeological model of the region and ground truth it with the collected evidence for deep freshwater in deep wells previously drilled by the o g industry and with the values of hydraulic heads calculated from their pressure tests aquifer properties such as porosity permeability and pressure were transferred from the hydrocarbon context and used in the hydrogeology context with due considerations due to the deeper reach compared to conventional hydrogeological data geophysical and wells it is important to note that hydrocarbon exploration data is irreplaceable in the identification of deep aquifers based on the cross correlation of the mapped hydrostratigraphic units with the observed regional freshwater indications six regional units were identified as potential aquifers adigrat hamanlei gabredarre gumburo jessoma auradu of these units while the most recent and shallowest i e auradu and jessoma cretaceous to paleocene have been previously recognised as regional or local aquifers the oldest ones i e adigrat hamanlei gabredarre and gumburo jurassic to cretaceous are here reported for the first time as potential deep aquifers the recommended use of the maps is twofold 1 for water resources exploitation only in areas close to the o g wells with indications of freshwater 2 for the definition of larger potential prospecting areas in areas far from oil

7936,study region europe with a particular focus on the czech republic poland spain and norway study focus long lasting droughts have become a semi permanent feature of the european climate especially over the last two decades these prolonged droughts are usually driven by persistent sea surface temperature anomalies over the pacific and atlantic basins by employing complex statistical methods i e canonical correlation analysis and convergent cross mapping in this study we make a comprehensive assessment of the observed drying trend over the central and southern parts of europe and its underlying drivers new hydrological insights building upon the potential relationship between drought variability and large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulation we show that the observed drying trend in the central and southern parts of europe has been driven by a long term slowdown of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc via changes in the large scale atmospheric circulation a weakening of amoc leads to an increase in the frequency of atmospheric blocking like circulation over the central part of europe which in turn inhibits precipitation and favors long term drying

schuldt et al 2020 in addition climate projections indicate that europe will become one of the hotspots for future high intensity droughts and prolonged heatwaves with southern and central europe becoming increasingly dry and hot and fennoscandia becoming wetter and colder balting et al 2021 cook et al 2020 ipcc 2018 naumann et al 2018 spinoni et al 2019 2018 for example in terms of damages and impacts the 2003 drought event affected large parts of central europe including the northwestern parts of spain france italy germany switzerland and austria and the western part of the czech republic leading to 17 134 billion euro in direct impact eea 2019 the 2015 drought event affected mostly the central and eastern parts of europe and it was the hottest and climatologically driest summer over the 1950 2015 study period for an area stretching from the eastern czech republic to ukraine ionita et al 2017 the socio economic impact in 2015 1250 deaths and 2 172 billion euro of direct impact eea 2019 was much lower compared to the 2003 event due to the awareness of the risk and vulnerability of the drought events in a recent study naumann et al 2021 has shown that over the period 1981 2010 droughts were responsible for around 9 billion of damages per year to the economies of countries in the eu and the uk and this value is expected to rise as economies grow and temperatures increase therefore a better understanding of drought characteristics and their large scale drivers at the european level is essential for better drought monitoring and forecasting in order to provide reliable adaptation strategies and thus reduce socioeconomic losses one of the most important drivers of long lasting dry events over europe is the north atlantic sea surface temperatures sst ionita et al 2012 kingston et al 2015 schubert et al 2014 for example the 2015 drought event in the central part of europe was mainly driven by anomalously cold sst anomalies in the north atlantic basin the so called cold blob duchez et al 2016 ionita et al 2017 this cold blob characterized by an anomalously negative sst anomaly south of greenland was associated with a 15 weakening of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc since the middle of the 20th century dima and lohmann 2010 rahmstorf et al 2015 under influence of increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations dima et al 2021 since the amoc plays a crucial role in transporting heat northward a slowdown or a shutdown could lead to widespread cooling over the northern hemisphere particularly around the east coast of u s and the west coast of europe jackson and wood 2020 liu et al 2020 2017 vellinga and wood 2008 to our knowledge there is no study focused on a potential direct link between the observed amoc changes and the drought features over europe through the observational record therefore building up on previous findings which indicate that on monthly to interannual time scales persistent large scale sst anomalies influence the frequency of drought events over europe in this study we investigate the potential relationship between the long term changes in drought over europe and the weakening trend of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation 2 data and methods the main variable analyzed in our study is the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei was computed based on the monthly precipitation pp monthly mean air temperature tt and the potential evapotranspiration pet data from the cru ts v 4 04 dataset harris et al 2020 using the r package spei https cran r project org web packages spei index html the spei computation is based on the probability distribution of the difference between pp and pet pp pet and the data are normalized into a log logistic probability distribution to obtain the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the potential evapotranspiration data were computed by employing the penman monteith equation vanderlinden et al 2008 since the aim of our study is to analyze the observed trends in the long term drought at european level we focus our analysis on an accumulation period of 12 months for spei spei12 thus for the current study we make use of december spei12 which integrates the drought variability throughout the whole year to analyze the relationship between drought variability and the north atlantic sst we make use of the hadisst data set with data distributed on a 1 1 grid rayner et al 2003 and covering the period 1871 2021 for the current study we used the period 1901 2020 which overlaps with the time period when we have available data to compute spei in order to identify large scale atmospheric circulation patterns associated with dry conditions over europe we use the monthly sea level pressure slp fields from the 20th century reanalysis data v3 covering january 1902 to december 2015 period with a spatial resolution of 2 2 slivinski et al 2021 the trend analysis for the december spei12 field was performed by using the mann kendall test mann 1945 the mann kendall test has been intensively used to identify trends in the hydrometeorological time series adamowski et al 2009 dang et al 2020 and the references therein the significance of a trend is determined by the z statistic that has a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 a positive z value indicates an increasing trend whereas a negative z value shows a decreasing trend in the time series the non parametric sen s slop method sen 1968 was used to evaluate the magnitude of the trends the coupled modes of variability between spei12 and annual sst are obtained by applying the canonical correlation analysis cca technique cca is a powerful multivariate method used to identify pairs of patterns with the maximum correlation between their associated time series von storch and zwiers 1999 in this study we use the cca to identify the main coupled modes of variability and their associated time components in the december spei12 and annual sst fields before applying cca the dimensionality of the spei12 and sst fields was reduced through an empirical orthogonal functions eof analysis the first 10 eofs of spei12 and sst were retained as input in the cca for december spei12 the first 10 eofs capture 80 of the total variance while the first 10 eofs of the annual sst capture 85 of the total variance in order to remove the uniform global warming trend before applying the cca between the spei12 and annual sst fields we removed the yearly global average from each grid point dima et al 2021 have demonstrated that this technique removes the spatially quasi uniform nonlinear trend determined from data without the necessity to choose a linear or nonlinear shape to be removed a priori in this respect this method considerably improves the signal to noise ratio in the examined datasets since the globally consistent warming trend explains a large amount of variance in the initial sst field to investigate the potential causal relationships between annual sst variable x and december spei12 variable y we used the convergent cross mapping ccm method which relies on time embedded state space reconstruction based on data sugihara et al 2012 an attractor is reconstructed based on each of the two time series if the variables are causally linked then they are components of the same dynamical system consequently their individual phase space representations are projections of the common system s attractor and are topologically equivalent nearby points in the attractor of y will correspond to nearby points in the attractor of x if only x causes y then y will contain information about x but the time evolution of x is independent of y and the former variable does not contain information about the later ccm determines how well local neighborhoods on the attractor of x a library of points correspond to local neighborhoods on the phase space representation of y thus in the attractor of y one finds nearest neighbors to a given point at time t and construct weights from them using these weights an estimate of x at time t is generated based on its nearest neighbors in the x phase space representation this procedure to compute x is repeated for all values of y from the library of points the similarity between the predicted and observed x time segments the cross map estimation is quantified by the pearson s correlation coefficient the pearson s correlation coefficient which compares the observed and the predicted values is used to measure prediction accuracy in practice the saturation of a cross map between x and y variables at a plateau above the significance thresholds suggests a causal relationship between the two variables dima et al 2021 sugihara et al 2012 an increase in the library size corresponds to a better filled attractor and closer neighbors therefore the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed x time segments should grow this increase in the correlation is called convergence and distinguishes causation from correlation dima et al 2021 sugihara et al 2012 3 results and discussion the spatial pattern of the mann kendall trend statistics mann 1945 for the december spei12 for the period 1902 2020 is presented in fig 1 negative values brown indicate a trend towards drier conditions while positive values green indicate a trend towards wetter states december spei12 exhibits a very clear signal most of the countries in the southern and central parts of europe show a significant decreasing trend drying over the last 120 years while the countries in the northern part of europe exhibit a significant positive trend wetting this is in agreement with the results from a recent study ionita and nagavciuc 2021 in which it has been shown that drought indices which take into account the effect of temperature e g spei and the self calibrated palmer drought severity index show a drying trend over the southern and central parts of europe and a wetting trend over the northern part of europe while precipitation based drought indices i e the standardized precipitation index do not capture this drying trend the hotspots in terms of drying are spain portugal the southern part of france italy the eastern part of germany the czech republic poland hungary slovenia and croatia the hotspots in terms of wetting are northern part of u k norway finland and sweden fig 1 this dipole like structure between the central and southern parts of europe and the north western part of europe is very clear also when looking at the probability distribution function of december spei12 averaged at country level fig 2 the 30 years probability density function pdf for some of the countries affected by the drying trend over the last 120 years i e the czech republic fig 2a poland fig 2b spain fig 2c shows a very clear pattern the period 1991 2020 was the driest one over the observational record while the period 1902 1930 was the wettest one in the case of the countries which show a wetting trend i e norway fig 2d the pattern is rather opposite the period 1991 2020 being the wettest one while the period 1902 1930 being the driest one the temporal evolution of december spei12 averaged over some of the countries affected by the drying trend i e czech republic fig 3a poland fig 3b spain fig 3c and the wetting trend i e norway indicates strong interannual variability of the drought conditions at country level as well as a statistically significant drying wetting trend of the long term drought condition i e spei12 for the czech republic poland and spain the occurrence of wet years was much higher before 1980 s compared to the period 1981 2020 after the beginning of the 1980 s there are just a limited number of years with positive wet values fig 3a b and c for the czech republic poland and spain the driest years have been recorded through the 21st century while in the case of norway the driest years have been recorded at the beginning of the 20th century the strongest drying trend is observed for the czech republic 1 53 139 years followed by poland 1 42 139 years and spain 0 98 139 years table 1 in the case of norway we observe a significant wetting trend over the analyzed period 1 42 139 years the identified hot spots in terms of drying trend have been under the influence of a long lasting drought over the last decade ionita et al 2021 moravec et al 2021 with 2015 and 2018 reaching record levels in terms of meteorological and soil moisture drought especially over the central part of europe ionita et al 2017 moravec et al 2021 the extreme dry summers in 2015 and 2018 have been associated with exceptional cold sst anomalies in the north atlantic basin and persistent high pressure systems over europe i e atmospheric blocking duchez et al 2016 ionita et al 2017 overall on monthly to interannual time scales the association between cold central north atlantic conditions blocking like atmospheric circulation patterns and dry summers in central parts of europe manifests as a predominant feature of the hydroclimate variability over europe throughout the observational record ionita et al 2011 schubert et al 2014 and also over paleo time scales ionita et al 2021 on interannual to multidecadal time scales dry wet summers were found to be associated with a cold warm north atlantic basin in the previous winter reduced enhanced winter precipitation over the central part of europe and enhanced blocking over the central and northern parts of europe ionita et al 2021 2012 kingston et al 2012 schubert et al 2016 similarly it was shown that during the negative phase of amo cold north atlantic basin germany and the southern part of the scandinavian peninsula is affected by dryness while a warm north atlantic basin positive amo phase is associated with wetness over these regions ionita et al 2012 to investigate the potential drivers of the drying trend over the central and southern part of europe we applied the cca methodology between december spei12 and the annual north atlantic sst over the 1902 2020 period fig 4 the main aim of the cca is to identify coupled modes of variability and their associated temporal components in the spei12 sst data sets fig 4a shows the sst pattern of the first coupled mode further referred as cca1 sst which explains 14 37 of the total variance it is dominated by an area of negative sst anomalies south of greenland surrounded by positive sst anomalies located around the eastern u s coast and the western european coast and the north sea the structure of the cca1 sst pattern fig 4a was found to be part of an sst mode associated with the long term amoc weakening trend caesar et al 2018 dima and lohmann 2010 which was attributed to increasing atmospheric co2 concentration dima et al 2021 later on based on observation data and simulations performed with an oceanic general circulation model it was shown that this pattern is generated by centennial scale amoc changes induced by deep water formation changes in the nordic seas dima et al 2022 e g fig 4 and s4 in their study in particular the center of negative anomalies located south of greenland appears to be linked with a weakening of an amoc cell centered at 50 n a downslope of deep western boundary current dwbc which is fed by the nordic seas overflow system could result in the bottom vortex stretching with corresponding ocean surface changes on the northern recirculation gyre associated with adjustment of the gulf stream position born et al 2009 langehaug et al 2012 yeager and danabasoglu 2014 zhang et al 2011 zhang and vallis 2006 an anomalous dwbc affects also the subpolar amoc cell through geostrophic balance these processes are consistent with the north atlantic sst structure fig 4a one notes that the amoc trend mode characterized by centennial scale changes is distinct from the multidecadal fluctuations of the overturning circulation dima and lohmann 2010 which are reflected on the north atlantic sst as a monopolar pattern and which are associated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 this implies that the atmospheric and spei12 changes emphasized here are linked only to centennial scale variations of amoc which are emphasized in climate projections for this century but are not directly reflecting the multidecadal fluctuations of the overturning associated with amo the corresponding december spei12 cca1 spei12 spatial pattern fig 4b which explains 13 88 of the total variance is characterized by a dipole like structure between the southern and central parts of europe negative loadings and the scandinavian peninsula and u k positive loadings the highest negative loadings correspond to the regions countries where a significant drying trend is observed i e spain portugal the southern part of france italy the eastern part of germany the czech republic poland hungary slovenia and croatia see also fig 1 overall the first cca pair which is the focus of our study and which reflects the coupling between december spei12 and the annual sst indicates that dry wet conditions over the southern and central northern parts of europe are associated with negative sst anomalies south of greenland flanked by positive sst anomalies over the eastern u s coast western european coast the north sea and the mediterranean sea the dipole like structure of the cca1 spei12 is a prominent feature of the drought variability at the european scale ionita et al 2015 this is consistent with the corresponding time series of the cca1 spei12 and cca1 sst which are significantly correlated r 0 89 99 significance level and shows a significant centennial trend e g drying over the southern and central parts of europe is associated with cooling of the north atlantic basin south of greenland over the analyzed period fig 4c the fact that the north atlantic cooling was associated with an amoc weakening dima and lohmann 2010 caesar et al 2018 dima et al 2022 implies that the cca1 spei12 pattern could be considered a consequence of atlantic ocean circulation slowdown in order to investigate the mechanisms through which an amoc weakening and associated negative sst anomalies south of greenland influence the spei12 field we constructed regression maps of the sea level pressure field on the cca1 spei12 time components fig 5 the regression of the annual slp field on the time series of cca1 spei12 fig 5a indicates that dry conditions over the southern and central parts of europe are associated with a high pressure system extending from the east coast of the u s to the central and southern parts of europe where it reaches the highest amplitude and a low pressure system over fennoscandia and the arctic region the mechanisms linking the cca1 spei12 pattern with this atmospheric structure are revealed also by the corresponding regression maps constructed between the seasonal slp field i e january february march fig 5b april may june fig 5c july august september fig 5d and october november december fig 5e and the time series of cca1 spei12 the winter slp regression map resembles the positive phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao fig 5b and is consistent with a barotropic atmospheric response to the north south sst gradient disposed south of greenland in the cca1 sst pattern rodwell et al 1999 fig 4b our findings are also in agreement with the study of rousi et al 2021 which has shown that an amoc decline leads to 60 increase in an anticyclonic i e high pressure circulation over the western and central parts of europe with a significant effect on the central european droughts the high pressure system over the central and southern parts of europe suppresses ascending motions and reduces water vapor condensation and precipitation formation leading to drought conditions below this system this high pressure system over the central and southern parts of europe has a seasonally persistent feature fig 5b e thus leading to long lasting droughts by suppressing precipitation and or increasing the temperature thus based on these results we argue that the long term drying trend observed over the southern and central parts of europe is driven by an association between a relatively high frequency of atmospheric blocking conditions e g persistent high pressure systems induced by the centennial scale trend of ssts disposed south of greenland this specific sst pattern was associated with a long term weakening trend of the amoc in response to increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations caesar et al 2018 dima et al 2021 the influence of the prolonged positive slp anomalies on the drying trend over the central part of europe is supported also by the first coupled mode of variability between the annual sst and the annual slp filed the spatial structure of the first coupled mode of variability sst slp fig 6 is similar to the sst pattern associated with the drying trend over central europe fig 3a and the annual slp regression map fig 5a thus we can argue that the coupling between the amoc trend mode and prolonged positive slp anomalies over the central north atlantic basin extending up to central europe are leading to drying especially in the central and southern parts of europe the influence of amoc on the north atlantic large scale atmospheric circulation is made mainly through the sst anomalies it generates in this sector consequently the structure and mechanism of atmospheric response depend on the corresponding thermal structure of the ocean surface two distinct sst patterns were emphasized in associations with amoc changes park and latif 2008 dima and lohmann 2010 dima et al 2022 on one side multidecadal amoc variations associated with amo are associated with a monopolar north atlantic sst pattern which induces a thermal baroclinic atmospheric response which projects onto nao sutton and hodson 2007 the corresponding axis of the slp dipole is not zonally aligned but it is tilted north eastward dima and lohmann 2007 on the other side centennial scale amoc changes are reflected by the sst dipole located south of greenland this patterns increases the local meridional temperature gradient which in turn favors the formation of storms which can feed with energy the zonal circulation and result in a nao like barotropic atmospheric response frankignoul et al 2013 rodwell et al 1999 this type of atmospheric response i e nao like barotropic which has an impact on the european climate can be observed in figs 5 and 6 and resembles the barotropic atmospheric response to the amoc centennial scale changes reflected by the sst dipole located south of greenland one notes that at both time scales an amoc weakening induces a positive nao like response in the atmosphere the causal relationship between the north atlantic sst pattern and the corresponding spei12 structure derived through cca has been also tested by using the ccm method which was applied to the corresponding two time series fig 4c the cross map skill from the time component of the spei12 and the time component to the north atlantic sst identified through cca increases with the library length and reaches a plateau around ρ 0 85 well above the 95 significance level indicating a robust causal relationship from the later to the former fig 7 4 discussion and conclusions in this study we have investigated the spatio temporal variability of the annual drought variability over europe as represented by spei12 and related the long term drying trend over the central and southern parts of europe with large scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies the relationship between december spei12 which reflects an integration of moisture availability through the whole year and annual sst was analyzed by using canonical correlation analysis and convergent cross mapping methods we have focused the current study just on the first mode of coupled variability since we aimed to identify the drivers of the drying wetting trend patterns at european scale the coupled modes of variability as identified by the cca can provide insights into the teleconnection patterns between the long term drought conditions over europe and global regional sst patterns these indicate that the long term drying trend in the southern and central parts of europe as captured by spei12 is linked with a dipolar slp pattern which resembles the positive phase of nao but with the azore center shifted towards europe which is reminiscent of a barotropic response to a sst structure located south of greenland in response to the long term weakening trend of the amoc the relationship between a weak amoc state and long lasting drought over europe seems to be a pervasive one through different time scales and climate backgrounds in a recent study ionita et al 2021 have found that long lasting droughts over the central part of europe over the last millennium have been driven by a combination of low solar variability a weak amoc state characterized by negative sst anomalies south of greenland and high atmospheric blocking frequency over the central part of europe from an even longer time span perspective the 8 2ka bp climatic event which occurred during a period of a relatively warm climate background and was likely associated with a significant reduction of the amoc intensity von grafenstein et al 1998 and can be seen as an analog for the current and future oceanic and hydro climatic configuration consistent with our results an abrupt surface cooling of the north atlantic basin which indicated a weakening of amoc at 8 2ka lead to enhanced drying over the western part of europe further back in time for the younger dryas fluctuation about 12 900 11 700 years bp a strong cooling of the north atlantic ocean in response to a reduction of the amoc corroborated with enhanced blocking activity has been associated with harsh winters and warm summers over europe schenk et al 2018 therefore the connections between the north atlantic ocean and dryness wetness over europe appear to represent a pervasive manifestation through climatic events manifested in both recent and distant past future climate projections indicate that europe will face substantial drying even for the less aggressive pathways scenarios ssp126 and ssp245 balting et al 2021 as climate projections show a long term slowdown of amoc during this century collins et al 2013

7936,study region europe with a particular focus on the czech republic poland spain and norway study focus long lasting droughts have become a semi permanent feature of the european climate especially over the last two decades these prolonged droughts are usually driven by persistent sea surface temperature anomalies over the pacific and atlantic basins by employing complex statistical methods i e canonical correlation analysis and convergent cross mapping in this study we make a comprehensive assessment of the observed drying trend over the central and southern parts of europe and its underlying drivers new hydrological insights building upon the potential relationship between drought variability and large scale oceanic and atmospheric circulation we show that the observed drying trend in the central and southern parts of europe has been driven by a long term slowdown of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc via changes in the large scale atmospheric circulation a weakening of amoc leads to an increase in the frequency of atmospheric blocking like circulation over the central part of europe which in turn inhibits precipitation and favors long term drying

temperatures increase therefore a better understanding of drought characteristics and their large scale drivers at the european level is essential for better drought monitoring and forecasting in order to provide reliable adaptation strategies and thus reduce socioeconomic losses one of the most important drivers of long lasting dry events over europe is the north atlantic sea surface temperatures sst ionita et al 2012 kingston et al 2015 schubert et al 2014 for example the 2015 drought event in the central part of europe was mainly driven by anomalously cold sst anomalies in the north atlantic basin the so called cold blob duchez et al 2016 ionita et al 2017 this cold blob characterized by an anomalously negative sst anomaly south of greenland was associated with a 15

al 2008 since the aim of our study is to analyze the observed trends in the long term drought at european level we focus our analysis on an accumulation period of 12 months for spei spei12 thus for the current study we make use of december spei12 which integrates the drought variability throughout the whole year to analyze the relationship between drought variability and the north atlantic sst we make use of the hadisst data set with data distributed on a 1 1 grid rayner et al 2003 and covering the period 1871 2021 for the current study we used the period 1901 2020 which overlaps with the time period when we have available data to compute spei in order to identify large scale atmospheric circulation patterns associated with dry conditions over europe we use the monthly sea level pressure slp fields from the 20th century reanalysis data v3 covering january 1902 to december 2015 period with a spatial resolution of 2 2 slivinski et al 2021 the trend analysis for the december spei12 field was performed by using the mann kendall test mann 1945 the mann kendall test has been intensively used to identify trends in the hydrometeorological time series adamowski et al 2009 dang et al 2020 and the references therein the significance of a trend is determined by the z statistic that has a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 a positive z value indicates an increasing trend whereas a negative z value shows a decreasing trend in the time series the non parametric sen s slop method sen 1968 was used to evaluate the magnitude of the trends the coupled modes of variability between spei12 and annual sst are obtained by applying the canonical correlation analysis cca technique cca is a powerful multivariate method used to identify pairs of patterns with the maximum correlation between their associated time series von storch and zwiers 1999 in this study we use the cca to identify the main coupled modes of variability and their associated time components in the december spei12 and annual sst fields before applying cca the dimensionality of the spei12 and sst fields was reduced through an empirical orthogonal functions eof analysis the first 10 eofs of spei12 and sst were retained as input in the cca for december spei12 the first 10 eofs capture 80 of the total variance while the first 10 eofs of the annual sst capture 85 of the total variance in order to remove the uniform global warming trend before applying the cca between the spei12 and annual sst fields we removed the yearly global average from each grid point dima et al 2021 have demonstrated that this technique removes the spatially quasi uniform nonlinear trend determined from data without the necessity to choose a linear or nonlinear shape to be removed a priori in this respect this method considerably improves the signal to noise ratio in the examined datasets since the globally consistent warming trend explains a large amount of variance in the initial sst field to investigate the potential causal relationships between annual sst variable x and december spei12 variable y we used the convergent cross mapping ccm method which relies on time embedded state space reconstruction based on data sugihara et al 2012 an attractor is reconstructed based on each of the two time series if the variables are causally linked then they are components of the same dynamical system consequently their individual phase space representations are projections of the common system s attractor and are topologically equivalent nearby points in the attractor of y will correspond to nearby points in the attractor of x if only x causes y then y will contain information about x but the time evolution of x is independent of y and the former variable does not contain information about the later ccm determines how well local neighborhoods on the attractor of x a library of points correspond to local neighborhoods on the phase space representation of y thus in the attractor of y one finds nearest neighbors to a given point at time t and construct weights from them using these weights an estimate of x at time t is generated based on its nearest neighbors in the x phase space representation this procedure to compute x is repeated for all values of y from the library of points the similarity between the predicted and observed x time segments the cross map estimation is quantified by the pearson s correlation coefficient the pearson s correlation coefficient which compares the observed and the predicted values is used to measure prediction accuracy in practice the saturation of a cross map between x and y variables at a plateau above the significance thresholds suggests a causal relationship between the two variables dima et al 2021 sugihara et al 2012 an increase in the library size corresponds to a better filled attractor and closer neighbors therefore the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed x time segments should grow this increase in the correlation is called convergence and distinguishes causation from correlation dima et al 2021 sugihara et al 2012 3 results and discussion the spatial pattern of the mann kendall trend statistics mann 1945 for the december spei12 for the period 1902 2020 is presented in fig 1 negative values brown indicate a trend towards drier conditions while positive values green indicate a trend towards wetter states december spei12 exhibits a very clear signal most of the countries in the southern and central parts of europe show a significant decreasing trend drying over the last 120 years while the countries in the northern part of europe exhibit a significant positive trend wetting this is in agreement with the results from a recent study ionita and nagavciuc 2021 in which it has been shown that drought indices which take into account the effect of temperature e g spei and the self calibrated palmer drought severity index show a drying trend over the southern and central parts of europe and a wetting trend over the northern part of europe while precipitation based drought indices i e the standardized precipitation index do not capture this drying trend the hotspots in terms of drying are spain portugal the southern part of france italy the eastern part of germany the czech republic poland hungary slovenia and croatia the hotspots in terms of wetting are northern part of u k norway finland and sweden fig 1 this dipole like structure between the central and southern parts of europe and the north western part of europe is very clear also when looking at the probability distribution function of december spei12 averaged at country level fig 2 the 30 years probability density function pdf for some of the countries affected by the drying trend over the last 120 years i e the czech republic fig 2a poland fig 2b spain fig 2c shows a very clear pattern the period 1991 2020 was the driest one over the observational record while the period 1902 1930 was the wettest one in the case of the countries which show a wetting trend i e norway fig 2d the pattern is rather opposite the period 1991 2020 being the wettest one while the period 1902 1930 being the driest one the temporal evolution of december spei12 averaged over some of the countries affected by the drying trend i e czech republic fig 3a poland fig 3b spain fig 3c and the wetting trend i e norway indicates strong interannual variability of the drought conditions at country level as well as a statistically significant drying wetting trend of the long term drought condition i e spei12 for the czech republic poland and spain the occurrence of wet years was much higher before 1980 s compared to the period 1981 2020 after the beginning of the 1980 s there are just a limited number of years with positive wet values fig 3a b and c for the czech republic poland and spain the driest years have been recorded through the 21st century while in the case of norway the driest years have been recorded at the beginning of the 20th century the strongest drying trend is observed for the czech republic 1 53 139 years followed by poland 1 42 139 years and spain 0 98 139 years table 1 in the case of norway we observe a significant wetting trend over the analyzed period 1 42 139 years the identified hot spots in terms of drying trend have been under the influence of a long lasting drought over the last decade ionita et al 2021 moravec et al 2021 with 2015 and 2018 reaching record levels in terms of meteorological and soil moisture drought especially over the central part of europe ionita et al 2017 moravec et al 2021 the extreme dry summers in 2015 and 2018 have been associated with exceptional cold sst anomalies in the north atlantic basin and persistent high pressure systems over europe i e atmospheric blocking duchez et al 2016 ionita et al 2017 overall on monthly to interannual time scales the association between cold central north atlantic conditions blocking like atmospheric circulation patterns and dry summers in central parts of europe manifests as a predominant feature of the hydroclimate variability over europe throughout the observational record ionita et al 2011 schubert et al 2014 and also over paleo time scales ionita et al 2021 on interannual to multidecadal time scales dry wet summers were found to be associated with a cold warm north atlantic basin in the previous winter reduced enhanced winter precipitation over the central part of europe and enhanced blocking over the central and northern parts of europe ionita et al 2021 2012 kingston et al 2012 schubert et al 2016 similarly it was shown that during the negative phase of amo cold north atlantic basin germany and the southern part of the scandinavian peninsula is affected by dryness while a warm north atlantic basin positive amo phase is associated with wetness over these regions ionita et al 2012 to investigate the potential drivers of the drying trend over the central and southern part of europe we applied the cca methodology between december spei12 and the annual north atlantic sst over the 1902 2020 period fig 4 the main aim of the cca is to identify coupled modes of variability and their associated temporal components in the spei12 sst data sets fig 4a shows the sst pattern of the first coupled mode further referred as cca1 sst which explains 14 37 of the total variance it is dominated by an area of negative sst anomalies south of greenland surrounded by positive sst anomalies located around the eastern u s coast and the western european coast and the north sea the structure of the cca1 sst pattern fig 4a was found to be part of an sst mode associated with the long term amoc weakening trend caesar et al 2018 dima and lohmann 2010 which was attributed to increasing atmospheric co2 concentration dima et al 2021 later on based on observation data and simulations performed with an oceanic general circulation model it was shown that this pattern is generated by centennial scale amoc changes induced by deep water formation changes in the nordic seas dima et al 2022 e g fig 4 and s4 in their study in particular the center of negative anomalies located south of greenland appears to be linked with a weakening of an amoc cell centered at 50 n a downslope of deep western boundary current dwbc which is fed by the nordic seas overflow system could result in the bottom vortex stretching with corresponding ocean surface changes on the northern recirculation gyre associated with adjustment of the gulf stream position born et al 2009 langehaug et al 2012 yeager and danabasoglu 2014 zhang et al 2011 zhang and vallis 2006 an anomalous dwbc affects also the subpolar amoc cell through geostrophic balance these processes are consistent with the north atlantic sst structure fig 4a one notes that the amoc trend mode characterized by centennial scale changes is distinct from the multidecadal fluctuations of the overturning circulation dima and lohmann 2010 which are reflected on the north atlantic sst as a monopolar pattern and which are associated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 this implies that the atmospheric and spei12 changes emphasized here are linked only to centennial scale variations of amoc which are emphasized in climate projections for this century but are not directly reflecting the multidecadal fluctuations of the overturning associated with amo the corresponding december spei12 cca1 spei12 spatial pattern fig 4b which explains 13 88 of the total variance is characterized by a dipole like structure between the southern and central parts of europe negative loadings and the scandinavian peninsula and u k positive loadings the highest negative loadings correspond to the regions countries where a significant drying trend is observed i e spain portugal the southern part of france italy the eastern part of germany the czech republic poland hungary slovenia and croatia see also fig 1 overall the first cca pair which is the focus of our study and which reflects the coupling between december spei12 and the annual sst indicates that dry wet conditions over the southern and central northern parts of europe are associated with negative sst anomalies south of greenland flanked by positive sst anomalies over the eastern u s coast western european coast the north sea and the mediterranean sea the dipole like structure of the cca1 spei12 is a prominent feature of the drought variability at the european scale ionita et al 2015 this is consistent with the corresponding time series of the cca1 spei12 and cca1 sst which are significantly correlated r 0 89 99 significance level and shows a significant centennial trend e g drying over the southern and central parts of europe is associated with cooling of the north atlantic basin south of greenland over the analyzed period fig 4c the fact that the north atlantic cooling was associated with an amoc weakening dima and lohmann 2010 caesar et al 2018 dima et al 2022 implies that the cca1 spei12 pattern could be considered a consequence of atlantic ocean circulation slowdown in order to investigate the mechanisms through which an amoc weakening and associated negative sst anomalies south of greenland influence the spei12 field we constructed regression maps of the sea level pressure field on the cca1 spei12 time components fig 5 the regression of the annual slp field on the time series of cca1 spei12 fig 5a indicates that dry conditions over the southern and central parts of europe are associated with a high pressure system extending from the east coast of the u s to the central and southern parts of europe where it reaches the highest amplitude and a low pressure system over fennoscandia and the arctic region the mechanisms linking the cca1 spei12 pattern with this atmospheric structure are revealed also by the corresponding regression maps constructed between the seasonal slp field i e january february march fig 5b april may june fig 5c july august september fig 5d and october november december fig 5e and the time series of cca1 spei12 the winter slp regression map resembles the positive phase of the north atlantic oscillation nao fig 5b and is consistent with a barotropic atmospheric response to the north south sst gradient disposed south of greenland in the cca1 sst pattern rodwell et al 1999 fig 4b our findings are also in agreement with the study of rousi et al 2021 which has shown that an amoc decline leads to 60 increase in an anticyclonic i e high pressure circulation over the western and central parts of europe with a significant effect on the central european droughts the high pressure system over the central and southern parts of europe suppresses ascending motions and reduces water vapor condensation and precipitation formation leading to drought conditions below this system this high pressure system over the central and southern parts of europe has a seasonally persistent feature fig 5b e thus leading to long lasting droughts by suppressing precipitation and or increasing the temperature thus based on these results we argue that the long term drying trend observed over the southern and central parts of europe is driven by an association between a relatively high frequency of atmospheric blocking conditions e g persistent high pressure systems induced by the centennial scale trend of ssts disposed south of greenland this specific sst pattern was associated with a long term weakening trend of the amoc in response to increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations caesar et al 2018 dima et al 2021 the influence of the prolonged positive slp anomalies on the drying trend over the central part of europe is supported also by the first coupled mode of variability between the annual sst and the annual slp filed the spatial structure of the first coupled mode of variability sst slp fig 6 is similar to the sst pattern associated with the drying trend over central europe fig 3a and the annual slp regression map fig 5a thus we can argue that the coupling between the amoc trend mode and prolonged positive slp anomalies over the central north atlantic basin extending up to central europe are leading to drying especially in the central and southern parts of europe the influence of amoc on the north atlantic large scale atmospheric circulation is made mainly through the sst anomalies it generates in this sector consequently the structure and mechanism of atmospheric response depend on the corresponding thermal structure of the ocean surface two distinct sst patterns were emphasized in associations with amoc changes park and latif 2008 dima and lohmann 2010 dima et al 2022 on one side multidecadal amoc variations associated with amo are associated with a monopolar north atlantic sst pattern which induces a thermal baroclinic atmospheric response which projects onto nao sutton and hodson 2007 the corresponding axis of the slp dipole is not zonally aligned but it is tilted north eastward dima and lohmann 2007 on the other side centennial scale amoc changes are reflected by the sst dipole located south of greenland this patterns increases the local meridional temperature gradient which in turn favors the formation of storms which can feed with energy the zonal circulation and result in a nao like barotropic atmospheric response frankignoul et al 2013 rodwell et al 1999 this type of atmospheric response i e nao like barotropic which has an impact on the european climate can be observed in figs 5 and 6 and resembles the barotropic atmospheric response to the amoc centennial scale changes reflected by the sst dipole located south of greenland one notes that at both time scales an amoc weakening induces a positive nao like response in the atmosphere the causal relationship between the north atlantic sst pattern and the corresponding spei12 structure derived through cca has been also tested by using the ccm method which was applied to the corresponding two time series fig 4c the cross map skill from the time component of the spei12 and the time component to the north atlantic sst identified through cca increases with the library length and reaches a plateau around ρ 0 85 well above the 95 significance level indicating a robust causal relationship from the later to the former fig 7 4 discussion and conclusions in this study we have investigated the spatio temporal variability of the annual drought variability over europe as represented by spei12 and related the long term drying trend over the central and southern parts of europe with large scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies the relationship between december spei12 which reflects an integration of moisture availability through the whole year and annual sst was analyzed by using canonical correlation analysis and convergent cross mapping methods we have focused the current study just on the first mode of coupled variability since we aimed to identify the drivers of the drying wetting trend patterns at european scale the coupled modes of variability as identified by the cca can provide insights into the teleconnection patterns between the long term drought conditions over europe and global regional sst patterns these indicate that the long term drying trend in the southern and central parts of europe as captured by spei12 is linked with a dipolar slp pattern which resembles the positive phase of nao but with the azore center shifted towards europe which is reminiscent of a barotropic response to a sst structure located south of greenland in response to the long term weakening trend of the amoc the relationship between a weak amoc state and long lasting drought over europe seems to be a pervasive one through different time scales and climate backgrounds in a recent study ionita et al 2021 have found that long lasting droughts over the central part of europe over the last millennium have been driven by a combination of low solar variability a weak amoc state characterized by negative sst anomalies south of greenland and high atmospheric blocking frequency over the central part of europe from an even longer time span perspective the 8 2ka bp climatic event which occurred during a period of a relatively warm climate background and was likely associated with a significant reduction of the amoc intensity von grafenstein et al 1998 and can be seen as an analog for the current and future oceanic and hydro climatic configuration consistent with our results an abrupt surface cooling of the north atlantic basin which indicated a weakening of amoc at 8 2ka lead to enhanced drying over the western part of europe further back in time for the younger dryas fluctuation about 12 900 11 700 years bp a strong cooling of the north atlantic ocean in response to a reduction of the amoc corroborated with enhanced blocking activity has been associated with harsh winters and warm summers over europe schenk et al 2018 therefore the connections between the north atlantic ocean and dryness wetness over europe appear to represent a pervasive manifestation through climatic events manifested in both recent and distant past future climate projections indicate that europe will face substantial drying even for the less aggressive pathways scenarios ssp126 and ssp245 balting et al 2021 as climate projections show a long term slowdown of amoc during this century collins et al 2013

introduction sediment loading to the coast is critical for both ecosystems and coastal geomorphology globally mentaschi et al 2018 walling 2012 and in california slagel and griggs 2008 willis and griggs 2003 dam construction has decreased sediment loads to the coast threatening wetland and beach stability in southern california post dam sediment loads are less than 50 of pre dam loads resulting in beach erosion and expensive beach nourishment activities slagel and griggs 2008 by contrast land use change including the construction phase of urbanization wolman 1967 road construction tarolli and sofia 2016 mining messina and biggs 2016 and agriculture dedkov and mozzherin 1996 generally increase sediment loads particularly from small watersheds though some urban surfaces may generate less sediment than undisturbed areas due to pavement and revegetation wolman 1967 other activities including channelization brown 1988 simon 1989 and importing water for human use manago and hogue 2017 may also increase runoff and change sediment loads increased sediment loads can increase sedimentation in coastal wetlands converting them to upland habitat and triggering costly management interventions chapman et al 2014 fennessey and jarrett 1994 in southern california and along the us mexico border all four human activities dams channelization water imports and land use change occur parts of the tijuana river estuary in southern san diego county which receives loads from the cross border tijuana river have experienced high sedimentation rates attributed in part to rapid urbanization weis et al 2001 with consequent impacts on the estuarine ecosystem zedler and west 2008 and tidal channels wallace et al 2005 rapid urbanization in tijuana has increased sediment loads above pre disturbance levels in some locations where bare soil with high erosion rates can persist for decades biggs et al 2010 and where channel erosion rates can be many times the natural background rate taniguchi et al 2018 however much of tijuana has high impervious surface coverage and channelization which can reduce sediment loads below the natural background wolman 1967 and the municipal government has installed dozens of sedimentation basins in tijuana to control sediment loads several large dams on the tijuana river and its major tributaries have also reduced the active contributing area of the watershed by 70 reducing total runoff and sediment loads by approximately 50 compared with pre development conditions resulting in beach erosion in both the united states and mexico inman and masters 1991 willis and griggs 2003 at the same time smaller canyons drainage areas 10 km2 on erodible sediments with no dams contribute high sediment loads in the southern part of the estuary due to unregulated urbanization on steep hillslopes biggs et al 2018 gudino elizondo et al 2019 and high rates of stream channel erosion taniguchi et al 2018 the combined impacts of urbanization and dams on the runoff and suspended sediment load ssl of the tijuana river system remain to be determined including comparisons before 1960 1970 s and after the large scale urbanization the need for updated ssl estimates and change over time is especially critical as government agencies develop plans to mitigate cross border flows of sewage and sediment ssl also varies over time due to climate variability and extreme events most of the long term ssl to coastal california over 1944 1995 was delivered in a few wet years inman and jenkins 1999 and calculations of long term ssl must account for the frequency distribution of ssl especially extreme events li et al 2020 the relationship between rainfall runoff and ssl may change for large events that trigger releases from dams since water released from dams typically has lower sediment concentrations than the water entering the dam however monitoring and measurement of ssl may be limited to relatively small events where there may not be overflow from large dams in california reservoirs trap 84 of the ssl entering them willis and griggs 2003 so extrapolation of sediment rating curves developed using data from small events to extreme events may significantly overestimate ssl in this study data on ssc from historical 1973 1979 2002 2014 and recent 2019 2021 periods are compiled and combined with long time series of runoff q and rainfall p to estimate the relationship between p q and ssl for the tijuana river the q p relationship is tested for change over time and the ssc q and ssl q relationships observed in 2001 2021 are compared with data from the 1970 s the impact of dams on calculations of ssl during wet years receives special attention we aim to answer what is the relationship between storm size and sediment loads what storm sizes and return intervals account for most of the sediment load on decadal timescales what is the impact of different assumptions about sediment retention by dams on ssl calculations have the annual q p relationship and sediment rating curves ssl q changed from the 1970 2010 s finally how does ssl in the tijuana river compare with loads from smaller watersheds that drain to the tijuana estuary and in other watersheds in california the major contributions of the paper are to 1 quantify decadal means variability and frequency in runoff and ssl 2 quantify uncertainty in ssl caused by dams and by scatter in the q ssl relationship and 3 test for changes in runoff and ssl in a rapidly urbanizing section of the us mexico border region 2 study area the tijuana river watershed

outlets of three small watersheds that drain directly to the southern part of the estuary safran et al 2017 the lower reach of tijuana river was channelized in early 1979 in part in response to

city of san diego r morales personal communication and historical observations indicated if spillway overflow occurred at the rodriguez dam urs corporation 2012 for 1970 2009 and r morales personal communication for 2010 2020 3 2 ssc data we compiled historical data on ssc of the tijuana river from a municipal monitoring program 2002 2014 weston solutions 2015 and from the united states geological survey usgs 1970 s we also collected our own water samples in 2019 2021 and analyzed them for suspended sediment concentrations ssc the historical data were reported as either total suspended solids tss 2002 2014 or ssc 1970 s and the new samples 2019 2021 were analyzed for ssc tss and ssc differ in the method of subsampling in the laboratory see s1 0 for details following recommendations of gray et al 2000 we do not attempt to correct the tss values to ssc and assume that the difference between tss and ssc values is small compared to other uncertainties in the calculation of ssl tss values in stormwater were obtained from an existing report weston solutions 2015 composite samples were taken from hollister bridge fig 1 for twenty two storms sampled from january 2002 to march 2014 all samples were volume weighted composites though some samples had more frequent sampling on the rising limb see s2 0 and fig s1 the usgs reported 182 values of ssc from hollister bridge over 1970 1978 station 11013500 united states geological survey 2016 http waterdata usgs gov nwis access date 2021 06 21 fig 1 additional water samples were taken by the authors from the tijuana river in 2019 2021 at dairy mart road bridge dmr fig 1 with a combination of grab samples and an autosampler that took samples once an hour see s3 1 for details of the water sampling ssc methods and ssc data 3 3 storm metrics and ssc traditional sediment rating curves where instantaneous ssl is modeled as a function of instantaneous runoff may result in significant error given intra event hysteresis in ssc warrick et al 2015 management agencies also often only collect composite samples and report storm wise mean ssc complicating the use of instantaneous rating curves storm metrics such as total or peak runoff qpk may provide more accurate predictions of ssc and ssl than instantaneous sediment rating curves duvert et al 2012 in california qpk correlates with sediment yield in individual watersheds but the relationship varies by location warrick et al 2015 we therefore modeled storm wise mean ssc as a power function of qpk duvert et al 2012 1 ssc bcf sscqpk a q pk b where a and b are determined through linear regression on the log transformed values of ssc and qpk and bcfsscqpk is a bias correction factor crawford 1991 that compensates for the underestimation that occurs when using minimum least squares on log transformed variables the regression parameters were calibrated to the data collected from 2002 to 2021 outliers were identified using the tukey fence method and the impact of outliers quantified by comparing regression parameters annual q and annual ssl with and without outliers see s3 2 for details in order to calculate annual ssl for the period with 5 minute runoff data 2001 2020 the ecohydrology package fuka et al 2018 in r r core team 2021 was used to separate streamflow into stormflow and baseflow qpk and total stormflow volume were then calculated for each storm ssc was estimated for each storm using eq 1 and ssl calculated as the product of total volume and ssc see s3 3 for details suspended sediment yield ssy was calculated by dividing ssl by the drainage area of the lower watershed a lower fig 1 since watersheds upstream of dams contributed flows in only a few years 3 4 annual ssl and accounting for dams sub daily runoff data were not available for 1962 2000 so we could not use a storm wise ssc qpk relationship eq 1 to estimate annual ssl sslann for years before 2001 instead we estimated sslann tons for the whole period 1962 2020 from annual q qann mcm 2 ssl ann bcf ann c q ann d where bcfann is the bias correction factor for annual values and c and d are regression parameters all of the available ssc data were collected during periods with no overflow from the two main dams barrett and rodriguez sediment retention behind the dams could cause ssc and ssl to be lower than predicted by eq 2 during wet periods with spillway overflow in order to quantify the impact of different assumptions about dam impacts on ssl estimates we calculated ssl for years with overflow using eq 2 given two different values of q 1 qann tot which includes overflow and assumes that overflow from the dams does not change the ssl q relationship eq 2 and 2 qann lower which excludes overflow and is estimated as 3 q ann lower bcf qp gp ann lower h where bcf qp is the bias correction factor for the q p regression pann lower is annual rainfall in the lower watershed and g and h are regression parameters sslann at the outlet for years with overflow is then calculated from eq 2 with qann lower as the predictor which assumes complete retention of sediment in the reservoirs and no channel erosion downstream of the dams the channel downstream of rodriguez dam is channelized with concrete and has limited opportunity for erosion urs corporation 2012a note that this sensitivity analysis does not determine the impact of dams per se on long term sediment load the ssl q relationship eq 2 already includes the impact of dams because the data to calibrate eq 1 were collected in the post dam period rather we quantify the impact of assumptions about dams on ssl calculations for years with overflow the combined impact of q p and ssl q on annual ssl was determined by creating an ssl p relationship 4 ssl ann bcf sslp mp ann lower n where bcf sslp is the bias correction factor and m and n are regression parameters this regression assumes that dams retain all sediment that enters the corresponding reservoir errors in ssl estimates can be quantified using standard statistical techniques which may be less applicable if the data are non normal or if multiple types of uncertainty are present alternatively bootstrapping and monte carlo methods rustomji and wilkinson 2008 can be used to estimate uncertainty we used bootstrapping with replacement to generate 1000 ssc qpk data sets and therefore 1000 estimates of the parameters of the ssc qpk relationship eq 1 these parameters were used to estimate ensembles of 1000 values each of 1 sslann for 2001 2020 2 parameters of eq 2 and 3 values of sslann for each year from 1962 to 2020 3 5 change over time and comparisons with other studies we tested for changes in the annual q p relationship before and after the start of imported water 1978 and channelization 1979 both of which occurred within several months of each other so we were unable to separate their effects we instead refer to pre and post 1978 periods where the pre 1978 period includes the 1962 1978 water years the statistical significance of changes in the coefficients of the power functions eqs 2 4 were tested using linear regression on the log transformed variables including pre or post 1978 as an indicator variable 0 or 1 and an interaction term between the continuous variables p or q and the indicator changes in the annual q p relationship during the post 1978 period 1979 2019 were determined using multiple regression with p and year as independent variables sslann 2001 2019 and instantaneous ssc 2019 2021 were compared with historical data from 1970 to 1978 and with the annual and instantaneous sediment rating curves of brownlie and taylor 1981 hereafter bt81 which were based on data from 1973 to 1975 the combined impact of changes in the q p and ssl q relationships were quantified by creating ssl p relationships in the pre and post 1978 periods q and ssl were calculated for a pre 1978 scenario by applying the q p eq 3 and ssl p eq 4 relationships from the pre 1978 period to the p time series in the post 1978 period 1980 2019 other studies on the tijuana river used methods similar to ours to quantify long term ssl bt81 calculated ssl for 1937 1975 using an instantaneous sediment rating curve ssc q developed from 43 samples taken at hollister bridge by the usgs from 1973 to 1975 bt81 then estimated sslann from a log linear regression of sslann against qann equivalent to eq 2 but with no bias correction factor the highest runoff with ssc data in the analysis of bt81 was very low 3 23 m3 s 1 compared with both our largest sampled runoff 128 4 m3 s 1 and with the peak runoff of all storms from 2001 to 2020 bt81 therefore extrapolated well beyond the observed range of runoff in part due to low runoff in the pre 1978 conditions increasing uncertainty about ssl during high runoff and wet years in the 1970 s inman and jenkins 1999 hereafter ij99 updated the period of record of ssl estimates to 1995 using the same annual sediment rating curve as bt81 and streamflow data to 1995 ij99 did not add any more ssc values or recalculate annual rating curves in order to compare our ssl values with ij99 we calculated ssl for the same wet period as ij99 1969 1995 using our annual ssl q relationship eq 2 we also compare our ssl estimates with values from urs corporation 2012a who also estimated annual sediment load of the tijuana river under undisturbed conditions using annual runoff and an empirical equation calibrated to sedimentation rates for reservoirs across the conterminous united states 4 results 4 1 ssc results 2019 2021 seven storms were sampled at dairy mart road in 2019 2021 and sixty two samples were analyzed for ssc table s1 data from one storm were omitted see s4 0 for details including ssc data and sampled hydrographs figs s2 s8 and tables s2 s8 the maximum runoff with a water sample during the 2019 2021 period 128 4 m3 s 1 was close to the largest qpk of storms sampled over 2002 2014 133 6 m3 s 1 instantaneous ssc values over 2019 2021 ranged from 95 mg l 1 during pre storm conditions to 5480 mg l 1 at the largest sampled runoff 4 2 storm wise sediment rating curves storm wise mean ssc increased linearly with event peak runoff qpk in log log space years 2001 2014 and 2019 2021 fig 2 the tukey 1977 method identified three outliers the ssc qpk regression excluding outliers r2 0 61 was used to estimate ssc for storms with no ssc observations over the 2001 2019 period see s5 0 table s9 for details storm wise mean ssc of the storms sampled from 2019 to 2021 fell in the range of the values from 2002 to 2014 with one high mean ssc value at low qpk 4 m3 s 1 fig 2 there was no indication of differences in ssc by sampling location see s4 0 for details 4 3 stormflow separation the stormflow separation algorithm identified 498 storm events over 2001 2020 when using a flow threshold of 1 m3 s 1 a filter parameter f of 0 99 and storm separation duration sephr of 12 h annual q and ssl were relatively insensitive to the separation parameters see s6 0 table s10 figs s9 s18 qpk ranged from 1 to 532 m3 s 1 many of the storms were small 10 m3 s 1 fig s19 and most qpk values were smaller than the maximum qpk in the observed ssc dataset though 15 storms had qpk greater than twice the qpk of the largest storm sampled for ssc baseflow was high in 2020 due in part to continual sewage releases see s6 0 where the qpk ssc relationship may not hold so we excluded the 2020 water year from further analyses 4 4 storm wise and annual suspended sediment load 2001 2019 sslann averaged 0 131 0 037 mt y 1 ssy 112 9 tons km 2 yr 1 over 2001 2019 ranging from 1200 300 tons in 2002 to 587 000 182 000 tons in 2017 table s11 the twenty largest storms delivered 73 of the total ssl over the 2001 2019 period the 10 largest storms delivered 53 and the single largest storm 9 5 table s12 demonstrating the importance of large events in the long term sediment load however storms smaller than the 2 year storm accounted for 47 of the total sediment load so while a few large storms were important more numerous smaller storms also accounted for around half of the cumulative ssl sslann tons correlated with qann mcm over 2001 2019 fig 3 bootstrap regressions provided 1000 estimates of c and d fig 3 the c and d parameters are inversely related so could not be sampled independently for sensitivity analysis instead c and d pairs were selected for bootstrapping the mean and standard deviation of the regression parameters eq 2 from the bootstrapping were bcfann 1 1 0 03 c 260 5 76 9 and d 1 67 0 12 4 5 annual q and q p relationships 1962 2019 the runoff time series has three periods table 1 fig 4 very low runoff 1962 1978 high runoff with several years of dam overflow 1979 1999 and moderate flow with no dam overflow 2000 2019 qann in the 3 wettest years was 5 5 4 5 and 4 4 times higher than the largest annual flow observed from 2001 to 2019 us army corps of engineers 2018 one or both of the two dams overflowed in 8 years 14 of all years between 1962 and 2019 fig 4 barrett overflowed more frequently and for lower runoff values than did rodriguez barrett had zero overflow from 2006 to 2019 r morales personal communication so we assume that rodriguez also did not overflow in any year after 2010 annual q correlated linearly with annual p in log log space fig 5 four years with overflow 1980 1983 1993 1995 had significantly more runoff than predicted using eq 3 fig 5 suggesting either that the upper watershed produced large volumes of runoff in those years or that there were non linearities in the q p relationship in the lower watershed that are not captured by the log linear function eq 3 changes in the q p relationship are discussed in section 4 7 1 4 6 annual ssl 1962 2019 frequency analysis and assumptions about dams applying the bootstrapped parameters of eq 2 to the qann time series from 1962 to 2019 generated 1000 values of sslann for each year from which we calculated a mean and standard deviation for each year fig 6 the long term mean sslann was 0 128 0 165 mt yr 1 with a range of 0 0012 0 574 mt yr 1 the coefficient of variation cv standard deviation mean of the bootstrapped values of sslann was highest 30 for years with high rainfall nearly half 46 of the cumulative sslann over 1962 2019 occurred during very wet years recurrence interval tr 10 years the wettest years tr 20 years contributed 28 fig 7 when using qann lower to predict sslann slightly more than half of the long term ssl was contributed by years with a return interval of less than 10 years a small fraction of ssl 5 was contributed by annual runoff with a tr of 2 years or less calculations of sslann for years with dam overflow were highly sensitive to the q values used in eq 2 and the corresponding assumptions about dam impacts on ssl table 1 using qann total to predict sslann which assumes that dams do not impact the ssl q relationship results in a much larger 7 1x total ssl 0 920 mt y 1 over 1962 2019 compared with using qann lower 0 128 mt y 1 which assumes complete retention by dams using qann total also results in a larger contribution 90 of the wettest years tr 10 years to cumulative sslann compared with using qann lower 46 from the wettest years fig 7 the ratio of ssl estimated by using qann total to ssl estimated using qann lower ranged from 6 8 to 33 9 for the four wettest years table 1 the lower estimate where ssl for years with overflow is calculated using qann lower is likely more reliable since dams typically retain a large percentage of the sediment load into them 85 for reservoirs in california willis and griggs 2003 our purpose here is to quantify the range of possible ssl values and to demonstrate how not taking dams into account can bias ssl calculations in years with overflow 4 7 change over time 4 7 1 changes in annual q p relationships and q annual runoff qann increased for a given annual rainfall after 1978 coinciding with the start of imported water and channelization with the largest percentage increases at low annual rainfall fig 5 the parameters of the q p relationship in the pre 1978 condition 1962 1978 were bcf 1 24 g 5 1 10 9 and h 3 305 r2 0 62 in the post 1978 condition the parameters were bcf 1 10 g 4 7 10 4 h 1 832 r2 0 67 the intercepts and slopes of the q p relationship were statistically different p 0 01 pre and post 1978 using the pre 1978 q p parameters to predict q in the post 1978 period years with no overflow only gives mean annual runoff of 1 8 mcm compared with 26 5 mcm observed an approximate 15 fold increase the mechanisms that could account for this increase are discussed in section 5 2 4 7 2 changes in ssl q relationships annual ssl was higher for a given annual runoff in the 1970 s bt81 compared to the 2000 s except for the wettest years fig 3 additional ssc data from the usgs 1976 1978 not included in bt81 or ij99 fig 8 fig s21 suggests that ssl and ssc were consistently higher in the 1970 s than in 2019 2021 at low runoff 0 1 1 m3 s 1 but were highly variable for runoff greater than 1 m3 s 1 daily ssl in april may and june amj 1978 for example was significantly lower than daily ssl in 2019 2021 but ssl in amj was not different from other months for all other years in the 1970 1977 period fig 8 seasonality could account for the low ssc at high flows in 1978 amj since amj is at the end of the wet season but the available data do not allow for robust conclusions all samples from the 1970 s were collected prior to channelization and imported water which could have either increased or decreased ssc for a given runoff depending on the role of the channel and wastewater in providing sediment at low flows additional sampling may help quantify seasonal differences in the ssc q relationship and allow for a more robust comparison with historical data though the lack of historical ssc data at high runoff complicates quantification of changes over time 4 7 3 changes in ssl p relationships and annual ssl post 1978 ssl was several times higher than pre 1978 ssl for a given pann lower fig 9 this suggests that higher ssc in the 1970 s was more than balanced by higher runoff production in the post 1978 period resulting in higher ssl for a given annual p in the post 1978 period with decreasing differences in wetter years the slopes and intercepts of the ssl p relationship were statistically significantly different pre and post 1978 p 0 05 if the low ssc and ssl values observed in april and may of 1978 fig 8 are more representative than the higher values in 1970 1977 then the pre 1978 ssl would be even lower than our estimate sslann during the post 1978 period no overflow years only calculated assuming pre 1978 parameter values eq 4 was 7831 tons y 1 while the mean for the same time period using the post 1978 parameter values was 94 888 tons y 1 combined the increase in runoff 15 fold more than compensated for any potential decrease in ssc resulting in a 12 fold increase in ssl from pre to post 1978 conditions the impact of uncertainties in the historical and recent data and the plausibility of this magnitude of change will be discussed in section 5 2 4 8 comparison with other studies on the tijuana river our upper bound estimate of ssl during the wet period of ij99 1969 1995 using qann total to predict ssl 1 85 mtons yr 1 was 5 3 times higher than the ij99 estimate while our lower bound estimate using qann lower 0 148 mtons yr 1 was 58 lower than the ij99 estimate table 2 our higher sslann estimate when using qann total is due to our annual ssl q relationship fig 5 which has higher ssl at high runoff qann 60 mcm than the relationship used by ij99 our ssl estimate using qann lower is lower than ij99 due to our assumption of reservoir retention of sediment during years of overflow which dominate the long term average due to the likelihood of high rates of sediment retention in the reservoirs and our additional ssc observations at high runoff we believe that our revised estimate of 0 148 mtons yr 1 over 1969 1995 is the most reliable and that ij99 may overestimate ssl not controlling for the time period our estimated mean annual ssy over 1962 2019 is 38 lower than ij99 years 1944 1995 and 15 lower than the warrick and farnsworth 2009 estimates for the tijuana river table 2 5 discussion 5 1 dam impacts on ssl calculations assumptions about dams and their impact on the q ssl relationship had a large impact on ssl estimates both for the years with overflow and for the long term mean use of runoff from the lower watershed only qann lower to estimate suspended sediment loads sslann which assumes complete retention of sediment behind dams results in significantly lower ssl values compared with the use of qann total table 1 and compared to previous estimates ij99 it also reduces the importance of the wettest years which have much higher runoff fig 4 but not significantly higher ssl fig 6 due to retention of sediment behind the dams this conclusion depends on accurate estimation of qann lower non linearities in the q p response could result in inaccurate estimates of qann lower especially for years with high rainfall future research could use more detailed q p modeling of the lower watershed our documentation of dam impacts on ssl estimates is important for estimates of ssl in other river basins with dams samples of ssc are often collected for relatively small frequent storms when dam overflow may be unlikely extrapolation of the ssl q relationship for years with overflow would then overestimate ssl a systematic review of existing ssl estimates e g ij99 and sensitivity analysis using the method proposed here would help determine the magnitude of this potential overestimation 5 2 change over time 5 2 1 annual runoff mean annual runoff increased by 24 7 mcm 15x after 1978 controlling for precipitation variability the increase in q could be due to channelization of the tijuana river in 1979 and to the start of importing of water from the colorado river 1978 channelization reduces channel infiltration and could have reduced groundwater flow down the valley and reduced evapotranspiration from riparian vegetation limited data are available to determine the extent of the pre 1978 riparian vegetation but riparian evapotranspiration et can be approximated to a first order assuming riparian vegetation width ranging from 100 m to 500 m along the 4 km of channelized river and 1260 mm per year of et equal to potential et of the coastal region hart et al 2009 gives annual et of the pre channel riparian zone of 2 5 3 8 mcm which is much smaller than the change in annual runoff 24 7 mcm infiltration in the channel and floodplain with resulting down valley groundwater flow may have further reduced surface flow before channelization but estimation of this flow is beyond the scope of this paper the volume of water imported from the colorado river was 101 3 mcm by 2008 cohen et al 2011 which is larger than the observed increase in runoff wastewater from tijuana discharged directly to the river until 1997 when the international water treatment plant was finalized further research is needed including on how wastewater effluent dams channelization and urbanization affect the q p relationship baseflow stormflow and annual q 5 2 2 sediment rating curves and ssl annual fig 5 and instantaneous sediment rating curves q vs ssl or ssc fig 8 fig s20 suggest that ssl for a given runoff was lower in 2001 2019 than in the 1970 s for low annual runoff but similar for higher runoff there is considerable uncertainty in ssc for high flows as most of the 1970 s samples were collected at low flow 3 28 m3 s 1 instantaneous ssl was approximately 10x higher in 1970 s compared with 2019 2021 for low runoff fig 8 except for april june 1978 which had lower annual ssl for a given annual q higher runoff post 1978 resulted in higher ssl despite the lower ssl for a given discharge our analysis suggests that ssl was 12x higher in the post 1978 condition than it would have been under pre 1978 conditions assuming the sediment rating curves were stable for the full range of runoff observed however ssl in the post dam period was still 60 lower than ssl estimated for pre dam conditions by inman and masters 1991 suggesting that ssl increased post 1978 compared with 1962 1978 conditions but likely not to pre dam levels table 2 5 3 land use and channelization impacts on ssl sediment management in tijuana especially the installation of sedimentation basins may have reduced the sediment load under conditions of low runoff large human impacts on small runoff events with limited impacts on large events is also seen in floods where land use has the biggest impact for return periods of 5 years white and greer 2006 in addition impervious cover is high 50 80 in the urban core of tijuana biggs et al 2010 and many stream channels have been lined with concrete both of which could reduce ssl below the pre urban background wolman 1967 more work is needed to calculate the historical and contemporary rating curves and ssl of the tijuana river and how they are impacted by seasonality management and land cover change 5 4 comparisons with other watersheds in southern california ssl for watersheds in the peninsular ranges of southern california averaged 100 tons km 2 yr 1 and ranged from 10 to 350 tons km 2 yr 1 ij99 tijuana river ssl from our study table 2 is within the range of other watersheds in the peninsular range suggesting that while urbanization may have increased ssl above the pre urban baseline urbanization does not appear to have increased the ssl of the tijuana river beyond the range observed in other watersheds in southern california however channelization and imported water coincided with a large increase in runoff for a given annual rainfall fig 4 and year was a significant predictor of annual runoff after controlling for annual rainfall combined this resulted in a 12 fold increase in ssl compared with pre 1978 conditions however dam construction has likely reduced sediment load by 50 75 from pre dam conditions table 2 ij99 inman and masters 1991 significant uncertainty remains about the combined impacts of dam construction imported water urbanization and channelization on runoff and sediment loads in contrast with the tijuana river and other peninsular ranges ssy in the los laureles canyon watershed llcw 11 6 km2 which drains directly into the tijuana estuary was extremely high 5000 tons km 2 y 1 biggs et al 2018 and roughly 42 times the ssy of the tijuana river the trap data used for the llcw includes bedload but the trapped sediment was only approximately 10 15 by weight cobbles or larger 64 mm diameter and most of the sediment in the trap is fine to very fine sand taniguchi quan unpublished data the undammed side canyons draining to the tijuana estuary have much higher sediment yields than the mainstem of the tijuana river with consequent high sedimentation rates and impacts on the southern part of the estuary 5 5 implications for sediment accumulation and management our results suggest a paradox runoff and annual suspended sediment load from the tijuana river has likely increased during urbanization but loads in the post dam period 1936 present are likely still lower than the pre dam load table 2 and yet the tijuana estuary has lost most of its tidal prism due to high rates of sediment accumulation safran et al 2017 the tijuana river also does not have significantly higher loads than other streams on similar lithology the paradox could be explained in part by the reduction in stormflow and consequent reduced transport capacity of the river following dam construction bt81 estimate that annual flow in the tijuana river decreased from 8 6 mcm in pre dam conditions to 1 6 mcm in the post dam but pre channelization period 1951 1975 a reduction of 81 table c11 3 in bt81 annual and peak runoff increased following channelization and urbanization in the post dam period fig 5 though it is unclear whether flows reached their pre dam levels significant uncertainty remains about the magnitudes of pre dam runoff and ssl and the runoff necessary to transport sediment through the estuary to the coast 6 conclusion 6 1 main findings flood events larger than the 2 year recurrence interval n 10 accounted for more than half of total suspended sediment load ssl of the tijuana river over 2001 2019 but frequent floods smaller than the 2 year event also accounted for nearly half of ssl over the longer time period 1962 2019 the 10 wettest years accounted for 48 of ssl while the driest 50 of years accounted for less than 5 extreme events may have less impact on decadal cumulative ssl than previously documented ij99 due to the impact of sediment retention by dams on ssl estimates during years with dam overflow overall large events and wet years are important for the long term load but more frequently occurring years and events are also important ssl in the tijuana river likely decreased from 1970 s to 2019 2021 for small storms due to higher suspended sediment concentrations in the 1970 s but annual runoff increased markedly resulting in a net increase in annual ssl the ssl from the tijuana river is still likely around half of the load prior to construction of dams upstream ij99 inman and masters 1991 and delivery of sediment to the coast is likely further reduced by a reduction in flow and transport capacity willis and griggs 2003 reduced flow in the post dam period likely contributes to accumulation of sediment in the tijuana estuary and to low sediment loads to the ocean and consequent beach erosion 6 2 limitations and future work sediment load estimates are uncertain especially during the wet years tr 10 y that account for approximately half of the total ssl our calculations of ssl and the impact of dams depend on accurate estimation of runoff from the lower watershed and stability of the annual ssl q relationship the abrupt increase in runoff post 1978 coincides with channelization and the start of imported water but changes in measured runoff could also be caused in part by changes in the methods equipment or rating curves associated with channelization q p and ssl q relationships may change markedly during extreme events but the current dataset and most similar datasets do not have ssc data for those events future work could model annual runoff and sediment loads for upper and lower watersheds in the few extreme wet years including the trapping efficiencies of the two main reservoirs sediment loads may have increased post channelization and post urbanization due to increased runoff but significant uncertainty in the historical 1960 70 s relationship between runoff and ssl precludes precise estimates our analysis quantifies changes in runoff and sediment loading over time but does not identify the mechanism responsible for the changes channelization urban wastewater impervious surface soil exposure and channel erosion could all contribute to changes in runoff and or sediment loads future work could model runoff and sediment loads and analyze intra annual changes in flow duration curves to identify mechanisms responsible for the observed changes both drought and flood frequency are projected to increase in the region ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 modrick and georgakakos 2015 ssl is a non linear function of rainfall so increases in both wet and dry years could cause a net increase in ssl to the estuary even if long term mean rainfall does not change the interacting effects of climate variability channelization urbanization imported water runoff sediment loads estuarine sedimentation rates and ecosystem impacts require further quantification 6 3 implications and broader impacts our methods and findings have implications for calculations of sediment loads in other locations first event wise modeling of sediment loads can leverage municipal monitoring datasets which may be event wise composites and not instantaneous values used in traditional rating curve construction second the relationships between annual rainfall runoff and sediment loads can be highly impacted by dams upstream especially during extreme wet years when dams overflow but this is often difficult to quantify due to limited data availability for extreme events sediment retention behind dams can reduce sediment concentrations downstream but such effects may not be included in sediment rating curves fit to ssc measurements taken at low runoff without dam overflow uncertainty analysis as performed here can help quantity possible dam impacts on calculations of long term sediment loads third we quantify uncertainty in the sediment runoff relationships using bootstrapping and provide an updated estimation of long term sediment loads and trends which can be used to inform future sediment management and restoration efforts revised sediment runoff relationships can also be used to calibrate watershed models to evaluate the effects of sea level rise climate change and land use changes on future sediment loads and resilience of coastal wetlands funding this work was supported by

7937,study region tijuana river watershed on the us mexico border where urbanization estuarine sedimentation and beach erosion incentivize quantification of runoff and suspended sediment loads ssl and concentrations ssc study focus rainfall runoff and ssl were quantified for 2001 2019 storm wise and 1962 2019 annual using sediment rating curves and bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty new hydrological insights annual runoff increased for a given rainfall depth following channelization and the start of imported water in 1978 79 and during urbanization over 1980 2019 ssc for a given runoff fell between 1970 s and 2000 s but annual ssl increased severalfold due to higher annual runoff half the ssl over 2001 2019 occurred during nine storms nearly half 48 of annual ssl occurred in the six wettest years over 1962 2019 though years with recurrence interval 2 10 years accounted for 50 neglecting the impact of dams on the ssl rainfall relationship during extreme wet years over estimated annual ssl by a factor of 7 and by up to 30x for the wettest year long term mean suspended sediment yield 119 tons km 2 yr 1 is similar to other southern california watersheds but much lower than observed 5000 tons km 2 yr 1 in a small watershed that also drains to the tijuana estuary accumulation of sediment in the estuary may be driven by undammed side canyons and by low runoff that

introduction sediment loading to the coast is critical for both ecosystems and coastal geomorphology globally mentaschi et al 2018 walling 2012 and in california slagel and griggs 2008 willis and griggs 2003 dam construction has decreased sediment loads to the coast threatening wetland and beach stability in southern california post dam sediment loads are less than 50 of pre dam loads resulting in beach erosion and expensive beach nourishment activities slagel and griggs 2008 by contrast land use change including the construction phase of urbanization wolman 1967 road construction tarolli and sofia 2016 mining messina and biggs 2016 and agriculture dedkov and mozzherin 1996 generally increase sediment loads particularly from small watersheds though some urban surfaces may generate less sediment than undisturbed areas due to pavement and revegetation wolman 1967 other activities including channelization brown 1988 simon 1989 and importing water for human use manago and hogue 2017 may also increase runoff and change sediment loads increased sediment loads can increase sedimentation in coastal wetlands converting them to upland habitat and triggering costly management interventions chapman et al 2014 fennessey and jarrett 1994 in southern california and along the us mexico border all four human activities dams channelization water imports and land use change occur parts of the tijuana river estuary in southern san diego county which receives loads from the cross border tijuana river have experienced high sedimentation rates attributed in part to rapid urbanization weis et al 2001 with consequent impacts on the estuarine ecosystem zedler and west 2008 and tidal channels wallace et al 2005 rapid urbanization in tijuana has increased sediment loads above pre disturbance levels in some locations where bare soil with high erosion rates can persist for decades biggs et al 2010 and where channel erosion rates can be many times the natural background rate taniguchi et al 2018 however much of tijuana has high impervious surface coverage and channelization which can reduce sediment loads below the natural background wolman 1967 and the municipal government has installed dozens of sedimentation basins in tijuana to control sediment loads several large dams on the tijuana river and its major tributaries have also reduced the active contributing area of the watershed by 70 reducing total runoff and sediment loads by approximately 50 compared with pre development conditions resulting in beach erosion in both the united states and mexico inman and masters 1991 willis and griggs 2003 at the same time smaller canyons drainage areas 10 km2 on erodible sediments with no dams contribute high sediment loads in the southern part of the estuary due to unregulated urbanization on steep hillslopes biggs et al 2018 gudino elizondo et al 2019 and high rates of stream channel erosion taniguchi et al 2018 the combined impacts of urbanization and dams on the runoff and suspended sediment load ssl of the tijuana river system remain to be determined including comparisons before 1960 1970 s and after the large scale urbanization the need for updated ssl estimates and change over time is especially critical as government agencies develop plans to mitigate cross border flows of sewage and sediment ssl also varies over time due to climate variability and extreme events most of the long term ssl to coastal california over 1944 1995 was delivered in a few wet years inman and jenkins 1999 and calculations of long term ssl must account for the frequency distribution of ssl especially extreme events li et al 2020 the relationship between rainfall runoff and ssl may change for large events that trigger releases from dams since water released from dams typically has lower sediment concentrations than the water entering the dam however monitoring and measurement of ssl may be limited to relatively small events where there may not be overflow from large dams in california reservoirs trap 84 of the ssl entering them willis and griggs 2003 so extrapolation of sediment rating curves developed using data from small events to extreme events may significantly overestimate ssl in this study data on ssc from historical 1973 1979 2002 2014 and recent 2019 2021 periods are compiled and combined with long time series of runoff q and rainfall p to estimate the relationship between p q and ssl for the tijuana river the q p relationship is tested for change over time and the ssc q and ssl q relationships observed in 2001 2021 are compared with data from the 1970 s the impact of dams on calculations of ssl during wet years receives special attention we aim to answer what is the relationship between storm size and sediment loads what storm sizes and return intervals account for most of the sediment load on decadal timescales what is the impact of different assumptions about sediment retention by dams on ssl calculations have the annual q p relationship and sediment rating curves ssl q changed from the 1970 2010 s finally how does ssl in the tijuana river compare with loads from smaller watersheds that drain to the tijuana estuary and in other watersheds in california the major contributions of the paper are to 1 quantify decadal means variability and frequency in runoff and ssl 2 quantify uncertainty in ssl caused by dams and by scatter in the q ssl relationship and 3 test for changes in runoff and ssl in a rapidly urbanizing section of the us mexico border region 2 study area the tijuana river watershed trw drains a total of 4483 km2 with approximately 27 of the drainage area in the united states and 73 in mexico international boundary and water commission 2005 fig 1 the central and eastern parts of the trw are on the peninsular range batholith and the western part is on marine and fluvial deposits of conglomerate sandstone and siltstone brownlie and taylor 1981 trw has two large dams barrett dam was built in 1922 has a total capacity of 42 9 mcm city of san diego 2021 and receives runoff from the united states portion of the watershed the rodriguez dam was completed in 1936 and has a capacity of 94 0 mcm at the spillway crest international boundary and water commission 1966 the drainage area at barrett dam is 635 km2 14 of the trw city of san diego 2021 and at rodriguez dam is 2251 km2 57 of the trw urs corporation 2012a the remaining lower watershed alower 1138 km2 29 which is the active contributing watershed in all but very wet years straddles the us mexico border and includes the urban areas of tijuana and tecate the active contributing area in the us is mostly undeveloped open space a third dam el carrizo was added in 1978 to impound water imported from the colorado river the watershed draining to the el carrizo dam is very small 2 6 of the watershed and the dam has no overflow urs corporation 2012b so we do not include it in the analysis of runoff and ssl urbanization has expanded rapidly in tijuana due to economic opportunity and consequent immigration acosta 2009 much of the urbanization is unregulated with extensive and chronic soil exposure biggs et al 2010 unpaved roads that generate ephemeral gullies gudino elizondo et al 2018 and extreme channel erosion taniguchi et al 2018 to mitigate the sediment loads sedimentation basins have been constructed both in the united states and mexico excess sedimentation has buried salt marsh vegetation in the tijuana estuary in the united states weis et al 2001 zedler and west 2008 wetland loss has been most severe at the outlets of three small watersheds that drain directly to the southern part of the estuary safran et al 2017 the lower reach of tijuana river was channelized in early 1979 in part in response to previous flooding a total of 4 km of channel was lined with concrete from the border upstream and an additional 2 km lined with rock downstream of the border international boundary and water commission 2021 tijuana started importing water from the colorado river in 1978 urs corporation 2012b increasing to 76 7 mcm y 1 in 2000 and 101 3 mcm y 1 in 2008 cohen et al 2011 3 materials and methods we compiled data on rainfall runoff section 3 1 and ssc section 3 2 for the tijuana river where it enters the tijuana estuary ssc data included both historical data and our own samples we then developed a relationship between storm wise peak runoff qpk and storm wise mean ssc for 2002 2021 section 3 3 storm wise ssl was then estimated for all storms for the water years that had 5 minute runoff data 2001 2020 and aggregated to annual values of ssl the annual ssl values for 2001 2020 were used to develop an annual ssl q relationship which was then used to estimate annual ssl for all years over 1962 2020 including sensitivity analysis of the impact of dams section 3 4 finally we tested for changes in the q p and ssl q relationships between 1970 s and 2000 s and compare with other studies section 3 5 the discharge and ssc data are available in biggs and taniguchi quan 2022 3 1 rainfall and runoff data runoff q in the mainstem tijuana river has been measured by the international boundary and water commission ibwc since 1962 upstream of where the river enters the tijuana estuary fig 1 runoff data at five minute resolution are available from 2000 to 2020 and daily means from 1962 to 2020 international boundary and water commission 2021 monthly rainfall for both the lower and total watershed fig 1 was calculated for 1962 2020 from the era5 land dataset muñoz sabater 2019 muñoz sabater et al 2021 which has 9 km cell size annual rainfall and runoff were aggregated using the oct sept water year data on runoff over the spillway at barrett reservoir were obtained from the city of san diego r morales personal communication and historical observations indicated if spillway overflow occurred at the rodriguez dam urs corporation 2012 for 1970 2009 and r morales personal communication for 2010 2020 3 2 ssc data we compiled historical data on ssc of the tijuana river from a municipal monitoring program 2002 2014 weston solutions 2015 and from the united states geological survey usgs 1970 s we also collected our own water samples in 2019 2021 and analyzed them for suspended sediment concentrations ssc the historical data were reported as either total suspended solids tss 2002 2014 or ssc 1970 s and the new samples 2019 2021 were analyzed for ssc tss and ssc differ in the method of subsampling in the laboratory see s1 0 for details following recommendations of gray et al 2000 we do not attempt to correct the tss values to ssc and assume that the difference between tss and ssc values is small compared to other uncertainties in the calculation of ssl tss values in stormwater were obtained from an existing report weston solutions 2015 composite samples were taken from hollister bridge fig 1 for twenty two storms sampled from january 2002 to march 2014 all samples were volume weighted composites though some samples had more frequent sampling on the rising limb see s2 0 and fig s1 the usgs reported 182 values of ssc from hollister bridge over 1970 1978 station 11013500 united states geological survey 2016 http waterdata usgs gov nwis access date 2021 06 21 fig 1 additional water samples were taken by the authors from the tijuana river in 2019 2021 at dairy mart road bridge dmr fig 1 with a combination of grab samples and an autosampler that took samples once an hour see s3 1 for details of the water sampling ssc methods and ssc data 3 3 storm metrics and ssc traditional sediment rating curves where instantaneous ssl is modeled as a function of instantaneous runoff may result in significant error given intra event hysteresis in ssc warrick et al 2015 management agencies also often only collect composite samples and report storm wise mean ssc complicating the use of instantaneous rating curves storm metrics such as total or peak runoff qpk may provide more accurate predictions of ssc and ssl than instantaneous sediment rating curves duvert et al 2012 in california qpk correlates with sediment yield in individual watersheds but the relationship varies by location warrick et al 2015 we therefore modeled storm wise mean ssc as a power function of qpk duvert et al 2012 1 ssc bcf sscqpk a q pk b where a and b are determined through linear regression on the log transformed values of ssc and qpk and bcfsscqpk is a bias correction factor crawford 1991 that compensates for the underestimation that occurs when using minimum least squares on log transformed variables the regression parameters were calibrated to the data collected from 2002 to 2021 outliers were identified using the tukey fence method and the impact of outliers quantified by comparing regression parameters annual q and annual ssl with and without outliers see s3 2 for details in order to calculate annual ssl for the period with 5 minute runoff data 2001 2020 the ecohydrology package fuka et al 2018 in r r core team 2021 was used to separate streamflow into stormflow and baseflow qpk and total stormflow volume were then calculated for each storm ssc was estimated for each storm using eq 1 and ssl calculated as the product of total volume and ssc see s3 3 for details suspended sediment yield ssy was calculated by dividing ssl by the drainage area of the lower watershed a lower fig 1 since watersheds upstream of dams contributed flows in only a few years 3 4 annual ssl and accounting for dams sub daily runoff data were not available for 1962 2000 so we could not use a storm wise ssc qpk relationship eq 1 to estimate annual ssl sslann for years before 2001 instead we estimated sslann tons for the whole period 1962 2020 from annual q qann mcm 2 ssl ann bcf ann c q ann d where bcfann is the bias correction factor for annual values and c and d are regression parameters all of the available ssc data were collected during periods with no overflow from the two main dams barrett and rodriguez sediment retention behind the dams could cause ssc and ssl to be lower than predicted by eq 2 during wet periods with spillway overflow in order to quantify the impact of different assumptions about dam impacts on ssl estimates we calculated ssl for years with overflow using eq 2 given two different values of q 1 qann tot which includes overflow and assumes that overflow from the dams does not change the ssl q relationship eq 2 and 2 qann lower which excludes overflow and is estimated as 3 q ann lower bcf qp gp ann lower h where bcf qp is the bias correction factor for the q p regression pann lower is annual rainfall in the lower watershed and g and h are regression parameters sslann at the outlet for years with overflow is then calculated from eq 2 with qann lower as the predictor which assumes complete retention of sediment in the reservoirs and no channel erosion downstream of the dams the channel downstream of rodriguez dam is channelized with concrete and has limited opportunity for erosion urs corporation 2012a note that this sensitivity analysis does not determine the impact of dams per se on long term sediment load the ssl q relationship eq 2 already includes the impact of dams because the data to calibrate eq 1 were collected in the post dam period rather we quantify the impact of assumptions about dams on ssl calculations for years with overflow the combined impact of q p and ssl q on annual ssl was determined by creating an ssl p relationship 4 ssl ann bcf sslp mp ann lower n where bcf sslp is the bias correction factor and m and n are regression parameters this regression assumes that dams retain all sediment that enters the corresponding reservoir errors in ssl estimates can be quantified using standard statistical techniques which may be less applicable if the data are non normal or if multiple types of uncertainty are present alternatively bootstrapping and monte carlo methods rustomji and wilkinson 2008 can be used to estimate uncertainty we used bootstrapping with replacement to generate 1000 ssc qpk data sets and therefore 1000 estimates of the parameters of the ssc qpk relationship eq 1 these parameters were used to estimate ensembles of 1000 values each of 1 sslann for 2001 2020 2 parameters of eq 2 and 3 values of sslann for each year from 1962 to 2020 3 5 change over time and comparisons with other studies we tested for changes in the annual q p relationship before and after the start of imported water 1978 and channelization 1979 both of which occurred within several months of each other so we were unable to separate their effects we instead refer to pre and post 1978 periods where the pre 1978 period includes the 1962 1978 water years the statistical significance of changes in the coefficients of the power functions eqs 2 4 were tested using linear regression on the log transformed variables including pre or post 1978 as an indicator variable 0 or 1 and an interaction term between the continuous variables p or q and the indicator changes in the annual q p relationship during the post 1978 period 1979 2019 were determined using multiple regression with p and year as independent variables sslann 2001 2019 and instantaneous ssc 2019 2021 were compared with historical data from 1970 to 1978 and with the annual and instantaneous sediment rating curves of brownlie and taylor 1981 hereafter bt81 which were based on data from 1973 to 1975 the combined impact of changes in the q p and ssl q relationships were quantified by creating ssl p relationships in the pre and post 1978 periods q and ssl were calculated for a pre 1978 scenario by applying the q p eq 3 and ssl p eq 4 relationships from the pre 1978 period to the p time series in the post 1978 period 1980 2019 other studies on the tijuana river used methods similar to ours to quantify long term ssl bt81 calculated ssl for 1937 1975 using an instantaneous sediment rating curve ssc q developed from 43 samples taken at hollister bridge by the usgs from 1973 to 1975 bt81 then estimated sslann from a log linear regression of sslann against qann equivalent to eq 2 but with no bias correction factor the highest runoff with ssc data in the analysis of bt81 was very low 3 23 m3 s 1 compared with both our largest sampled runoff 128 4 m3 s 1 and with the peak runoff of all storms from 2001 to 2020 bt81 therefore extrapolated well beyond the observed range of runoff in part due to low runoff in the pre 1978 conditions increasing uncertainty about ssl during high runoff and wet years in the 1970 s inman and jenkins 1999 hereafter ij99 updated the period of record of ssl estimates to 1995 using the same annual sediment rating curve as bt81 and streamflow data to 1995 ij99 did not add any more ssc values or recalculate annual rating curves in order to compare our ssl values with ij99 we calculated ssl for the same wet period as ij99 1969 1995 using our annual ssl q relationship eq 2 we also compare our ssl estimates with values from urs corporation 2012a who also estimated annual sediment load of the tijuana river under undisturbed conditions using annual runoff and an empirical equation calibrated to sedimentation rates for reservoirs across the conterminous united states 4 results 4 1 ssc results 2019 2021 seven storms were sampled at dairy mart road in 2019 2021 and sixty two samples were analyzed for ssc table s1 data from one storm were omitted see s4 0 for details including ssc data and sampled hydrographs figs s2 s8 and tables s2 s8 the maximum runoff with a water sample during the 2019 2021 period 128 4 m3 s 1 was close to the largest qpk of storms sampled over 2002 2014 133 6 m3 s 1 instantaneous ssc values over 2019 2021 ranged from 95 mg l 1 during pre storm conditions to 5480 mg l 1 at the largest sampled runoff 4 2 storm wise sediment rating curves storm wise mean ssc increased linearly with event peak runoff qpk in log log space years 2001 2014 and 2019 2021 fig 2 the tukey 1977 method identified three outliers the ssc qpk regression excluding outliers r2 0 61 was used to estimate ssc for storms with no ssc observations over the 2001 2019 period see s5 0 table s9 for details storm wise mean ssc of the storms sampled from 2019 to 2021 fell in the range of the values from 2002 to 2014 with one high mean ssc value at low qpk 4 m3 s 1 fig 2 there was no indication of differences in ssc by sampling location see s4 0 for details 4 3 stormflow separation the stormflow separation algorithm identified 498 storm events over 2001 2020 when using a flow threshold of 1 m3 s 1 a filter parameter f of 0 99 and storm separation duration sephr of 12 h annual q and ssl were relatively insensitive to the separation parameters see s6 0 table s10 figs s9 s18 qpk ranged from 1 to 532 m3 s 1 many of the storms were small 10 m3 s 1 fig s19 and most qpk values were smaller than the maximum qpk in the observed ssc dataset though 15 storms had qpk greater than twice the qpk of the largest storm sampled for ssc baseflow was high in 2020 due in part to continual sewage releases see s6 0 where the qpk ssc relationship may not hold so we excluded the 2020 water year from further analyses 4 4 storm wise and annual suspended sediment load 2001 2019 sslann averaged 0 131 0 037 mt y 1 ssy 112 9 tons km 2 yr 1 over 2001 2019 ranging from 1200 300 tons in 2002 to 587 000 182 000 tons in 2017 table s11 the twenty largest storms delivered 73 of the total ssl over the 2001 2019 period the 10 largest storms delivered 53 and the single largest storm 9 5 table s12 demonstrating the importance of large events in the long term sediment load however storms smaller than the 2 year storm accounted for 47 of the total sediment load so while a few large storms were important more numerous smaller storms also accounted for around half of the cumulative ssl sslann tons correlated with qann mcm over 2001 2019 fig 3 bootstrap regressions provided 1000 estimates of c and d fig 3 the c and d parameters are inversely related so could not be sampled independently for sensitivity analysis instead c and d pairs were selected for bootstrapping the mean and standard deviation of the regression parameters eq 2 from the bootstrapping were bcfann 1 1 0 03 c 260 5 76 9 and d 1 67 0 12 4 5 annual q and q p relationships 1962 2019 the runoff time series has three periods table 1 fig 4 very low runoff 1962 1978 high runoff with several years of dam overflow 1979 1999 and moderate flow with no dam overflow 2000 2019 qann in the 3 wettest years was 5 5 4 5 and 4 4 times higher than the largest annual flow observed from 2001 to 2019 us army corps of engineers 2018 one or both of the two dams overflowed in 8 years 14 of all years between 1962 and 2019 fig 4 barrett overflowed more frequently and for lower runoff values than did rodriguez barrett had zero overflow from 2006 to 2019 r morales personal communication so we assume that rodriguez also did not overflow in any year after 2010 annual q correlated linearly with annual p in log log space fig 5 four years with overflow 1980 1983 1993 1995 had significantly more runoff than predicted using eq 3 fig 5 suggesting either that the upper watershed produced large volumes of runoff in those years or that there were non linearities in the q p relationship in the lower watershed that are not captured by the log linear function eq 3 changes in the q p relationship are discussed in section 4 7 1 4 6 annual ssl 1962 2019 frequency analysis and assumptions about dams applying the bootstrapped parameters of eq 2 to the qann time series from 1962 to 2019 generated 1000 values of sslann for each year from which we calculated a mean and standard deviation for each year fig 6 the long term mean sslann was 0 128 0 165 mt yr 1 with a range of 0 0012 0 574 mt yr 1 the coefficient of variation cv standard deviation mean of the bootstrapped values of sslann was highest 30 for years with high rainfall nearly half 46 of the cumulative sslann over 1962 2019 occurred during very wet years recurrence interval tr 10 years the wettest years tr 20 years contributed 28 fig 7 when using qann lower to predict sslann slightly more than half of the long term ssl was contributed by years with a return interval of less than 10 years a small fraction of ssl 5 was contributed by annual runoff with a tr of 2 years or less calculations of sslann for years with dam overflow were highly sensitive to the q values used in eq 2 and the corresponding assumptions about dam impacts on ssl table 1 using qann total to predict sslann which assumes that dams do not impact the ssl q relationship results in a much larger 7 1x total ssl 0 920 mt y 1 over 1962 2019 compared with using qann lower 0 128 mt y 1 which assumes complete retention by dams using qann total also results in a larger contribution 90 of the wettest years tr 10 years to cumulative sslann compared with using qann lower 46 from the wettest years fig 7 the ratio of ssl estimated by using qann total to ssl estimated using qann lower ranged from 6 8 to 33 9 for the four wettest years table 1 the lower estimate where ssl for years with overflow is calculated using qann lower is likely more reliable since dams typically retain a large percentage of the sediment load into them 85 for reservoirs in california willis and griggs 2003 our purpose here is to quantify the range of possible ssl values and to demonstrate how not taking dams into account can bias ssl calculations in years with overflow 4 7 change over time 4 7 1 changes in annual q p relationships and q annual runoff qann increased for a given annual rainfall after 1978 coinciding with the start of imported water and channelization with the largest percentage increases at low annual rainfall fig 5 the parameters of the q p relationship in the pre 1978 condition 1962 1978 were bcf 1 24 g 5 1 10 9 and h 3 305 r2 0 62 in the post 1978 condition the parameters were bcf 1 10 g 4 7 10 4 h 1 832 r2 0 67 the intercepts and slopes of the q p relationship were statistically different p 0 01 pre and post 1978 using the pre 1978 q p parameters to predict q in the post 1978 period years with no overflow only gives mean annual runoff of 1 8 mcm compared with 26 5 mcm observed an approximate 15 fold increase the mechanisms that could account for this increase are discussed in section 5 2 4 7 2 changes in ssl q relationships annual ssl was higher for a given annual runoff in the 1970 s bt81 compared to the 2000 s except for the wettest years fig 3 additional ssc data from the usgs 1976 1978 not included in bt81 or ij99 fig 8 fig s21 suggests that ssl and ssc were consistently higher in the 1970 s than in 2019 2021 at low runoff 0 1 1 m3 s 1 but were highly variable for runoff greater than 1 m3 s 1 daily ssl in april may and june amj 1978 for example was significantly lower than daily ssl in 2019 2021 but ssl in amj was not different from other months for all other years in the 1970 1977 period fig 8 seasonality could account for the low ssc at high flows in 1978 amj since amj is at the end of the wet season but the available data do not allow for robust conclusions all samples from the 1970 s were collected prior to channelization and imported water which could have either increased or decreased ssc for a given runoff depending on the role of the channel and wastewater in providing sediment at low flows additional sampling may help quantify seasonal differences in the ssc q relationship and allow for a more robust comparison with historical data though the lack of historical ssc data at high runoff complicates quantification of changes over time 4 7 3 changes in ssl p relationships and annual ssl post 1978 ssl was several times higher than pre 1978 ssl for a given pann lower fig 9 this suggests that higher ssc in the 1970 s was more than balanced by higher runoff production in the post 1978 period resulting in higher ssl for a given annual p in the post 1978 period with decreasing differences in wetter years the slopes and intercepts of the ssl p relationship were statistically significantly different pre and post 1978 p 0 05 if the low ssc and ssl values observed in april and may of 1978 fig 8 are more representative than the higher values in 1970 1977 then the pre 1978 ssl would be even lower than our estimate sslann during the post 1978 period no overflow years only calculated assuming pre 1978 parameter values eq 4 was 7831 tons y 1 while the mean for the same time period using the post 1978 parameter values was 94 888 tons y 1 combined the increase in runoff 15 fold more than compensated for any potential decrease in ssc resulting in a 12 fold increase in ssl from pre to post 1978 conditions the impact of uncertainties in the historical and recent data and the plausibility of this magnitude of change will be discussed in section 5 2 4 8 comparison with other studies on the tijuana river our upper bound estimate of ssl during the wet period of ij99 1969 1995 using qann total to predict ssl 1 85 mtons yr 1 was 5 3 times higher than the ij99 estimate while our lower bound estimate using qann lower 0 148 mtons yr 1 was 58 lower than the ij99 estimate table 2 our higher sslann estimate when using qann total is due to our annual ssl q relationship fig 5 which has higher ssl at high runoff qann 60 mcm than the relationship used by ij99 our ssl estimate using qann lower is lower than ij99 due to our assumption of reservoir retention of sediment during years of overflow which dominate the long term average due to the likelihood of high rates of sediment retention in the reservoirs and our additional ssc observations at high runoff we believe that our revised estimate of 0 148 mtons yr 1 over 1969 1995 is the most reliable and that ij99 may overestimate ssl not controlling for the time period our estimated mean annual ssy over 1962 2019 is 38 lower than ij99 years 1944 1995 and 15 lower than the warrick and farnsworth 2009 estimates for the tijuana river table 2 5 discussion 5 1 dam impacts on ssl calculations assumptions about dams and their impact on the q ssl relationship had a large impact on ssl estimates both for the years with overflow and for the long term mean use of runoff from the lower watershed only qann lower to estimate suspended sediment loads sslann which assumes complete retention of sediment behind dams results in significantly lower ssl values compared with the use of qann total table 1 and compared to previous estimates ij99 it also reduces the importance of the wettest years which have much higher runoff fig 4 but not significantly higher ssl fig 6 due to retention of sediment behind the dams this conclusion depends on accurate estimation of qann lower non linearities in the q p response could result in inaccurate estimates of qann lower especially for years with high rainfall future research could use more detailed q p modeling of the lower watershed our documentation of dam impacts on ssl estimates is important for estimates of ssl in other river basins with dams samples of ssc are often collected for relatively small frequent storms when dam overflow may be unlikely extrapolation of the ssl q relationship for years with overflow would then overestimate ssl a systematic review of existing ssl estimates e g ij99 and sensitivity analysis using the method proposed here would help determine the magnitude of this potential overestimation 5 2 change over time 5 2 1 annual runoff mean annual runoff increased by 24 7 mcm 15x after 1978 controlling for precipitation variability the increase in q could be due to channelization of the tijuana river in 1979 and to the start of importing of water from the colorado river 1978 channelization reduces channel infiltration and could have reduced groundwater flow down the valley and reduced evapotranspiration from riparian vegetation limited data are available to determine the extent of the pre 1978 riparian vegetation but riparian evapotranspiration et can be approximated to a first order assuming riparian vegetation width ranging from 100 m to 500 m along the 4 km of channelized river and 1260 mm per year of et equal to potential et of the coastal region hart et al 2009 gives annual et of the pre channel riparian zone of 2 5 3 8 mcm which is much smaller than the change in annual runoff 24 7 mcm infiltration in the channel and floodplain with resulting down valley groundwater flow may have further reduced surface flow before channelization but estimation of this flow is beyond the scope of this paper the volume of water imported from the colorado river was 101 3 mcm by 2008 cohen et al 2011 which is larger than the observed increase in runoff wastewater from tijuana discharged directly to the river until 1997 when the international water treatment plant was finalized further research is needed including on how wastewater effluent dams channelization and urbanization affect the q p relationship baseflow stormflow and annual q 5 2 2 sediment rating curves and ssl annual fig 5 and instantaneous sediment rating curves q vs ssl or ssc fig 8 fig s20 suggest that ssl for a given runoff was lower in 2001 2019 than in the 1970 s for low annual runoff but similar for higher runoff there is considerable uncertainty in ssc for high flows as most of the 1970 s samples were collected at low flow 3 28 m3 s 1 instantaneous ssl was approximately 10x higher in 1970 s compared with 2019 2021 for low runoff fig 8 except for april june 1978 which had lower annual ssl for a given annual q higher runoff post 1978 resulted in higher ssl despite the lower ssl for a given discharge our analysis suggests that ssl was 12x higher in the post 1978 condition than it would have been under pre 1978 conditions assuming the sediment rating curves were stable for the full range of runoff observed however ssl in the post dam period was still 60 lower than ssl estimated for pre dam conditions by inman and masters 1991 suggesting that ssl increased post 1978 compared with 1962 1978 conditions but likely not to pre dam levels table 2 5 3 land use and channelization impacts on ssl sediment management in tijuana especially the installation of sedimentation basins may have reduced the sediment load under conditions of low runoff large human impacts on small runoff events with limited impacts on large events is also seen in floods where land use has the biggest impact for return periods of 5 years white and greer 2006 in addition impervious cover is high 50 80 in the urban core of tijuana biggs et al 2010 and many stream channels have been lined with concrete both of which could reduce ssl below the pre urban background wolman 1967 more work is needed to calculate the historical and contemporary rating curves and ssl of the tijuana river and how they are impacted by seasonality management and land cover change 5 4 comparisons with other watersheds in southern california ssl for watersheds in the peninsular ranges of southern california averaged 100 tons km 2 yr 1 and ranged from 10 to 350 tons km 2 yr 1 ij99 tijuana river ssl from our study table 2 is within the range of other watersheds in the peninsular range suggesting that while urbanization may have increased ssl above the pre urban baseline urbanization does not appear to have increased the ssl of the tijuana river beyond the range observed in other watersheds in southern california however channelization and imported water coincided with a large increase in runoff for a given annual rainfall fig 4 and year was a significant predictor of annual runoff after controlling for annual rainfall combined this resulted in a 12 fold increase in ssl compared with pre 1978 conditions however dam construction has likely reduced sediment load by 50 75 from pre dam conditions table 2 ij99 inman and masters 1991 significant uncertainty remains about the combined impacts of dam construction imported water urbanization and channelization on runoff and sediment loads in contrast with the tijuana river and other peninsular ranges ssy in the los laureles canyon watershed llcw 11 6 km2 which drains directly into the tijuana estuary was extremely high 5000 tons km 2 y 1 biggs et al 2018 and roughly 42 times the ssy of the tijuana river the trap data used for the llcw includes bedload but the trapped sediment was only approximately 10 15 by weight cobbles or larger 64 mm diameter and most of the sediment in the trap is fine to very fine sand taniguchi quan unpublished data the undammed side canyons draining to the tijuana estuary have much higher sediment yields than the mainstem of the tijuana river with consequent high sedimentation rates and impacts on the southern part of the estuary 5 5 implications for sediment accumulation and management our results suggest a paradox runoff and annual suspended sediment load from the tijuana river has likely increased during urbanization but loads in the post dam period 1936 present are likely still lower than the pre dam load table 2 and yet the tijuana estuary has lost most of its tidal prism due to high rates of sediment accumulation safran et al 2017 the tijuana river also does not have significantly higher loads than other streams on similar lithology the paradox could be explained in part by the reduction in stormflow and consequent reduced transport capacity of the river following dam construction bt81 estimate that annual flow in the tijuana river decreased from 8 6 mcm in pre dam conditions to 1 6 mcm in the post dam but pre channelization period 1951 1975 a reduction of 81 table c11 3 in bt81 annual and peak runoff increased following channelization and urbanization in the post dam period fig 5 though it is unclear whether flows reached their pre dam levels significant uncertainty remains about the magnitudes of pre dam runoff and ssl and the runoff necessary to transport sediment through the estuary to the coast 6 conclusion 6 1 main findings flood events larger than the 2 year recurrence interval n 10 accounted for more than half of total suspended sediment load ssl of the tijuana river over 2001 2019 but frequent floods smaller than the 2 year event also accounted for nearly half of ssl over the longer time period 1962 2019 the 10 wettest years accounted for 48 of ssl while the driest 50 of years accounted for less than 5 extreme events may have less impact on decadal cumulative ssl than previously documented ij99 due to the impact of sediment retention by dams on ssl estimates during years with dam overflow overall large events and wet years are important for the long term load but more frequently occurring years and events are also important ssl in the tijuana river likely decreased from 1970 s to 2019 2021 for small storms due to higher suspended sediment concentrations in the 1970 s but annual runoff increased markedly resulting in a net increase in annual ssl the ssl from the tijuana river is still likely around half of the load prior to construction of dams upstream ij99 inman and masters 1991 and delivery of sediment to the coast is likely further reduced by a reduction in flow and transport capacity willis and griggs 2003 reduced flow in the post dam period likely contributes to accumulation of sediment in the tijuana estuary and to low sediment loads to the ocean and consequent beach erosion 6 2 limitations and future work sediment load estimates are uncertain especially during the wet years tr 10 y that account for approximately half of the total ssl our calculations of ssl and the impact of dams depend on accurate estimation of runoff from the lower watershed and stability of the annual ssl q relationship the abrupt increase in runoff post 1978 coincides with channelization and the start of imported water but changes in measured runoff could also be caused in part by changes in the methods equipment or rating curves associated with channelization q p and ssl q relationships may change markedly during extreme events but the current dataset and most similar datasets do not have ssc data for those events future work could model annual runoff and sediment loads for upper and lower watersheds in the few extreme wet years including the trapping efficiencies of the two main reservoirs sediment loads may have increased post channelization and post urbanization due to increased runoff but significant uncertainty in the historical 1960 70 s relationship between runoff and ssl precludes precise estimates our analysis quantifies changes in runoff and sediment loading over time but does not identify the mechanism responsible for the changes channelization urban wastewater impervious surface soil exposure and channel erosion could all contribute to changes in runoff and or sediment loads future work could model runoff and sediment loads and analyze intra annual changes in flow duration curves to identify mechanisms responsible for the observed changes both drought and flood frequency are projected to increase in the region ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 modrick and georgakakos 2015 ssl is a non linear function of rainfall so increases in both wet and dry years could cause a net increase in ssl to the estuary even if long term mean rainfall does not change the interacting effects of climate variability channelization urbanization imported water runoff sediment loads estuarine sedimentation rates and ecosystem impacts require further quantification 6 3 implications and broader impacts our methods and findings have implications for calculations of sediment loads in other locations first event wise modeling of sediment loads can leverage municipal monitoring datasets which may be event wise composites and not instantaneous values used in traditional rating curve construction second the relationships between annual rainfall runoff and sediment loads can be highly impacted by dams upstream especially during extreme wet years when dams overflow but this is often difficult to quantify due to limited data availability for extreme events sediment retention behind dams can reduce sediment concentrations downstream but such effects may not be included in sediment rating curves fit to ssc measurements taken at low runoff without dam overflow uncertainty analysis as performed here can help quantity possible dam impacts on calculations of long term sediment loads third we quantify uncertainty in the sediment runoff relationships using bootstrapping and provide an updated estimation of long term sediment loads and trends which can be used to inform future sediment management and restoration efforts revised sediment runoff relationships can also be used to calibrate watershed models to evaluate the effects of sea level rise climate change and land use changes on future sediment loads and resilience of coastal wetlands funding this work was supported by

watersheds simulated by soil water assessment tool swat under the representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 emission scenario using six climate models including canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 by comparing the last thirty years of the past century 1971 2000 and the same years of this century 2071 2100 bias correction for maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall data obtained from all climate models have been done using cmhyd software the swat model is calibrated and validated using eleven sensitive hydrological parameters new hydrological insights the result revealed that the change in maximum temperature ranges from 2 93 c november and 5 17 c march and the change in minimum temperature also ranges from 3 08 c to 4 79 c on a monthly basis rainfall is expected to increase up to 29 75 november and decrease up to 9 26 march in different seasons due to the change in climate a flow is predicted to increase up to 27 82 27 47 26 47 and 24 97 in ribb gilgel abay gumara and megech watersheds respectively and it is also decreasing in winter and spring seasons on average the streamflow is expected to increase by 5 89 5 63 4 92 and 4 87 in ribb gumara megech and gilgel abay watersheds respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change stream flow swat lake tana sub basin upper blue nile basin 1 introduction climate change is arguably the most important environmental challenge facing the world in the 21st century owing to its wide reaching impacts on human society fulco et al 2007 although climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon us epa 2016 there is now a common consensus among the scientific community that anthropogenic activities are largely responsible for its occurrence mainly through burning fossil fuels like oil coal and gas leading to emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs to the atmosphere henderson and reinert 2016 until the 1800 s the emission of these ghgs was relatively stable but has since continuously increased due to industrialization population growth and the subsequent increase in energy consumption deforestation and human settlements north 2014 during the past 15 20 years the growth rate in heat trapping ghgs emissions increased from 1 5 to 2 ppm per year hayhoe et al 2017 consequently the global mean surface temperature for the decade 2006 2015 increased by 0 87 c which is higher than the observed long term average in the pre industrial period 1850 1900 ipcc 2018 due to the future anthropogenic activities and the emission of ghgs being uncertain it is strongly believed that future global temperatures will keep changing the representative concentration pathways rcps which are used for making projections based on these anthropogenic factors describe four different pathways of ghg emissions and atmospheric concentrations air pollutant emissions and land use in terms of a stringent mitigation scenario rcp2 6 two intermediate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and one scenario with very high ghg emissions rcp8 5 that assumes radiative forcing concentration will reach 8 5 w m2 in the atmosphere and temperature increases up to 2 6 4 8 cin the end of 21 st century ipcc 2014 over the past few decades a plethora of climate models has been used to estimate the future climate of the earth under different scenarios the annual values projected for precipitation by such models are inherently uncertain and often inconsistent because each model is slightly different tebaldi et al 2011 power et al 2012 fao 2010 schaller et al 2011 however the trend and magnitude of change in precipitation are fairly consistent among the models most of which revealed an increasing trend in heavy rainfall extremes towards the end of the 21st century almost in all parts of the world poveda and martínez 2011 suppiah et al 2013 further projections show that the precipitation is very likely to increase in high latitudes and near major convergence zones in the tropics in some seasons while decreases are expected in many subtropical regions stocker et al 2013 such changes in the intensity and distribution of precipitation will have serious implications on water seager et al 2007 sivakumar 2011 stoll et al 2011 a key resource for economic growth and social development currently approximately one third of the world s population lives in water stress countries and by 2025 two thirds of the world s population will experience water scarcity problems due to the reduction of river flow and groundwater recharge fao 2010 due to climate change more frequent severe droughts and flood events are expected to intensify in different regions us epa 2016 in ethiopia over the past five decades changes in rainfall and temperature have affected the various components of the hydrological cycle in major river basins gebremicael et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 in the country the hydrological drought during dry seasons and flooding in rainy seasons have become a common problem in many perennial rivers as noted by bekele et al 2021 mengistu et al 2021 roth et al 2018 numerous studies indicate that the hydrology of headwater catchments of the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia has been influenced by climate change kim and kaluarachchi 2009 malede et al 2022 worqlul et al 2018 whereas there are many climate change studies conducted in the lake tana basin very few studies used the rcp scenarios for instance the study conducted by chakilu et al 2020 tigabu et al 2021 used the rcp 8 5 scenario but the studies were conducted only on one or two catchments within the basin which limits our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change in the entire basin besides most of the previous studies conducted in the basin focused on projecting future climate under special report on emissions scenarios sres for example setegn et al 2011 used the a2 scenario while adem et al 2014 used a2 and b2 emission scenarios with a single climate model this study focused on how much the highest emission scenario rcp8 5 suggested by the fifth ipcc assessment report ar5 ipcc 2014 influences the stream flow nature of the four gauged watersheds of lake tana basin which contributes more than 60 of the total flow of the nile river mulat and moges 2014 by using six global climate models gcm in 2071 2100 with relative to 1971 2000 due to the inadequate number of meteorological stations in the basin and considering that most of the existing stations do not have long term historical recorded data for regional downscaling global climate models gcm were directly used through correcting the biases using cmhyd software the finding of this study gives important indications on the extent to which this highly demanded water resources for both upper and lower catchment communities will be affected by climate change and it also gives essential output for policymakers concerned about the reduction of climate change vulnerability of water resources in the planning process of different micro and macro projects including the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description lake tana basin is located in the north western highlands and stretches between 10 95 and 12 78 n latitudes and 36 89 and 38 25 e longitudes with a drainage area of about 15 096 km2 of which 3063 km2 of land is covered with lake tana fig 1 lake tana is the largest lake in ethiopia covering a surface area of 3000 3600 km2 at an elevation of 1800 m above sea level and a maximum depth of 15 m the climate of the lake tana sub basin is dominated by tropical highland monsoon with most of its rainfall occurring between june and september more than 93 of the flow of the lake is collected from four major rivers which are gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech setegn 2010 gilgel abay is the largest watershed in the lake tana sub basin which covers 1754 km2 followed by ribb gumara and megech watersheds which cover 1407 km2 1272 km2 and 514 km2 respectively according to conway and schipper 2011 most of the rainfall 70 90 total rainfall in the region occurs from june to september and the mean annual precipitation of the study area ranges from 1200 to 1600 mm based on data from 1961 to 2000 the temperature of the basin varies between 9 c and 28 c based on the fao soil classification map of the world fao and unesco 1977 chromic luvisols eutric cambisols eutric fluvisols eutric leptosols eutric regosols eutric vertisols haplic alisols haplic luvisols haplic nitisols and lithic leptosols are the major soil types in the basin the majority of the land area 51 3 of the lake tana basin is used for agriculture 29 is an agro pastoral area and 20 of the basin is covered by the lake water setegn et al 2008 2 2 climate and hydrological data collection and processing meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia some of the data which span 30 years 1971 2000 were used for bias correction of climate model outputs twelve meteorological stations were used in and near the study area although there are more numbers of meteorological stations in the study area many of them do not have adequate data and are full of missing values even in recorded data the missing values were replaced by the long term average recorded values of the corresponding dates of the preceding years and the years after the missed one to compare and evaluate the deviation of the data produced from climate models during the swat model calibration and validation process the missing data were replaced by 99 which is compatible with the swat model table 1 climate model data were obtained from the earth system grid federation esgf website https esgf node llnl gov projects esgf llnl which is hosted by the united states of america department of energy lawrence livermore national laboratory given that most of the meteorological stations in the lake tana basin do not have long term historical recorded data for regional downscaling global climate models gcm were directly used through bias correction using cmhyd software precipitation and temperature data are projected by six global climate models including canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 in coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 the data are produced under the experiment of the representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 emission scenario flow data of the four watersheds gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech were collected from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia for calibration and validation of the swat model like meteorological data flow data were also collected on a daily time scale with missing values replaced by 99 2 3 geophysical data collection and processing besides climatic data geophysical data such as land use cover soil and altitude dem were required to run the hydrological model swat the land use cover data were obtained from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia soil data of the study area were also obtained from the digital soil map of the world website https data apps fao org map catalog srv eng catalog search metadata 446ed430 8383 11db b9b2 000d939bc5d8 which is digitized by fao unesco soil map of the world with 1 5000000 scale srtm digital elevation model dem data with 30 m 30 m resolution was collected from the united state geological survey usgs website https earthexplorer usgs gov the altitude data was used for watershed delineation and slope classification in hydrological response unit hru definition and analysis process 2 4 bias correction of climate models data climate data are obtained from global scale climate models climate variables such as rainfall and temperature obtained from such coarse resolution climate models are highly influenced by local topographies like mountains which may not probably be taken into consideration in the global climate models development process because of their coarse resolution thus to minimize the deviation of climate models output from the real observed data of meteorological stations the bias correction process was needed and it was done using variance scaling and power transformation methods for temperature and precipitation respectively using cmhyd software rathjens et al 2016 the reason why these two methods were selected for this study was that both are more efficient than other methods in frequency based statistics in other studies fang et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 precipitation data obtained from all climate models were corrected by fitting them to the thirty years 1971 2000 data and measured for their coefficient of variation cv in the power transformation process in this nonlinear correction each daily precipitation amount p is transformed into a corrected p by using eq 1 as follows 1 p ap b the coefficient a and the superscript b were determined iteratively the mean value of b was determined by equating the cv of the observed value of precipitation with that simulated value on a monthly basis and the coefficient a was determined by equating the mean value of observed precipitation with that simulated value for the comparison period bias correction for temperature only involved scaling and shifting to adjust the mean and variance of simulated and observed climate data terink et al 2010 ho et al 2012 by fitting it to thirty years period 1971 2000 data and the standard year s deviation sd thus the corrected daily temperature tcorr was obtained by using the following eq 2 2 t corr t obs σ t obs σ t gcm t gcm t gcm where tcorr is the corrected daily temperature tgcm is the uncorrected daily temperature obtained from the climate model tobs is the observed daily temperature an overbar denotes the mean value of the variable and σ is the standard deviation 2 5 swat model setup and simulation soil water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed small watershed or large river basin scale hydrological model which simulates the quality quantity of surface and groundwater it also simulates sediment transport on a particular watershed while predicting the environmental impacts of land use land management practices and climate change it is widely used in the assessment of soil and water conservation and non point pollution control in river basins neitsch et al 2002 the model requires daily climate data and geophysical data to simulate surface runoff groundwater flow and evapotranspiration of watersheds the model starts from the watershed characterization process and basically it passes six important steps 1 watershed delineation 2 hydrological response unit hru definition and analysis 3 climate and weather data formation 4 simulation 5 model calibration and 6 model validation srtm dem data of the entire lake tana basin was used for river networking and watershed delineation through the burn in method in the process four outlets were selected for the study area and each watershed was delineated with a combination of sub watersheds sub watersheds were further classified into hydrological response units hrus using land use soil and slope distribution process all land use soil and slope classes in each sub basin were considered in the hru definition process surface runoff is estimated separately for each sub basin and routed to quantify the total surface runoff of the basin using the following equation eq 3 neitsch et al 2002 3 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w sweep q gw i where swt is the final soil water content mm swo is the initial soil water content on the day i mm t is time days rday is the amount of precipitation on the day i mm qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on the day i mm ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on the day i mm wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on the day i and qgw is the amount of groundwater flow on the day i mm the amount of surface runoff is calculated using the following formula eq 4 4 q surf r day i a 2 r day i a s where qsurf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess mm rday is the height of rainfall for the day mm ia is the initial abstractions canopy interception surface storage infiltration before runoff mm and s is the retention parameter therefore retention parameter s is defined as eq 5 5 s 25 4

only occur when rday ia 2 6 swat model calibration and validation once the flow was simulated with default parameters sensitive parameters were selected using the sensitivity analysis process for the four watersheds ten and seven years of climate data were used for calibration and validation respectively these years were selected based on the availability of data based on the sensitivity analysis result eleven parameters that have a prominent influence on the streamflow of watersheds were selected table 2 and the value of each parameter in the four watersheds was determined by the calibration process the calibration process was done by using swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs version 12 software and the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm the fitted value of parameters was observed by iterating 2000 simulations through automatically adjusting the values based on the range of adjustment domain the output produced by using selected parameters and their adjusted values were compared with the observed streamflow of the watersheds so that the efficiency of the swat model was evaluated the efficiency of the model was evaluated using statistical variables that determine the fitness of simulated flow with the measured flow data of watersheds those statistical variables are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative volume error rve shown in eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q sim i q obs 2 where qobs and qsim represent the observed and simulated daily stream flows at the ith time steps respectively n refers to the number of days in the simulated or observed time series period the overbar symbol represents the mean value which indicates the average value of streamflow the value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranges between 1 and 1 shows the best fit of the model or that the model simulates similar values of streamflow with the observed values a value between 0 and 1 is considered an acceptable level of performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 8 rve i 1 n q obs i q sim i i 1 n q obs i 100 rve indicates the ratios of the sum of differences in the observed and simulated value of streamflow to the total observed streamflow the optimal value of rve is 0 a positive value indicates underestimation and a negative value indicates overestimation gupta et al 1999 3 result and discussion 3 1 the efficiency of climate models in this study six climate models were used to predict future climate in the study area the efficiency of each model was evaluated by comparing their historical data with station observed data the error in rainfall and temperature are analyzed on monthly basis the model error of rainfall ranges from an absolute value of 0 05 1 94 the maximum variation is observed in august by the noresm1 m climate model and the minimum is observed in january by the csiro mk3 6 0 climate model almost all climate models reasonably capture the station measured rainfall especially in the winter season december march fig 2 indeed the change is more prominent in the summer season because rain is not common in the winter seasons in the study area in general the rainfall data produced by climate models are consistent with the measured data on the stations all climate models except cnrm cm5 overestimated the maximum temperature in six consecutive months from december to may the error ranges from the absolute value of 0 01 c which is predicted in september csiro mk3 6 0 and january by hadgem2 es to 0 5 c predicted in march by the cnrm cm5 climate model the overall deviation of the model in maximum temperature is 0 19 c 0 03 c 0 25 c 0 14 c 0 12 c and 0 16 c in canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 climate models respectively fig 3 all climate models are relatively more efficient in minimum temperature than the maximum temperature in capturing the measured data the errors of models range from 0 01 c to 0 35 c and the maximum error was recorded in october by the cnrm cm5 climate model unlike maximum temperature some climate models underestimate the minimum temperature on monthly basis generally on average errors by canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 are 0 03 c 0 04 c 0 07 c 0 09 c 0 02 c and 0 05 c respectively fig 4 3 2 change in rainfall in the last thirty years of this century rainfall is predicted to increase in the summer and autumn seasons in all climate models except the cnrm cm5 model which predicted an increase in rainfall in september and noresmi m in october seasonally the change in rainfall ranges from the absolute value of 0 83 29 75 fig 5 the maximum change is forecasted by the cnrm cm5 climate model in november most of the climate models predicted that rainfall will decrease in the spring pre summer season the maximum decreasing change is observed in march which is 9 26 by the canesm2 climate model as far as the region has been getting rainfall in the summer season conway and schipper 2011 it is obvious that the change is not that much expected to be high in the winter season and this study showed the same result on an annual average basis the change is relatively lower than the change in the monthly time step annually the change ranged from 2 45 to 7 17 in which the maximum change was predicted by csiro mk3 6 0 in general the annual mean rainfall is expected to change by 6 85 2 45 4 89 2 46 2 57 and 7 17 under canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m csiro mk3 6 0 climate models respectively within one hundred years fig 8 3 3 change in temperature swat model requires daily maximum and minimum air temperature which may be read from records of observed data or may be generated neitsch et al 2002 seasonally the maximum temperature is expected to increase with a range of 2 93 c and 5 17 c under all climate models based on the rcp 8 5 climate change scenario in the last thirty years of the 21st century the lowest change in maximum temperature was forecasted by the cnrm cm5 climate model in november whereas the highest change is forecasted by csiro mk3 6 0 in march fig 6 the change is higher in the winter than the summer season in almost all climate models on an average basis the highest change was observed in march which is 4 61 c and the lowest is 3 48 c in november fig 6 temperature is one of the most important parameters for estimating the evapotranspiration which can potentially reduce the water availability in the catchments in the swat model neitsch et al 2002 because the area is dry in the winter season and potential evapotranspiration which is used for water balance computation in this study is considering that the availability of moisture in the soil is sufficient enough allen et al 1998 this highest change in maximum temperature observed in march may not have a significant effect in actual evapotranspiration of the catchments annually the maximum temperature is expected to increase by 4 12 c 4 05 c 4 03 c 3 99 c 3 96 c and 3 89 c under csiro mk3 6 0 hadgem2 es canesm2 cnrm cm5 noresmi m and ec earth climate models respectively fig 8 the overall change in minimum temperature follows a more or less similar seasonal pattern to the change in maximum temperature except for the difference in time when the highest changes are observed the average change in minimum temperature ranges from 3 08 c observed in october by ec earth to 4 79 c observed in april by the cnrm cm5 climate model fig 7 like maximum temperature the change in minimum temperature is also higher in the winter season in terms of average values of changes in all climate models the highest change in minimum temperature is expected to be 4 42 c in april on annual basis the change in minimum temperature is not showing significant variation between the climate models we used at the end of thirty years of this century the mean minimum temperature is expected to increase by 4 11 c 4 06 c 4 04 c 4 00 c 3 88 c 3 86 c under csiro mk3 6 0 canesm2 hadgem2 es cnrm cm5 ec earth and noresm1 m climate models respectively fig 8 3 4 swat model efficiency swat model has a good efficiency in the gaged watersheds of the lake tana basin the default efficiency of the model was very poor in both statistical parameters which are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative volume error rve comparatively the highest efficiency in terms of nse was observed in the gumara watershed 0 18 but in terms of rve it was good in the ribb watershed 28 69 in default simulation the worst efficiency of the model was observed in the megech watershed in terms of both nse and rve the values were 0 32 and 48 52 respectively table 4 to enhance the efficiency of the swat model some additional parameters were included and a total of 11 important parameters were selected after sensitivity analysis was done and the values of the parameters were calibrated using automatic calibration and manual calibration processes in the sensitivity analysis process the parameter which has the highest value of the absolute value of t stat and the lowest value of the p value is taken as the most sensitive parameter neitsch et al 2002 among 11 parameters five of the most sensitive parameters in each watershed with their fitted values are presented in table 3 the model was more efficient in the gilgel abay watershed in both calibration and validation process in terms of nse 0 86 even though it shows some improvement through calibration the model was still weak in the megech watershed and statistically the efficiency of the model nse in the watershed was 0 51 and 0 54 in the calibration and validation process respectively the rve in this watershed recorded negative 8 84 and 6 62 in the calibration and validation process respectively these negative rve values indicate that the model overestimated the simulated streamflow relative to the measured value table 4 the calibrated values of parameters were also verified by independent climate data and it shows consistent efficiency with the calibrated one as it is shown in fig 9 the model captured the peak flows in some years whereas it overestimated and underestimated in some other years in all watersheds as it can be shown on the graph fig 9 in the megech watershed simulated flow is higher than the observed flow in both calibration and validation time in this simulation process the model does not consider irrigation and other small scale water work projects that can reduce the stream flow at the lower catchment of the watershed on the upper part of the megech watershed there is one dam angereb dam which is used for the domestic water supply of gondar town haregeweyn et al 2012 because the dam stores water during the rainy season the peak simulated flow is higher than the observed flow as it can be shown in fig 9 3 5 impacts of climate change on streamflow the streamflow in the four major watersheds of lake tana sub basin under the worst representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario shows visible changes in the last thirty years of this century in all watersheds seasonally the change is more prominent in summer and the beginning of autumn the impact of climate change on the dry season flow of the four watersheds is much less than the impact observed in rainy seasons according to chakilu and moges 2017 gebrehiwot et al 2010 mekonnen et al 2018 rientjes et al 2011 studies conducted in the region and shao et al 2018 yihdego and webb 2013 out of the region the dry season flow of watersheds is affected by the land use change of the catchments even though the study area commonly gets rainfall in the summer season especially in july and august the change in rainfall was higher in the following three months in all watersheds the maximum value of change in streamflow was observed in november figs 10 13 unlike in the ribb watershed in the other three watersheds the maximum change is shown under the canesm2 climate model prediction given that the four watersheds are close to each other the minimum maximum and average change of streamflow in all climate models did not show a significant variation among the watersheds the maximum change in all watersheds ranges from 25 to 28 approximately in all climate models the maximum value of changes in gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech is 27 47 26 47 27 82 and 24 97 respectively even though the change in streamflow between watersheds is not showing considerable variation the change between the six climate models within each watershed showed great variation in the gilgel abay watershed the change ranges from 0 52 in june by the noresm1 m climate model to 27 47 in november by canesm2 including the decreasing change the change under almost all climate models except under cnrm cm5 in april shows a decreasing value in the winter and spring season and it ranges from 0 59 to 5 95 fig 10 like the gilgel abay watershed in the gumara watershed the maximum change in streamflow is shown in november and it is produced because of the canesm2 climate model the change in this watershed except hadgem2 es in june and noresm1 m in october under all climate models in all months of summer and autumn seasons showed an increasing trend in the gumara watershed the change ranges from 0 71 decreasing in january under the cnrm cm5 climate model to 26 47 in november under the canesm2 climate model fig 11 the result is consistent with other studies with different climate models ayele et al 2016 and different hydrological models haile et al 2017 this watershed is one of the highly vulnerable areas of the lake tana basin to climate change due to much of the upper catchment of the watershed being covered by mountainous land and being used for intensive agricultural activities chakilu and moges 2017 during the summer season the area gets a high amount of rainfall which can result in flooding in the lower catchment of the watershed and in another way it is also highly exposed to hydrological drought in the winter dry season because of the expansion of agriculture and plowing of sloppy areas without applying any soil and water conservation mechanisms mena 2018 which enable the water to infiltrate into the soil and join the groundwater to enhance the base flow of the river dams et al 2008 zhang and schilling 2006 unlike the other three watersheds in the ribb watershed the maximum change in streamflow was observed under cnrm cm5 but similar to others it is observed in november fig 12 though there are some variations in the values of change in streamflow under all climate models in all months the change in the ribb watershed showed a similar change pattern in time compared to the gumara watershed this similarity is because the two watersheds shared the same meteorological stations in simulations of the hydrological model the increment of streamflow in the watershed was also verified by other studies conducted in the region wagena et al 2016 yimer et al 2009 in the megech watershed the streamflow was projected and the change showed increasing in the summer and autumn seasons in the last thirty years of this century under all climate models except crnm cm5 which showed a decreasing trend in september compared to other watersheds the lowest maximum change in streamflow was predicted 24 97 m3 s in this watershed in the region the maximum temperature was observed in the winter and spring seasons indicating that much of the rainfall is changed to evapotranspiration and the flow is predicted to decrease like other studies gleick 1987 karl and riebsame 1989 wigley and jones 1985 the maximum decreasing value of change in streamflow 7 371 is predicted in march under the canesm2 climate model fig 13 besides to predicting the change in streamflow because of climate change in a monthly basis the annual mean streamflow change between the baseline period and the last thirty years of this century is also evaluated the annual mean streamflow in all watersheds under all climate models ranges from 1 to 6 43 the maximum annual average change in streamflow was predicted in the ribb watershed under csiro mk3 6 0 and the minimum change was forecasted in the megech watershed under hadgem2 es unlike other climate models the change in annual average streamflow under hadgem2 es in the gilgel abay watershed was predicted to decrease by 1 39 in the last thirty years of this century as far as the four watersheds shared the same meteorological stations in the simulation process the variation of change in streamflow on an annual average basis especially between the gumara and ribb watersheds was negligible as it is shown in fig 14 the two lines nearly overlapped especially in three climate models ec earth cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es 4 conclusion this study revealed that under all climate models the climate is changing and it is altering the flow conditions of watersheds in the lake tana basin despite this finding the change in temperature and precipitation does not show consistent variability in all used climate model outputs especially temperature showed an increasing trend in the highest emission scenario rcp 8 5 over the last thirty years of this century the highest annual mean temperature is likely to be increasing by 4 15 c under the csiro mk3 6 0 climate model relative to other models used in this study whereas the lowest change is expected under the ec earth climate model even though the change in precipitation seems insignificant seasonally it showed considerable variabilities due to this high emission scenario the change in climate potentially increases the streamflow of the four watersheds during the rainy summer and autumn seasons the highest change in stream flow is expected to be observed in november in all watersheds due to the increment of temperature being very high in the winter and spring seasons the potential evapotranspiration is likely to be increasing in the basin furthermore rainfall is not usually common in the winter and spring seasons in the region and even the change in rainfall showed a negative change under most climate models thus the increment of potential evapotranspiration and reduction of rainfall is likely to cause a decreasing of stream flow in the dry seasons generally the study showed that future climate change is expected to potentially alter the streamflow conditions especially in the two extreme flow cases of watersheds and therefore any water management project plans should consider the future stream flow dynamics caused by climate change finally based on the result of this study appropriate physical and biological soil and water conservation measures are highly recommended to protect against flooding soil erosion and sedimentation of the lake and hydrological drought in the basin credit authorship contribution statement gashaw gismu chakilu designed the hydrological model

watersheds simulated by soil water assessment tool swat under the representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 emission scenario using six climate models including canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 by comparing the last thirty years of the past century 1971 2000 and the same years of this century 2071 2100 bias correction for maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall data obtained from all climate models have been done using cmhyd software the swat model is calibrated and validated using eleven sensitive hydrological parameters new hydrological insights the result revealed that the change in maximum temperature ranges from 2 93 c november and 5 17 c march and the change in minimum temperature also ranges from 3 08 c to 4 79 c on a monthly basis rainfall is expected to increase up to 29 75 november and decrease up to 9 26 march in different seasons due to the change in climate a flow is predicted to increase up to 27 82 27 47 26 47 and 24 97 in ribb gilgel abay gumara and megech watersheds respectively and it is also decreasing in winter and spring seasons on average the streamflow is expected to increase by 5 89 5 63 4 92 and 4 87 in ribb gumara megech and gilgel abay watersheds respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change stream flow swat lake tana sub basin upper blue nile basin 1 introduction climate change is arguably the most important environmental challenge facing the world in the 21st century owing to its wide reaching impacts on human society fulco et al 2007 although climate change is a naturally occurring phenomenon us epa 2016 there is now a common consensus among the scientific community that anthropogenic activities are largely responsible for its occurrence mainly through burning fossil fuels like oil coal and gas leading to emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs to the atmosphere henderson and reinert 2016 until the 1800 s the emission of these ghgs was relatively stable but has since continuously increased due to industrialization population growth and the subsequent increase in energy consumption deforestation and human settlements north 2014 during the past 15 20 years the growth rate in heat trapping ghgs emissions increased from 1 5 to 2 ppm per year hayhoe et al 2017 consequently the global mean surface temperature for the decade 2006 2015 increased by 0 87 c which is higher than the observed long term average in the pre industrial period 1850 1900 ipcc 2018 due to the future anthropogenic activities and the emission of ghgs being uncertain it is strongly believed that future global temperatures will keep changing the representative concentration pathways rcps which are used for making projections based on these anthropogenic factors describe four different pathways of ghg emissions and atmospheric concentrations air pollutant emissions and land use in terms of a stringent mitigation scenario rcp2 6 two intermediate scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and one scenario with very high ghg emissions rcp8 5 that assumes radiative forcing concentration will reach 8 5 w m2 in the atmosphere and temperature increases up to 2 6 4 8 cin the end of 21 st century ipcc 2014 over the past few decades a plethora of climate models has been used to estimate the future climate of the earth under different scenarios the annual values projected for precipitation by such models are inherently uncertain and often inconsistent because each model is slightly different tebaldi et al 2011 power et al 2012 fao 2010 schaller et al 2011 however the trend and magnitude of change in precipitation are fairly consistent among the models most of which revealed an increasing trend in heavy rainfall extremes towards the end of the 21st century almost in all parts of the world poveda and martínez 2011 suppiah et al 2013 further projections show that the precipitation is very likely to increase in high latitudes and near major convergence zones in the tropics in some seasons while decreases are expected in many subtropical regions stocker et al 2013 such changes in the intensity and distribution of precipitation will have serious implications on water seager et al 2007 sivakumar 2011 stoll et al 2011 a key resource for economic growth and social development currently approximately one third of the world s population lives in water stress countries and by 2025 two thirds of the world s population will experience water scarcity problems due to the reduction of river flow and groundwater recharge fao 2010 due to climate change more frequent severe droughts and flood events are expected to intensify in different regions us epa 2016 in ethiopia over the past five decades changes in rainfall and temperature have affected the various components of the hydrological cycle in major river basins gebremicael et al 2013 tesemma et al 2010 in the country the hydrological drought during dry seasons and flooding in rainy seasons have become a common problem in many perennial rivers as noted by bekele et al 2021 mengistu et al 2021 roth et al 2018 numerous studies indicate that the hydrology of headwater catchments of the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia has been influenced by climate change kim and kaluarachchi 2009 malede et al 2022 worqlul et al 2018 whereas there are many climate change studies conducted in the lake tana basin very few studies used the rcp scenarios for instance the study conducted by chakilu et al 2020 tigabu et al 2021 used the rcp 8 5 scenario but the studies were conducted only on one or two catchments within the basin which limits our understanding of the potential impacts of climate change in the entire basin besides most of the previous studies conducted in the basin focused on projecting future climate under special report on emissions scenarios sres for example setegn et al 2011 used the a2 scenario while adem et al 2014 used a2 and b2 emission scenarios with a single climate model this study focused on how much the highest emission scenario rcp8 5 suggested by the fifth ipcc assessment report ar5 ipcc 2014 influences the stream flow nature of the four gauged watersheds of lake tana basin which contributes more than 60 of the total flow of the nile river mulat and moges 2014 by using six global climate models gcm in 2071 2100 with relative to 1971 2000 due to the inadequate number of meteorological stations in the basin and considering that most of the existing stations do not have long term historical recorded data for regional downscaling global climate models gcm were directly used through correcting the biases using cmhyd software the finding of this study gives important indications on the extent to which this highly demanded water resources for both upper and lower catchment communities will be affected by climate change and it also gives essential output for policymakers concerned about the reduction of climate change vulnerability of water resources in the planning process of different micro and macro projects including the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description lake tana basin is located in the north western highlands and stretches between 10 95 and 12 78 n latitudes and 36 89 and 38 25 e longitudes with a drainage area of about 15 096 km2 of which 3063 km2 of land is covered with lake tana fig 1 lake tana is the largest lake in ethiopia covering a surface area of 3000 3600 km2 at an elevation of 1800 m above sea level and a maximum depth of 15 m the climate of the lake tana sub basin is dominated by tropical highland monsoon with most of its rainfall occurring between june and september more than 93 of the flow of the lake is collected from four major rivers which are gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech setegn 2010 gilgel abay is the largest watershed in the lake tana sub basin which covers 1754 km2 followed by ribb gumara and megech watersheds which cover 1407 km2 1272 km2 and 514 km2 respectively according to conway and schipper 2011 most of the rainfall 70 90 total rainfall in the region occurs from june to september and the mean annual precipitation of the study area ranges from 1200 to 1600 mm based on data from 1961 to 2000 the temperature of the basin varies between 9 c and 28 c based on the fao soil classification map of the world fao and unesco 1977 chromic luvisols eutric cambisols eutric fluvisols eutric leptosols eutric regosols eutric vertisols haplic alisols haplic luvisols haplic nitisols and lithic leptosols are the major soil types in the basin the majority of the land area 51 3 of the lake tana basin is used for agriculture 29 is an agro pastoral area and 20 of the basin is covered by the lake water setegn et al 2008 2 2 climate and hydrological data collection and processing meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia some of the data which span 30 years 1971 2000 were used for bias correction of climate model outputs twelve meteorological stations were used in and near the study area although there are more numbers of meteorological stations in the study area many of them do not have adequate data and are full of missing values even in recorded data the missing values were replaced by the long term average recorded values of the corresponding dates of the preceding years and the years after the missed one to compare and evaluate the deviation of the data produced from climate models during the swat model calibration and validation process the missing data were replaced by 99 which is compatible with the swat model table 1 climate model data were obtained from the earth system grid federation esgf website https esgf node llnl gov projects esgf llnl which is hosted by the united states of america department of energy lawrence livermore national laboratory given that most of the meteorological stations in the lake tana basin do not have long term historical recorded data for regional downscaling global climate models gcm were directly used through bias correction using cmhyd software precipitation and temperature data are projected by six global climate models including canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 in coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 the data are produced under the experiment of the representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 emission scenario flow data of the four watersheds gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech were collected from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia for calibration and validation of the swat model like meteorological data flow data were also collected on a daily time scale with missing values replaced by 99 2 3 geophysical data collection and processing besides climatic data geophysical data such as land use cover soil and altitude dem were required to run the hydrological model swat the land use cover data were obtained from the ministry of water and energy of ethiopia soil data of the study area were also obtained from the digital soil map of the world website https data apps fao org map catalog srv eng catalog search metadata 446ed430 8383 11db b9b2 000d939bc5d8 which is digitized by fao unesco soil map of the world with 1 5000000 scale srtm digital elevation model dem data with 30 m 30 m resolution was collected from the united state geological survey usgs website https earthexplorer usgs gov the altitude data was used for watershed delineation and slope classification in hydrological response unit hru definition and analysis process 2 4 bias correction of climate models data climate data are obtained from global scale climate models climate variables such as rainfall and temperature obtained from such coarse resolution climate models are highly influenced by local topographies like mountains which may not probably be taken into consideration in the global climate models development process because of their coarse resolution thus to minimize the deviation of climate models output from the real observed data of meteorological stations the bias correction process was needed and it was done using variance scaling and power transformation methods for temperature and precipitation respectively using cmhyd software rathjens et al 2016 the reason why these two methods were selected for this study was that both are more efficient than other methods in frequency based statistics in other studies fang et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 precipitation data obtained from all climate models were corrected by fitting them to the thirty years 1971 2000 data and measured for their coefficient of variation cv in the power transformation process in this nonlinear correction each daily precipitation amount p is transformed into a corrected p by using eq 1 as follows 1 p ap b the coefficient a and the superscript b were determined iteratively the mean value of b was determined by equating the cv of the observed value of precipitation with that simulated value on a monthly basis and the coefficient a was determined by equating the mean value of observed precipitation with that simulated value for the comparison period bias correction for temperature only involved scaling and shifting to adjust the mean and variance of simulated and observed climate data terink et al 2010 ho et al 2012 by fitting it to thirty years period 1971 2000 data and the standard year s deviation sd thus the corrected daily temperature tcorr was obtained by using the following eq 2 2 t corr t obs σ t obs σ t gcm t gcm t gcm where tcorr is the corrected daily temperature tgcm is the uncorrected daily temperature obtained from the climate model tobs is the observed daily temperature an overbar denotes the mean value of the variable and σ is the standard deviation 2 5 swat model setup and simulation soil water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed small watershed or large river basin scale hydrological model which simulates the quality quantity of surface and groundwater it also simulates sediment transport on a particular watershed while predicting the environmental impacts of land use land management practices and climate change it is widely used in the assessment of soil and water conservation and non point pollution control in river basins neitsch et al 2002 the model requires daily climate data and geophysical data to simulate surface runoff groundwater flow and evapotranspiration of watersheds the model starts from the watershed characterization process and basically it passes six important steps 1 watershed delineation 2 hydrological response unit hru definition and analysis 3 climate and weather data formation 4 simulation 5 model calibration and 6 model validation srtm dem data of the entire lake tana basin was used for river networking and watershed delineation through the burn in method in the process four outlets were selected for the study area and each watershed was delineated with a combination of sub watersheds sub watersheds were further classified into hydrological response units hrus using land use soil and slope distribution process all land use soil and slope classes in each sub basin were considered in the hru definition process surface runoff is estimated separately for each sub basin and routed to quantify the total surface runoff of the basin using the following equation eq 3 neitsch et al 2002 3 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w sweep q gw i where swt is the final soil water content mm swo is the initial soil water content on the day i mm t is time days rday is the amount of precipitation on the day i mm qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on the day i mm ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on the day i mm wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on the day i and qgw is the amount of groundwater flow on the day i mm the amount of surface runoff is calculated using the following formula eq 4 4 q surf r day i a 2 r day i a s where qsurf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess mm rday is the height of rainfall for the day mm ia is the initial abstractions canopy interception surface storage infiltration before runoff mm and s is the retention parameter therefore retention parameter s is defined as eq 5 5 s 25 4 1000 cn 10 where cn is the curve number for the day and the initial abstractions ia are commonly approximated as 0 2 s eq 6 is represented as follows 6 q surf r day 0 2 s 2 r day 0 8 s the runoff will only occur when rday ia 2 6 swat model calibration and validation once the flow was simulated with default parameters sensitive parameters were selected using the sensitivity analysis process for the four watersheds ten and seven years of climate data were used for calibration and validation respectively these years were selected based on the availability of data based on the sensitivity analysis result eleven parameters that have a prominent influence on the streamflow of watersheds were selected table 2 and the value of each parameter in the four watersheds was determined by the calibration process the calibration process was done by using swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs version 12 software and the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm the fitted value of parameters was observed by iterating 2000 simulations through automatically adjusting the values based on the range of adjustment domain the output produced by using selected parameters and their adjusted values were compared with the observed streamflow of the watersheds so that the efficiency of the swat model was evaluated the efficiency of the model was evaluated using statistical variables that determine the fitness of simulated flow with the measured flow data of watersheds those statistical variables are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative volume error rve shown in eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q sim i q obs 2 where qobs and qsim represent the observed and simulated daily stream flows at the ith time steps respectively n refers to the number of days in the simulated or observed time series period the overbar symbol represents the mean value which indicates the average value of streamflow the value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranges between 1 and 1 shows the best fit of the model or that the model simulates similar values of streamflow with the observed values a value between 0 and 1 is considered an

discussion 3 1 the efficiency of climate models in this study six climate models were used to predict future climate in the study area the efficiency of each model was evaluated by comparing their historical data with station observed data the error in rainfall and temperature are analyzed on monthly basis the model error of rainfall ranges from an absolute value of 0 05 1 94 the maximum variation is observed in august by the noresm1 m climate model and the minimum is observed in january by the csiro mk3 6 0 climate model almost all climate models reasonably capture the station measured rainfall especially in the winter season december march fig 2 indeed the change is more prominent in the summer season because rain is not common in the winter seasons in the study area in general the rainfall data produced by climate models are consistent with the measured data on the stations all climate models except cnrm cm5 overestimated the maximum temperature in six consecutive months from december to may the error ranges from the absolute value of 0 01 c which is predicted in september csiro mk3 6 0 and january by hadgem2 es to 0 5 c predicted in march by the cnrm cm5 climate model the overall deviation of the model in maximum temperature is 0 19 c 0 03 c 0 25 c 0 14 c 0 12 c and 0 16 c in canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 climate models respectively fig 3 all climate models are relatively more efficient in minimum temperature than the maximum temperature in capturing the measured data the errors of models range from 0 01 c to 0 35 c and the maximum error was recorded in october by the cnrm cm5 climate model unlike maximum temperature some climate models underestimate the minimum temperature on monthly basis generally on average errors by canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 are 0 03 c 0 04 c 0 07 c 0 09 c 0 02 c and 0 05 c respectively fig 4 3 2 change in rainfall in the last thirty years of this century rainfall is predicted to increase in the summer and autumn seasons in all climate models except the cnrm cm5 model which predicted an increase in rainfall in september and noresmi m in october seasonally the change in rainfall ranges from the absolute value of 0 83 29 75 fig 5 the maximum change is forecasted by the cnrm cm5 climate model in november most of the climate models predicted that rainfall will decrease in the spring pre summer season the maximum decreasing change is observed in march which is 9 26 by the canesm2 climate model as far as the region has been getting rainfall in the summer season conway and schipper 2011 it is obvious that the change is not that much expected to be high in the winter season and this study showed the same result on an annual average basis the change is relatively lower than the change in the monthly time step annually the change ranged from 2 45 to 7 17 in which the maximum change was predicted by csiro mk3 6 0 in general the annual mean rainfall is expected to change by 6 85 2 45 4 89 2 46 2 57 and 7 17 under canesm2 ec earth cnrm cm5 hadgem2 es noresm1 m csiro mk3 6 0 climate models respectively within one hundred years fig 8 3 3 change in temperature swat model requires daily maximum and minimum air temperature which may be read from records of observed data or may be generated neitsch et al 2002 seasonally the maximum temperature is expected to increase with a range of 2 93 c and 5 17 c under all climate models based on the rcp 8 5 climate change scenario in the last thirty years of the 21st century the lowest change in maximum temperature was forecasted by the cnrm cm5 climate model in november whereas the highest change is forecasted by csiro mk3 6 0 in march fig 6 the change is higher in the winter than the summer season in almost all climate models on an average basis the highest change was observed in march which is 4 61 c and the lowest is 3 48 c in november fig 6 temperature is one of the most important parameters for estimating the evapotranspiration which can potentially reduce the water availability in the catchments in the swat model neitsch et al 2002 because the area is dry in the winter season and potential evapotranspiration which is used for water balance computation in this study is considering that the availability of moisture in the soil is sufficient enough allen et al 1998 this highest change in maximum temperature observed in march may not have a significant effect in actual evapotranspiration of the catchments annually the maximum temperature is expected to increase by 4 12 c 4 05 c 4 03 c 3 99 c 3 96 c and 3 89 c under csiro mk3 6 0 hadgem2 es canesm2 cnrm cm5 noresmi m and ec earth climate models respectively fig 8 the overall change in minimum temperature follows a more or less similar seasonal pattern to the change in maximum temperature except for the difference in time when the highest changes are observed the average change in minimum temperature ranges from 3 08 c observed in october by ec earth to 4 79 c observed in april by the cnrm cm5 climate model fig 7 like maximum temperature the change in minimum temperature is also higher in the winter season in terms of average values of changes in all climate models the highest change in minimum temperature is expected to be 4 42 c in april on annual basis the change in minimum temperature is not showing significant variation between the climate models we used at the end of thirty years of this century the mean minimum temperature is expected to increase by 4 11 c 4 06 c 4 04 c 4 00 c 3 88 c 3 86 c under csiro mk3 6 0 canesm2 hadgem2 es cnrm cm5 ec earth and noresm1 m climate models respectively fig 8 3 4 swat model efficiency swat model has a good efficiency in the gaged watersheds of the lake tana basin the default efficiency of the model was very poor in both statistical parameters which are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative volume error rve comparatively the highest efficiency in terms of nse was observed in the gumara watershed 0 18 but in terms of rve it was good in the ribb watershed 28 69 in default simulation the worst efficiency of the model was observed in the megech watershed in terms of both nse and rve the values were 0 32 and 48 52 respectively table 4 to enhance the efficiency of the swat model some additional parameters were included and a total of 11 important parameters were selected after sensitivity analysis was done and the values of the parameters were calibrated using automatic calibration and manual calibration processes in the sensitivity analysis process the parameter which has the highest value of the absolute value of t stat and the lowest value of the p value is taken as the most sensitive parameter neitsch et al 2002 among 11 parameters five of the most sensitive parameters in each watershed with their fitted values are presented in table 3 the model was more efficient in the gilgel abay watershed in both calibration and validation process in terms of nse 0 86 even though it shows some improvement through calibration the model was still weak in the megech watershed and statistically the efficiency of the model nse in the watershed was 0 51 and 0 54 in the calibration and validation process respectively the rve in this watershed recorded negative 8 84 and 6 62 in the calibration and validation process respectively these negative rve values indicate that the model overestimated the simulated streamflow relative to the measured value table 4 the calibrated values of parameters were also verified by independent climate data and it shows consistent efficiency with the calibrated one as it is shown in fig 9 the model captured the peak flows in some years whereas it overestimated and underestimated in some other years in all watersheds as it can be shown on the graph fig 9 in the megech watershed simulated flow is higher than the observed flow in both calibration and validation time in this simulation process the model does not consider irrigation and other small scale water work projects that can reduce the stream flow at the lower catchment of the watershed on the upper part of the megech watershed there is one dam angereb dam which is used for the domestic water supply of gondar town haregeweyn et al 2012 because the dam stores water during the rainy season the peak simulated flow is higher than the observed flow as it can be shown in fig 9 3 5 impacts of climate change on streamflow the streamflow in the four major watersheds of lake tana sub basin under the worst representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario shows visible changes in the last thirty years of this century in all watersheds seasonally the change is more prominent in summer and the beginning of autumn the impact of climate change on the dry season flow of the four watersheds is much less than the impact observed in rainy seasons according to chakilu and moges 2017 gebrehiwot et al 2010 mekonnen et al 2018 rientjes et al 2011 studies conducted in the region and shao et al 2018 yihdego and webb 2013 out of the region the dry season flow of watersheds is affected by the land use change of the catchments even though the study area commonly gets rainfall in the summer season especially in july and august the change in rainfall was higher in the following three months in all watersheds the maximum value of change in streamflow was observed in november figs 10 13 unlike in the ribb watershed in the other three watersheds the maximum change is shown under the canesm2 climate model prediction given that the four watersheds are close to each other the minimum maximum and average change of streamflow in all climate models did not show a significant variation among the watersheds the maximum change in all watersheds ranges from 25 to 28 approximately in all climate models the maximum value of changes in gilgel abay gumara ribb and megech is 27 47 26 47 27 82 and 24 97 respectively even though the change in streamflow between watersheds is not showing considerable variation the change between the six climate models within each watershed showed great variation in the gilgel abay watershed the change ranges from 0 52 in june by the noresm1 m climate model to 27 47 in november by canesm2 including the decreasing change the change under almost all climate models except under cnrm cm5 in april shows a decreasing value in the winter and spring season and it ranges from 0 59 to 5 95 fig 10 like the gilgel abay watershed in the gumara watershed the maximum change in streamflow is shown in november and it is produced because of the canesm2 climate model the change in this watershed except hadgem2 es in june and noresm1 m in october under all climate models in all months of summer and autumn seasons showed an increasing trend in the gumara watershed the change ranges from 0 71 decreasing in january under the cnrm cm5 climate model to 26 47 in november under the canesm2 climate model fig 11 the result is consistent with other studies with different climate models ayele et al 2016 and different hydrological models haile et al 2017 this watershed is one of the highly vulnerable areas of the lake tana basin to climate change due to much of the upper catchment of the watershed being covered by mountainous land and being used for intensive agricultural activities chakilu and moges 2017 during the summer season the area gets a high amount of rainfall which can result in flooding in the lower catchment of the watershed and in another way it is also highly exposed to hydrological drought in the winter dry season because of the expansion of agriculture and plowing of sloppy areas without applying any soil and water conservation mechanisms mena 2018 which enable the water to infiltrate into the soil and join the groundwater to enhance the base flow of the river dams et al 2008 zhang and schilling 2006 unlike the other three watersheds in the ribb watershed the maximum change in streamflow was observed under cnrm cm5 but similar to others it is observed in november fig 12 though there are some variations in the values of change in streamflow under all climate models in all months the change in the ribb watershed showed a similar change pattern in time compared to the gumara watershed this similarity is because the two watersheds shared the same meteorological stations in simulations of the hydrological model the increment of streamflow in the watershed was also verified by other studies conducted in the region wagena et al 2016 yimer et al 2009 in the megech watershed the streamflow was projected and the change showed increasing in the summer and autumn seasons in the last thirty years of this century under all climate models except crnm cm5 which showed a decreasing trend in september compared to other watersheds the lowest maximum change in streamflow was predicted 24 97 m3 s in this watershed in the region the maximum temperature was observed in the winter and spring seasons indicating that much of the rainfall is changed to evapotranspiration and the flow is predicted to decrease like other studies gleick 1987 karl and riebsame 1989 wigley and jones 1985 the maximum decreasing value of change in streamflow 7 371 is predicted in march under the canesm2 climate model fig 13 besides to predicting the change in streamflow because of climate change in a monthly basis the annual mean streamflow change between the baseline period and the last thirty years of this century is also evaluated the annual mean streamflow in all watersheds under all climate models ranges from 1 to 6 43 the maximum annual average change in streamflow was predicted in the ribb watershed under csiro mk3 6 0 and the minimum change was forecasted in the megech watershed under hadgem2 es unlike other climate models the change in annual average streamflow under hadgem2 es in the gilgel abay watershed was predicted to decrease by 1 39 in the last thirty years of this century as far as the four watersheds shared the same meteorological stations in the simulation process the variation of change in streamflow on an annual average basis especially between the gumara and ribb watersheds was negligible as it is shown in fig 14 the two lines nearly overlapped especially in three climate models ec earth cnrm cm5 and hadgem2 es 4 conclusion this study revealed that under all climate models the climate is changing and it is altering the flow conditions of watersheds in the lake tana basin despite this finding the change in temperature and precipitation does not show consistent variability in all used climate model outputs especially temperature showed an increasing trend in the highest emission scenario rcp 8 5 over the last thirty years of this century the highest annual mean temperature is likely to be increasing by 4 15 c under the csiro mk3 6 0 climate model relative to other models used in this study whereas the lowest change is expected under the ec earth climate model even though the change in precipitation seems insignificant seasonally it showed considerable variabilities due to this high emission scenario the change in climate potentially increases the streamflow of the four watersheds during the rainy summer and autumn seasons the highest change in stream flow is expected to be observed in november in all watersheds due to the increment of temperature being very high in the winter and spring seasons the potential evapotranspiration is likely to be increasing in the basin furthermore rainfall is not usually common in the winter and spring seasons in the region and even the change in rainfall showed a negative change under most climate models thus the increment of potential evapotranspiration and reduction of rainfall is likely to cause a decreasing of stream flow in the dry seasons generally the study showed that future climate change is expected to potentially alter the streamflow conditions especially in the two extreme flow cases of watersheds and therefore any water management project plans should consider the future stream flow dynamics caused by climate change finally based on the result of this study appropriate physical and biological soil and water conservation measures are highly recommended to protect against flooding soil erosion and sedimentation of the lake and hydrological drought in the basin credit authorship contribution statement gashaw gismu chakilu designed the hydrological model

7939,study region congo river basin study focus precipitation is the major driving force of hydrological processes and is one of the main input datasets for hydrological models the congo river basin is one of the least studied major river basins in the world and suffers from the scarcity and difficulty in accessing rain gauge data necessitating the use of satellite precipitation estimates for hydrological studies in this study we have made a comprehensive comparison of different satellite based precipitation products inputs for a hydrological model in the congo river basin new hydrological insight for this region our findings showed that the products based on satellite only source tend to overestimate the rainy season peaks in comparison with the 3b42 v7 product on the other hand the satellite products that consider gauge calibration presented better agreements between each other the hydrological model was able to reproduce the general precipitation products characteristics while the gauge adjusted satellite products performed better than those without gauge adjustments overall precipitation patterns have a crucial effect on the model s performance and leads to different streamflow and water balance components values the choice of rainfall product has a significant importance in the interpretation of the simulated hydrological cycle keywords precipitation satellite observations frogs swat model congo river basin 1 introduction hydrological models are frequently used as practical tools to assess and to predict the impacts of anthropogenic activities on water resources and also assist in their management or create a basis for decision making on sustainable development alternatives and conservation practices abbaspour et al 2015 loucks and beek 2017 however these models require distributed meteorological information precipitation temperature wind speed etc which is a great challenge in large and poorly gauged areas such as tropical regions precipitation is one of the main parameters for hydrological models but its estimation is still very difficult because of its strong spatio temporal heterogeneity beck et al 2016 there are three ways of measuring precipitation over a basin i conventional instrumentation using networks of rain or snow meters ii ground based weather radar and iii satellite measurement nevertheless despite the accuracy of estimates from conventional instrumentation and weather radar the distribution and density of these methods are highly variable another issue with these methods is the completeness and consistency of the historical data series as well as the availability for near real time analysis kidd and levizzani 2011 sun et al 2017 the precipitation data obtained by satellite is an alternative in regions where data is scarce with a large number of free products available with high spatial and temporal resolution that can fill historical gaps and complement or replace in situ stations kidd et al 2017 with the advent of the satellite tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 from late 1997 2014 transitioning with the launch of the global precipitation measurement gpm hou et al 2014 skofronick jackson et al 2017 a mission that is actually operating in conjunction with other passive microwave platforms the performance of satellite precipitation estimates has significantly evolved along the years numerous satellite based precipitation products with different characteristics i e spatial temporal among others have since then been developed and improved for distinct application purposes such as for climatological hydrological agricultural and monitoring studies numerous observational daily precipitation products including satellite estimates are now available in a common 1 x1 grid format through the frequent rainfall observations on grids frogs database roca et al 2019 frogs database enables easier intercomparisons and applications based on the selection of a single to multiple products considering their category i e satellite only gauge adjusted satellite estimates among others nonetheless the estimation of satellite precipitation data is not wholly reliable due to the uncertainties arising from measurement errors associated with observations sampling recovery algorithms and bias correction processes that leads to systematic and random errors roca et al 2010 oliveira et al 2016 beck et al 2016 beck et al 2017 sun et al 2017 tropical forests including the congo river basin crb strongly influence both the regional and global climate storing large carbon stocks and regulating energy and water cycles in this sense any changes in the structure of these ecosystems such as those caused by deforestation can create positive feedbacks and increase climate change trends the crb in central africa is the second largest river basin in the world and supports one of earth s three major humid tropical forest regions alsdorf et al 2016 it contains about 70 of africa s forest cover of the congo basin s 530 million hectares of land 300 million are covered by forest almost 99 of the forested area is primary or naturally regenerated forest as opposed to plantations and 46 is lowland dense forest the average annual precipitation is around 1500 2000 mm of precipitation per year and is the most convectively active region of the world dezfuli 2017 almost 60 of precipitation occurs during the wet seasons and the basin wide average seasonal cycle has two precipitation peaks one in march and the other in november hua et al 2019 crowhurst et al 2021 this basin is currently an object of concern because of evidence of a significant multidecadal drying trend one of the most significant worldwide zhou et al 2014 harris et al 2017 despite the important role in the tropical climate system the crb is plagued by a scarcity of precipitation ground data especially after the early 1990 s this scarcity of data is primarily because the meteorological services of both angola and the democratic republic of the congo countries that include most of the congo rain forest essentially ceased to function for decades and have been slow to rebuild their services alsdorf et al 2016 the lack of in situ data leads most hydrological studies in the congo basin to depend on satellite precipitation estimates beighley et al 2011 assessed the applicability of satellite precipitation estimates in terrestrial rainfall runoff modelling in the crb where three sources products of rainfall data were applied to the hillslope river routing hrr model although large variability among the products were found especially in the equatorial regions of the crb the trmm 3b42 product which is a gauge adjusted product provided the best spatial and temporal distributions however the cause and potential solutions to the detected variability were not discussed by beighley et al 2011 on the other hand aloysius and saiers 2017 in a climate projection context via rainfall runoff model application made use of 25 global climate models gcms to explore the variability in modeled runoff in two subsequent periods near future 2016 2035 and mid century 2046 2065 and under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios aloysius and saiers 2017 also revealed the importance of long term and spatially explicit dataset for characterizing hydrologic response in minimizing the uncertainty that vary widely by region within the crb being crucial for both observational and projection studies this study aims to 1 exploit the precipitation distributions and variability characteristics among the 23 gridded satellite based precipitation products over the crb during the period from 2001 to 2012 the regional performance evaluations are categorized according to their input data sources satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted which leads to an unprecedented assessment over the region that can provides important feedback to both the algorithm developers and science community on the support for instance of the climate hydrological and agricultural monitoring and research in addition this study aims to analyze 2 the impact of these precipitation products inputs in a hydrological model swat soil water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and investigate the potential behaviors of these different precipitation inputs in describing hydrologic processes although several hydrological models have been applied in the crb e g beighley et al 2011 tshimanga and hughes 2014 we considered the swat model because apart from its

materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the intracratonic depression in central africa called the crb fig 1 is situated between latitudes 9 n and 14 s and longitudes 11 e and 34 e it covers an area of approximately 3 7 million km2 including most of the democratic republic of congo drc formerly zaire the people s republic of congo roc and the central african republic car elevations within the basin are 3000 m above sea level m asl in the eastern highlands and less than 300 m asl in the center of the basin runge 2007 the physiography of the crb varies and consists of the northern peneplains of bushy wooded savanna with tropical humid climate bultot 1971 the middle basin includes the dense and heavily forested swamp forest of the cuvette centrale and the sandy sandstone formations of the batékés plateaux of between 350 and 930 m altitude covered by bushy savanna laraque et al 2001 mean annual rainfall is 2000 mm y 1 in the central basin decreasing northward to southward to 1100 mm y 1 alsdorf et al 2016 the basic rainfall pattern across the basin is thought to be due to the bi annual passage of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz across the basin the itcz over africa is acknowledged as the location where the dry northeasterly harmattan meets the moist southerly flow of the monsoon and a major control on tropical rainfall recent evidence concerning the latitudinal progression of the equatorial rainy season however suggests that this view of the itcz may be challenged jackson et al 2009 nicholson et al 2019 rainfall across the basin occurs with a seasonal peak in precipitation from december to march in areas of the southern hemisphere with northern hemisphere basins having theirs within july to october moukandi n kaya et al 2021 annual extremes of precipitation in the equatorial regions are in april and october while sharp precipitation gradients which may result in spurious trends are noticed in the south eastern parts of the basin yin and gruber 2010 tshimanga et al 2012 2 2 satellite based precipitation datasets twenty three precipitation products with a common period from 2001 to 2012 except 3b42 v7 0 period from 1998 to 2012 were selected for this study table 1 these datasets were acquired from the frequent rainfall observations on grids frogs database roca et al 2019 frogs is composed of several quasi global and regional daily precipitation products with a common spatial resolution of 1 1 although frogs database includes satellites ground based and reanalysis products only the satellite based category was considered for this study the satellite based precipitation products which differ from each other in multiple aspects e g satellite source with or without gauge adjustments among others are here sub divided into two main groups i the satellite only and ii the gauge calibrated satellite these products are retrieved utilizing infrared ir observations from geostationary satellites and or passive microwave observations from multiple or single low elevation orbiting leo satellites the gauge based calibration step is distinctly applied to those satellite precipitation products these adjustments are climatological on a monthly or daily time step and take into consideration in situ observations from the global telecommunication system gts or other gauged based precipitation products e g gpcc table 1 shows the satellite based precipitation products selected for this study and their main characteristics frogs database is freely available from ftp ftp climserv ipsl polytechnique fr frogs see roca et al 2019 for a detailed description of each product 2 3 swat model the soil water assessment tool is a continuous time spatially distributed hydrological basin scale model that simulates water sediment nutrient chemical and bacterial transport in a basin resulting from the interactions among weather condition soil properties stream channel characteristics vegetation and crop growth as well as land management practices the model calculates pollutant loads from various non point and point sources arnold et al 1998 fundamentally the model is hydrologically driven based upon the water balance of an individual landscape unit 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r dayi q surfi e ai w seepi q gwi where swt is the final soil water content mm h2o sw0 is the initial soil water content mm h2o t is time days rdayi is precipitation on day i mm h2o qsurfi is surface runoff on day i mm h2o eai is evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o wseepi is the amount of water from the soil profile inflowing to the vadose zone on day i mm h2o and qgwi is the base flow on day i mm h2o 2 3 1 model setup swat2012 version winchell et al 2013 was setup for the crb using the datasets listed in table 2 the basin was delineated based on the dominant land use soil and slope classes taking into cognizance the size and spatial heterogeneity of the basin allocating one hydrologic response unit hru per subbasin resulting in 272 subbasins and hrus the period of simulation was from 1998 to 2012 comprising calibration 2000 2006 validation 2006 2012 and a two year warm up period 1998 2000 lakes wetlands and reservoirs were setup in swat model the reservoirs were parameterized based on available information and assuming that no management system was in place in the swat model the evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith method the penman monteith method also gave better estimates of evapotranspiration when used with the plant growth modification of strauch and volk 2013 the plant growth module was used since the swat model simulates plant growth based on dormancy during the winter season for the reinitiation of the growing season for perennial plants and this process is not a valid growing pattern in the tropics the surface runoff was calculated using the soil conservation service s curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 and the variable storage method williams 1969 was used for channel routing 2 3 1 1 wetland the choice of model is explained in datok et al 2022 but in order to further emphasise the assumptions made in this study it is important to underline that the level of complexity and types quality of data needed for the model datok et al 2022 informed the choice of the model the main assumption made was to treat the central wetland area as a blackbox thus creating a deterministic model that may not take into account all physical processes the swat model is a process based model simulating both upland and channel processes the land phase is solved at hru level in which the hydrologic cycle controls the amount of water sediment nutrient and pesticide loadings to the main channel and ii a stream phase solved at reach level where water sediments and nutrients move through the channels of the watershed to the outlet being semi distributed the internal variables of the model are adjusted based on a combination of unit cells whose location is not precisely located since small scale spatial differences were not needed we relied on basin scale or regional parameters to calibrate the model wetlands and depressions are located in subbasins off the main channel thus water that flows into them must originate from the subbasin they are located for reservoirs they are located on the main channels thereby trapping all flow from upstream subbasins neitsch et al 2011 in our model the watershed was partitioned into 272 subbasins where an unequal number of subbasins drained to each of the four principal gauging stations while the entire watershed drained into the main gauging outlet at brazzaville kinshasa since the 272 subbasins had an equal number of hrus for reasons given in datok et al 2022 it meant that the hydrological effects of the wetlands are proportionally distributed within the respective hrus thus the model offers future promise as the availability of observations in any one of the wetland subbasins will seriously improve the model calibration the water balance for the wetland in swat is given as follows 2 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep where v is the volume of water in impoundment at the end of the day m3 h2o vstored is the volume of water at the beginning of the day m3 h2o vflowin is the volume of water entering the wetland during the day m3 h2o vflowout is the volume of water flowing out of the wetland during the day m3 h2o vpcp is the volume of precipitation falling on the wetland during the day m3 h2o vevap is the volume of water removed from the wetland during the day m3 h2o and vseep is the volume of water lost from the wetland during the day m3 h2o in calculating the inflows into the wetlands swat subtracts the volume of water entering the wetland from the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater loadings to the main channel on the other hand the wetland releases water whenever the water volume exceeds the normal storage volume 3 v flowout 0 ifv v nor where vnor is the volume of water held in wetland when filled to the normal water level m3 h2o neitsch et al 2011 2 3 1 2 3b42 v 7 reference database swat model was setup with daily precipitation estimates by the tmpa 3b42 v 7 product from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm afterward 3b42 the 3b42 v 7 provides rainfall estimates at a 3 h temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution daily grids that spans nearly three decades 1998 today the quality of the tmpa 3b42 product has been assessed for several tropical regions some of them focusing on the crb munzimi et al 2015 and 2019 washington et al 2013 studies such as munzini et al 2015 demonstrate that despite some of the limitations in validating satellite based products the 3b42 v 7 is consistent in the depiction of intra annual variation in crb we chose the 3b42 v 7 instead of the gauge stations to set up the swat model firstly because there is a low gauge density across the crb munzimi et al 2015 kabuya et al 2020 and secondly the gaps or missing data after the 80 s samba et al 2008 and nicholson et al 2019 spatial and temporal rainfall data scarcity has a large impact on general and extreme streamflow simulations tan and yang 2020 as well this scarcity would lead to errors in trend analysis in this context 3b42 v 7 was more suitable to be used as input for swat model 2 3 2 model calibration model calibration was based on the optimization of the parameter values by adjusting the simulated streamflow qsim to observed streamflow qobs at a monthly time step the observed data from the five gauging stations fig 1 are located on major tributaries of the crb two on the northern side of the basin ubangui at bangui and sangha at ouesso two others on the southern side lualaba at kisangani and kutu moke at kasai and the fifth station is located at the brazzaville kinshasa gauging station that controls 98 of the entire basin the common period of calibration and validation for the stations was taken as the years 2000 2012 table 2 in the model set up used the simulated streamflow was adjusted to the observed streamflow by manual calibration trial and error this method follows the simple approach of manual adjustment of uncertain or unknown parameters and the comparison of predictions with measured values relying on human judgment to attain the best fit for model parameters moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 the model parameterization was done by adjusting influential parameters firstly parameters which are generally sensitive such as groundwater related parameters secondly parameters related to runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration table 3 the parameters were regionalized according to the characteristics of the subbasins further details of the calibration and validation procedures can be found in datok et al 2022 for the evaluation of model performance we used the nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse that measures the magnitude of residual variance compared to observed variance moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination r2 that describes the degree of linear relationship between observed and simulated streamflow and percent bias pbias which evaluates the average tendency of the magnitude of simulated values in relation to the observed ones the kling gupta efficiency kge by gupta et al 2009 is a decomposition of the nse and mean squared error kge facilitates the analysis of relative importance of correlation bias and variability in hydrologic modeling kge hydrogof 2017 for streamflow moriasi et al 2015 proposed nse values 0 50 r2 0 60 and pbias 25 to be a satisfactory level for monthly scales a kge value 0 50 is also considered satisfactory gupta et al 2009 2 4 evaluation of the performance of precipitation datasets using swat model the swat model was run for twenty three scenarios based on the precipitation products described in table 1 the base scenario is based on the 3b42 v7 0 product and it was calibrated with observed streamflow see above the other precipitation scenarios were run using identical datasets see table 1 so that variations in streamflow and other hydrological components were uniquely attributable to precipitation for the evaluation of the performance of precipitation datasets we used kge and pbias objective functions calculated using the streamflow of base scenario 3b42 v7 0 as reference 3 results and discussion precipitation regimes over the crb are firstly assessed through the 23 satellite based precipitation products during the period from 2001 to 2012 secondly the model calibration and validation are performed for the period from 1998 to 2012 two years of warm up for the model afterwards hydrological evolution streamflow and water balance components through the 23 precipitation products during 2003 2012 two years of warn up are assessed finally we discuss the influence of the precipitation input on model performance when the model has been pre calibrated with one of the products here 3b42 3 1 comparison of the different precipitation datasets satellite precipitation estimates through different gridded products has been constantly evaluated and assessed across west africa considering gauged precipitation observations as a reference e g gosset et al 2018 nicholson et al 2019 satgé et al 2020 the reliability of satellite precipitation estimates depends on several factors e g seasonality the gauge network densities and can vary in space and time the precipitation regime i e seasonality over the crb varies regionally e g munzimi et al 2015 spatially there are remarkable characteristics on the precipitation distribution over crb which are demonstrated through the unconditional annual mean and the 99th percentile fig 2 the central region of the crb and the northern portion of the luabala sub basin experience the largest amounts of precipitation with about 7 and 10 mm day 1 respectively nevertheless the lualaba also showed the largest regional contrast of precipitation amounts with most of the watershed area presenting precipitation mean lower than 3 mm day 1 these spatial characteristics were directly linked to the extreme precipitation occurrences represented by the 99th percentile strongly influenced by the surface type i e orographic conditions where the highest values 50 mm day 1 were found mainly across the wetland zones and over the northwest part of lualaba fig 3 depicts the annual cycle of precipitation through the monthly accumulated mean distributions from all the selected satellite based precipitation products over the five crb sub basins during the period from 2001 to 2012 the contrasts between the satellite only and satellite gauged adjusted precipitation are assessed considering the 3b42 v7 0 product as baseline overall three different precipitation regimes which were associated with the geographic characteristics were observed across the five sub basins of the congo which is in agreement with previous findings based on both the satellite and rain gauge data e g munzimi et al 2015 i kasai and luabala located in the southernmost portion presenting a well defined dry wet period with the maximum minimum from november to march between june and august ii sangha and ubangi in the northern portions presents a prolonged rainy period peak of maximums around august september and a short term dry season december and january and iii the central part which is characterized by a less well defined monsoonal regime with a dry period less pronounced and two rainy peaks the first around march and the second during october november although all the satellite precipitation products were able to successfully represent the annual cycle of rainfall over each watershed under study notable differences along the year on the magnitudes of the precipitation amounts were observed overall two remarkable performance characteristics were noted the group of satellite only products mostly overestimates the rainy seasons peaks compared to the rest of the products in particular the cmorph v1 0 raw 3b42rt uncal v7 0 followed by imerg v06 eu and imerg v06 lu products stand out for presenting the highest peaks especially during the rainy seasons systematically for all the five sub basins for instance cmorph v1 0 raw overestimates about 100 mm month in comparison to the rest of the products at most of the sub basins on the other hand the group of gauge adjusted satellite products presented better agreements between each other and compared to 3b42 v7 0 except for gsmap gauges rnlv6 0 and cmorph v1 0 crt which exhibited opposite performances to its satellite only versions underestimating the monthly totals during a greater part of the year for all the five sub basins in addition tamsat v2 stands out due to its difficulties in following the annual cycle properly e g central underestimating the rainiest months at all sub basins and also overestimating drier periods especially over the northern portions i e at sangha and ubangi other particular basin characteristics and the performance diversities of both the satellite only and gauge adjusted products are clear considering the relative differences of each product compared to 3b42 v7 0 as reference in supplementary material fig s1 the overestimations found by satellite only products were relatively larger during the dry and dry to wet periods over kasai and luabala sub basins in this case during these periods at luabala the 3b42 ir v7 0 3b42rt uncal v7 0 and cmorph v1 0 raw products stand out for presenting the largest relative differences among all the sub basins with more than 300 200 and about 290 respectively an opposite behavior with negative relative differences in about 100 during the dry period at kasai and luabala sub basins was observed for the gauge adjusted satellite group with a slight exception 3b42rt v7 0 and cmorph v1 0 crt at luabala the regional tamsat v2 0 tamsat v3 0 and arc2 products in comparison to 3b42 v7 0 product tend to overestimate january s amounts of precipitation the dry period at sangha and ubangi which are consistent with the findings of ayehu et al 2018 for another african region it is worth mentioning that the performance and or agreement of certain satellite precipitation products in particular the native versions satellite only and those ones adjusted calibrated by rain gauges in representing the local and or regional precipitation regimes are extremely linked to the region of interest this is because the precipitation regimes are driven by multiple factors including the frequency and intensity of rainy non rainy days to its monthly totals as well as the contribution of a certain class of precipitation occurrences and the corroboration of moderate extreme and extreme events over tropical land regions roca 2019 these factors can be represented differently by satellite estimates and the differences are related to distinct aspects e g the product technique itself platform sources gauge adjustments systematic uncertainties among others the analyses were carried out by assessing the abilities of the satellite based products in representing regionally for the five congo watersheds the mean annual cycle of precipitation distributions which are controlled by the daily precipitation amount and occurrence contributions thus the annual cycle of precipitation biases is then a consequence of the representation of the precipitation intensities both in terms of occurrences and amounts gosset et al 2018 according to casse et al 2015 the ability to reproduce the frequency distribution of rain rates and their contribution to the rainfall total are important criteria for hydrological applications especially due to the impact of rainfall intensity for instance to the runoff to assess how the precipitation amounts and occurrences are distributed according to the intensity scale we looked at the cumulative density functions cdf of occurrence and volume amount of daily precipitation during the period from 2001 to 2012 over the five congo sub basins computed for each precipitation product satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted acquired from frogs database through the cdf analysis the relative contribution of each rain rate bin to the total rainfall volume and to the total number of occurrences can be assessed accordingly we consider a logarithmically spaced precipitation bins excluding the zeros non raining days the analysis is performed per watershed and satellite based precipitation product separated per satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted categories taking into account the entire period of sampling from 2001 to 2012 fig 4 shows the cumulative density functions of occurrence and volume amount of daily precipitation during the period from 2001 to 2012 over the five congo sub basins computed for each satellite precipitation product satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted acquired from frogs database through the overall cdf analyses it becomes more evident the differences between the two groups of satellite precipitation compared to the 3b42 v7 0 reference database it is also possible to note that even though the monthly totals are impacted differently these two distinct cdf distributions are preserved for all the five watersheds better agreements between all the satellite only products compared to the 3b42 v7 0 in both the occurrences and amounts of precipitation distributions were observed slight overestimations underestimations on the amounts occurrences and frequencies of rainfalls lower greater than 5 mm day 1 were observed from most of the satellite only products compared to 3b42 v7 0 however the arc2 and chirp v2 products presented opposite features especially at the luabala and the central basins respectively in contrast the group of gauge adjusted satellite precipitation products showed larger differences heterogeneities across all precipitation distribution ranges especially in the volume of precipitation frequencies e g up to 45 of frequency differences at precipitation intensities from 1 to 5 mm day 1 in parallel to the scattered frequency distributions on the rainfall occurrences an overestimation most prominent at rainfall intensities greater than 10 mm day 1 were observed from almost all the satellite gauge products in comparison to 3b42 v7 0 except for cmorph v1 0 crt at luabala and tamsat v2 at sangha and ubangi such characteristics suggest that the gauge inclusion and or adjustment techniques could directly impact quantitatively and qualitatively the daily precipitation distributions from low to larger intensities modifying its amount and occurrence frequencies 3 2 swat model performance 3 2 1 model calibration the model was calibrated at a monthly time step at the outlet of the four main drainage units as well as the principal crb outlet fig 1 table 3 summarizes the revised range of parameter values used in the calibration most of the parameters used to establish the model were groundwater parameters that have a strong influence on the water retention and transfer between the soil and aquifer these parameters are within the limits of physically meaningful values indicated by whittaker et al 2010 neitsch et al 2011 and pagliero et al 2014 for the swat model calibrated values for the canopy storage parameter canmx were defined for each crop canmx depends on the leaf area index of specific crops of which the evergreen forest has the highest value for the parameters ch n2 and ch n1 that control channel roughness we use the ranges recommended by chow 1959 3 2 2 model efficiency the simulated streamflow qsim matched the measured streamflow qobs and was synchronised with the variability in precipitation data for all gauge sites for both calibration and validation periods fig 5 and table 4 the nse r2 and kge values for the calibration and validation periods for ubangi bangui and sangha ouesso gauges suggest good model performance for kasai kutu moke and brazzaville kinshasa outlet gauges these values suggest acceptable model performance but for lualaba kisangani the model performance is less acceptable the ubangui and sangha basins mostly draining the northern hemisphere present few hydrological and hydraulic singularities thus it is not surprising that the conversion of rainfall into discharge is well performed by the model the lualaba sub basin presents many lakes and swamps including the tanganyika lake whose behavior was complicated to model due to the lack of hydraulic hydrological data e g volume of water stored surface area for these lakes pbias suggests a good fit between simulated and observed streamflow for all gauge sites however the pbias indicated an underestimation for the calibration period except for kasai kutu moke gauge and overestimation for the validation period with the exception of the brazzaville kinshasa outlet gauge table 5 fig 6 shows the relative error between qobs and qsim positive values indicate overestimated qsim and negative values indicate underestimated qsim for ubangi bangui sangha ouesso and kasai kutu moke the model in general overestimated low flows in qobs in the calibration and validation periods conversely for lualaba kisangani and brazzaville kinshasa outlet the model underestimated low flows periods the peak flow at brazzaville kinshasa outlet was underestimated while for other gauges the peak flow was slightly underestimated the overestimation of minimum values of qobs is linked to the lower baseflow and faster recession during the dry season this overestimation could not be corrected by an increase of baseflow recession constant because it would lead to overestimating streamflow during the beginning of the rainy season further details about the drainage sub basins and calibration and validation can be found in datok et al 2022 model performance results shown in this section depend on the design and assumptions of the swat model and represent one example of an application of this model in the crb the swat model was originally developed for temperate zones which means that input data and the calibration method needs to be improved for tropical basins wagner et al 2011 strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 dos santos et al 2018 different modifications have been made to the classic swat model including the addition of different variations of wetland and reservoir modules liu et al 2008 sun et al 2015 guilhen et al 2020 however they still have their shortcomings including the need for more data and a lack of a proper representation of physical processes phiri et al 2021 input variables that are associated with the wetlands include the surface areas and volumes of water at normal and overflowing as well as the fraction of the subbasin area draining into the wetland the absence of these data as well as the quality and resolution of the dem add to the uncertainties of the model the pbias however suggests a good fit between the simulations and observations the timing of flood events the bimodal pattern of rainfall over the basin wet and dry years and also the regularity of groundwater flow over the simulation period were well captured the results from the datok et al 2020 model also hint at a hydrological disconnect of the upper congo with the drainage basin due to the presence of natural reservoirs which cause significant lag this result is in conformity with the work of kitambo et al 2021 in which similar observations with respect to surface water extent and height were considered similar to the results from kitambo et al 2021 the datok et al 2022 model shows surface runoff start to increase around april to may and reach maximum levels from october november in the northern tributaries this result shows that inspite of the weak correlation in the lualaba basin much like in kitambo et al 2021 the results at the basin outlet at brazzaville kinshasa are not strongly influenced by this subbasin therefore the contribution of the upper congo to the discharge of flow and sediments to the basin outlet are negligible and since this particular region presents the highest level of uncertainty in our calibrated model it gives us a higher degree of confidence in our model outputs in addition there is a generally good agreement between simulation and observation of hydrological parameters like rainfall evapotranspiration seasonality and discharge in a majority of the model subbasins and less acceptable ones in other regions datok et al 2022 therefore this study adds to the argument that the benchmarks used for the performance metrics should be hydrologically meaningful and hence subjective by taking into account the objectives of the study the available observations and parameter values knoben et al 2019 3 3 hydrological evaluation 3 3 1 streamflow the hydrographs fig 7 indicate that the swat model follows the key features of the satellite precipitation products as the dry and wet season at the five gauge sites studied show thus it is possible to evaluate the performance of those products without recalibration it is expected however that the twenty two precipitation product inputs lead to different streamflow prediction than the 3b42 v7 0 base scenario at all five gauges in general and as expected the products without precipitation adjustments satellite only predicts higher streamflow however according to the results some satellite products behave differently for example cmorph v1 0 crt predicts higher streamflow at the gauge lualaba kisangani but in other gauges this product underestimated the streamflow statistical analysis fig 8 and the δ supplementary material table s2 demonstrated that the hydrological model driven by the precipitation products with precipitation adjustments satellite gauge performed better than those without precipitation adjustments as expected but trends between the products and differences between the regions are evident the kge and pbias indexes indicates some products can provide satisfactory performance at ubangi bangui lualaba kisangani and brazzaville kinshasa outlet without model recalibration fig 8 also highlights that the gpcp cdr v1 3 not enforced which is a satellite only product demonstrates a good performance kge 0 71 at ubangi bangui gauge when looking at the entire crb the worst scores were obtained by 3b42rt uncal v7 0 and cmorph v1 0 raw satellite only products it is evidenced by fig 8 that while some satellite only products tend to lead to higher streamflow predictions such as cmorph v1 0 raw and 3b42rt uncal v7 0 others as 3b42 ir v7 0 and 3b42 mw v7 0 tend to lead to lower streamflows in particularl at sangha ouesso and ubangi bangui dry regions of crb the regional products tamsat v2 0 v3 0 and arc2 did not perform well in estimating streamflow when compared to quasi global products such as the imerg v6 0 fc or land only products like the chirps v2 0 although arc2 performed better than the other regional products it still underestimated the streamflow at four gauge stations the near real time nrt precipitation products important for now casting and forecasting streamflow in applications such as early warning systems such as imerg v6 0 eu and imerg v6 0 lu did not provide a good prediction of streamflow showing a consequent overestimation at all gauges among the nrt products only 3b42rt v7 0 had a good performance at the ubangi bangui stations and brazzaville kinshasa outlet and kasai kutu moke the pbias indicates a good performance when compared to the base scenario maybe due to the similarities with the product used in our base scenario in general the monthly streamflow simulation results and the statistical scores from imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 presented consistent streamflow simulations except for kasai kutu moke and sangha ouesso gauges studies as tan et al 2018 and amorim et al 2020 have shown the better performance of imerg products to estimate streamflow all around the world in comparison to tmpa products due to its improvement in precipitation estimation in our case the recalibration of model parameters for imerg products could improve streamflow simulations specifically at the gauge stations where 3b42 v7 0 did not perform well 3 3 2 water balance components to better understand the influence of the different precipitation products in predicting the water balance components wbc utilizing the swat model we analyzed the monthly cycle of evapotranspiration et surface runoff surq lateral flow latq percolation perc soil water content sw groundwater contribution to streamflow gwq and water yield wyld simulated at the sub basin scale the results show that the satellite only products tend to overestimate the wbc especially in the rainy season however the level of overestimation and underestimation depends on the type of wbc and the region in the crb for et predictions fig 9 the precipitation products have the tendency to overestimate in both dry and wet seasons when compared to 3b42 v7 0 although some track et much more closely than others the cmorph v1 0 raw and gsmap gauges rnl v6 0 have the tendency to underestimate this component peak basin wide et during march is overestimated for almost all products while the basin s low at june july and august is underestimated at lualaba and overestimated at other regions at ubangi most of the precipitation products capture the same tendency of 3b42 v7 0 between june to february overall the global et prediction is overestimated at all sub basins in supplementary material table s3 the surq fig 10 latq and perc supplementary material figs s4 and s5 predictions which are intrinsically linked to the amount and dynamics of precipitation are similar for the dry season at kasai ubangi and sangha sub basins however none of the products capture the full amplitude of fluctuations across seasons at the central and lualaba sub basins the predictions are overestimated even in the dry season for the wet season the satellite precipitation products have the tendency to overestimate these components in regards to 3b42 v7 0 at five regions kasai and lualaba sub basins presenting one large peak of surq lat and perc between november to march sangha and ubangi have one peak around august september while the central region has two peaks the first around march april and the second during october november these peaks are overestimated and some products as tamsat v3 0 and arc2 do not follow the same seasonal shape of 3b42 v7 0 in general the global surq latq and perc in supplementary material table s3 are overestimated although some track much more closely than others especially in the dry season the sw fig 11 and gwq supplementary material fig s6 predictions which refers to water stored in soil demonstrate a wide range of simulated values particularly for gwq hence overestimateing these components for both satellite only and satellite gauge with respect to 3b42 v7 0 for sw the precipitation products generally follow the seasonal shape except some products as cmorph v1 0 raw and gsmap gauges rnl v6 0 although none of them capture the full amplitude of fluctuations across seasons the tracks are closer than others for sw in the dry season at lualaba and ubangi but for central kasai and sangha the tracks are scattered the seasonal cycle of gwq does not present a large fluctuation across seasons but the tracks are scattered at all regions studied this behaviour could be linked to the swat model because the model simulates groundwater using the two way groundwater surface water exchange which limits the ability to predict groundwater storage shao et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 also the surface water groundwater interaction mechanisms are less studied than other wbc in the congo basin alsdorf et al 2016 the wyld supplementary material figures s6 predictions consisting of surface runoff groundwater flow tile flow transmission loss are also overestimated compared to 3b42 v7 0 the peak flows have the same characteristic of surq at all regions with two peaks at the central kasai and lualaba however peak shapes of some precipitation products are wider than the peak of 3b42 v7 0 similar to the gwq the wyld tracks are scattered at all sub basins overall the trends between the precipitation products and differences between the regions affects the wbc the δ supplementary material table s3 showed that even a small increase or decrease of amounts of precipitation would cause increase or decrease in the wbc especially the components that are dependent on the dynamics of precipitation as surface runoff and percolation however some precipitation products behave differently for example in most of the analyzed products an increase in amount of precipitation leads to an increase in the values of the wbc but cmorph v1 0 crt shows a decrease of amount of precipitation then an increase in surface runoff values at the central kasai and sangha that leads to a decrease of percolation several possible causes could lead to these results the hydrological response of the wbc is linked to precipitation and design and assumptions of the model to type of vegetation topography and soil it is expected that in forest areas there will be less surface runoff than in pasture areas for example soil degradation will also lead to an increase of runoff 3 4 influence of the precipitation input on model performance to compare the hydrological performance of the satellite based precipitation products using the swat model we summarized some recent hydrological evaluation studies around the world in table 4 tuo et al 2016 tan et al 2018 amorim et al 2020 sharannya et al 2020 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 four main conclusions can be drawn from the comparisons i in many cases the imerg v6 0 fc outperforms 3b42 v7 0 in hydrological simulations due to its improvement in precipitation estimation ii the performance of the satellite based precipitation products depends on the basin localization and simulations scale daily or monthly iii hydrological model choice will affect the accuracy assessment of precipitation products for detecting streamflow extremes and iv the recalibration of the model parameters for each satellite based precipitation product effectively improved the precision of streamflow simulations as shown in the hydrological evaluation section the imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 products demonstrates good performance without recalibration and could be used to study the hydrological cycle in the crb especially for streamflow and evapotranspiration these results agree with the findings reported in table 4 and a recalibration of the model parameters could effectively improve the precision of satellite based precipitation product simulations especially for wbc that are connected to the amount and dynamics of precipitation as surq latq and perc nevertheless the bias in satellite based precipitation products was recognized as a major issue across several basins around the world maggioni and massari 2018 and the inaccuracy of satellite data may lead to unrealistic parameter values when recalibrating the model peng et al 2021 maggioni and massari 2018 have shown that model recalibration was also raised as a viable option to improve streamflow simulations from satellite based precipitation products but caution is necessary when recalibrating models another option is the bias correction of the satellite products with ground based measurements of precipitation to obtain more realistic flow simulations wang et al 2021 crb model calibration was based on a trial and error basis see above we ran the model several times using parameters calculated either from known physical information about the basin or from information obtained from literature and global datasets we tried as much as possible to fix the parameters to be as realistic as possible there is a chance that some of the hydrological behaviours of the system were not captured accurately datok et al 2022 it is possible that the model recalibration for each precipitation product could improve the results especially for streamflow however tmpa 3b42 v 7 reference subset tends to underestimate rainfall in the crb beighley et al 2011 munzimi et al 2015 the precipitations products analyzed is this study largely tend to overestimate the rainfall in the crb fig 3 which could lead to unrealistic parameters especially those associated with the movement and storage of groundwater and also the runoff numerous researchers have examined the quality of satellite derived precipitation datasets through hydrological modelling e g beck et al 2017 dembélé et al 2020 beighley et al 2011 analyzed the trmm cmorph and persiann dataset through the hillslope river routing hrr model in the crb to predict streamflow and water storages and some of their results are similar to ours notably cmorph tends to overestimate magnitudes and trmm shows reasonable agreement relative to the historical observations however persiann performed better in capturing the pattern of streamflow in the swat model having a performance close to 3b42 v7 0 trmm supplementary material tables s2 and s3 the different results may be linked to the design and assumptions of these two models or the persiann bias correction carried out in recent years satellites estimate appear not to perform well over the crb mccollum et al 2000 awange et al 2016 and there are large discrepancies between gauge based products from gpcc global precipitation climatology centre cmap cpc merged analysis of precipitation gpcp global precipitation climatology project and cpc climate prediction center in the interannual and decadal variations in precipitation over the basin negron juarez et al 2009 the lack of a dense and reliable network of rain gauges makes it impossible to assess quantitatively the rainfall products against a proper ground validation reference in addition for the long term mean gpcp and cmap display the major precipitation patterns although substantial discrepancies occur in areas with low gauge densities such as equatorial west africa yin et al 2004 however independent of these discrepancies our findings show that the imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 are potential alternative sources of data for hydrological modeling using swat in the crb 4 conclusions the present work investigated the performances of 23 satellite based precipitation products table 1 in simulating streamflow and water balance components at the congo river basin through the swat model the key findings are as follows the precipitation products were able to represent with consistency the annual cycle of rainfall and the frequencies of rain intensities occurrences over each sub basin studied however the precipitation amounts during the year are different especially due to high precipitation intensities in the absence of a reliable dense ground validation network the gauge adjusted version of 3b42 v7 0 which has been shown to provide good simulations of the discharge through the swat model was taken as a benchmark to analyze the skills of other precipitation products overall the group of satellite only precipitation products mostly overestimates the rainy season peaks and the gauge adjusted satellite products presented better agreements between each other and compared to 3b42 v7 0 except for gsmap gauges rnlv6 0 and cmorph v1 0 crt streamflow and water balance components simulation replicate precipitation products patterns and gauge adjusted satellite performed better than satellite only for streamflow in addition during the rainy season the precipitation products have the tendency to overestimate the surq latq and perc in regards to 3b42 v7 0 over the congo basin for other components et sw gwq and wyld and streamflow predictions there is an overestimation at all sub basins however imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 products demonstrate good performance with our model and could be used to predict the hydrological cycle in general the selection of precipitation products has a crucial effect on model performance and has to be taken into consideration since it is one of the sources of uncertainties unfortunately the congo river basin is deprived of a quality and dense rain gauge network for assessing these uncertainties more quantitatively using the hydrological model with an ensemble of available products provides a good illustration of the impact of the uncertainties and can be used to filter out the products which behave like outliers and or to indicate the confidence in the simulated hydrological variables the combination of bias correction of the satellite products with ground based measurements and recalibration of the model parameters could effectively improve predictions of the hydrological cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

7939,study region congo river basin study focus precipitation is the major driving force of hydrological processes and is one of the main input datasets for hydrological models the congo river basin is one of the least studied major river basins in the world and suffers from the scarcity and difficulty in accessing rain gauge data necessitating the use of satellite precipitation estimates for hydrological studies in this study we have made a comprehensive comparison of different satellite based precipitation products inputs for a hydrological model in the congo river basin new hydrological insight for this region our findings showed that the products based on satellite only source tend to overestimate the rainy season peaks in comparison with the 3b42 v7 product on the other hand the satellite products that consider gauge calibration presented better agreements between each other the hydrological model was able to reproduce the general precipitation products characteristics while the gauge adjusted satellite products performed better than those without gauge adjustments overall precipitation patterns have a crucial effect on the model s performance and leads to different streamflow and water balance components values the choice of rainfall product has a significant importance in the interpretation of the simulated hydrological cycle keywords precipitation satellite observations frogs swat model congo river basin 1 introduction hydrological models are frequently used as practical tools to assess and to predict the impacts of anthropogenic activities on water resources and also assist in their management or create a basis for decision making on sustainable development alternatives and conservation practices abbaspour et al 2015 loucks and beek 2017 however these models require distributed meteorological information precipitation temperature wind speed etc which is a great challenge in large and poorly gauged areas such as tropical regions precipitation is one of the main parameters for hydrological models but its estimation is still very difficult because of its strong spatio temporal heterogeneity beck et al 2016 there are three ways of measuring precipitation over a basin i conventional instrumentation using networks of rain or snow meters ii ground based weather radar and iii satellite measurement nevertheless despite the accuracy of estimates from conventional instrumentation and weather radar the distribution and density of these methods are highly variable another issue with these methods is the completeness and consistency of the historical data series as well as the availability for near real time analysis kidd and levizzani 2011 sun et al 2017 the precipitation data obtained by satellite is an alternative in regions where data is scarce with a large number of free products available with high spatial and temporal resolution that can fill historical gaps and complement or replace in situ stations kidd et al 2017 with the advent of the satellite tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 from late 1997 2014 transitioning with the launch of the global precipitation measurement gpm hou et al 2014 skofronick jackson et al 2017 a mission that is actually operating in conjunction with other passive microwave platforms the performance of satellite precipitation estimates has significantly evolved along the years numerous satellite based precipitation products with different characteristics i e spatial temporal among others have since then been developed and improved for distinct application purposes such as for climatological hydrological agricultural and monitoring studies numerous observational daily precipitation products including satellite estimates are now available in a common 1 x1 grid format through the frequent rainfall observations on grids frogs database roca et al 2019 frogs database enables easier intercomparisons and applications based on the selection of a single to multiple products considering their category i e satellite only gauge adjusted satellite estimates among others nonetheless the estimation of satellite precipitation data is not wholly reliable due to the uncertainties arising from measurement errors associated with observations sampling recovery algorithms and bias correction processes that leads to systematic and random errors roca et al 2010 oliveira et al 2016 beck et al 2016 beck et al 2017 sun et al 2017 tropical forests including the congo river basin crb strongly influence both the regional and global climate storing large carbon stocks and regulating energy and water cycles in this sense any changes in the structure of these ecosystems such as those caused by deforestation can create positive feedbacks and increase climate change trends the crb in central africa is the second largest river basin in the world and supports one of earth s three major humid tropical forest regions alsdorf et al 2016 it contains about 70 of africa s forest cover of the congo basin s 530 million hectares of land 300 million are covered by forest almost 99 of the forested area is primary or naturally regenerated forest as opposed to plantations and 46 is lowland dense forest the average annual precipitation is around 1500 2000 mm of precipitation per year and is the most convectively active region of the world dezfuli 2017 almost 60 of precipitation occurs during the wet seasons and the basin wide average seasonal cycle has two precipitation peaks one in march and the other in november hua et al 2019 crowhurst et al 2021 this basin is currently an object of concern because of evidence of a significant multidecadal drying trend one of the most significant worldwide zhou et al 2014 harris et al 2017 despite the important role in the tropical climate system the crb is plagued by a scarcity of precipitation ground data especially after the early 1990 s this scarcity of data is primarily because the meteorological services of both angola and the democratic republic of the congo countries that include most of the congo rain forest essentially ceased to function for decades and have been slow to rebuild their services alsdorf et al 2016 the lack of in situ data leads most hydrological studies in the congo basin to depend on satellite precipitation estimates beighley et al 2011 assessed the applicability of satellite precipitation estimates in terrestrial rainfall runoff modelling in the crb where three sources products of rainfall data were applied to the hillslope river routing hrr model although large variability among the products were found especially in the equatorial regions of the crb the trmm 3b42 product which is a gauge adjusted product provided the best spatial and temporal distributions however the cause and potential solutions to the detected variability were not discussed by beighley et al 2011 on the other hand aloysius and saiers 2017 in a climate projection context via rainfall runoff model application made use of 25 global climate models gcms to explore the variability in modeled runoff in two subsequent periods near future 2016 2035 and mid century 2046 2065 and under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios aloysius and saiers 2017 also revealed the importance of long term and spatially explicit dataset for characterizing hydrologic response in minimizing the uncertainty that vary widely by region within the crb being crucial for both observational and projection studies this study aims to 1 exploit the precipitation distributions and variability characteristics among the 23 gridded satellite based precipitation products over the crb during the period from 2001 to 2012 the regional performance evaluations are categorized according to their input data sources satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted which leads to an unprecedented assessment over the region that can provides important feedback to both the algorithm developers and science community on the support for instance of the climate hydrological and agricultural monitoring and research in addition this study aims to analyze 2 the impact of these precipitation products inputs in a hydrological model swat soil water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and investigate the potential behaviors of these different precipitation inputs in describing hydrologic processes although several hydrological models have been applied in the crb e g beighley et al 2011 tshimanga and hughes 2014 we considered the swat model because apart from its capability of simulating the water balance and storages in different compartments it has demonstrated its flexibility for being appllied in several regions of the world e g tuo et al 2016 sharannya et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in africa e g akoko et al 2021 and in the congo basin aloysius et al 2017 this study will also contribute to the debate on the performance of satellite precipitation estimates in areas which lack in situ gauge measurements additionally the utilization of a single product or an ensemble of products in which the product characteristics are considered as well as the precipitation product most appropriate in representing the regional precipitation distributions can be considered as subject of debate in multiple aspects e g algorithm developments research and monitoring applications the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 we describe the study area the precipitation database and the methodology section 3 provides an assessment and discussion of the selected precipitation products which are subsequently applied through the swat model and which are exploited in the same section finally the conclusions are presented in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the intracratonic depression in central africa called the crb fig 1 is situated between latitudes 9 n and 14 s and longitudes 11 e and 34 e it covers an area of approximately 3 7 million km2 including most of the democratic republic of congo drc formerly zaire the people s republic of congo roc and the central african republic car elevations within the basin are 3000 m above sea level m asl in the eastern highlands and less than 300 m asl in the center of the basin runge 2007 the physiography of the crb varies and consists of the northern peneplains of bushy wooded savanna with tropical humid climate bultot 1971 the middle basin includes the dense and heavily forested swamp forest of the cuvette centrale and the sandy sandstone formations of the batékés plateaux of between 350 and 930 m altitude covered by bushy savanna laraque et al 2001 mean annual rainfall is 2000 mm y 1 in the central basin decreasing northward to southward to 1100 mm y 1 alsdorf et al 2016 the basic rainfall pattern across the basin is thought to be due to the bi annual passage of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz across the basin the itcz over africa is acknowledged as the location where the dry northeasterly harmattan meets the moist southerly flow of the monsoon and a major control on tropical rainfall recent evidence concerning the latitudinal progression of the equatorial rainy season however suggests that this view of the itcz may be challenged jackson et al 2009 nicholson et al 2019 rainfall across the basin occurs with a seasonal peak in precipitation from december to march in areas of the southern hemisphere with northern hemisphere basins having theirs within july to october moukandi n kaya et al 2021 annual extremes of precipitation in the equatorial regions are in april and october while sharp precipitation gradients which may result in spurious trends are noticed in the south eastern parts of the basin yin and gruber 2010 tshimanga et al 2012 2 2 satellite based precipitation datasets twenty three precipitation products with a common period from 2001 to 2012 except 3b42 v7 0 period from 1998 to 2012 were selected for this study table 1 these datasets were acquired from the frequent rainfall observations on grids frogs database roca et al 2019 frogs is composed of several quasi global and regional daily precipitation products with a common spatial resolution of 1 1 although frogs database includes satellites ground based and reanalysis products only the satellite based category was considered for this study the satellite based precipitation products which differ from each other in multiple aspects e g satellite source with or without gauge adjustments among others are here sub divided into two main groups i the satellite only and ii the gauge calibrated satellite these products are retrieved utilizing infrared ir observations from geostationary satellites and or passive microwave observations from multiple or single low elevation orbiting leo satellites the gauge based calibration step is distinctly applied to those satellite precipitation products these adjustments are climatological on a monthly or daily time step and take into consideration in situ observations from the global telecommunication system gts or other gauged based precipitation products e g gpcc table 1 shows the satellite based precipitation products selected for this study and their main characteristics frogs database is freely available from ftp ftp climserv ipsl polytechnique fr frogs see roca et al 2019 for a detailed description of each product 2 3 swat model the soil water assessment tool is a continuous time spatially distributed hydrological basin scale model that simulates water sediment nutrient chemical and bacterial transport in a basin resulting from the interactions among weather condition soil properties stream channel characteristics vegetation and crop growth as well as land management practices the model calculates pollutant loads from various non point and point sources arnold et al 1998 fundamentally the model is hydrologically driven based upon the water balance of an individual landscape unit 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r dayi q surfi e ai w seepi q gwi where swt is the final soil water content mm h2o sw0 is the initial soil water content mm h2o t is time days rdayi is precipitation on day i mm h2o qsurfi is surface runoff on day i mm h2o eai is evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o wseepi is the amount of water from the soil profile inflowing to the vadose zone on day i mm h2o and qgwi is the base flow on day i mm h2o 2 3 1 model setup swat2012 version winchell et al 2013 was setup for the crb using the datasets listed in table 2 the basin was delineated based on the dominant land use soil and slope classes taking into cognizance the size and spatial heterogeneity of the basin allocating one hydrologic response unit hru per subbasin resulting in 272 subbasins and hrus the period of simulation was from 1998 to 2012 comprising calibration 2000 2006 validation 2006 2012 and a two year warm up period 1998 2000 lakes wetlands and reservoirs were setup in swat model the reservoirs were parameterized based on available information and assuming that no management system was in place in the swat model the evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith method the penman monteith method also gave better estimates of evapotranspiration when used with the plant growth modification of strauch and volk 2013 the plant growth module was used since the swat model simulates plant growth based on dormancy during the winter season for the reinitiation of the growing season for perennial plants and this process is not a valid growing pattern in the tropics the surface runoff was calculated using the soil conservation service s curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 and the variable storage method williams 1969 was used for channel routing 2 3 1 1 wetland the choice of model is explained in datok et al 2022 but in order to further emphasise the assumptions made in this study it is important to underline that the level of complexity and types quality of data needed for the model datok et al 2022 informed the choice of the model the main assumption made was to treat the central wetland area as a blackbox thus creating a deterministic model that may not take into account all physical processes the swat model is a process based model simulating both upland and channel processes the land phase is solved at hru level in which the hydrologic cycle controls the amount of water sediment nutrient and pesticide loadings to the main channel and ii a stream phase solved at reach level where water sediments and nutrients move through the channels of the watershed to the outlet being semi distributed the internal variables of the model are adjusted based on a combination of unit cells whose location is not precisely located since small scale spatial differences were not needed we relied on basin scale or regional parameters to calibrate the model wetlands and depressions are located in subbasins off the main channel thus water that flows into them must originate from the subbasin they are located for reservoirs they are located on the main channels thereby trapping all flow from upstream subbasins neitsch et al 2011 in our model the watershed was partitioned into 272 subbasins where an unequal number of subbasins drained to each of the four principal gauging stations while the entire watershed drained into the main gauging outlet at brazzaville kinshasa since the 272 subbasins had an equal number of hrus for reasons given in datok et al 2022 it meant that the hydrological effects of the wetlands are proportionally distributed within the respective hrus thus the model offers future promise as the availability of observations in any one of the wetland subbasins will seriously improve the model calibration the water balance for the wetland in swat is given as follows 2 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep where v is the volume of water in impoundment at the end of the day m3 h2o vstored is the volume of water at the beginning of the day m3 h2o vflowin is the volume of water entering the wetland during the day m3 h2o vflowout is the volume of water flowing out of the wetland during the day m3 h2o vpcp is the volume of precipitation falling on the wetland during the day m3 h2o vevap is the volume of water removed from the wetland during the day m3 h2o and vseep is the volume of water lost from the wetland during the day m3 h2o in calculating the inflows into the wetlands swat subtracts the volume of water entering the wetland from the surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater loadings to the main channel on the other hand the wetland releases water whenever the water volume exceeds the normal storage volume 3 v flowout 0 ifv v nor where vnor is the volume of water held in wetland when filled to the normal water level m3 h2o neitsch et al 2011 2 3 1 2 3b42 v 7 reference database swat model was setup with daily precipitation estimates by the tmpa 3b42 v 7 product from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm afterward 3b42 the 3b42 v 7 provides rainfall estimates at a 3 h temporal resolution and 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution daily grids that spans nearly three decades 1998 today the quality of the tmpa 3b42 product has been assessed for several tropical regions some of them focusing on the crb munzimi et al 2015 and 2019 washington et al 2013 studies such as munzini et al 2015 demonstrate that despite some of the limitations in validating satellite based products the 3b42 v 7 is consistent in the depiction of intra annual variation in crb we chose the 3b42 v 7 instead of the gauge stations to set up the swat model firstly because there is a low gauge density across the crb munzimi et al 2015 kabuya et al 2020 and secondly the gaps or missing data after the 80 s samba et al 2008 and nicholson et al 2019 spatial and temporal rainfall data scarcity has a large impact on general and extreme streamflow simulations tan and yang 2020 as well this scarcity would lead to errors in trend analysis in this context 3b42 v 7 was more suitable to be used as input for swat model 2 3 2 model calibration model calibration was based on the optimization of the parameter values by adjusting the simulated streamflow qsim to observed streamflow qobs at a monthly time step the observed data from the five gauging stations fig 1 are located on major tributaries of the crb two on the northern side of the basin ubangui at bangui and sangha at ouesso two others on the southern side lualaba at kisangani and kutu moke at kasai and the fifth station is located at the brazzaville kinshasa gauging station that controls 98 of the entire basin the common period of calibration and validation for the stations was taken as the years 2000 2012 table 2 in the model set up used the simulated streamflow was adjusted to the observed streamflow by manual calibration trial and error this method follows the simple approach of manual adjustment of uncertain or unknown parameters and the comparison of predictions with measured values relying on human judgment to attain the best fit for model parameters moradkhani and sorooshian 2008 the model parameterization was done by adjusting influential parameters firstly parameters which are generally sensitive such as groundwater related parameters secondly parameters related to runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration table 3 the parameters were regionalized according to the characteristics of the subbasins further details of the calibration and validation procedures can be found in datok et al 2022 for the evaluation of model performance we used the nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse that measures the magnitude of residual variance compared to observed variance moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination r2 that describes the degree of linear relationship between observed and simulated streamflow and percent bias pbias which evaluates the average tendency of the magnitude of simulated values in relation to the observed ones the kling gupta efficiency kge by gupta et al 2009 is a decomposition of the nse and mean squared error kge facilitates the analysis of relative importance of correlation bias and variability in hydrologic modeling kge hydrogof 2017 for streamflow moriasi et al 2015 proposed nse values 0 50 r2 0 60 and pbias 25 to be a satisfactory level for monthly scales a kge value 0 50 is also considered satisfactory gupta et al 2009 2 4 evaluation of the performance of precipitation datasets using swat model the swat model was run for twenty three scenarios based on the precipitation products described in table 1 the base scenario is based on the 3b42 v7 0 product and it was calibrated with observed streamflow see above the other precipitation scenarios were run using identical datasets see table 1 so that variations in streamflow and other hydrological components were uniquely attributable to precipitation for the evaluation of the performance of precipitation datasets we used kge and pbias objective functions calculated using the streamflow of base scenario 3b42 v7 0 as reference 3 results and discussion precipitation regimes over the crb are firstly assessed through the 23 satellite based precipitation products during the period from 2001 to 2012 secondly the model calibration and validation are performed for the period from 1998 to 2012 two years of warm up for the model afterwards hydrological evolution streamflow and water balance components through the 23 precipitation products during 2003 2012 two years of warn up are assessed finally we discuss the influence of the precipitation input on model performance when the model has been pre calibrated with one of the products here 3b42 3 1 comparison of the different precipitation datasets satellite precipitation estimates through different gridded products has been constantly evaluated and assessed across west africa considering gauged precipitation observations as a reference e g gosset et al 2018 nicholson et al 2019 satgé et al 2020 the reliability of satellite precipitation estimates depends on several factors e g seasonality the gauge network densities and can vary in space and time the precipitation regime i e seasonality over the crb varies regionally e g munzimi et al 2015 spatially there are remarkable characteristics on the precipitation distribution over crb which are demonstrated through the unconditional annual mean and the 99th percentile fig 2 the central region of the crb and the northern portion of the luabala sub basin experience the largest amounts of precipitation with about 7 and 10 mm day 1 respectively nevertheless the lualaba also showed the largest regional contrast of precipitation amounts with most of the watershed area presenting precipitation mean lower than 3 mm day 1 these spatial characteristics were directly linked to the extreme precipitation occurrences represented by the 99th percentile strongly influenced by the surface type i e orographic conditions where the highest values 50 mm day 1 were found mainly across the wetland zones and over the northwest part of lualaba fig 3 depicts the annual cycle of precipitation through the monthly accumulated mean distributions from all the selected satellite based precipitation products over the five crb sub basins during the period from 2001 to 2012 the contrasts between the satellite only and satellite gauged adjusted precipitation are assessed considering the 3b42 v7 0 product as baseline overall three different precipitation regimes which were associated with the geographic characteristics were observed across the five sub basins of the congo which is in agreement with previous findings based on both the satellite and rain gauge data e g munzimi et al 2015 i kasai and luabala located in the southernmost portion presenting a well defined dry wet period with the maximum minimum from november to march between june and august ii sangha and ubangi in the northern portions presents a prolonged rainy period peak of maximums around august september and a short term dry season december and january and iii the central part which is characterized by a less well defined monsoonal regime with a dry period less pronounced and two rainy peaks the first around march and the second during october november although all the satellite precipitation products were able to successfully represent the annual cycle of rainfall over each watershed under study notable differences along the year on the magnitudes of the precipitation amounts were observed overall two remarkable performance characteristics were noted the group of satellite only products mostly overestimates the rainy seasons peaks compared to the rest of the products in particular the cmorph v1 0 raw 3b42rt uncal v7 0 followed by imerg v06 eu and imerg v06 lu products stand out for presenting the highest peaks especially during the rainy seasons systematically for all the five sub basins for instance cmorph v1 0 raw overestimates about 100 mm month in comparison to the rest of the products at most of the sub basins on the other hand the group of gauge adjusted satellite products presented better agreements between each other and compared to 3b42 v7 0 except for gsmap gauges rnlv6 0 and cmorph v1 0 crt which exhibited opposite performances to its satellite only versions underestimating the monthly totals during a greater part of the year for all the five sub basins in addition tamsat v2 stands out due to its difficulties in following the annual cycle properly e g central underestimating the rainiest months at all sub basins and also overestimating drier periods especially over the northern portions i e at sangha and ubangi other particular basin characteristics and the performance diversities of both the satellite only and gauge adjusted products are clear considering the relative differences of each product compared to 3b42 v7 0 as reference in supplementary material fig s1 the overestimations found by satellite only products were relatively larger during the dry and dry to wet periods over kasai and luabala sub basins in this case during these periods at luabala the 3b42 ir v7 0 3b42rt uncal v7 0 and cmorph v1 0 raw products stand out for presenting the largest relative differences among all the sub basins with more than 300 200 and about 290 respectively an opposite behavior with negative relative differences in about 100 during the dry period at kasai and luabala sub basins was observed for the gauge adjusted satellite group with a slight exception 3b42rt v7 0 and cmorph v1 0 crt at luabala the regional tamsat v2 0 tamsat v3 0 and arc2 products in comparison to 3b42 v7 0 product tend to overestimate january s amounts of precipitation the dry period at sangha and ubangi which are consistent with the findings of ayehu et al 2018 for another african region it is worth mentioning that the performance and or agreement of certain satellite precipitation products in particular the native versions satellite only and those ones adjusted calibrated by rain gauges in representing the local and or regional precipitation regimes are extremely linked to the region of interest this is because the precipitation regimes are driven by multiple factors including the frequency and intensity of rainy non rainy days to its monthly totals as well as the contribution of a certain class of precipitation occurrences and the corroboration of moderate extreme and extreme events over tropical land regions roca 2019 these factors can be represented differently by satellite estimates and the differences are related to distinct aspects e g the product technique itself platform sources gauge adjustments systematic uncertainties among others the analyses were carried out by assessing the abilities of the satellite based products in representing regionally for the five congo watersheds the mean annual cycle of precipitation distributions which are controlled by the daily precipitation amount and occurrence contributions thus the annual cycle of precipitation biases is then a consequence of the representation of the precipitation intensities both in terms of occurrences and amounts gosset et al 2018 according to casse et al 2015 the ability to reproduce the frequency distribution of rain rates and their contribution to the rainfall total are important criteria for hydrological applications especially due to the impact of rainfall intensity for instance to the runoff to assess how the precipitation amounts and occurrences are distributed according to the intensity scale we looked at the cumulative density functions cdf of occurrence and volume amount of daily precipitation during the period from 2001 to 2012 over the five congo sub basins computed for each precipitation product satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted acquired from frogs database through the cdf analysis the relative contribution of each rain rate bin to the total rainfall volume and to the total number of occurrences can be assessed accordingly we consider a logarithmically spaced precipitation bins excluding the zeros non raining days the analysis is performed per watershed and satellite based precipitation product separated per satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted categories taking into account the entire period of sampling from 2001 to 2012 fig 4 shows the cumulative density functions of occurrence and volume amount of daily precipitation during the period from 2001 to 2012 over the five congo sub basins computed for each satellite precipitation product satellite only and satellite gauge adjusted acquired from frogs database through the overall cdf analyses it becomes more evident the differences between the two groups of satellite precipitation compared to the 3b42 v7 0 reference database it is also possible to note that even though the monthly totals are impacted differently these two distinct cdf distributions are preserved for all the five watersheds better agreements between all the satellite only products compared to the 3b42 v7 0 in both the occurrences and amounts of precipitation distributions were observed slight overestimations underestimations on the amounts occurrences and frequencies of rainfalls lower greater than 5 mm day 1 were observed from most of the satellite only products compared to 3b42 v7 0 however the arc2 and chirp v2 products presented opposite features especially at the luabala and the central basins respectively in contrast the group of gauge adjusted satellite precipitation products showed larger differences heterogeneities across all precipitation distribution ranges especially in the volume of precipitation frequencies e g up to 45 of frequency differences at precipitation intensities from 1 to 5 mm day 1 in parallel to the scattered frequency distributions on the rainfall occurrences an overestimation most prominent at rainfall intensities greater than 10 mm day 1 were observed from almost all the satellite gauge products in comparison to 3b42 v7 0 except for cmorph v1 0 crt at luabala and tamsat v2 at sangha and ubangi such characteristics suggest that the gauge inclusion and or adjustment techniques could directly impact quantitatively and qualitatively the daily precipitation distributions from low to larger intensities modifying its amount and occurrence frequencies 3 2 swat model performance 3 2 1 model calibration the model was calibrated at a monthly time step at the outlet of the four main drainage units as well as the principal crb outlet fig 1 table 3 summarizes the revised range of parameter values used in the calibration most of the parameters used to establish the model were groundwater parameters that have a strong influence on the water retention and transfer between the soil and aquifer these parameters are within the limits of physically meaningful values indicated by whittaker et al 2010 neitsch et al 2011 and pagliero et al 2014 for the swat model calibrated values for the canopy storage parameter canmx were defined for each crop canmx depends on the leaf area index of specific crops of which the evergreen forest has the highest value for the parameters ch n2 and ch n1 that control channel roughness we use the ranges recommended by chow 1959 3 2 2 model efficiency the simulated streamflow qsim matched the measured streamflow qobs and was synchronised with the variability in precipitation data for all gauge sites for both calibration and validation periods fig 5 and table 4 the nse r2 and kge values for the calibration and validation periods for ubangi bangui and sangha ouesso gauges suggest good model performance for kasai kutu moke and brazzaville kinshasa outlet gauges these values suggest acceptable model performance but for lualaba kisangani the model performance is less acceptable the ubangui and sangha basins mostly draining the northern hemisphere present few hydrological and hydraulic singularities thus it is not surprising that the conversion of rainfall into discharge is well performed by the model the lualaba sub basin presents many lakes and swamps including the tanganyika lake whose behavior was complicated to model due to the lack of hydraulic hydrological data e g volume of water stored surface area for these lakes pbias suggests a good fit between simulated and observed streamflow for all gauge sites however the pbias indicated an underestimation for the calibration period except for kasai kutu moke gauge and overestimation for the validation period with the exception of the brazzaville kinshasa outlet gauge table 5 fig 6 shows the relative error between qobs and qsim positive values indicate overestimated qsim and negative values indicate underestimated qsim for ubangi bangui sangha ouesso and kasai kutu moke the model in general overestimated low flows in qobs in the calibration and validation periods conversely for lualaba kisangani and brazzaville kinshasa outlet the model underestimated low flows periods the peak flow at brazzaville kinshasa outlet was underestimated while for other gauges the peak flow was slightly underestimated the overestimation of minimum values of qobs is linked to the lower baseflow and faster recession during the dry season this overestimation could not be corrected by an increase of baseflow recession constant because it would lead to overestimating streamflow during the beginning of the rainy season further details about the drainage sub basins and calibration and validation can be found in datok et al 2022 model performance results shown in this section depend on the design and assumptions of the swat model and represent one example of an application of this model in the crb the swat model was originally developed for temperate zones which means that input data and the calibration method needs to be improved for tropical basins wagner et al 2011 strauch and volk 2013 alemayehu et al 2017 dos santos et al 2018 different modifications have been made to the classic swat model including the addition of different variations of wetland and reservoir modules liu et al 2008 sun et al 2015 guilhen et al 2020 however they still have their shortcomings including the need for more data and a lack of a proper representation of physical processes phiri et al 2021 input variables that are associated with the wetlands include the surface areas and volumes of water at normal and overflowing as well as the fraction of the subbasin area draining into the wetland the absence of these data as well as the quality and resolution of the dem add to the uncertainties of the model the pbias however suggests a good fit between the simulations and observations the timing of flood events the bimodal pattern of rainfall over the basin wet and dry years and also the regularity of groundwater flow over the simulation period were well captured the results from the datok et al 2020 model also hint at a hydrological disconnect of the upper congo with the drainage basin due to the presence of natural reservoirs which cause significant lag this result is in conformity with the work of kitambo et al 2021 in which similar observations with respect to surface water extent and height were considered similar to the results from kitambo et al 2021 the datok et al 2022 model shows surface runoff start to increase around april to may and reach maximum levels from october november in the northern tributaries this result shows that inspite of the weak correlation in the lualaba basin much like in kitambo et al 2021 the results at the basin outlet at brazzaville kinshasa are not strongly influenced by this subbasin therefore the contribution of the upper congo to the discharge of flow and sediments to the basin outlet are negligible and since this particular region presents the highest level of uncertainty in our calibrated model it gives us a higher degree of confidence in our model outputs in addition there is a generally good agreement between simulation and observation of hydrological parameters like rainfall evapotranspiration seasonality and discharge in a majority of the model subbasins and less acceptable ones in other regions datok et al 2022 therefore this study adds to the argument that the benchmarks used for the performance metrics should be hydrologically meaningful and hence subjective by taking into account the objectives of the study the available observations and parameter values knoben et al 2019 3 3 hydrological evaluation 3 3 1 streamflow the hydrographs fig 7 indicate that the swat model follows the key features of the satellite precipitation products as the dry and wet season at the five gauge sites studied show thus it is possible to evaluate the performance of those products without recalibration it is expected however that the twenty two precipitation product inputs lead to different streamflow prediction than the 3b42 v7 0 base scenario at all five gauges in general and as expected the products without precipitation adjustments satellite only predicts higher streamflow however according to the results some satellite products behave differently for example cmorph v1 0 crt predicts higher streamflow at the gauge lualaba kisangani but in other gauges this product underestimated the streamflow statistical analysis fig 8 and the δ supplementary material table s2 demonstrated that the hydrological model driven by the precipitation products with precipitation adjustments satellite gauge performed better than those without precipitation adjustments as expected but trends between the products and differences between the regions are evident the kge and pbias indexes indicates some products can provide satisfactory performance at ubangi bangui lualaba kisangani and brazzaville kinshasa outlet without model recalibration fig 8 also highlights that the gpcp cdr v1 3 not enforced which is a satellite only product demonstrates a good performance kge 0 71 at ubangi bangui gauge when looking at the entire crb the worst scores were obtained by 3b42rt uncal v7 0 and cmorph v1 0 raw satellite only products it is evidenced by fig 8 that while some satellite only products tend to lead to higher streamflow predictions such as cmorph v1 0 raw and 3b42rt uncal v7 0 others as 3b42 ir v7 0 and 3b42 mw v7 0 tend to lead to lower streamflows in particularl at sangha ouesso and ubangi bangui dry regions of crb the regional products tamsat v2 0 v3 0 and arc2 did not perform well in estimating streamflow when compared to quasi global products such as the imerg v6 0 fc or land only products like the chirps v2 0 although arc2 performed better than the other regional products it still underestimated the streamflow at four gauge stations the near real time nrt precipitation products important for now casting and forecasting streamflow in applications such as early warning systems such as imerg v6 0 eu and imerg v6 0 lu did not provide a good prediction of streamflow showing a consequent overestimation at all gauges among the nrt products only 3b42rt v7 0 had a good performance at the ubangi bangui stations and brazzaville kinshasa outlet and kasai kutu moke the pbias indicates a good performance when compared to the base scenario maybe due to the similarities with the product used in our base scenario in general the monthly streamflow simulation results and the statistical scores from imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 presented consistent streamflow simulations except for kasai kutu moke and sangha ouesso gauges studies as tan et al 2018 and amorim et al 2020 have shown the better performance of imerg products to estimate streamflow all around the world in comparison to tmpa products due to its improvement in precipitation estimation in our case the recalibration of model parameters for imerg products could improve streamflow simulations specifically at the gauge stations where 3b42 v7 0 did not perform well 3 3 2 water balance components to better understand the influence of the different precipitation products in predicting the water balance components wbc utilizing the swat model we analyzed the monthly cycle of evapotranspiration et surface runoff surq lateral flow latq percolation perc soil water content sw groundwater contribution to streamflow gwq and water yield wyld simulated at the sub basin scale the results show that the satellite only products tend to overestimate the wbc especially in the rainy season however the level of overestimation and underestimation depends on the type of wbc and the region in the crb for et predictions fig 9 the precipitation products have the tendency to overestimate in both dry and wet seasons when compared to 3b42 v7 0 although some track et much more closely than others the cmorph v1 0 raw and gsmap gauges rnl v6 0 have the tendency to underestimate this component peak basin wide et during march is overestimated for almost all products while the basin s low at june july and august is underestimated at lualaba and overestimated at other regions at ubangi most of the precipitation products capture the same tendency of 3b42 v7 0 between june to february overall the global et prediction is overestimated at all sub basins in supplementary material table s3 the surq fig 10 latq and perc supplementary material figs s4 and s5 predictions which are intrinsically linked to the amount and dynamics of precipitation are similar for the dry season at kasai ubangi and sangha sub basins however none of the products capture the full amplitude of fluctuations across seasons at the central and lualaba sub basins the predictions are overestimated even in the dry season for the wet season the satellite precipitation products have the tendency to overestimate these components in regards to 3b42 v7 0 at five regions kasai and lualaba sub basins presenting one large peak of surq lat and perc between november to march sangha and ubangi have one peak around august september while the central region has two peaks the first around march april and the second during october november these peaks are overestimated and some products as tamsat v3 0 and arc2 do not follow the same seasonal shape of 3b42 v7 0 in general the global surq latq and perc in supplementary material table s3 are overestimated although some track much more closely than others especially in the dry season the sw fig 11 and gwq supplementary material fig s6 predictions which refers to water stored in soil demonstrate a wide range of simulated values particularly for gwq hence overestimateing these components for both satellite only and satellite gauge with respect to 3b42 v7 0 for sw the precipitation products generally follow the seasonal shape except some products as cmorph v1 0 raw and gsmap gauges rnl v6 0 although none of them capture the full amplitude of fluctuations across seasons the tracks are closer than others for sw in the dry season at lualaba and ubangi but for central kasai and sangha the tracks are scattered the seasonal cycle of gwq does not present a large fluctuation across seasons but the tracks are scattered at all regions studied this behaviour could be linked to the swat model because the model simulates groundwater using the two way groundwater surface water exchange which limits the ability to predict groundwater storage shao et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 also the surface water groundwater interaction mechanisms are less studied than other wbc in the congo basin alsdorf et al 2016 the wyld supplementary material figures s6 predictions consisting of surface runoff groundwater flow tile flow transmission loss are also overestimated compared to 3b42 v7 0 the peak flows have the same characteristic of surq at all regions with two peaks at the central kasai and lualaba however peak shapes of some precipitation products are wider than the peak of 3b42 v7 0 similar to the gwq the wyld tracks are scattered at all sub basins overall the trends between the precipitation products and differences between the regions affects the wbc the δ supplementary material table s3 showed that even a small increase or decrease of amounts of precipitation would cause increase or decrease in the wbc especially the components that are dependent on the dynamics of precipitation as surface runoff and percolation however some precipitation products behave differently for example in most of the analyzed products an increase in amount of precipitation leads to an increase in the values of the wbc but cmorph v1 0 crt shows a decrease of amount of precipitation then an increase in surface runoff values at the central kasai and sangha that leads to a decrease of percolation several possible causes could lead to these results the hydrological response of the wbc is linked to precipitation and design and assumptions of the model to type of vegetation topography and soil it is expected that in forest areas there will be less surface runoff than in pasture areas for example soil degradation will also lead to an increase of runoff 3 4 influence of the precipitation input on model performance to compare the hydrological performance of the satellite based precipitation products using the swat model we summarized some recent hydrological evaluation studies around the world in table 4 tuo et al 2016 tan et al 2018 amorim et al 2020 sharannya et al 2020 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 four main conclusions can be drawn from the comparisons i in many cases the imerg v6 0 fc outperforms 3b42 v7 0 in hydrological simulations due to its improvement in precipitation estimation ii the performance of the satellite based precipitation products depends on the basin localization and simulations scale daily or monthly iii hydrological model choice will affect the accuracy assessment of precipitation products for detecting streamflow extremes and iv the recalibration of the model parameters for each satellite based precipitation product effectively improved the precision of streamflow simulations as shown in the hydrological evaluation section the imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 products demonstrates good performance without recalibration and could be used to study the hydrological cycle in the crb especially for streamflow and evapotranspiration these results agree with the findings reported in table 4 and a recalibration of the model parameters could effectively improve the precision of satellite based precipitation product simulations especially for wbc that are connected to the amount and dynamics of precipitation as surq latq and perc nevertheless the bias in satellite based precipitation products was recognized as a major issue across several basins around the world maggioni and massari 2018 and the inaccuracy of satellite data may lead to unrealistic parameter values when recalibrating the model peng et al 2021 maggioni and massari 2018 have shown that model recalibration was also raised as a viable option to improve streamflow simulations from satellite based precipitation products but caution is necessary when recalibrating models another option is the bias correction of the satellite products with ground based measurements of precipitation to obtain more realistic flow simulations wang et al 2021 crb model calibration was based on a trial and error basis see above we ran the model several times using parameters calculated either from known physical information about the basin or from information obtained from literature and global datasets we tried as much as possible to fix the parameters to be as realistic as possible there is a chance that some of the hydrological behaviours of the system were not captured accurately datok et al 2022 it is possible that the model recalibration for each precipitation product could improve the results especially for streamflow however tmpa 3b42 v 7 reference subset tends to underestimate rainfall in the crb beighley et al 2011 munzimi et al 2015 the precipitations products analyzed is this study largely tend to overestimate the rainfall in the crb fig 3 which could lead to unrealistic parameters especially those associated with the movement and storage of groundwater and also the runoff numerous researchers have examined the quality of satellite derived precipitation datasets through hydrological modelling e g beck et al 2017 dembélé et al 2020 beighley et al 2011 analyzed the trmm cmorph and persiann dataset through the hillslope river routing hrr model in the crb to predict streamflow and water storages and some of their results are similar to ours notably cmorph tends to overestimate magnitudes and trmm shows reasonable agreement relative to the historical observations however persiann performed better in capturing the pattern of streamflow in the swat model having a performance close to 3b42 v7 0 trmm supplementary material tables s2 and s3 the different results may be linked to the design and assumptions of these two models or the persiann bias correction carried out in recent years satellites estimate appear not to perform well over the crb mccollum et al 2000 awange et al 2016 and there are large discrepancies between gauge based products from gpcc global precipitation climatology centre cmap cpc merged analysis of precipitation gpcp global precipitation climatology project and cpc climate prediction center in the interannual and decadal variations in precipitation over the basin negron juarez et al 2009 the lack of a dense and reliable network of rain gauges makes it impossible to assess quantitatively the rainfall products against a proper ground validation reference in addition for the long term mean gpcp and cmap display the major precipitation patterns although substantial discrepancies occur in areas with low gauge densities such as equatorial west africa yin et al 2004 however independent of these discrepancies our findings show that the imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 are potential alternative sources of data for hydrological modeling using swat in the crb 4 conclusions the present work investigated the performances of 23 satellite based precipitation products table 1 in simulating streamflow and water balance components at the congo river basin through the swat model the key findings are as follows the precipitation products were able to represent with consistency the annual cycle of rainfall and the frequencies of rain intensities occurrences over each sub basin studied however the precipitation amounts during the year are different especially due to high precipitation intensities in the absence of a reliable dense ground validation network the gauge adjusted version of 3b42 v7 0 which has been shown to provide good simulations of the discharge through the swat model was taken as a benchmark to analyze the skills of other precipitation products overall the group of satellite only precipitation products mostly overestimates the rainy season peaks and the gauge adjusted satellite products presented better agreements between each other and compared to 3b42 v7 0 except for gsmap gauges rnlv6 0 and cmorph v1 0 crt streamflow and water balance components simulation replicate precipitation products patterns and gauge adjusted satellite performed better than satellite only for streamflow in addition during the rainy season the precipitation products have the tendency to overestimate the surq latq and perc in regards to 3b42 v7 0 over the congo basin for other components et sw gwq and wyld and streamflow predictions there is an overestimation at all sub basins however imerg v6 0 fc and chirps v2 0 products demonstrate good performance with our model and could be used to predict the hydrological cycle in general the selection of precipitation products has a crucial effect on model performance and has to be taken into consideration since it is one of the sources of uncertainties unfortunately the congo river basin is deprived of a quality and dense rain gauge network for assessing these uncertainties more quantitatively using the hydrological model with an ensemble of available products provides a good illustration of the impact of the uncertainties and can be used to filter out the products which behave like outliers and or to indicate the confidence in the simulated hydrological variables the combination of bias correction of the satellite products with ground based measurements and recalibration of the model parameters could effectively improve predictions of the hydrological cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
