5495,due to a lack of awareness of environmental protection at the beginning of tunnel excavation and the unique ecological vulnerability of karst areas tunnel excavation is beginning to have increasingly serious negative effects on the ecological environments in karst areas leading to challenges related to regional water resources and ecological security the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel drainage has had far reaching impacts on the hydrology ecology and environment in karst areas the most prominent effects of the recent advances in drainage techniques include the destruction of aquifer structures changes in the distribution patterns of water resources and the groundwater flow field and even the initiation of geological disasters i e collapses in karst areas in addition karst water circulation and hydrogeochemical processes have also been affected however due to the complex geological conditions and limited observational data in karst areas the impacts of tunnel drainage on ecological systems remain poorly understood with increased understanding researchers have found that the physical and chemical properties of the soil the speed of soil erosion the physiological processes and growth rates of plants and even the compositions of plant communities are gradually changing in tunnel affected karst areas although the understanding of these processes and mechanisms remains far from sufficient based on the progress made regarding the understanding of water resource and hydrological process issues resulting from tunnel excavation in karst areas we expect to experience a worldwide increase in investigations of the eco hydrogeological effects of tunnel excavation in the future keywords tunnel excavation drainage effect hydrological effects environmental effects ecological effects karst areas 1 introduction karst a special landscape shaped by carbonate dissolution covers approximately 20 of the earth s dry ice free land and karst aquifers are at least a partial source of drinking water to almost a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 2007 carbonates often occupy landscapes where water shortages are common due to significant seasonal variation in rainfall ford and williams 2007 furthermore karst landscapes are generally characterized by thin soil layers high infiltration capacity and low water holding capacity and are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and human impacts due to their unique hydrogeological characteristics ford and williams 2007 additionally plateaus and mountains are the dominant landforms in karst areas especially in europe and asia and act as insurmountable barriers for transportation as a result the excavation of tunnels has been a common necessity for efficient transportation in the form of both motorways and railways in karst plateau and mountain areas gisbert et al 2009 vincenzi et al 2009 butscher et al 2011 zarei et al 2011 liu et al 2019 generally tunnels are excavated below the groundwater table in karst areas although some tunnels in karst mountains may start in the vadose zone at each end but pass into a transient zone or even a steady state phreatic zone in their central parts creating an elongated zone of depression that permits gravity driven drainage resulting in a lowered groundwater table ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 karst groundwater drawdown can result in reductions in karst spring discharges gisbert et al 2009 liu et al 2019 and the complete loss or drying up of surface water vincenzi et al 2009 liu et al 2019 therefore any groundwater drawdown could alter the natural hydrogeological flow system and consequently impact groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology in surface water systems springs wells streams lakes wetlands and associated aquatic ecosystems and related ecosystems in karst areas furthermore karst water stress is likely to increase dramatically in the future because of an increase in tunnel excavation induced groundwater drawdown with the rapid development of transportation and urbanization in karst areas among these development projects tunnel construction projects in the alps in europe and in southwest china are particularly notable fig 1 in these areas the depths of tunnels are generally tens of meters to hundreds of meters and some are even longer than 1000 m for example the depth of the diversion tunnel of the jinping hydropower station in china is 2525 m the depths of the gotthard railway tunnel and lotschberg tunnel in switzerland are 2438 m and 1300 m respectively masset and loew 2013 vulliet et al 2003 and the depth of the new lyon turin line tunnel in italy is close to 2500 m bonini and barla 2012 additionally tunnel lengths are generally hundreds of meters to thousands of meters and some exceed 10 km after may 1 2004 when new countries joined the european union the need was felt to link these states through an infrastructure network of motorway and railway links with high speeds hs and high capacities hc easily able to transport all possible goods throughout europe zini et al 2015 therefore many superlong and deep tunnels have been excavated in alpine karst areas and inflow into the tunnels has resulted in groundwater drawdown and land settlement table 1 additionally numerous tunnels have been excavated in the mountainous karst areas of southwest china by the end of 2018 72 railway tunnels with a total length of 1000 km individual tunnels longer than 10 km have been built and 98 railway tunnels with a total length of 1600 km individual tunnels longer than 10 km are under construction or planned additionally 10 933 highway tunnels with a total length of 8800 km have been built including 3896 tunnels with a total length of 4300 km in carbonate areas fig 1 in addition a large number of tunnels have been built in the karst areas of the united states day 2004 south korea song et al 2012 shin et al 2002 2005 shin 2008 chae et al 2008 iran aghda et al 2016 tunisia redhaounia et al 2015 and so on however tunnel excavation in those areas has resulted in large hydroecological and environmental problems due to the intrinsic vulnerability of karst thus to minimize the impacts on these vulnerable and complex areas people must learn how to live with karst anagnostou 1995 perrochet 2005 park et al 2008 pesendorfer and loew 2010 hassani et al 2016 beginning with an analysis of the karst environment vulnerability and the drainage effects of tunnels early views on the impacts of tunnel excavation on hydrological and ecological environments are reviewed in this paper then the impacts of tunnel excavation on the hydrological system soil properties ecosystems and geological disasters in karst areas are summarized finally final considerations and future prospects are presented 2 the vulnerability of the karst environment and drainage effects of tunnel excavation 2 1 the karst environment and its vulnerability the karst environment consists of five components karst weathered residual soil karst morphology the karst hydrological system surface and underground air layers and karst biota yuan 1988a this system shows a double layer structure related to the interactions of the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere at the surface and in the subsurface karst environments are characterized by distinctive landforms related to dissolution and dominantly subsurface drainage gutiérrez et al 2014 because of this type of drainage unique patterns of surface and subsurface runoff occur on the one hand this hydrological pattern produces dry surface habitats and can lead to water shortages on the other hand the extent of the underground pipeline network varies greatly in different areas and the network can be easily blocked in low lying areas in cases of heavy rain causing local waterlogging in addition the direct connection between the surface and the underlying high permeability aquifers makes karst aquifers extremely vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic hazards e g chemical contamination and contaminants can be transported rapidly through tunnels in a larger region and are difficult to remediate reflecting the low threshold elasticity and fragile ecological environment of disaster prone karst areas tuyet 2001 gabrovšek et al 2011 ilona 2016 filipović marijić et al 2018 the soil layer in karst areas is very thin and the physical erosion rate is higher than the soil formation rate yuan 1988b once a soil is lost it is difficult to regenerate additionally the loss of soil aggravates karst drought as soil cover is among the largest water reservoirs in karst areas the above characteristics are one of the fundamental differences between soil vulnerability in carbonate areas and that in areas with other rock types and are also the reasons for the issues associated with land use in karst areas jiang et al 2006 kiernan 2010 smirnova and gennadiev 2017 due to the low quality and calcium rich soil environments plants in karst areas are mostly lithologically adapted slender and calcium loving querejeta et al 2007 lyu et al 2019 the growth rate of trees is slow and vegetation growth is limited by soil and water conditions consequently the vegetation in karst areas has a low degree of resilience and is more vulnerable than that in other areas nepstad et al 1994 baskin et al 1997 tenorio and drezner 2006 lawless et al 2006 moran et al 2008 the high vulnerability of karst environments produces a situation in which it is very easy to damage or destroy natural resources but extremely difficult or impossible to restore conditions back to a pristine situation even if remedial measures are taken the economic costs are usually very high parise and gunn 2007 in short the hydrological systems soil and ecosystems are the most sensitive factors in karst areas the impact of tunnel excavation on the atmospheric system is not clear and the main impact on karst landforms is karst collapse therefore this study mainly focuses on the influence of tunnel excavation on hydrological systems soil ecosystems and geological disasters 2 2 the drainage effect of tunnel excavation tunnels in karst areas are generally deeply buried and large scale geological disasters such as rock bursts collapse and water inrushes often occur during the construction process the most significant hydrogeological impacts that can occur during tunnel excavation in an aquifer are the barrier and drain effects vázquez suñe et al 2005 the barrier effect is caused by underground impervious structures located below the water table these structures reduce the effective transmissivity of the aquifer leading to a rise in the water table upgradient and a drop in the water table downgradient shin et al 2002 ricci et al 2007 shin 2008 deveughèle and zokimila 2010 the barrier effect may result in geotechnical and or environmental consequences and may affect pre existing infrastructure custodio and carrera 1989 marinos and kavvadas 1997 tambara et al 2003 paris et al 2010 the drain effect is caused by drainage tunnels which are designed to extract groundwater to avoid water loads but may have far reaching environmental and geotechnical consequences li and kagami 1997 chae et al 2008 vincenzi et al 2009 butscher 2012 the relative position of the tunnel and groundwater level is the key to producing a drainage effect if the tunnel is located above the regional groundwater level some epikarst springs may be drained affecting the shallow groundwater in the aeration zone if the tunnel is located below the regional groundwater level large springs or underground rivers may be drained and the groundwater level will drop significantly tunnel excavation penetrates karst fissures and faults and exposes karst caves moreover existing karst fissures expand under the action of a high pressure water head and then further develop and split forming new fissures increasing water conduction channels and destroying the aquifer structure as a result large amounts of surface water and groundwater are discharged into the tunnel through fissures and faults and the tunnel becomes a new centralized mean of drainage in the region fig 2 tunnel drainage causes changes in the hydrogeological regime and a progressive stabilization of discharge is observed until a new steady state is reached falcone et al 2008 celico et al 2005 however once the original water resource balance at the tunneling site is broken a series of ecological and environmental effects is triggered for instance water inrushing occurred in a high speed railway tunnel in southern spain during excavation with a peak flow of 800 l s after a short period of time spring discharges dried up gisbert et al 2009 the drawdown produced by tunnel excavation could cause hydrological hydrogeological and environmental impacts on groundwater dependent ecosystems vincenzi et al 2009 such as the exhaustion of water resources changes in water circulation and karst collapse in addition how will tunnel drainage affect soil and ecosystems this question is also a matter of concern fig 3 3 early views on the role of tunnel excavation in hydroecology and the environment in karst areas in historical research on the ecohydrological and environmental effects caused by tunnel excavation in karst areas some achievements have been obtained through a large number of scientific observations data analysis and numerical simulations koyama et al 2012 traditionally the influence of tunnel drainage on groundwater has been widely studied in terms of 1 changes in water resource distribution patterns 2 changes in the groundwater flow field 3 changes in the water circulation process and 4 changes in hydrogeochemical processes fig 4 table 2 3 1 impacts of tunnel excavation on the distribution pattern of water resources first tunnel drainage destroys the aquifer structure then the surface water and groundwater drain forming a cone of depression which expands with the drainage time until the tunnel drainage fully accounts for the recharge from the boundary fig 5 attanayake and waterman 2006 argued that the impact of underground engineering construction on the water environment was mainly caused by a decrease in water resources when there is no reservoir or large body of water near the tunnel the groundwater recharge above the tunnel may not occur fast enough to avoid a significant excavation induced water level drawdown kim et al 2001 moon and jeong 2011 the influential range of tunnel drainage and the amount of water resources to be drained vary greatly not only could the radius of influence range from one or two hundred meters to more than ten kilometers but the water loss also shows anisotropy karst aquifers are characterized by highly varied hydraulic properties that are a result of the complex interactions among karst conduits discrete fractures and the rock matrix ford and williams 1989 in addition the inhomogeneity of karst development the difference in the lithological assemblage characteristics of strata the development degree of faults and fissures in tunnel areas and the difference in the relative position between the tunnel and regional groundwater levels also play important roles zhan and park 2003 sun and zhan 2006 jin et al 2016 hadi and arash 2018 the existence of large karst caves thick limestone water conducting faults and tunnels located in the lower part of the groundwater table are more conducive to tunnel drainage aquifer destruction and differences in tunnel drainage aggravate the uneven distribution of karst water resources thus changing the spatial distribution pattern of water resources table 2 abundant monitoring data on draining water resources and lowering groundwater levels during tunnel excavation have been accumulated consequently there is widespread agreement about changes in the distribution pattern of water resources however in karst areas with different hydrogeological structures the influence of tunnels on the distribution pattern of water resources also varies therefore it is necessary to effectively summarize and establish a hydrogeological model for karst tunnels affecting the distribution pattern of water resources and hydrological processes in addition previous studies have focused on the impact of tunnel excavation on the spatial distribution of water resources while only a few studies have focused on the impact on the annual distribution and multiyear changes in surface water soil water and groundwater 3 2 impacts of tunnel excavation on the groundwater flow field under natural conditions karst groundwater runs along corroded channels from high to low elevations during tunnel excavation however karst groundwater is continuously discharged into the tunnel due to the drainage effect and the flow velocity and direction of groundwater change accordingly as a result tunnel drainage changes the hydrodynamic conditions of the tunnel site area and forms a new potential sink center fig 5 then the local hydraulic gradient is significantly enhanced and the groundwater runoff pattern changes significantly groundwater level decline is the most prominent manifestation of this flow field change the construction of subway tunnels may cause a significant local or regional drop in groundwater levels due to the seepage and removal of the surrounding groundwater into the tunnel kim et al 2001 at the same time tunnel excavation drainage may use static groundwater reserves to increase the recharge and expand the recharge boundary of groundwater thus changing the regional groundwater flow field two multitracer tests proved the connection between losing streams and numerous water inlets in a tunnel and these connections had a maximum linear distance of 1 4 km and velocities of up to 135 m d several of the demonstrated flow paths passed under previous groundwater divides mountain ridges proving that the tunnel had completely modified the regional flow system vincenzi et al 2009 in addition regional and local flow systems may also change as the groundwater level and velocity change because of the inadequate number of boreholes and natural springs near the tunnel site the groundwater flow field must be qualitatively studied to some extent by groundwater simulation software however due to the heterogeneity in karst aquifers and the uncertainty in the model itself its applicability in simulating karst aquifers is limited and the simulation results are often unsatisfactory shoemaker et al 2008 added a pipeline flow program based on the modflow 2005 open source program the hagen poiseuille equation and darcy weisbach equation were used to describe laminar and turbulent flow in a karst pipeline medium compared with an equivalent porous medium the pipeline flow program is more accurate in terms of water level and flow measurements modflow cfp has been tested hill et al 2010 applied gallegos et al 2013 giese et al 2018 and improved zargham et al 2018 however although modflow cfp can calculate the flow process of different nodes it does not consider the hydrodynamic process inside the pipeline the description of the flow characteristics in the pipeline is relatively fuzzy and the flow exchange between the pipeline medium and the fracture medium is represented by a linear equation assuming that the flow exchange is directly proportional to the head difference between the two which does not conform to actual flow exchange behavior therefore long term efforts are needed to improve existing models in addition in some karst valley areas there are several parallel tunnels in the same hydrogeological unit forming a tunnel group the influence of the tunnel group on the groundwater flow field is more complex and this complexity should be a focus in future research 3 3 impacts of tunnel excavation on water circulation tunnel excavation may accelerate or slow water circulation spectral analysis of precipitation and groundwater seepage records showed that seepage lagged precipitation by 3 months this delay was related to the advancement of the wetting front and an increase in the number of active flow paths rademacher et al 2003 additionally tunnel excavation penetrates cracks and fractures exposes karst caves changes the aquifer structure and increases the groundwater flow paths the unique fissure and network structure of a karst aquifer causes the tunnel water inflow to respond rapidly to rainfall and can have a larger range of impacts gisbert et al 2009 tunneling may broaden and shift capture zones leading to changes in the origin and age of groundwater and the migration of groundwater along preferential flow paths e g faults due to the drainage effect of the tunnel butscher et al 2011 moreover the influence of tunnel excavation on karst areas is more serious than in nonkarst areas a comprehensive hydrological monitoring program was implemented with four multitracer tests focusing on four sections of seven railway tunnels in a high speed railway line between bologna and florence italy the impact radius was 200 m in the thin bedded sequences but reached 2 3 4 0 km in calcareous and thick bedded arenitic turbidites linear flow velocities as determined from the peaks of the tracer breakthrough curves ranged from 3 6 m day in the thin bedded turbidites to 39 m day in the calcareous rocks average values from the four test sites vincenzi et al 2014 there are two main reasons for these differences the change in hydrodynamic conditions in the area caused the acceleration of groundwater movement in addition tunnel excavation strengthened the hydraulic links between adjacent aquifers the tunnel drainage formed a cone of depression which gave the aquifer enough space to receive external recharge water and strengthened the infiltration transformation of surface water to groundwater in addition the long term drainage of some tunnels also accelerates the dissolution of carbonate rock resulting in an increase in the permeability of the rock mass which in turn accelerates the water circulation fig 4 at present there are few quantitative descriptions of soil water in water circulation studies in karst tunnel areas the conversion process comprising precipitation surface water soil water groundwater and tunnel water may be a research hotspot in the future in addition due to the unique geological structure of karst areas the ability of karst areas to absorb rainfall is very strong it is only in the case of heavy or regular rainstorms that slope flow can occur while other forms of rainfall are absorbed by the surface zone whether tunnel drainage has an impact on the runoff generation mechanism in tunnel site areas has not yet been studied additionally whether the process of rainfall runoff generation is affected by tunnel drainage conditions is also a matter of concern 3 4 impacts of tunnel excavation on groundwater hydrogeochemistry and water environment tunnel excavation can cause changes in groundwater hydrogeochemistry in several ways tunnel drainage leads to a decrease in aquifer water pressure and changes in the geochemical equilibrium conditions the process of groundwater circulation accelerates the interaction between water and rock thus changing the chemical composition of the groundwater mossmark et al 2015 fig 4 and tunnel drainage destroys the aquifer s structure and promotes the mixing of groundwater from different aquifers thus changing the chemical characteristics of groundwater li and kagami 1997 studied the variations in groundwater level and chemical compositions during the construction of the songben tunnel project in japan when the tunnel passed through unfavorable strata such as coal bearing strata geochemical reactions would oxidize the sulfides in the strata produce sulfate and hydrogen ions and cause groundwater chemical anomalies these chemical anomalies caused the hydrolysis or dissolution of calcium bearing minerals and released calcium ions which lead to a change in the hydrochemical type and an increase in mineralization it was found that the changes in the groundwater chemical compositions were more obvious than the changes in groundwater levels the change in hydrochemical characteristics caused by tunnel drainage has also been noted in many other studies including studies on the subway system in seoul chae et al 2008 and the new colle di tenda road tunnel between france and italy banzato et al 2011 moreover hydrochemical changes are difficult to predict since they are dependent on geological and hydrological conditions and tunnel design these changes may have an adverse effect on the environment and could affect the lifespan of construction materials such as rock support drainage systems and sealing systems mossmark et al 2015 tunnel excavation very easily causes water pollution the wastewater from construction easily enters the groundwater system it is difficult to estimate the amount of contaminants that leak into the tunnel and these chemicals can be difficult to measure a study on the hydrochemistry of groundwater seeping into subway tunnels in seoul showed that tunnel excavation may affect redox conditions thus influencing the chemical properties of urban groundwater and leading to a significant increase in dissolved manganese and iron concentrations in urban groundwater chae et al 2008 it is believed that the blasting products such as nitrate and nitrite and the components of heavy metal rich minerals in the rock walls and waste residues which can be released by chemical reactions enter the water body during tunnel construction dust from tunnel excavation oil leakage from construction machinery waterproof grouting material and shotcrete anchor support material can also pollute the surrounding surface water in particular the liquid leaking from reinforcements containing harmful ingredients has some of the most significant impacts on the water environment some studies have shown that the content of acrylamide in tunnel drainage can reach 95500 g l when using a reinforcing agent containing acrylamide weideborg et al 2001 acrylamide is completely soluble in water and may cause acute lethal effects on fish or other aquatic organisms some ingredients and chemicals used in the preparation of mortars and grouting suspensions may be toxic neurotoxic or carcinogenic and may be irritants or corrosives their use is dangerous to both humans and the environment these toxic components can pollute karst aquifers and can have long lasting hazardous consequences for underground karst species both physically and chemically these materials rapidly destroy underground habitats and have killed an enormous number of rare endangered and endemic species bonacci et al 2009 previous studies have shown that karst tunnel construction accelerates the interaction between water and rock but whether it further changes the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of regional hydrogeochemical fields needs to be confirmed by observation data in addition whether tunnel drainage further promotes karstification has yet to be studied systematically in summary the distribution of karst water resources becomes more uneven due to tunnel drainage more importantly tunnel drainage directly causes groundwater drawdown and destroys karst aquifers and the flow field and geochemical characteristics of groundwater change accordingly in addition unreasonable construction practices also lead to groundwater pollution however due to the complex geological conditions and limited observational data in karst areas the impacts of tunnel drainage on soil and vegetation have been neglected in the research that does exist researchers have found that the physical and chemical properties of soil plant physiological processes growth rate and coverage in tunnel affected karst areas are gradually changing geological hazards especially subsidence or collapse are widespread in karst tunnel areas and have seriously affected the local ecological environment therefore it is necessary to sort the existing research summarize its patterns analyze its mechanisms and identify problems and directions for future research 4 impacts of tunnel excavation on soil properties as shown in fig 6 and table 3 the physical and chemical properties of soil can be modified and soil erosion can be accelerated by tunnel excavation in karst areas tunnel drainage can result in the drying up of surface water and the drawdown of groundwater cutting off the connections among surface water groundwater and soil water leading to a decrease in soil moisture and consequently impacting soil microbial communities and functions with the decrease in soil moisture microbial abundance and diversity the concentration of co2 in the soil will decrease significantly which may change the soil structure and physical and chemical properties potentially resulting in an increase in the soil bulk density and clay content and a decrease in organic matter and nutrient contents eventually the quality of the soil will decrease jiang 2019 at the same time the groundwater drawdown and surface collapse caused by tunnel drainage will further accelerate water circulation destroy the micromorphology of the soil disrupt plant root systems and finally accelerate soil erosion 4 1 changes in soil physical properties the influence of tunnel excavation and operation on soil physical characteristics is mainly manifested in the decrease in soil moisture and the increase in soil temperature table 3 tunnel drainage dries surface water and lowers the groundwater level resulting in reduced soil moisture liu et al 2019 due to the lack of monitoring data there are few studies on the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of soil moisture during the tunnel construction period the influence of subway tunnels on the increase in soil temperature has been a research hotspot in recent years with the main research methods being field measurements scale model simulations of the experimental platform theoretical analyses and numerical simulations cavagnaro and brulard 1997 glehn and bluhm 2000 subway operations result in an increase in air temperature and the temperature of the surrounding rock in the tunnel which in turn leads to an increase in soil temperature in such a system the trains are the heat source and the air surrounding rock and groundwater are the main heat conduction media ampofo et al 2004 moreover the changes in soil temperature show great temporal and spatial differences soil texture geological conditions stratum and structure and engineering conditions lining layer and impervious layer are the main factors influencing the spatiotemporal variation in soil temperature lee et al 2004 it is presumed that the driving factor is the increase in soil evaporation 4 2 changes in soil chemical properties in addition to the soil water contents the soil organic matter and ph values may also be reduced by tunnel excavation the decrease in groundwater level and the acceleration of water circulation both promote the transport of soil nutrients to deeper levels or into groundwater in one study the soil morphology the physical and chemical properties of soil horizons water fluxes in the saturated zone and tritium content in groundwater were determined at nine sites miller and chanasyk 2010 the results showed that the soil types were different between the recharge area with a shallow groundwater level 1 81 m and the discharge area with a deep groundwater level 2 60 m the leaching of carbonates from the b horizons was consistent with the downward groundwater flow and the high water soluble na levels in the three orthic soils suggested an influence from a shallower water table at some point moreover the unreasonable disposal of construction waste residue and liquid will lead to soil pollution 4 3 acceleration of soil erosion the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation may aggravate soil erosion until now little research has been conducted on the mechanism by which tunnel excavation induces soil erosion but many observations have demonstrated a correlation between coal mining subsidence and soil erosion sinha et al 2016 therefore we hypothesize that the ground subsidence caused by drainage may be a direct cause of accelerated soil erosion subsidence reshapes the surface structure and morphology steepens the slope and destabilizes the soil body in some areas thus accelerating gravitational erosion and hydraulic erosion simulation results have shown that the maximum modulus of erosion and the erosion volume of the subsidence basin without water logging would increase by 78 and 23 respectively compared with those of the original situation and that the edge of the subsidence basin is subject to the greatest acceleration in soil erosion meng et al 2012 in addition deposition of sediment can destroy plant roots and affect the uptake of water by plants the decrease in vegetation caused by a drop in water level and ground subsidence may be an indirect cause of the acceleration in soil erosion daniels 2010 sinha et al 2016 as the vegetation root system is destroyed or dies the water holding capacity of the surface weakens and rainfall induced soil erosion becomes more likely to occur 5 impacts of tunnel excavation on karst ecosystems because of the calcium rich rock the circulation of water and air and its unique double layer structure karst ecosystems have poor soil fertility poor water retention ability low vegetation coverage and low degrees of resilience due to the lack of a systematic surface water hydrological network in karst areas natural vegetation is mainly dependent on the consumption of groundwater resources for survival so vegetation is very sensitive to groundwater changes the decrease in groundwater level and soil water content caused by tunnel drainage has negative impacts on the ecological environment and ecological processes with specific results such as a reduced plant growth rate changes in plant physiological processes and changes in plant communities table 4 5 1 changes in plant physiological processes plants adapt to water stress by changing water absorption strategies and efficiency especially plants with dimorphic root systems in karst areas the surface roots of dimorphic root systems potentially take up water from the upper soil layers while deeper roots extract water stored in epikarst and even underground rivers williams and ehleringer 2000 kulmatiski et al 2006 heilman et al 2009 hasselquist et al 2010 when the groundwater level declines due to drought mining or tunnel excavation plants adjust their water utilization strategies and absorb deep groundwater fig 7 an analysis of the results of δ2h and δ18o analyses indicated that the drawdown caused by tunnel excavation in a karst valley induced a decrease in the soil water content which led to the transformation of the plant water absorption pattern from dominantly exploiting soil water sources in the rainy season to dominantly exploiting subsurface water sources in the dry season liu et al 2019 plants can also change their strategies and efficiency of water absorption by adjusting the size and density of vessels to adapt to changes in the groundwater level fig 7 the lumen areas of vessels were separately measured in 26 tree rings from six trees and the results suggested that vessel size and density were correlated with circumferential stem growth which is in turn governed by the local water supply schume et al 2004 different tree species also show different physiological characteristics oak showed a stress avoidance strategy involving a decrease in conduit size under drought leading to a reduction in water conducting capacity and a lower risk of cavitation in contrast pine reduced the carbon costs of the water conducting system during drought by decreasing the number and cell wall thickness of conduits while the lumen diameter and efficiency of water conduction may increase eilmann et al 2009 in addition stomatal control is also a strategy for plants to cope with water deficits and the main response is a reduction in stomatal conductance or stomatal closure due to variations in the water content and canopy water potential of different tree species the sensitivity of stomatal behavior also varies sparks and black 1999 zweifel et al 2007 5 2 decrease in plant growth rate the narrowing of tree ring width is an index for decreases in the tree growth rate the study of tree rings in woody species can provide information on past and present ecological controls on tree establishment growth and death including those related to climate and water availability bogino and villalba 2008 dussart et al 1998 esper et al 2002 máguas et al 2011 martin and germain 2016 witt et al 2017 the tree ring widths widen and narrow due to the rise and fall in the groundwater levels respectively stockton and fritts 1973 yanosky 1982 1983 1984 sloan et al 2001 lageard and drew 2008 the groundwater table has been shown to be the dominant factor influencing oak growth at one site especially during times of intensive drainage scharnweber et al 2014 some studies have attempted to use tree rings as an indicator of groundwater level decline caused by tunnel excavation zheng et al 2017 growth reduction caused by tunnel drainage can be easily identified by a dramatic decline in tree ring width fig 7 lowering of the groundwater table significantly reduces the growth rate of pine trees for 15 years and the effect can extend up to 1 km away from the tunnel axis zheng et al 2017 groundwater is the most important limiting resource for plant distribution and growth soil moisture and salinity affect natural vegetation growth and are closely related to the groundwater level a decrease in the groundwater level may lead to plant wilting and death therefore the concepts of the ecological water level of groundwater ecological balance of groundwater and threshold of groundwater level depth were proposed boutaleb et al 2000 horton et al 2001 and the maximum allowable water discharged from tunnels was determined based on the ecological water requirement of vegetation in addition land subsidence destroys plant roots leading to a decline in the growth rate and even death of plants daniels 2010 5 3 changes in plant communities tunnels and vehicles can inadvertently transport plant seeds which increases the likelihood of species invasion rutkovska et al 2013 and changes in plant community diversity one study found that approximately 32 3 of the plant seeds in a highway tunnel did not live near the tunnel entrance dark 2004 both the magnitude of seed deposition and the species richness in the seed samples from two motorway tunnels were higher in the lanes leading out of the city than in the lanes leading into the city indicating an export of urban biodiversity via traffic as proportions of seeds of nonnative species were also higher in the outbound lanes traffic may foster invasion processes in cities and may transport nonnative species to the surrounding landscapes lipper and kowarik 2010 at present it has been assumed that the increase in plant seed species in tunnels will cause species invasion and changes in plant diversity but more concrete conclusions will required additional observational data furthermore the destruction of the plant root system caused by ground subsidence and the decrease in plant growth rate or even death due to groundwater drawdown may also lead to a reduction in plant species or promote the gradual vegetation succession to xerophytes however whether the long term drainage of tunnels will lead to vegetation succession has seldom been studied and this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by observational data 6 impacts of tunnel excavations on karst environments geological hazards 6 1 the process of ground collapse caused by tunnel drainage collapse is often a side effect of tunnel excavation and is one of the most common geological hazards casagrande et al 2005 the development process of ground collapse caused by tunnel drainage can be divided into three stages fig 8 in the first phase groundwater maintains the natural water level and is relatively stable in the natural state in the bedrock a hole or funnel forms through dissolution at this time the soil is also affected by the buoyancy of the karst water and the resistance to sliding of the soil itself which allows the overlying soil to exist in a basically stable state in the second phase the groundwater level drops rapidly after a large amount of the tunnel is drained fig 8 the water flow process can cause erosion and movement of the soil in the surface overburden and karst conduit and gradually forms caves in the soil the surface soil shows signs of tension cracks and subsidence because of gravity the vibrations pressure and hydraulic pressure caused by gunstocks during construction are destructive and enhance the connectivity of deep and shallow karst fissures and conduits in the third phase with the further development of the soil cave the roof soil layer becomes increasingly thin when the negative vacuum pressure and the weight of the soil exceed the collapse resistance a collapse occurs 6 2 impacts of ground collapse tunnel excavation in addition to drainage may cause dramatic changes in the local hydrogeology leading to enhanced internal erosion the development of sinkholes and the subsequent formation of karst collapse milanovic 2000 bonetto et al 2008 vigna et al 2010 gutiérrez et al 2014 ground subsidence settlement and karst collapse are the most common changes table 5 according to incomplete statistics nearly all long railway tunnels built in karst areas in southwest china have experienced karst collapse to varying degrees in the pinglin tunnels of the taipei ilan expressway project taiwan the sudden groundwater inflow was up to 750 l s which led to a collapse at the tunnel face and a tunnel boring machine tbm in the pilot tunnel was trapped and damaged tseng et al 2001 although stiff lining segments were used and grouting mortar was utilized to fill any gap between the linings and surrounding soil investigations have demonstrated that surface collapses appear to be unavoidable fargnoli et al 2015 and have caused some damage to residential areas and buildings above the tunnels farrell et al 2014 lavasan et al 2016 6 3 interfering factors and preventive measures the change in effective stress and the increase in hydrodynamic pressure caused by tunnel drainage in the overlying loose soil layer are the most fundamental causes of ground subsidence areas with fluctuating groundwater levels and strong runoff zones are often prone to collapse and the change in hydrodynamic conditions is the main factor driving karst collapse fig 8 as has been confirmed by an abundance of observational data the most perceptible impact when tunneling with the earth pressure balance epb method is soil movement during tunnel excavation soil movements can be divided into short and long term movements short term movements are mainly caused by 1 ground loss during excavation which redistributes the stress in the soil and results in stress relief ercelebi et al 2011 2 injection of grout and 3 advancement of the tbm and consequent pushing of the soil pujades et al 2015 long term movements are observed after the excavation process and are associated with creep stress redistribution consolidation of the soil after drainage and perhaps soil consolidation resulting from groundwater changes due to the interaction between the tunnel and the aquifer ercelebi et al 2011 barrier effect or drain effect additionally groundwater ingress is another factor triggering ground subsidence during construction due to the instability of the cutting face large amounts of groundwater from leaking fractures and fissures can flow into the completed tunnel and this loss of groundwater produces an effective stress that leads to ground consolidation and ground surface settlement chen et al 2017 ground subsidence is obviously affected by rainfall which increases the groundwater level and the hydraulic gradient rapidly flowing water can carry large amounts of sediment which accelerates the development of ground subsidence ground subsidence always occurs or expands during the rainy season since the compressibility and thickness of the overlying strata vary from place to place it is postulated that differential ground surface settlement will also occur amorosi et al 2014 loganathan and poulos 1998 for double line or multiline tunnels tunnel spacing and construction sequences have a great influence on the amount shape and scope of ground collapse the ground collapse resulting from parallel tunnels is larger and wider than that resulting from a single track tunnel with the decrease in tunnel spacing a grouped caving effect will occur and the amount of collapse will increase chehade and shahrour 2008 several techniques including grout injection masini et al 2014 can be employed to avoid issues such as cracking tilting or settling to accurately predict settlement by analytical or numerical methods it is important to know the soil parameters furthermore steering parameters such as the face pressure or grout pressure in the annular gap can be adapted to the surrounding soil to ensure an unimpaired construction workflow 7 final considerations and future prospects in recent years in response to rapid economic development tunnel excavation in karst areas has continued to accelerate due to the lack of environmental protection awareness at the beginning of tunnel excavation and the unique ecological vulnerability of karst areas the negative effects of tunnel excavation on the ecological environments in karst areas are becoming more significant and are producing challenges for regional water resources and ecological security even potentially causing strong social repercussions in china south korea and the alps to analyze the impact of tunnel excavation on hydrology ecology and the environment a series of studies have been conducted and some advances have been achieved most of the existing studies focus on the specific manifestations and ecological environment effects caused by tunnel excavation it is agreed upon that the decline in the groundwater level caused by tunnel excavation is the basic reason for the observed ecological environmental effects however there are still some deficiencies in the explanations of the mechanisms by which tunnel excavation impacts hydrological processes vegetation and soil the evolutionary trends of hydroecological environmental effects and related research methods and means overall research on the ecological environmental effects of tunnel excavation is still relatively lacking the following aspects need to be addressed in the future 7 1 impacts of tunnel excavation on karst water resources and hydrological processes tunnel excavation often passes through karst aquifers forming a large artificial pipeline due to the uneven development of the water bearing medium and the complex hydraulic characteristics of karst aquifers the groundwater immediately flows into the tunnel after tunnel excavation resulting in varying degrees of surface water leakage and groundwater drawdown which further aggravates the uneven distribution of water resources and challenges the reliability of regional water resources the tunnel drainage forms a cone of depression with the tunnel as the center the local hydraulic gradient increases instantly the flow system is disturbed and the groundwater supply boundary expands all of which significantly alter the groundwater flow field many tunnels are located below the groundwater level in the process of excavation the formation of artificial pipelines and the release of high water pressures destroy the karst aquifer change the runoff path of groundwater strengthen the relationships between different aquifers enhance the interaction between water and rock and consequently change the water circulation process and the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater in addition unreasonable tunnel excavation practices can also produce water quality problems previous studies have focused little on soil water to improve the observations of soil water and carry out quantitative analysis of the transformation of precipitation surface water soil water groundwater and tunnel water long term monitoring experiments and numerical simulations should be conducted the ecohydrological effect of a single tunnel and the influence of a new tunnel on an existing tunnel have been abundantly researched the interaction and superposition effect among multiple tunnels have seldom been studied but will be a hot topic in future research establishing a monitoring network for a tunnel group is suggested to optimize the numerical simulation model and quantitatively depict the superposition effect of the tunnel group in addition the ecological environmental impact of extralong and deeply buried tunnels cannot be ignored whether such tunnels affect the ecological functions in mountain areas e g the alps is also worth studying to establish a monitoring network relevant research should be carried out and timely measurements should be obtained 7 2 impacts of tunnel excavation on soil properties the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel drainage results in a decrease in the soil water content which leads to changes in the soil microbial community function and co2 concentrations and to changes in the structural physical and chemical properties of the soil thus reducing the soil quality furthermore tunnel excavation not only accelerates water circulation but also causes ground collapse which destroys the soil microtopography and plant roots thereby promoting soil erosion however there are few studies in this area and no large observational dataset exists what are the mechanisms and processes behind this impact does tunnel drainage result in changes in the soil microbial community and functions and consequently changes in soil quality does tunnel drainage reduce soil quality by reducing soil moisture and enhancing leaching no related studies were found it is suggested that the systematic monitoring of soil physical chemical biological microbial co2 and erosion characteristics should be strengthened to explore the processes and mechanisms of the responses of soil characteristics to tunnel excavation at different spatial and temporal scales 7 3 impacts of tunnel excavation on ecological karst systems plants adapt to water stress by changing water absorption strategies and efficiency including through changes in conduit size and density stomatal closure and deeper root development a sharp decline in tree ring width indicates that the growth speed of some trees around a tunnel decreases and some trees even die which further affects the ecosystem in this area additionally tunnels also provide a pathway for the migration of plant seeds which can cause changes in biodiversity this is an interesting topic do these effects exist in other areas and if so what is the mechanism does this process affect other physiological processes of plants or even cause changes in plant communities around the tunnel these questions have yet to be answered by using 18o 2h 3h and 13c to analyze the changes in water absorption strategies and the efficiency of plants in tunnel affected areas and by observing the widths of tree rings vessels and stomata the changes in plant growth rate and physiological characteristics can be analyzed and used to explore the mechanisms of vegetation growth rate and physiological process affected by tunnel excavation by means of sampling remote sensing technology and modeling we can explore changes in vegetation coverage and plant diversity under tunnel disturbance conditions verify the possibility of species invasion in the tunnel site area and reveal the process of vegetation succession from aquatic or arbor vegetation to terrestrial xerophytic or shrub and herbaceous vegetation 7 4 impacts of tunnel excavation on karst environments geological hazards the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation results in a decrease in groundwater buoyancy the movement of water flow accelerates potential soil erosion and forms soil caves with the development of soil caves and the action of gravity surface cracks subsidence and collapse appear gradually the rapid change in groundwater dynamic conditions is the main cause of collapse analysis and numerical methods can be effectively used to predict collapses and then carry out scientific grouting however at present collapses still occur frequently in the process of tunnel construction it is still necessary to carry out long term monitoring to better understand the mechanisms and patterns of collapses and to optimize the design concept and calculation parameters to improve the prediction accuracy moreover optimizing the construction scheme and avoiding a large amount of drainage may be the most favorable means to reduce collapse 7 5 prevention of hydrological ecological and environmental problems in the past workers have gradually reduced the negative impacts of tunnel excavation through geological hazard risk assessments advanced geological predictions improvements to lining materials and improvements to construction technologies however significant challenges remain the following work is still necessary before tunnel excavation it is necessary to carry out systematic surveys and monitoring of karst landforms and the hydrogeology establish a real hydrogeological conceptual model and accurately simulate and predict tunnel related geological disasters in order to make accurate and scientifically founded decisions during tunnel excavations to adapt to heterogeneous karst aquifers the existing analytical solution should be modified in the prediction of tunnel water inflow different methods for early warning index systems and engineering verifications should be proposed for tunnel projects with different geological structures in karst areas additionally the design scheme should be optimized such that the tunnel does not intersect areas with strong karstification or water saturation zones as much as possible for a tunnel under excavation the principles of dynamic investigation dynamic evaluation and dynamic construction should be adhered to during construction hydrogeological monitoring and investigation should be carried out emergency conditions should be dealt with in a timely manner prediction and evaluation should be upgraded the scientificity and reliability of previous evaluation methods should be revised and verified and construction strategies should be adjusted in a timely manner after tunnel excavation it is necessary to carry out hydrological and ecological environmental investigations and monitoring enhance the study of the classification and evaluation methods of ecological environmental impacts optimize the quantitative evaluation index system of the ecological environmental impact and propose evaluation criteria to improve the decision making and management of tunnel construction and operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

5495,due to a lack of awareness of environmental protection at the beginning of tunnel excavation and the unique ecological vulnerability of karst areas tunnel excavation is beginning to have increasingly serious negative effects on the ecological environments in karst areas leading to challenges related to regional water resources and ecological security the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel drainage has had far reaching impacts on the hydrology ecology and environment in karst areas the most prominent effects of the recent advances in drainage techniques include the destruction of aquifer structures changes in the distribution patterns of water resources and the groundwater flow field and even the initiation of geological disasters i e collapses in karst areas in addition karst water circulation and hydrogeochemical processes have also been affected however due to the complex geological conditions and limited observational data in karst areas the impacts of tunnel drainage on ecological systems remain poorly understood with increased understanding researchers have found that the physical and chemical properties of the soil the speed of soil erosion the physiological processes and growth rates of plants and even the compositions of plant communities are gradually changing in tunnel affected karst areas although the understanding of these processes and mechanisms remains far from sufficient based on the progress made regarding the understanding of water resource and hydrological process issues resulting from tunnel excavation in karst areas we expect to experience a worldwide increase in investigations of the eco hydrogeological effects of tunnel excavation in the future keywords tunnel excavation drainage effect hydrological effects environmental effects ecological effects karst areas 1 introduction karst a special landscape shaped by carbonate dissolution covers approximately 20 of the earth s dry ice free land and karst aquifers are at least a partial source of drinking water to almost a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 2007 carbonates often occupy landscapes where water shortages are common due to significant seasonal variation in rainfall ford and williams 2007 furthermore karst landscapes are generally characterized by thin soil layers high infiltration capacity and low water holding capacity and are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and human impacts due to their unique hydrogeological characteristics ford and williams 2007 additionally plateaus and mountains are the dominant landforms in karst areas especially in europe and asia and act as insurmountable barriers for transportation as a result the excavation of tunnels has been a common necessity for efficient transportation in the form of both motorways and railways in karst plateau and mountain areas gisbert et al 2009 vincenzi et al 2009 butscher et al 2011 zarei et al 2011 liu et al 2019 generally tunnels are excavated below the groundwater table in karst areas although some tunnels in karst mountains may start in the vadose zone at each end but pass into a transient zone or even a steady state phreatic zone in their central parts creating an elongated zone of depression that permits gravity driven drainage resulting in a lowered groundwater table ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 karst groundwater drawdown can result in reductions in karst spring discharges gisbert et al 2009 liu et al 2019 and the complete loss or drying up of surface water vincenzi et al 2009 liu et al 2019 therefore any groundwater drawdown could alter the natural hydrogeological flow system and consequently impact groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology in surface water systems springs wells streams lakes wetlands and associated aquatic ecosystems and related ecosystems in karst areas furthermore karst water stress is likely to increase dramatically in the future because of an increase in tunnel excavation induced groundwater drawdown with the rapid development of transportation and urbanization in karst areas among these development projects tunnel construction projects in the alps in europe and in southwest china are particularly notable fig 1 in these areas the depths of tunnels are generally tens of meters to hundreds of meters and some are even longer than 1000 m for example the depth of the diversion tunnel of the jinping hydropower station in china is 2525 m the depths of the gotthard railway tunnel and lotschberg tunnel in switzerland are 2438 m and 1300 m respectively masset and loew 2013 vulliet et al 2003 and the depth of the new lyon turin line tunnel in italy is close to 2500 m bonini and barla 2012 additionally tunnel lengths are generally hundreds of meters to thousands of meters and some exceed 10 km after may 1 2004 when new countries joined the european union the need was felt to link these states through an infrastructure network of motorway and railway links with high speeds hs and high capacities hc easily able to transport all possible goods throughout europe zini et al 2015 therefore many superlong and deep tunnels have been excavated in alpine karst areas and inflow into the tunnels has resulted in groundwater drawdown and land settlement table 1 additionally numerous tunnels have been excavated in the mountainous karst areas of southwest china by the end of 2018 72 railway tunnels with a total length of 1000 km individual tunnels longer than 10 km have been built and 98 railway tunnels with a total length of 1600 km individual tunnels longer than 10 km are under construction or planned additionally 10 933 highway tunnels with a total length of 8800 km have been built including 3896 tunnels with a total length of 4300 km in carbonate areas fig 1 in addition a large number of tunnels have been built in the karst areas of the united states day 2004 south korea song et al 2012 shin et al 2002 2005 shin 2008 chae et al 2008 iran aghda et al 2016 tunisia redhaounia et al 2015 and so on however tunnel excavation in those areas has resulted in large hydroecological and environmental problems due to the intrinsic vulnerability of karst thus to minimize the impacts on these vulnerable and complex areas people must learn how to live with karst anagnostou 1995 perrochet 2005 park et al 2008 pesendorfer and loew 2010 hassani et al 2016 beginning with an analysis of the karst environment vulnerability and the drainage effects of tunnels early views on the impacts of tunnel excavation on hydrological and ecological environments are reviewed in this paper then the impacts of tunnel excavation on the hydrological system soil properties ecosystems and geological disasters in karst areas are summarized finally final considerations and future prospects are presented 2 the vulnerability of the karst environment and drainage effects of tunnel excavation 2 1 the karst environment and its vulnerability the karst environment consists of five components karst weathered residual soil karst morphology the karst hydrological system surface and underground air layers and karst biota yuan 1988a this system shows a double layer structure related to the interactions of the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere at the surface and in the subsurface karst environments are characterized by distinctive landforms related to dissolution and dominantly subsurface drainage gutiérrez et al 2014 because of this type of drainage unique patterns of surface and subsurface runoff occur on the one hand this hydrological pattern produces dry surface habitats and can lead to water shortages on the other hand the extent of the underground pipeline network varies greatly in different areas and the network can be easily blocked in low lying areas in cases of heavy rain causing local waterlogging in addition the direct connection between the surface and the underlying high permeability aquifers makes karst aquifers extremely vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic hazards e g chemical contamination and contaminants can be transported rapidly through tunnels in a larger region and are difficult to remediate reflecting the low threshold elasticity and fragile ecological environment of disaster prone karst areas tuyet 2001 gabrovšek et al 2011 ilona 2016 filipović marijić et al 2018 the soil layer in karst areas is very thin and the physical erosion rate is higher than the soil formation rate yuan 1988b once a soil is lost it is difficult to regenerate additionally the loss of soil aggravates karst drought as soil cover is among the largest water reservoirs in karst areas the above characteristics are one of the fundamental differences between soil vulnerability in carbonate areas and that in areas with other rock types and are also the reasons for the issues associated with land use in karst areas jiang et al 2006 kiernan 2010 smirnova and gennadiev 2017 due to the low quality and calcium rich soil environments plants in karst areas are mostly lithologically adapted slender and calcium loving querejeta et al 2007 lyu et al 2019 the growth rate of trees is slow and vegetation growth is limited by soil and water conditions consequently the vegetation in karst areas has a low degree of resilience and is more vulnerable than that in other areas nepstad et al 1994 baskin et al 1997 tenorio and drezner 2006 lawless et al 2006 moran et al 2008 the high vulnerability of karst environments produces a situation in which it is very easy to damage or destroy natural resources but extremely difficult or impossible to restore conditions back to a pristine situation even if remedial measures are taken the economic costs are usually very high parise and gunn 2007 in short the hydrological systems soil and ecosystems are the most sensitive factors in karst areas the impact of tunnel excavation on the atmospheric system is not clear and the main impact on karst landforms is karst collapse therefore this study mainly focuses on the influence of tunnel excavation on hydrological systems soil ecosystems and geological disasters 2 2 the drainage effect of tunnel excavation tunnels in karst areas are generally deeply buried and large scale geological disasters such as rock bursts collapse and water inrushes often occur during the construction process the most significant hydrogeological impacts that can occur during tunnel excavation in an aquifer are the barrier and drain effects vázquez suñe et al 2005 the barrier effect is caused by underground impervious structures located below the water table these structures reduce the effective transmissivity of the aquifer leading to a rise in the water table upgradient and a drop in the water table downgradient shin et al 2002 ricci et al 2007 shin 2008 deveughèle and zokimila 2010 the barrier effect may result in geotechnical and or environmental consequences and may affect pre existing infrastructure custodio and carrera 1989 marinos and kavvadas 1997 tambara et al 2003 paris et al 2010 the drain effect is caused by drainage tunnels which are designed to extract groundwater to avoid water loads but may have far reaching environmental and geotechnical consequences li and kagami 1997 chae et al 2008 vincenzi et al 2009 butscher 2012 the relative position of the tunnel and groundwater level is the key to producing a drainage effect if the tunnel is located above the regional groundwater level some epikarst springs may be drained affecting the shallow groundwater in the aeration zone if the tunnel is located below the regional groundwater level large springs or underground rivers may be drained and the groundwater level will drop significantly tunnel excavation penetrates karst fissures and faults and exposes karst caves moreover existing karst fissures expand under the action of a high pressure water head and then further develop and split forming new fissures increasing water conduction channels and destroying the aquifer structure as a result large amounts of surface water and groundwater are discharged into the tunnel through fissures and faults and the tunnel becomes a new centralized mean of drainage in the region fig 2 tunnel drainage causes changes in the hydrogeological regime and a progressive stabilization of discharge is observed until a new steady state is reached falcone et al 2008 celico et al 2005 however once the original water resource balance at the tunneling site is broken a series of ecological and environmental effects is triggered for instance water inrushing occurred in a high speed railway tunnel in southern spain during excavation with a peak flow of 800 l s after a short period of time spring discharges dried up gisbert et al 2009 the drawdown produced by tunnel excavation could cause hydrological hydrogeological and environmental impacts on groundwater dependent ecosystems vincenzi et al 2009 such as the exhaustion of water resources changes in water circulation and karst collapse in addition how will tunnel drainage affect soil and ecosystems this question is also a matter of concern fig 3 3 early views on the role of tunnel excavation in hydroecology and the environment in karst areas in historical research on the ecohydrological and environmental effects caused by tunnel excavation in karst areas some achievements have been obtained through a large number of scientific observations data analysis and numerical simulations koyama et al 2012 traditionally the influence of tunnel drainage on groundwater has been widely studied in terms of 1 changes in water resource distribution patterns 2 changes in the groundwater flow field 3 changes in the water circulation process and 4 changes in hydrogeochemical processes fig 4 table 2 3 1 impacts of tunnel excavation on the distribution pattern of water resources first tunnel drainage destroys the aquifer structure then the surface water and groundwater drain forming a cone of depression which expands with the drainage time until the tunnel drainage fully accounts for the recharge from the boundary fig 5 attanayake and waterman 2006 argued that the impact of underground engineering construction on the water environment was mainly caused by a decrease in water resources when there is no reservoir or large body of water near the tunnel the groundwater recharge above the tunnel may not occur fast enough to avoid a significant excavation induced water level drawdown kim et al 2001 moon and jeong 2011 the influential range of tunnel drainage and the amount of water resources to be drained vary greatly not only could the radius of influence range from one or two hundred meters to more than ten kilometers but the water loss also shows anisotropy karst aquifers are characterized by highly varied hydraulic properties that are a result of the complex interactions among karst conduits discrete fractures and the rock matrix ford and williams 1989 in addition the inhomogeneity of karst development the difference in the lithological assemblage characteristics of strata the development degree of faults and fissures in tunnel areas and the difference in the relative position between the tunnel and regional groundwater levels also play important roles zhan and park 2003 sun and zhan 2006 jin et al 2016 hadi and arash 2018 the existence of large karst caves thick limestone water conducting faults and tunnels located in the lower part of the groundwater table are more conducive to tunnel drainage aquifer destruction and differences in tunnel drainage aggravate the uneven distribution of karst water resources thus changing the spatial distribution pattern of water resources table 2 abundant monitoring data on draining water resources and lowering groundwater levels during tunnel excavation have been accumulated consequently there is widespread agreement about changes in the distribution pattern of water resources however in karst areas with different hydrogeological structures the influence of tunnels on the distribution pattern of water resources also varies therefore it is necessary to effectively summarize and establish a hydrogeological model for karst tunnels affecting the distribution pattern of water resources and hydrological processes in addition previous studies have focused on the impact of tunnel excavation on the spatial distribution of water resources while only a few studies have focused on the impact on the annual distribution and multiyear changes in surface water soil water and groundwater 3 2 impacts of tunnel excavation on the groundwater flow field under natural conditions karst groundwater runs along corroded channels from high to low elevations during tunnel excavation however karst groundwater is continuously discharged into the tunnel due to the drainage effect and the flow velocity and direction of groundwater change accordingly as a result tunnel drainage changes the hydrodynamic conditions of the tunnel site area and forms a new potential sink center fig 5 then the local hydraulic gradient is significantly enhanced and the groundwater runoff pattern changes significantly groundwater level decline is the most prominent manifestation of this flow field change the construction of subway tunnels may cause a significant local or regional drop in groundwater levels due to the seepage and removal of the surrounding groundwater into the tunnel kim et al 2001 at the same time tunnel excavation drainage may use static groundwater reserves to increase the recharge and expand the recharge boundary of groundwater thus changing the regional groundwater flow field two multitracer tests proved the connection between losing streams and numerous water inlets in a tunnel and these connections had a maximum linear distance of 1 4 km and velocities of up to 135 m d several of the demonstrated flow paths passed under previous groundwater divides mountain ridges proving that the tunnel had completely modified the regional flow system vincenzi et al 2009 in addition regional and local flow systems may also change as the groundwater level and velocity change because of the inadequate number of boreholes and natural springs near the tunnel site the groundwater flow field must be qualitatively studied to some extent by groundwater simulation software however due to the heterogeneity in karst aquifers and the uncertainty in the model itself its applicability in simulating karst aquifers is limited and the simulation results are often unsatisfactory shoemaker et al 2008 added a pipeline flow program based on the modflow 2005 open source program the hagen poiseuille equation and darcy weisbach equation were used to describe laminar and turbulent flow in a karst pipeline medium compared with an equivalent porous medium the pipeline flow program is more accurate in terms of water level and flow measurements modflow cfp has been tested hill et al 2010 applied gallegos et al 2013 giese et al 2018 and improved zargham et al 2018 however although modflow cfp can calculate the flow process of different nodes it does not consider the hydrodynamic process inside the pipeline the description of the flow characteristics in the pipeline is relatively fuzzy and the flow exchange between the pipeline medium and the fracture medium is represented by a linear equation assuming that the flow exchange is directly proportional to the head difference between the two which does not conform to actual flow exchange behavior therefore long term efforts are needed to improve existing models in addition in some karst valley areas there are several parallel tunnels in the same hydrogeological unit forming a tunnel group the influence of the tunnel group on the groundwater flow field is more complex and this complexity should be a focus in future research 3 3 impacts of tunnel excavation on water circulation tunnel excavation may accelerate or slow water circulation spectral analysis of precipitation and groundwater seepage records showed that seepage lagged precipitation by 3 months this delay was related to the advancement of the wetting front and an increase in the number of active flow paths rademacher et al 2003 additionally tunnel excavation penetrates cracks and fractures exposes karst caves changes the aquifer structure and increases the groundwater flow paths the unique fissure and network structure of a karst aquifer causes the tunnel water inflow to respond rapidly to rainfall and can have a larger range of impacts gisbert et al 2009 tunneling may broaden and shift capture zones leading to changes in the origin and age of groundwater and the migration of groundwater along preferential flow paths e g faults due to the drainage effect of the tunnel butscher et al 2011 moreover the influence of tunnel excavation on karst areas is more serious than in nonkarst areas a comprehensive hydrological monitoring program was implemented with four multitracer tests focusing on four sections of seven railway tunnels in a high speed railway line between bologna and florence italy the impact radius was 200 m in the thin bedded sequences but reached 2 3 4 0 km in calcareous and thick bedded arenitic turbidites linear flow velocities as determined from the peaks of the tracer breakthrough curves ranged from 3 6 m day in the thin bedded turbidites to 39 m day in the calcareous rocks average values from the four test sites vincenzi et al 2014 there are two main reasons for these differences the change in hydrodynamic conditions in the area caused the acceleration of groundwater movement in addition tunnel excavation strengthened the hydraulic links between adjacent aquifers the tunnel drainage formed a cone of depression which gave the aquifer enough space to receive external recharge water and strengthened the infiltration transformation of surface water to groundwater in addition the long term drainage of some tunnels also accelerates the dissolution of carbonate rock resulting in an increase in the permeability of the rock mass which in turn accelerates the water circulation fig 4 at present there are few quantitative descriptions of soil water in water circulation studies in karst tunnel areas the conversion process comprising precipitation surface water soil water groundwater and tunnel water may be a research hotspot in the future in addition due to the unique geological structure of karst areas the ability of karst areas to absorb rainfall is very strong it is only in the case of heavy or regular rainstorms that slope flow can occur while other forms of rainfall are absorbed by the surface zone whether tunnel drainage has an impact on the runoff generation mechanism in tunnel site areas has not yet been studied additionally whether the process of rainfall runoff generation is affected by tunnel drainage conditions is also a matter of concern 3 4 impacts of tunnel excavation on groundwater hydrogeochemistry and water environment tunnel excavation can cause changes in groundwater hydrogeochemistry in several ways tunnel drainage leads to a decrease in aquifer water pressure and changes in the geochemical equilibrium conditions the process of groundwater circulation accelerates the interaction between water and rock thus changing the chemical composition of the groundwater mossmark et al 2015 fig 4 and tunnel drainage destroys the aquifer s structure and promotes the mixing of groundwater from different aquifers thus changing the chemical characteristics of groundwater li and kagami 1997 studied the variations in groundwater level and chemical compositions during the construction of the songben tunnel project in japan when the tunnel passed through unfavorable strata such as coal bearing strata geochemical reactions would oxidize the sulfides in the strata produce sulfate and hydrogen ions and cause groundwater chemical anomalies these chemical anomalies caused the hydrolysis or dissolution of calcium bearing minerals and released calcium ions which lead to a change in the hydrochemical type and an increase in mineralization it was found that the changes in the groundwater chemical compositions were more obvious than the changes in groundwater levels the change in hydrochemical characteristics caused by tunnel drainage has also been noted in many other studies including studies on the subway system in seoul chae et al 2008 and the new colle di tenda road tunnel between france and italy banzato et al 2011 moreover hydrochemical changes are difficult to predict since they are dependent on geological and hydrological conditions and tunnel design these changes may have an adverse effect on the environment and could affect the lifespan of construction materials such as rock support drainage systems and sealing systems mossmark et al 2015 tunnel excavation very easily causes water pollution the wastewater from construction easily enters the groundwater system it is difficult to estimate the amount of contaminants that leak into the tunnel and these chemicals can be difficult to measure a study on the hydrochemistry of groundwater seeping into subway tunnels in seoul showed that tunnel excavation may affect redox conditions thus influencing the chemical properties of urban groundwater and leading to a significant increase in dissolved manganese and iron concentrations in urban groundwater chae et al 2008 it is believed that the blasting products such as nitrate and nitrite and the components of heavy metal rich minerals in the rock walls and waste residues which can be released by chemical reactions enter the water body during tunnel construction dust from tunnel excavation oil leakage from construction machinery waterproof grouting material and shotcrete anchor support material can also pollute the surrounding surface water in particular the liquid leaking from reinforcements containing harmful ingredients has some of the most significant impacts on the water environment some studies have shown that the content of acrylamide in tunnel drainage can reach 95500 g l when using a reinforcing agent containing acrylamide weideborg et al 2001 acrylamide is completely soluble in water and may cause acute lethal effects on fish or other aquatic organisms some ingredients and chemicals used in the preparation of mortars and grouting suspensions may be toxic neurotoxic or carcinogenic and may be irritants or corrosives their use is dangerous to both humans and the environment these toxic components can pollute karst aquifers and can have long lasting hazardous consequences for underground karst species both physically and chemically these materials rapidly destroy underground habitats and have killed an enormous number of rare endangered and endemic species bonacci et al 2009 previous studies have shown that karst tunnel construction accelerates the interaction between water and rock but whether it further changes the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of regional hydrogeochemical fields needs to be confirmed by observation data in addition whether tunnel drainage further promotes karstification has yet to be studied systematically in summary the distribution of karst water resources becomes more uneven due to tunnel drainage more importantly tunnel drainage directly causes groundwater drawdown and destroys karst aquifers and the flow field and geochemical characteristics of groundwater change accordingly in addition unreasonable construction practices also lead to groundwater pollution however due to the complex geological conditions and limited observational data in karst areas the impacts of tunnel drainage on soil and vegetation have been neglected in the research that does exist researchers have found that the physical and chemical properties of soil plant physiological processes growth rate and coverage in tunnel affected karst areas are gradually changing geological hazards especially subsidence or collapse are widespread in karst tunnel areas and have seriously affected the local ecological environment therefore it is necessary to sort the existing research summarize its patterns analyze its mechanisms and identify problems and directions for future research 4 impacts of tunnel excavation on soil properties as shown in fig 6 and table 3 the physical and chemical properties of soil can be modified and soil erosion can be accelerated by tunnel excavation in karst areas tunnel drainage can result in the drying up of surface water and the drawdown of groundwater cutting off the connections among surface water groundwater and soil water leading to a decrease in soil moisture and consequently impacting soil microbial communities and functions with the decrease in soil moisture microbial abundance and diversity the concentration of co2 in the soil will decrease significantly which may change the soil structure and physical and chemical properties potentially resulting in an increase in the soil bulk density and clay content and a decrease in organic matter and nutrient contents eventually the quality of the soil will decrease jiang 2019 at the same time the groundwater drawdown and surface collapse caused by tunnel drainage will further accelerate water circulation destroy the micromorphology of the soil disrupt plant root systems and finally accelerate soil erosion 4 1 changes in soil physical properties the influence of tunnel excavation and operation on soil physical characteristics is mainly manifested in the decrease in soil moisture and the increase in soil temperature table 3 tunnel drainage dries surface water and lowers the groundwater level resulting in reduced soil moisture liu et al 2019 due to the lack of monitoring data there are few studies on the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of soil moisture during the tunnel construction period the influence of subway tunnels on the increase in soil temperature has been a research hotspot in recent years with the main research methods being field measurements scale model simulations of the experimental platform theoretical analyses and numerical simulations cavagnaro and brulard 1997 glehn and bluhm 2000 subway operations result in an increase in air temperature and the temperature of the surrounding rock in the tunnel which in turn leads to an increase in soil temperature in such a system the trains are the heat source and the air surrounding rock and groundwater are the main heat conduction media ampofo et al 2004 moreover the changes in soil temperature show great temporal and spatial differences soil texture geological conditions stratum and structure and engineering conditions lining layer and impervious layer are the main factors influencing the spatiotemporal variation in soil temperature lee et al 2004 it is presumed that the driving factor is the increase in soil evaporation 4 2 changes in soil chemical properties in addition to the soil water contents the soil organic matter and ph values may also be reduced by tunnel excavation the decrease in groundwater level and the acceleration of water circulation both promote the transport of soil nutrients to deeper levels or into groundwater in one study the soil morphology the physical and chemical properties of soil horizons water fluxes in the saturated zone and tritium content in groundwater were determined at nine sites miller and chanasyk 2010 the results showed that the soil types were different between the recharge area with a shallow groundwater level 1 81 m and the discharge area with a deep groundwater level 2 60 m the leaching of carbonates from the b horizons was consistent with the downward groundwater flow and the high water soluble na levels in the three orthic soils suggested an influence from a shallower water table at some point moreover the unreasonable disposal of construction waste residue and liquid will lead to soil pollution 4 3 acceleration of soil erosion the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation may aggravate soil erosion until now little research has been conducted on the mechanism by which tunnel excavation induces soil erosion but many observations have demonstrated a correlation between coal mining subsidence and soil erosion sinha et al 2016 therefore we hypothesize that the ground subsidence caused by drainage may be a direct cause of accelerated soil erosion subsidence reshapes the surface structure and morphology steepens the slope and destabilizes the soil body in some areas thus accelerating gravitational erosion and hydraulic erosion simulation results have shown that the maximum modulus of erosion and the erosion volume of the subsidence basin without water logging would increase by 78 and 23 respectively compared with those of the original situation and that the edge of the subsidence basin is subject to the greatest acceleration in soil erosion meng et al 2012 in addition deposition of sediment can destroy plant roots and affect the uptake of water by plants the decrease in vegetation caused by a drop in water level and ground subsidence may be an indirect cause of the acceleration in soil erosion daniels 2010 sinha et al 2016 as the vegetation root system is destroyed or dies the water holding capacity of the surface weakens and rainfall induced soil erosion becomes more likely to occur 5 impacts of tunnel excavation on karst ecosystems because of the calcium rich rock the circulation of water and air and its unique double layer structure karst ecosystems have poor soil fertility poor water retention ability low vegetation coverage and low degrees of resilience due to the lack of a systematic surface water hydrological network in karst areas natural vegetation is mainly dependent on the consumption of groundwater resources for survival so vegetation is very sensitive to groundwater changes the decrease in groundwater level and soil water content caused by tunnel drainage has negative impacts on the ecological environment and ecological processes with specific results such as a reduced plant growth rate changes in plant physiological processes and changes in plant communities table 4 5 1 changes in plant physiological processes plants adapt to water stress by changing water absorption strategies and efficiency especially plants with dimorphic root systems in karst areas the surface roots of dimorphic root systems potentially take up water from the upper soil layers while deeper roots extract water stored in epikarst and even underground rivers williams and ehleringer 2000 kulmatiski et al 2006 heilman et al 2009 hasselquist et al 2010 when the groundwater level declines due to drought mining or tunnel excavation plants adjust their water utilization strategies and absorb deep groundwater fig 7 an analysis of the results of δ2h and δ18o analyses indicated that the drawdown caused by tunnel excavation in a karst valley induced a decrease in the soil water content which led to the transformation of the plant water absorption pattern from dominantly exploiting soil water sources in the rainy season to dominantly exploiting subsurface water sources in the dry season liu et al 2019 plants can also change their strategies and efficiency of water absorption by adjusting the size and density of vessels to adapt to changes in the groundwater level fig 7 the lumen areas of vessels were separately measured in 26 tree rings from six trees and the results suggested that vessel size and density were correlated with circumferential stem growth which is in turn governed by the local water supply schume et al 2004 different tree species also show different physiological characteristics oak showed a stress avoidance strategy involving a decrease in conduit size under drought leading to a reduction in water conducting capacity and a lower risk of cavitation in contrast pine reduced the carbon costs of the water conducting system during drought by decreasing the number and cell wall thickness of conduits while the lumen diameter and efficiency of water conduction may increase eilmann et al 2009 in addition stomatal control is also a strategy for plants to cope with water deficits and the main response is a reduction in stomatal conductance or stomatal closure due to variations in the water content and canopy water potential of different tree species the sensitivity of stomatal behavior also varies sparks and black 1999 zweifel et al 2007 5 2 decrease in plant growth rate the narrowing of tree ring width is an index for decreases in the tree growth rate the study of tree rings in woody species can provide information on past and present ecological controls on tree establishment growth and death including those related to climate and water availability bogino and villalba 2008 dussart et al 1998 esper et al 2002 máguas et al 2011 martin and germain 2016 witt et al 2017 the tree ring widths widen and narrow due to the rise and fall in the groundwater levels respectively stockton and fritts 1973 yanosky 1982 1983 1984 sloan et al 2001 lageard and drew 2008 the groundwater table has been shown to be the dominant factor influencing oak growth at one site especially during times of intensive drainage scharnweber et al 2014 some studies have attempted to use tree rings as an indicator of groundwater level decline caused by tunnel excavation zheng et al 2017 growth reduction caused by tunnel drainage can be easily identified by a dramatic decline in tree ring width fig 7 lowering of the groundwater table significantly reduces the growth rate of pine trees for 15 years and the effect can extend up to 1 km away from the tunnel axis zheng et al 2017 groundwater is the most important limiting resource for plant distribution and growth soil moisture and salinity affect natural vegetation growth and are closely related to the groundwater level a decrease in the groundwater level may lead to plant wilting and death therefore the concepts of the ecological water level of groundwater ecological balance of groundwater and threshold of groundwater level depth were proposed boutaleb et al 2000 horton et al 2001 and the maximum allowable water discharged from tunnels was determined based on the ecological water requirement of vegetation in addition land subsidence destroys plant roots leading to a decline in the growth rate and even death of plants daniels 2010 5 3 changes in plant communities tunnels and vehicles can inadvertently transport plant seeds which increases the likelihood of species invasion rutkovska et al 2013 and changes in plant community diversity one study found that approximately 32 3 of the plant seeds in a highway tunnel did not live near the tunnel entrance dark 2004 both the magnitude of seed deposition and the species richness in the seed samples from two motorway tunnels were higher in the lanes leading out of the city than in the lanes leading into the city indicating an export of urban biodiversity via traffic as proportions of seeds of nonnative species were also higher in the outbound lanes traffic may foster invasion processes in cities and may transport nonnative species to the surrounding landscapes lipper and kowarik 2010 at present it has been assumed that the increase in plant seed species in tunnels will cause species invasion and changes in plant diversity but more concrete conclusions will required additional observational data furthermore the destruction of the plant root system caused by ground subsidence and the decrease in plant growth rate or even death due to groundwater drawdown may also lead to a reduction in plant species or promote the gradual vegetation succession to xerophytes however whether the long term drainage of tunnels will lead to vegetation succession has seldom been studied and this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by observational data 6 impacts of tunnel excavations on karst environments geological hazards 6 1 the process of ground collapse caused by tunnel drainage collapse is often a side effect of tunnel excavation and is one of the most common geological hazards casagrande et al 2005 the development process of ground collapse caused by tunnel drainage can be divided into three stages fig 8 in the first phase groundwater maintains the natural water level and is relatively stable in the natural state in the bedrock a hole or funnel forms through dissolution at this time the soil is also affected by the buoyancy of the karst water and the resistance to sliding of the soil itself which allows the overlying soil to exist in a basically stable state in the second phase the groundwater level drops rapidly after a large amount of the tunnel is drained fig 8 the water flow process can cause erosion and movement of the soil in the surface overburden and karst conduit and gradually forms caves in the soil the surface soil shows signs of tension cracks and subsidence because of gravity the vibrations pressure and hydraulic pressure caused by gunstocks during construction are destructive and enhance the connectivity of deep and shallow karst fissures and conduits in the third phase with the further development of the soil cave the roof soil layer becomes increasingly thin when the negative vacuum pressure and the weight of the soil exceed the collapse resistance a collapse occurs 6 2 impacts of ground collapse tunnel excavation in addition to drainage may cause dramatic changes in the local hydrogeology leading to enhanced internal erosion the development of sinkholes and the subsequent formation of karst collapse milanovic 2000 bonetto et al 2008 vigna et al 2010 gutiérrez et al 2014 ground subsidence settlement and karst collapse are the most common changes table 5 according to incomplete statistics nearly all long railway tunnels built in karst areas in southwest china have experienced karst collapse to varying degrees in the pinglin tunnels of the taipei ilan expressway project taiwan the sudden groundwater inflow was up to 750 l s which led to a collapse at the tunnel face and a tunnel boring machine tbm in the pilot tunnel was trapped and damaged tseng et al 2001 although stiff lining segments were used and grouting mortar was utilized to fill any gap between the linings and surrounding soil investigations have demonstrated that surface collapses appear to be unavoidable fargnoli et al 2015 and have caused some damage to residential areas and buildings above the tunnels farrell et al 2014 lavasan et al 2016 6 3 interfering factors and preventive measures the change in effective stress and the increase in hydrodynamic pressure caused by tunnel drainage in the overlying loose soil layer are the most fundamental causes of ground subsidence areas with fluctuating groundwater levels and strong runoff zones are often prone to collapse and the change in hydrodynamic conditions is the main factor driving karst collapse fig 8 as has been confirmed by an abundance of observational data the most perceptible impact when tunneling with the earth pressure balance epb method is soil movement during tunnel excavation soil movements can be divided into short and long term movements short term movements are mainly caused by 1 ground loss during excavation which redistributes the stress in the soil and results in stress relief ercelebi et al 2011 2 injection of grout and 3 advancement of the tbm and consequent pushing of the soil pujades et al 2015 long term movements are observed after the excavation process and are associated with creep stress redistribution consolidation of the soil after drainage and perhaps soil consolidation resulting from groundwater changes due to the interaction between the tunnel and the aquifer ercelebi et al 2011 barrier effect or drain effect additionally groundwater ingress is another factor triggering ground subsidence during construction due to the instability of the cutting face large amounts of groundwater from leaking fractures and fissures can flow into the completed tunnel and this loss of groundwater produces an effective stress that leads to ground consolidation and ground surface settlement chen et al 2017 ground subsidence is obviously affected by rainfall which increases the groundwater level and the hydraulic gradient rapidly flowing water can carry large amounts of sediment which accelerates the development of ground subsidence ground subsidence always occurs or expands during the rainy season since the compressibility and thickness of the overlying strata vary from place to place it is postulated that differential ground surface settlement will also occur amorosi et al 2014 loganathan and poulos 1998 for double line or multiline tunnels tunnel spacing and construction sequences have a great influence on the amount shape and scope of ground collapse the ground collapse resulting from parallel tunnels is larger and wider than that resulting from a single track tunnel with the decrease in tunnel spacing a grouped caving effect will occur and the amount of collapse will increase chehade and shahrour 2008 several techniques including grout injection masini et al 2014 can be employed to avoid issues such as cracking tilting or settling to accurately predict settlement by analytical or numerical methods it is important to know the soil parameters furthermore steering parameters such as the face pressure or grout pressure in the annular gap can be adapted to the surrounding soil to ensure an unimpaired construction workflow 7 final considerations and future prospects in recent years in response to rapid economic development tunnel excavation in karst areas has continued to accelerate due to the lack of environmental protection awareness at the beginning of tunnel excavation and the unique ecological vulnerability of karst areas the negative effects of tunnel excavation on the ecological environments in karst areas are becoming more significant and are producing challenges for regional water resources and ecological security even potentially causing strong social repercussions in china south korea and the alps to analyze the impact of tunnel excavation on hydrology ecology and the environment a series of studies have been conducted and some advances have been achieved most of the existing studies focus on the specific manifestations and ecological environment effects caused by tunnel excavation it is agreed upon that the decline in the groundwater level caused by tunnel excavation is the basic reason for the observed ecological environmental effects however there are still some deficiencies in the explanations of the mechanisms by which tunnel excavation impacts hydrological processes vegetation and soil the evolutionary trends of hydroecological environmental effects and related research methods and means overall research on the ecological environmental effects of tunnel excavation is still relatively lacking the following aspects need to be addressed in the future 7 1 impacts of tunnel excavation on karst water resources and hydrological processes tunnel excavation often passes through karst aquifers forming a large artificial pipeline due to the uneven development of the water bearing medium and the complex hydraulic characteristics of karst aquifers the groundwater immediately flows into the tunnel after tunnel excavation resulting in varying degrees of surface water leakage and groundwater drawdown which further aggravates the uneven distribution of water resources and challenges the reliability of regional water resources the tunnel drainage forms a cone of depression with the tunnel as the center the local hydraulic gradient increases instantly the flow system is disturbed and the groundwater supply boundary expands all of which significantly alter the groundwater flow field many tunnels are located below the groundwater level in the process of excavation the formation of artificial pipelines and the release of high water pressures destroy the karst aquifer change the runoff path of groundwater strengthen the relationships between different aquifers enhance the interaction between water and rock and consequently change the water circulation process and the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater in addition unreasonable tunnel excavation practices can also produce water quality problems previous studies have focused little on soil water to improve the observations of soil water and carry out quantitative analysis of the transformation of precipitation surface water soil water groundwater and tunnel water long term monitoring experiments and numerical simulations should be conducted the ecohydrological effect of a single tunnel and the influence of a new tunnel on an existing tunnel have been abundantly researched the interaction and superposition effect among multiple tunnels have seldom been studied but will be a hot topic in future research establishing a monitoring network for a tunnel group is suggested to optimize the numerical simulation model and quantitatively depict the superposition effect of the tunnel group in addition the ecological environmental impact of extralong and deeply buried tunnels cannot be ignored whether such tunnels affect the ecological functions in mountain areas e g the alps is also worth studying to establish a monitoring network relevant research should be carried out and timely measurements should be obtained 7 2 impacts of tunnel excavation on soil properties the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel drainage results in a decrease in the soil water content which leads to changes in the soil microbial community function and co2 concentrations and to changes in the structural physical and chemical properties of the soil thus reducing the soil quality furthermore tunnel excavation not only accelerates water circulation but also causes ground collapse which destroys the soil microtopography and plant roots thereby promoting soil erosion however there are few studies in this area and no large observational dataset exists what are the mechanisms and processes behind this impact does tunnel drainage result in changes in the soil microbial community and functions and consequently changes in soil quality does tunnel drainage reduce soil quality by reducing soil moisture and enhancing leaching no related studies were found it is suggested that the systematic monitoring of soil physical chemical biological microbial co2 and erosion characteristics should be strengthened to explore the processes and mechanisms of the responses of soil characteristics to tunnel excavation at different spatial and temporal scales 7 3 impacts of tunnel excavation on ecological karst systems plants adapt to water stress by changing water absorption strategies and efficiency including through changes in conduit size and density stomatal closure and deeper root development a sharp decline in tree ring width indicates that the growth speed of some trees around a tunnel decreases and some trees even die which further affects the ecosystem in this area additionally tunnels also provide a pathway for the migration of plant seeds which can cause changes in biodiversity this is an interesting topic do these effects exist in other areas and if so what is the mechanism does this process affect other physiological processes of plants or even cause changes in plant communities around the tunnel these questions have yet to be answered by using 18o 2h 3h and 13c to analyze the changes in water absorption strategies and the efficiency of plants in tunnel affected areas and by observing the widths of tree rings vessels and stomata the changes in plant growth rate and physiological characteristics can be analyzed and used to explore the mechanisms of vegetation growth rate and physiological process affected by tunnel excavation by means of sampling remote sensing technology and modeling we can explore changes in vegetation coverage and plant diversity under tunnel disturbance conditions verify the possibility of species invasion in the tunnel site area and reveal the process of vegetation succession from aquatic or arbor vegetation to terrestrial xerophytic or shrub and herbaceous vegetation 7 4 impacts of tunnel excavation on karst environments geological hazards the groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation results in a decrease in groundwater buoyancy the movement of water flow accelerates potential soil erosion and forms soil caves with the development of soil caves and the action of gravity surface cracks subsidence and collapse appear gradually the rapid change in groundwater dynamic conditions is the main cause of collapse analysis and numerical methods can be effectively used to predict collapses and then carry out scientific grouting however at present collapses still occur frequently in the process of tunnel construction it is still necessary to carry out long term monitoring to better understand the mechanisms and patterns of collapses and to optimize the design concept and calculation parameters to improve the prediction accuracy moreover optimizing the construction scheme and avoiding a large amount of drainage may be the most favorable means to reduce collapse 7 5 prevention of hydrological ecological and environmental problems in the past workers have gradually reduced the negative impacts of tunnel excavation through geological hazard risk assessments advanced geological predictions improvements to lining materials and improvements to construction technologies however significant challenges remain the following work is still necessary before tunnel excavation it is necessary to carry out systematic surveys and monitoring of karst landforms and the hydrogeology establish a real hydrogeological conceptual model and accurately simulate and predict tunnel related geological disasters in order to make accurate and scientifically founded decisions during tunnel excavations to adapt to heterogeneous karst aquifers the existing analytical solution should be modified in the prediction of tunnel water inflow different methods for early warning index systems and engineering verifications should be proposed for tunnel projects with different geological structures in karst areas additionally the design scheme should be optimized such that the tunnel does not intersect areas with strong karstification or water saturation zones as much as possible for a tunnel under excavation the principles of dynamic investigation dynamic evaluation and dynamic construction should be adhered to during construction hydrogeological monitoring and investigation should be carried out emergency conditions should be dealt with in a timely manner prediction and evaluation should be upgraded the scientificity and reliability of previous evaluation methods should be revised and verified and construction strategies should be adjusted in a timely manner after tunnel excavation it is necessary to carry out hydrological and ecological environmental investigations and monitoring enhance the study of the classification and evaluation methods of ecological environmental impacts optimize the quantitative evaluation index system of the ecological environmental impact and propose evaluation criteria to improve the decision making and management of tunnel construction and operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

environment and aquaculture units the stackelberg game is applied and the results are compared with those of nash bargaining solution performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by its application to behesht abad river reservoir system iran results indicate that application of the model may reduce the eutrophication potential in the behesht abad water body by offering an equilibrium strategy comparing two decision making approaches stackelberg and nash bargaining also reveals that the leader in stackelberg as fine and constraint setter benefits from the premier position leading to higher environmental penalty tariffs less fish production capacities and consequently better water quality rather than the nash bargaining solution keywords multi pollutant waste load allocation equilibrium strategy ce qual w2 surrogate model fuzzy theory behesht abad river reservoir system 1 introduction to tackle the worldwide complex water quality challenges offering more efficient and practical management strategies are critical in protecting freshwater ecosystems and satisfying the sustainability criteria the water quality deterioration is of great concern in a reservoir system regarding the changes in self purification capacity and altered biogeochemical cycles the dam construction by changing the nutrient balance mayintensify the eutrophication potential in the impounded water and pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems due to the vulnerability of river reservoir systems the impacts of industrial effluents discharged to these water bodies are more highlighted aquaculture industries as one of the main contributors to food supplies and economic development by discharging excessive nutrient loads may increase algal growth deplete oxygen level and consequently augment eutrophication risk in receiving water bodies in this regard an effective management strategy to preserve the quality of water for its beneficial uses and prevention of adverse effects on the ecosystem is often appreciated waste load allocation wla programs refer to the determination of the amounts of pollutants to be discharged into a receiving water body under socio economic and water quality objectives and or constraints saadatpour et al 2019 involvement of various stakeholders with conflicting preferences and multi objective nature of wla problems may lead to a set of non dominated solutions by employing a multi objective optimization algorithm when objectives are in conflict any improvement in one goal could be achievable only by sacrificing others hence a compromised solution may balance the contradictory preferences game theory methodologies by equilibrating between the conflicting goals of players may result in a satisfactory solution to all the stakeholders madani 2010 and efficient management various methods of game theory have been applied to the water resources management as water transfer projects ahmadi et al 2019 conjunctive use of surface and

optimization wla programming model based on the stackelberg nash equilibrium strategy zhang et al 2018 developed a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for wla program with the use of stackelberg game aghasian et al 2019 used bankruptcy methods for conflict resolution in determination of allowable pollution load discharges to a river system under various scenarios considering uncertainties as an inherent part of water resources problems is essential to avoid defective planning some researches based on game theory approaches in water quality management have taken into account various types of uncertainties dealing with ambiguities and or randomness xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 mooselu et al 2019 an efficient perspective in dealing with water quality degradation is adjusting upstream discharges while benefiting from the water self purification capability in compliance with sustainable development in other words considering the dynamic waste assimilative capacity of water bodies and not focusing only on the critical conditions would result in cost effective wla programming with this regard temporal and spatial alterations of meteorological hydrological hydraulic features and water quality parameters should be taken into account although the profound knowledge of the hydrodynamic features of water bodies is required to depict the temporal and spatial variations of water quality scarce researches have been conducted to study the dynamic features of water quality characteristic in wla problems afshar and masoumi 2016 afshar et al 2018 in addition most of the previous studies have disregarded the multiple pollutant nature of the wla problems accounting for the interactions between water quality variables and the treatment technologies could result in a set of more economic and realistic decisions with stakeholders preferences saadatpour et al 2019 this research proposes an equilibrium strategy based s o framework to deal with the conflicting objectives in a mpwla multi pollutant waste load allocation problem aiming to reduce the eutrophication potential of river reservoir systems fuzzy membership functions have been formulated to cope with the fuzziness and imprecision associated with the objectives of various stakeholders ce qual w2 model and artificial neural networks ann as adaptive surrogate models have been developed to be linked with optimization algorithms to attain the equilibrium solutions by application of stackelberg and nash bargaining games the stackelberg game prioritizes the leader iran department of environment ir doe s decision over the followers decisions aquaculture industries however the players make the decisions simultaneously in the nash bargaining game minimizing water quality degradation and refinement of the environmental penalty tariffs while considering the enhancements of social status as addressed by increased employment rate have been accounted as ir doe s interests reduction of economic costs of wastewater treatment plants wwtp and also the environmental penalties and maximizing the revenue of fish production are regarded as objectives for the aquaculture units to specify the sequence of the decision making process the stackelberg game is abstracted as a bi level mpwla programming problem the hierarchical particle swarm optimization hpso algorithm is utilized to solve the sequential optimization problem the presented framework has been employed in the behesht abad river reservoir system to evaluate the practicality of the hybrid s o model and the stakeholder participations in the mpwla problem 2 model framework to derive the most desirable compromised solution between the stakeholders involved in the mpwla problem the wqsm i e ce qual w2 is linked with the 1 hpso in the stackelberg game application and 2 pso algorithm in simultaneous move approach nash bargaining theory in the stackelberg game abstracted as a bi level programming model a lower level optimization problem is formulated as a constraint to the upper level optimization problem forming a sequential decision system as assumed in this study the players have mutual influences on each other whereas the leader has higher authority in the decision making process the hpso is shaped in two levels consisting of two normal psos pso f optimizes the followers objectives whereas the pso l solves the leader s problem in which the decision variables are exchanged fig 1 the final solution derived from the proposed methodology would address the fish production threshold multi pollutant removal fractions environmental penalty tariffs for various pollutants and fish production capacities in different aquaculture units along the river reservoir system in the second approach the players ir doe and the pollutant discharge units make decisions simultaneously to tackle the computational burdens caused by the employment of the ce qual w2 in the s o framework various ann based surrogate models for water quality simulation have been developed in an adaptive pattern for this purpose ce qual w2 model is executed for 30 random mpwla scenarios and the generated data is stored in an archive the most significant and independent input data of various ann wqsms as the surrogate models have been determined employing pmi criteria in this regard the computational time of water quality response approximation would be reduced with a negligible harm to the accuracy in the adaptive framework in certain iterations the original wqsm is recalled to evaluate the new search space scenarios the new data set is then added to the archives of various ann wqsms for re sampling and remodeling mechanism decreasing the errors in the state variables approximations the state variables approximated by various ann wqsms would be employed for calculating the defined objectives in the optimization algorithm at any iteration flowchart of the proposed framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 case study behesht abad sub basin is one of the major water resource units in iran with 50 23 to 51 25 e and 32 1 to 32 34 n geographic coordinates and 3860 km2 in area the behesht abad river reservoir system is located in chaharmahal bakhtiari province in the central part of iran as shown in fig 2 the dam site is placed 2 7 km away from the intersection of behesht abad and kaj branches as headwaters of the reservoir the location of the behesht abad basin rivers and also fish farming units are depicted in fig 2 the prime aim of dam construction is the inter basin water transfer to zayandeh roud river the dam construction and operation would alter the waste assimilative capacity biochemical cycles and the nutrient equilibrium augmenting the eutrophication phenomenon friedl and wüest 2002 therefore it is highly essential to meet the water quality requirements in the supplying sub basin prior to dam construction some hydrological and meteorological features of the sub basin and reservoir are presented in table 1 according to water resource planning and management studies in the basin masoumi 2016 the intensive aquaculture activities in the studied region are the primary concerns due to nutrient loads discharging which lead to undesired algal growth oxygen depletion and unpleasant tastes and odor problems in the origin river basin such challenges restrict the reservoir performances bring on social dissatisfaction and pose a threat to the aquatic ecosystems influential parameters in the eutrophication status as phosphate nitrate ammonia and biological oxygen demand discharged from fish farming units 5 point source units located along behesht abad river reservoir system should be controlled in mpwla problem ir doe and the aquaculture units located along the behesht abad river reservoir system follow multi and contradictory goals in a management problem consisting of reduction of construction and operation costs of wwtp extending the aquaculture productions mitigation of water quality degradation in the water bodies and decline of reservoir eutrophication potential the involved stakeholders with discrepant interests and objectives participate in mpwla game to share the assimilative capacity of water resources equitably 2 2 equilibrium strategy stackelberg nash equilibrium game theory indicates that the outcome of strategic interactions provides acceptable solutions regarding all players preferences madani 2010 the stackelberg leader follower is a sequential move game by prioritizing the leader s decision over followers in which the leader leaders can take the first step in the decision system and have the higher authority by setting some limits influencing the followers xu et al 2017 after the leader s move the followers intend to maximize their payoff depending on the leader s decision in return the leader evaluates the response of followers and opts for the action with the largest payoff safari et al 2014 in this study the followers have equal positions to interact with each other and make decisions simultaneously 2 2 1 bi level programing problem blpp to reach a reasonable agreement and represent the sequential decision making with the priority of the leader the stackelberg game in the mpwla program is formulated as bi level programing problem blpp to deal with this hierarchical decision system the blpp has an optimization problem lower level as a constraint of another optimization problem upper level the objectives and constraints of the blpp are illustrated as eqs 1 4 in which the x and y refers to the leader s and followers decision variables the f x y and f x y indicate the leader s and followers objective functions gao et al 2011 and the g x y and g x y are the leader s and followers constraints respectively for each value of the optimized variable in the upper level x y is a response of the followers as lower level decision variables 1 min x x f x y st 2 g x y 0 3 min y y f x y 4 g x y 0 2 3 nash bargaining solution equilibrium formation is a process of interaction among individuals and groups solution to the nash bargaining provides a point in the bargaining set that maximizes the players utility gains relative to a fixed disagreement point nash bargaining solution f n s d is given by koçkesen 2019 5 f n s d arg max d s s s 1 d 1 s 2 d 2 s n d n s d b where s addresses the feasible set

specified alternative in the set s called the disagreement point denoted as d s is non empty convex and a compact subset of r2 and d s it is assumed there are s s which s d it provides a unique solution which satisfies the axioms such as pareto efficiency symmetry invariance and independence of irrelevant alternatives the conflicts among stakeholders in mpwla problem in behesht abad river reservoir system have been resolved as simultaneous and cooperative moves in nash bargaining game 2 4 simulation models ce qual w2 and ann wqsms taking into account temporal and spatial variation in quality and quantity properties and regarding the dynamic waste assimilative capacity calls for an appropriate simulation model ce qual w2 is a 2d longitudinal vertical hydrodynamic and wqsm which can be applied to geometrically complex water bodies and multiple reservoirs and branches cole and wells 2018 which complies with the requirements of the studied case of this research yet incorporation of a high fidelity wqsm with an optimization algorithm to achieve a high degree of precision requires a considerable investment of computational time ann has gained broad currency in an array of fields due to their simple structure capable of approximating even highly complex systems in this regard ann wqsms have been developed as a surrogate of the original hydrodynamic and wqsm the candidate input data of each ann wqsm approximate specific water quality parameter in the given check point of river reservoir system are determined based on mass balance equation and mathematical formulations the mathematical formulations describe the interactions and feed backs among various water quality parameters in eutrophication processes chapra 1997 cole and wells 2018 then the input data of ann wqsms are finalized based on intensive sensitivity analysis and pmi partial mutual information criteria li et al 2015 the time delays due to longitudinal distances between any check point and the external forcing functions locations for example between reservoir outlet check point and reservoir s headwaters have been included in some ann wqsms the output data of each ann wqsm have been extracted based on ce qual w2 model executions according to various random mpwla scenarios the ce qual w2 and developed ann wqsms depict special water quality parameter in a specific checkpoint in river reservoir system are coupled to pso hpso algorithm the data driven surrogate wqsms approximate system responses instead of high fidelity numerical hydrodynamic and wqsm ce qual w2 as the optimization algorithm progresses new search spaces are explored which the ann wqsms have not been experienced before in this regard in the specific iterations the ce qual w2 model is recalled to evaluate some particles of new spaces then the new evaluated particles have been added to ann archives for re modelling this re sampling and re modeling processes of ann wqsms lead to accuracy and efficiency in approximation of various state variables water quality parameters in any checkpoints 2 5 optimization algorithms pso and hierarchical pso the pso is a population based meta heuristic algorithm introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 according to the social behavior metaphor pso is initialized with a population of random particles communicating their information to conduct the swarm toward the best fitness achieved by each individual particle and by the whole population as the global best elhossini et al 2010 in the sequential optimization problem and also characterizing the superiority of the leader s position over the followers in the stackelberg game formulated as the blpp structure it is necessary to apply a hierarchical optimization procedure taking into account the nonlinearity of the objectives in the hierarchy of decision making procedure in this study the hierarchical pso hpso proposed by li et al 2006 is employed to solve the blpp with sequential decision approach this hierarchical algorithm framework includes two normal psos in which the pso l optimizes the leader s objectives as upper level and the pso f finds the follower s optimal values in lower level according to this decision making process output of one optimization problem is the input of another in the upper level the ir doe as the leader tends to enhance the dissolved oxygen do level in various monitoring points and also revise the environmental penalty tariffs of pollutant discharge violations the fish farming units as the followers in the lower level seek for minimizing the costs of wastewater treatment plants and also the environmental penalties imposed on offenders violating the pollutant discharge limitations 2 6 fuzzy objective functions it is a requisite to address the issue of uncertainty in water resources management problems involving ambiguous information and vague inter relationships imprecise goals of decision makers in mpwla problem could be formulated by employing fuzzy membership functions quantifying the utilities of the players the fuzzy membership function indicates the belonging of each value to a set varying in the range of 0 1 in which the higher degrees are more desired kerachian et al 2010 the developed environmental and economic utility functions to illustrate the goal satisfaction and deal with ambiguities in the mpwla problem are defined based on the experts viewpoints in mathematics environment management and fishery as below saadatpour and afshar 2007 soofiani et al 2012 koçer et al 2013 preference of the ir doe in supporting environmental conservation is defined as fuzzy membership function eq 6 6 λ d o j mean d o j k 6 2 7 do 6 1 do 6 in which λ is the membership degree of the do level in each monitoring station k and j refer to the wqsm time period and monitoring points and the mean indicates the average value of do concentration during the simulation period the economic goal of the ir doe is formulated as eqs 7 9 to show the leader s preferences in promotion of environmental penalty tariffs of the pollutants no3 po4 and cbod discharge violations the fuzzy membership function of po4 penalty tariff finepo4 is defined more stringent due to its significant role in the eutrophication problem as depicted in fig 3 in eqs 7 9 the finepo4 fineno3 and finebod are penalty tariffs of po4 no3 and bod respectively and λl describes the membership degree of environmental penalty tariff for a given pollutant l defined by ir doe 7 λ l f i n e p o 4 0 0001 f i n e p o 4 2 0 0148 f i n e p o 4 0 0058 8 λ l f i n e n o 3 0 00005 f i n

environmentally benign manner the followers pollutant discharge units in the lower level are seeking for reducing pollutants treatment cost which is defined in eq 10 10 λ x i 1 25 m e a n x i k s t d

removal fractions for the whole simulation period in each pollutant discharge unit are considered in the formulation the followers are also intending to decrease the payment of the environmental

eqs 10 and 11 the pollutants are restricted to cbod no3 and po4 in order to increase the revenue of fish production each aquaculture units objective is defined as eq 12 which is limited to the current fish framing capacities in this way the vagueness due to the relationships between the characteristics of the pollutant discharged and fish production capacities have been defined 12 λ p p i max p i β

of the pollutant discharged values due to the current and minimum capacities of fish farming production at each point source α and β are the positive constants which are set as 1 1 and 2 to consider the profit of fish farming units as the food production industries and enhancing the social and economic status in the society these values have been set according to the extensive sensitivity analysis and social and economic experts viewpoints the final formulation of the stackelberg game in the blpp structure is expressed as eq 13 13 m a x μ l min λ l f i n e i min λ d o j st 0 f i n e 50

behesht abad river reservoir wqsm setup the ce qual w2 model of behesht abad river reservoir system has been divided into 2 water bodies with 3 branches fig 2 it consists of 1 behesht abad river upstream from the reservoir and 2 behesht abad reservoir which extends upstream on both kaj and behesht abad rivers the behesht abad river reservoir water bodies as defined have been mapped as 56 longitudinal segments and up to 72 in depth layers behesht abad river reservoir bathymetry has been setup in ce qual w2 model based on geometrical maps information at the dam site reservoir surface volume elevation curve modeling in ce qual w2 represents a precise image of the reservoir geometry calibration and validation of reservoir water surface elevation wse and river flow velocity in ce qual w2 model have been followed based on data from water resources planning and hydraulic studies in behesht abad dam design landscape report 2011 the water resources planning and management studies a integrate whole water sources and sinks in behesht abad and zayandeh roud watersheds and b consider demand priorities in the origin and destination basin the governing mass balance equations in behesht abad reservoir in water resources planning management study are solved based on standard operation policies sop zamanipour 2017 the influential calibration coefficients determined by sensitivity analysis in ce qual w2 model have been estimated using information from masoumi 2016 and ziaie et al 2019 the behesht abad dam is under construction and no data is available for precise calibration of the model however the results of behesht abad river reservoir ce qual w2 model such as thermal and water quality profiles compare well with those of zayandeh roud reservoir with similar hydraulic and hydro climatological conditions to pursue the study five monitoring stations have been considered in segments 17 located at behesht abad river upstream of the reservoir 27 at the reservoir outlet 38 and 52 located in kaj river and the average of segments 22 and 55 at the confluence of kaj and behesht abad rivers inside the reservoir five major fish farming effluent tributaries are located at segments 11 33 36 41 and 47 as point sources numbered as 5 4 3 2 and 1 respectively the longitudinal representation of the system and the position of monitoring stations and pollutant discharging points fish farming units are depicted in fig 2 the behesht abad river reservoir system has been simulated based on 133 months data to cover major dry and wet periods the input sets of ann wqsms have been selected according to pmi measurement employing the developed software of li et al 2014 2015 on the available water quality and quantity values the 15 day averaging hydraulic meteorological hydrological and inflowing water quality flux data for the whole simulation period have been considered as the candidate input of anns the water bodies responses concentration of water quality variables derived from ce qual w2 executions at various monitoring points are regarded as output column in each ann wqsm the input vector considered for dissolved oxygen approximation consists of nitrate ammonia phosphate cbod and do inflow fluxes from headwaters 2 branches and tributaries 5 fish farming units water surface elevation outflow rate wind speed air temperature thermal inflow flux from headwaters and tributaries for the simulation period one month time delay has been considered for inflow fluxes of two headwaters kaj and behesht abad branches due to long spatial distances to monitoring point reservoir outlet in ann do model in reservoir outlet for ann do model development at reservoir outlet 62 columns of input variables and 11 850 rows of samples based on various random mpwla scenarios were introduced for more details nitrate ammonia phosphate cbod do thermal inflow fluxes 6 parameters with one month time delay for 2 headwaters no time delay for 5 tributaries one month time delay for water surface elevation outflow rate wind speed air temperature have been considered as input data of ann wqsm 6 2 2 6 5 4 2 62 approximate do concentration in reservoir outlet the values in the archive of ann wqsms are updated during the optimization procedure in each 100 iterations in pso algorithm and 20 iterations in hpso application for each check point and each state variable do no3 nh4 po4 and cbod a specific ann water quality surrogate model has been developed multi layer perceptron one hidden layer 18 to 30 neurons levenberg marquardt training function and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function for the hidden layer form the proposed ann models structure and architecture determined through trial and error procedure 70 of samples for training 15 for validating during the training and 15 for testing processes have been allocated randomly to improve generalization capability for expecting more reliable results the results of the ann wqsms approximation in comparison with ce qual w2 simulation results as shown in fig 4 a and b show acceptable accuracy and compatibility in different monitoring stations for various parameters considerable reduction in computational cost with negligible errors reveals the satisfactory emulation in employing the ann models in state variable approximations some statistical measures of do approximation by anns for various monitoring points are presented in table 2 3 2 optimization process to set up the optimization algorithms coded in matlab environment the values of parameters in pso are adjusted based on intensive sensitivity analysis there are 249 decision variables in the proposed fmpwla program which consists of 240 monthly wastewater removal levels for various pollutants 4 pollutants no3 nh4 po4 and cbod 5 fish farming units 12 months the environmental penalty tariffs for each quality variable 3 pollutants no3 po4 and cbod the allowable fish production capacity 1 threshold and 5 arranged capacities in each fish farming units these variables in the stackelberg game are divided into leader s the penalty tariffs and fish production threshold and followers monthly pollutants removal levels and fish farming capacities decision variables in two optimization levels which are exchanged during optimization process the pso algorithm as applied to nash bargaining theory the iterations and particle numbers have been set as 500 and 80 respectively in hpso developed for stackelberg game 150 iterations with 70 particles for lower level 75 iterations with 10 particles for upper level and 100 iterations in total have been 22 500 iterations for the whole optimization routine have been adjusted 3 3 model application the ann water quality surrogate models have been coupled with the optimization algorithms in an adaptive framework which recalls the ce qual w2 model for function evaluations and re modeling the anns to approximate the state variables in all monitoring stations in 10 day time intervals results of the model for averaged dissolved oxygen concentration at different monitoring stations are depicted in fig 5 the results clearly show pronounced enhancement in do level relative to the current situation however application of the stackelberg game in fmpwla problem have resulted in higher do levels in comparison with simultaneous approach nash bargaining game this may be attributed to the higher authority of the leader in the stackelberg game who is tending to enhance the water quality status in all monitoring stations the time series of the phosphate concentration as the restricting parameter in algal growth is represented in fig 6 as illustrated po4 concentration shows significant reduction in comparison with the existing condition at the reservoir outlet monitoring station 27 according to the proposed methodology in the stackelberg game ir doe sets the environmental penalty tariff and determines the threshold of fish production in each aquaculture unit to control the release of pollutants the average of no3 and cbod concentrations during the simulation period are also depicted in figs 7 and 8 respectively the results indicate pollutant reductions in comparison with the present condition addressing water quality improvement in different checkpoints as shown in figs 7 and 8 the higher levels of no3 and cbod are resulted in monitoring station 17 due to the intense fish farming at 5th fish farming unit before this checkpoint releasing high amount of pollutants application of the proposed methodology has resulted in penalty tariffs for various pollutants fig 9 the results of the application of both management strategies offered a remarkable rise in the current environmental penalty tariffs by compelling the fish farming units to reduce the discharged nutrients through the improvement of their treatment facilities or decrease in fish production capacities higher penalties will make units to comply with pollutant discharge standards and consequently the water quality status in river reservoir system will be improved it could also be concluded that the current penalty tariffs are inadequate and should be revised in order to preserve the quality of freshwater resources prioritizing the leader s decision over the followers in the stackelberg game which seeks for water quality enhancement and the revise on the environmental fees has led to higher penalty tariff than the nash bargaining solution in the nash bargaining game all the stakeholders the leader and followers have equal positions in the decision making process and there is no priority between the conflicting players therefore implementation of the results of stackelberg game is expected to lead to more enhancements in water quality this is in fact supported by figs 7 and 8 where concentration of no3 and cbod are slightly lower than those of the nash bargaining at all controlled checkpoints one may argue the compromise cost effectiveness of the increased tariff implementation of the stackelberg and nash bargaining game has resulted in fish production thresholds of 0 68 and 0 9 respectively the threshold as defined 0 1 imposes a restriction on the fish production capacities where higher values is a measure of larger fish production capacities stakeholders participation in the stackelberg game of fmpwla problem have caused more effective water quality improvement and less threshold of fish production capacity in contrast the stakeholders cooperation in the nash bargaining game results in larger values of fish production due to the equal status of pollutant discharge units and ir doe in the decision making process the derived fish production capacities in the aquaculture units from the stackelberg and nash bargaining games are compared with the current capacities in fig 10 the lower fish capacity in the stackelberg game could also be attributed to the leader s priority in the decision making process with priority of aquatic ecosystems protection in other words despite their tendency to gain the most profit from fisheries the followers in the stackelberg game prefer to lower their fish production to avoid higher environmental fees the outcome reveals that implementation of both management policies may decrease fish production relative to the current condition this is because intensive aquaculture activities in the studied area are one of the major pollution sources threatening the ecosystem s health and limiting water use purposes according to fig 10 the least percentage of fish production derived from the stackelberg game is shown at the 5th pollutant unit 11th segment which has the most intense fish farming activities releasing significant amount of nutrients to the receiving water body the carlson index introduced by carlson 1977 is calculated based on phosphate loading to assess the system s trophic state the carlson index values in reservoir based on the type of stakeholders participations in the decision making process are compared with the current status as illustrated in fig 11 the carlson index decreased by 5 7 units in all monitoring stations after applying the fmpwla programs according to the results employing the proposed water quality management policies have led to the mesotrophic condition in the river reservoir system except the reservoir outlet to achieve the oligotrophic state other pollution sources should be considered in fmpwla program however application of the proposed framework was satisfying in reducing the eutrophication potential in the water bodies and preventing the occurrences of undesirable water quality conditions comparing the results of two approaches reveals that developing fmpwla program in stackelberg game caused lower carlson index meaning the better water quality and more decline in the eutrophication potential in the receiving water systems reduction in phosphate level and carlson index and enhanced dissolved oxygen concentration differentiate implementation of stackelberg game in comparison with the nash bargaining game the higher environmental penalty tariffs less fish production capacities and fish production threshold offered in the stackelberg game are the main factors contributing to better water quality improvement 4 conclusion in this study an equilibrium strategy based fmpwla have been developed to reach an agreement as the equilibrium point of conflicting situation the stackelberg game as a sequential move game by priority of the leader over the followers was abstracted as blpp and then solved by employing a hpso algorithm to deal with the sequence of decision making in the fmpwla program nash bargaining theory as a simultaneous decision making approach with equal players was solved by pso algorithm coded in the matlab environment the final solution derived from the application of the proposed fmpwla illustrated the eutrophication potential reduction in various monitoring stations prioritizing the leader ir doe in stackelberg application by setting environmental fees and determining the fish production threshold has led to higher penalty tariffs less fish production capacities and less carlson index better water quality in comparison with the cooperative approach nash bargaining employment efficient combination of the presented tools could cause a sustainable management program due to the consideration of multiple pollutants participation of various stakeholders with conflicting objectives employment of 2d hydrodynamic and wqsm to optimal usage of the dynamic assimilative capacity of water bodies in a cost effective way and dealing with uncertainties during the objective evaluation fuzzy membership functions by addressing the system s ambiguities could bridge the gap between the realities and modeling thus the results would be more reliable and applicable the acquired results of the comprehensive program disclose that not only a compromise between the involved stakeholders with conflicting goals is made but the decision making process is also being facilitated by introducing the

5496,presence of various stakeholders in water resources management may arise conflicts and intensify the complexity of decision making to reduce eutrophication potential in a river reservoir system with discharges from aquaculture industries an equilibrium strategy based multi pollutant waste load allocation mpwla program is developed proposed mpwla model links a surrogate to ce qual w2 water quality model with artificial neural networks setting with an evolutionary optimization algorithm in an adaptive surrogate based simulation optimization framework environmental and economic objectives are formulated as fuzzy membership functions to deal with ambiguities and imprecisions in defining the goals of study to consider the conflicting preferences of stakeholders i e iran department of environment and aquaculture units the stackelberg game is applied and the results are compared with those of nash bargaining solution performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by its application to behesht abad river reservoir system iran results indicate that application of the model may reduce the eutrophication potential in the behesht abad water body by offering an equilibrium strategy comparing two decision making approaches stackelberg and nash bargaining also reveals that the leader in stackelberg as fine and constraint setter benefits from the premier position leading to higher environmental penalty tariffs less fish production capacities and consequently better water quality rather than the nash bargaining solution keywords multi pollutant waste load allocation equilibrium strategy ce qual w2 surrogate model fuzzy theory behesht abad river reservoir system 1 introduction to tackle the worldwide complex water quality challenges offering more efficient and practical management strategies are critical in protecting freshwater ecosystems and satisfying the sustainability criteria the water quality deterioration is of great concern in a reservoir system regarding the changes in self purification capacity and altered biogeochemical cycles the dam construction by changing the nutrient balance mayintensify the eutrophication potential in the impounded water and pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems due to the vulnerability of river reservoir systems the impacts of industrial effluents discharged to these water bodies are more highlighted aquaculture industries as one of the main contributors to food supplies and economic development by discharging excessive nutrient loads may increase algal growth deplete oxygen level and consequently augment eutrophication risk in receiving water bodies in this regard an effective management strategy to preserve the quality of water for its beneficial uses and prevention of adverse effects on the ecosystem is often appreciated waste load allocation wla programs refer to the determination of the amounts of pollutants to be discharged into a receiving water body under socio economic and water quality objectives and or constraints saadatpour et al 2019 involvement of various stakeholders with conflicting preferences and multi objective nature of wla problems may lead to a set of non dominated solutions by employing a multi objective optimization algorithm when objectives are in conflict any improvement in one goal could be achievable only by sacrificing others hence a compromised solution may balance the contradictory preferences game theory methodologies by equilibrating between the conflicting goals of players may result in a satisfactory solution to all the stakeholders madani 2010 and efficient management various methods of game theory have been applied to the water resources management as water transfer projects ahmadi et al 2019 conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources kerachian et al 2010 water allocation chen et al 2017 mooselu et al 2019 reservoir operation mojarabi kermani et al 2019 watershed managements moradi and limaei 2018 trans boundary water conflicts zeng et al 2019 and wla problems nikoo et al 2016 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 aghasian et al 2019 mooselu et al 2019 recently xu et al 2017 presented a bi level optimization wla programming model based on the stackelberg nash equilibrium strategy zhang et al 2018 developed a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for wla program with the use of stackelberg game aghasian et al 2019 used bankruptcy methods for conflict resolution in determination of allowable pollution load discharges to a river system under various scenarios considering uncertainties as an inherent part of water resources problems is essential to avoid defective planning some researches based on game theory approaches in water quality management have taken into account various types of uncertainties dealing with ambiguities and or randomness xu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 mooselu et al 2019 an efficient perspective in dealing with water quality degradation is adjusting upstream discharges while benefiting from the water self purification capability in compliance with sustainable development in other words considering the dynamic waste assimilative capacity of water bodies and not focusing only on the critical conditions would result in cost effective wla programming with this regard temporal and spatial alterations of meteorological hydrological hydraulic features and water quality parameters should be taken into account although the profound knowledge of the hydrodynamic features of water bodies is required to depict the temporal and spatial variations of water quality scarce researches have been conducted to study the dynamic features of water quality characteristic in wla problems afshar and masoumi 2016 afshar et al 2018 in addition most of the previous studies have disregarded the multiple pollutant nature of the wla problems accounting for the interactions between water quality variables and the treatment technologies could result in a set of more economic and realistic decisions with stakeholders preferences saadatpour et al 2019 this research proposes an equilibrium strategy based s o framework to deal with the conflicting objectives in a mpwla multi pollutant waste load allocation problem aiming to reduce the eutrophication potential of river reservoir systems fuzzy membership functions have been formulated to cope with the fuzziness and imprecision associated with the objectives of various stakeholders ce qual w2 model and artificial neural networks ann as adaptive surrogate models have been developed to be linked with optimization algorithms to attain the equilibrium solutions by application of stackelberg and nash bargaining games the stackelberg game prioritizes the leader iran department of environment ir doe s decision over the followers decisions aquaculture industries however the players make the decisions simultaneously in the nash bargaining game minimizing water quality degradation and refinement of the environmental penalty tariffs while considering the enhancements of social status as addressed by increased employment rate have been accounted as ir doe s interests reduction of economic costs of wastewater treatment plants wwtp and also the environmental penalties and maximizing the revenue of fish production are regarded as objectives for the aquaculture units to specify the sequence of the decision making process the stackelberg game is abstracted as a bi level mpwla programming problem the hierarchical particle swarm optimization hpso algorithm is utilized to solve the sequential optimization problem the presented framework has been employed in the behesht abad river reservoir system to evaluate the practicality of the hybrid s o model and the stakeholder participations in the mpwla problem 2 model framework to derive the most desirable compromised solution between the stakeholders involved in the mpwla problem the wqsm i e ce qual w2 is linked with the 1 hpso in the stackelberg game application and 2 pso algorithm in simultaneous move approach nash bargaining theory in the stackelberg game abstracted as a bi level programming model a lower level optimization problem is formulated as a constraint to the upper level optimization problem forming a sequential decision system as assumed in this study the players have mutual influences on each other whereas the leader has higher authority in the decision making process the hpso is shaped in two levels consisting of two normal psos pso f optimizes the followers objectives whereas the pso l solves the leader s problem in which the decision variables are exchanged fig 1 the final solution derived from the proposed methodology would address the fish production threshold multi pollutant removal fractions environmental penalty tariffs for various pollutants and fish production capacities in different aquaculture units along the river reservoir system in the second approach the players ir doe and the pollutant discharge units make decisions simultaneously to tackle the computational burdens caused by the employment of the ce qual w2 in the s o framework various ann based surrogate models for water quality simulation have been developed in an adaptive pattern for this purpose ce qual w2 model is executed for 30 random mpwla scenarios and the generated data is stored in an archive the most significant and independent input data of various ann wqsms as the surrogate models have been determined employing pmi criteria in this regard the computational time of water quality response approximation would be reduced with a negligible harm to the accuracy in the adaptive framework in certain iterations the original wqsm is recalled to evaluate the new search space scenarios the new data set is then added to the archives of various ann wqsms for re sampling and remodeling mechanism decreasing the errors in the state variables approximations the state variables approximated by various ann wqsms would be employed for calculating the defined objectives in the optimization algorithm at any iteration flowchart of the proposed framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 case study behesht abad sub basin is one of the major water resource units in iran with 50 23 to 51 25 e and 32 1 to 32 34 n geographic coordinates and 3860 km2 in area the behesht abad river reservoir system is located in chaharmahal bakhtiari province in the central part of iran as shown in fig 2 the dam site is placed 2 7 km away from the intersection of behesht abad and kaj branches as headwaters of the reservoir the location of the behesht abad basin rivers and also fish farming units are depicted in fig 2 the prime aim of dam construction is the inter basin water transfer to zayandeh roud river the dam construction and operation would alter the waste assimilative capacity biochemical cycles and the nutrient equilibrium augmenting the eutrophication phenomenon friedl and wüest 2002 therefore it is highly essential to meet the water quality requirements in the supplying sub basin prior to dam construction some hydrological and meteorological features of the sub basin and reservoir are presented in table 1 according to water resource planning and management studies in the basin masoumi 2016 the intensive aquaculture activities in the studied region are the primary concerns due to nutrient loads discharging which lead to undesired algal growth oxygen depletion and unpleasant tastes and odor problems in the origin river basin such challenges restrict the reservoir performances bring on social dissatisfaction and pose a threat to the aquatic ecosystems influential parameters in the eutrophication status as phosphate nitrate ammonia and biological oxygen demand discharged from fish farming units 5 point source units located along behesht abad river reservoir system should be controlled in mpwla problem ir doe and the aquaculture units located along the behesht abad river reservoir system follow multi and contradictory goals in a management problem consisting of reduction of construction and operation costs of wwtp extending the aquaculture productions mitigation of water quality degradation in the water bodies and decline of reservoir eutrophication potential the involved stakeholders with discrepant interests and objectives participate in mpwla game to share the assimilative capacity of water resources equitably 2 2 equilibrium strategy stackelberg nash equilibrium game theory indicates that the outcome of strategic interactions provides acceptable solutions regarding all players preferences madani 2010 the stackelberg leader follower is a sequential move game by prioritizing the leader s decision over followers in which the leader leaders can take the first step in the decision system and have the higher authority by setting some limits influencing the followers xu et al 2017 after the leader s move the followers intend to maximize their payoff depending on the leader s decision in return the leader evaluates the response of followers and opts for the action with the largest payoff safari et al 2014 in this study the followers have equal positions to interact with each other and make decisions simultaneously 2 2 1 bi level programing problem blpp to reach a reasonable agreement and represent the sequential decision making with the priority of the leader the stackelberg game in the mpwla program is formulated as bi level programing problem blpp to deal with this hierarchical decision system the blpp has an optimization problem lower level as a constraint of another optimization problem upper level the objectives and constraints of the blpp are illustrated as eqs 1 4 in which the x and y refers to the leader s and followers decision variables the f x y and f x y indicate the leader s and followers objective functions gao et al 2011 and the g x y and g x y are the leader s and followers constraints respectively for each value of the optimized variable in the upper level x y is a response of the followers as lower level decision variables 1 min x x f x y st 2 g x y 0 3 min y y f x y 4 g x y 0 2 3 nash bargaining solution equilibrium formation is a process of interaction among individuals and groups solution to the nash bargaining provides a point in the bargaining set that maximizes the players utility gains relative to a fixed disagreement point nash bargaining solution f n s d is given by koçkesen 2019 5 f n s d arg max d s s s 1 d 1 s 2 d 2 s n d n s d b where s addresses the feasible set of alternatives which is accessible to the stakeholders n is number of stakeholders if the stakeholders agree on a particular alternative they gain what they want otherwise they end up at a pre specified alternative in the set s called the disagreement point denoted as d s is non empty convex and a compact subset of r2 and d s it is assumed there are s s which s d it provides a unique solution which satisfies the axioms such as pareto efficiency symmetry invariance and independence of irrelevant alternatives the conflicts among stakeholders in mpwla problem in behesht abad river reservoir system have been resolved as simultaneous and cooperative moves in nash bargaining game 2 4 simulation models ce qual w2 and ann wqsms taking into account temporal and spatial variation in quality and quantity properties and regarding the dynamic waste assimilative capacity calls for an appropriate simulation model ce qual w2 is a 2d longitudinal vertical hydrodynamic and wqsm which can be applied to geometrically complex water bodies and multiple reservoirs and branches cole and wells 2018 which complies with the requirements of the studied case of this research yet incorporation of a high fidelity wqsm with an optimization algorithm to achieve a high degree of precision requires a considerable investment of computational time ann has gained broad currency in an array of fields due to their simple structure capable of approximating even highly complex systems in this regard ann wqsms have been developed as a surrogate of the original hydrodynamic and wqsm the candidate input data of each ann wqsm approximate specific water quality parameter in the given check point of river reservoir system are determined based on mass balance equation and mathematical formulations the mathematical formulations describe the interactions and feed backs among various water quality parameters in eutrophication processes chapra 1997 cole and wells 2018 then the input data of ann wqsms are finalized based on intensive sensitivity analysis and pmi partial mutual information criteria li et al 2015 the time delays due to longitudinal distances between any check point and the external forcing functions locations for example between reservoir outlet check point and reservoir s headwaters have been included in some ann wqsms the output data of each ann wqsm have been extracted based on ce qual w2 model executions according to various random mpwla scenarios the ce qual w2 and developed ann wqsms depict special water quality parameter in a specific checkpoint in river reservoir system are coupled to pso hpso algorithm the data driven surrogate wqsms approximate system responses instead of high fidelity numerical hydrodynamic and wqsm ce qual w2 as the optimization algorithm progresses new search spaces are explored which the ann wqsms have not been experienced before in this regard in the specific iterations the ce qual w2 model is recalled to evaluate some particles of new spaces then the new evaluated particles have been added to ann archives for re modelling this re sampling and re modeling processes of ann wqsms lead to accuracy and efficiency in approximation of various state variables water quality parameters in any checkpoints 2 5 optimization algorithms pso and hierarchical pso the pso is a population based meta heuristic algorithm introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 according to the social behavior metaphor pso is initialized with a population of random particles communicating their information to conduct the swarm toward the best fitness achieved by each individual particle and by the whole population as the global best elhossini et al 2010 in the sequential optimization problem and also characterizing the superiority of the leader s position over the followers in the stackelberg game formulated as the blpp structure it is necessary to apply a hierarchical optimization procedure taking into account the nonlinearity of the objectives in the hierarchy of decision making procedure in this study the hierarchical pso hpso proposed by li et al 2006 is employed to solve the blpp with sequential decision approach this hierarchical algorithm framework includes two normal psos in which the pso l optimizes the leader s objectives as upper level and the pso f finds the follower s optimal values in lower level according to this decision making process output of one optimization problem is the input of another in the upper level the ir doe as the leader tends to enhance the dissolved oxygen do level in various monitoring points and also revise the environmental penalty tariffs of pollutant discharge violations the fish farming units as the followers in the lower level seek for minimizing the costs of wastewater treatment plants and also the environmental penalties imposed on offenders violating the pollutant discharge limitations 2 6 fuzzy objective functions it is a requisite to address the issue of uncertainty in water resources management problems involving ambiguous information and vague inter relationships imprecise goals of decision makers in mpwla problem could be formulated by employing fuzzy membership functions quantifying the utilities of the players the fuzzy membership function indicates the belonging of each value to a set varying in the range of 0 1 in which the higher degrees are more desired kerachian et al 2010 the developed environmental and economic utility functions to illustrate the goal satisfaction and deal with ambiguities in the mpwla problem are defined based on the experts viewpoints in mathematics environment management and fishery as below saadatpour and afshar 2007 soofiani et al 2012 koçer et al 2013 preference of the ir doe in supporting environmental conservation is defined as fuzzy membership function eq 6 6 λ d o j mean d o j k 6 2 7 do 6 1 do 6 in which λ is the membership degree of the do level in each monitoring station k and j refer to the wqsm time period and monitoring points and the mean indicates the average value of do concentration during the simulation period the economic goal of the ir doe is formulated as eqs 7 9 to show the leader s preferences in promotion of environmental penalty tariffs of the pollutants no3 po4 and cbod discharge violations the fuzzy membership function of po4 penalty tariff finepo4 is defined more stringent due to its significant role in the eutrophication problem as depicted in fig 3 in eqs 7 9 the finepo4 fineno3 and finebod are penalty tariffs of po4 no3 and bod respectively and λl describes the membership degree of environmental penalty tariff for a given pollutant l defined by ir doe 7 λ l f i n e p o 4 0 0001 f i n e p o 4 2 0 0148 f i n e p o 4 0 0058 8 λ l f i n e n o 3 0 00005 f i n

environmentally benign manner the followers pollutant discharge units in the lower level are seeking for reducing pollutants treatment cost which is defined in eq 10 10 λ x i 1 25 m e a n x i k s t d

eqs 10 and 11 the pollutants are restricted to cbod no3 and po4 in order to increase the revenue of fish production each aquaculture units objective is defined as eq 12 which is limited to the current

the profit of fish farming units as the food production industries and enhancing the social and economic status in the society these values have been set according to the extensive sensitivity analysis and social and economic experts viewpoints the final formulation of the stackelberg game in the blpp structure is expressed as eq 13 13 m a x μ l min λ l f i n e i min λ d o j st 0 f i n e 50

sensitivity analysis in ce qual w2 model have been estimated using information from masoumi 2016 and ziaie et al 2019 the behesht abad dam is under construction and no data is available for precise calibration of the model however the results of behesht abad river reservoir ce qual w2 model such as thermal and water quality profiles compare well with those of zayandeh roud reservoir with similar hydraulic and hydro climatological conditions to pursue the study five monitoring stations have been considered in segments 17 located at behesht abad river upstream of the reservoir 27 at the reservoir outlet 38 and 52 located in kaj river and the average of segments 22 and 55 at the confluence of kaj and behesht abad rivers inside the reservoir five major fish farming effluent tributaries are located at segments 11 33 36 41 and 47 as point sources numbered as 5 4 3 2 and 1 respectively the longitudinal representation of the system and the position of monitoring stations and pollutant discharging points fish farming units are depicted in fig 2 the behesht abad river reservoir system has been simulated based on 133 months data to cover major dry and wet periods the input sets of ann wqsms have been selected according to pmi measurement employing the developed software of li et al 2014 2015 on the available water quality and quantity values the 15 day averaging hydraulic meteorological hydrological and inflowing water quality flux data for the whole simulation period have been considered as the candidate input of anns the water bodies responses concentration of water quality variables derived from ce qual w2 executions at various monitoring points are regarded as output column in each ann wqsm the input vector considered for dissolved oxygen approximation consists of nitrate ammonia phosphate cbod and do inflow fluxes from headwaters 2 branches and tributaries 5 fish farming units water surface elevation outflow rate wind speed air temperature thermal inflow flux from headwaters and tributaries for the simulation period one month time delay has been considered for inflow fluxes of two headwaters kaj and behesht abad branches due to long spatial distances

outlet the values in the archive of ann wqsms are updated during the optimization procedure in each 100 iterations in pso algorithm and 20 iterations in hpso application for each check point and each state variable do no3 nh4 po4 and cbod a specific ann water quality surrogate model has been developed multi layer perceptron one hidden layer 18 to 30 neurons levenberg marquardt training function and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function for the hidden layer form the proposed ann models structure and architecture determined through trial and error procedure 70 of samples for training 15 for validating during the training and 15 for testing processes have been allocated randomly to improve generalization capability for expecting more reliable results the results of the ann wqsms approximation in comparison with ce qual w2 simulation results as shown in fig 4 a and b show acceptable accuracy and compatibility in different monitoring stations for various parameters considerable reduction in computational cost with negligible errors reveals the satisfactory emulation in employing the ann models in state variable approximations some statistical measures of do approximation by anns for various monitoring points are presented in table 2 3 2 optimization process to set up the optimization algorithms coded in matlab environment the values of parameters in pso are adjusted based on intensive sensitivity analysis there are 249 decision variables in the proposed fmpwla program which consists of 240 monthly wastewater removal levels for various pollutants 4 pollutants no3 nh4 po4 and cbod 5 fish farming units 12 months the environmental penalty tariffs for each quality variable 3 pollutants no3 po4 and cbod the allowable fish production capacity 1 threshold and 5 arranged capacities in each fish farming units these variables in the stackelberg game are divided into leader s the penalty tariffs and fish production threshold and followers monthly pollutants removal levels and fish farming capacities decision variables in two optimization levels which are exchanged during optimization process the pso algorithm as applied to nash bargaining theory the iterations and particle numbers have been set as 500 and 80 respectively in hpso developed for stackelberg game 150 iterations with 70 particles for lower level 75 iterations with 10 particles for upper level and 100 iterations in total have been 22 500 iterations for the whole optimization routine have been adjusted 3 3 model application the ann water quality surrogate models have been coupled with the optimization algorithms in an adaptive framework which recalls the ce qual w2 model for function evaluations and re modeling the anns to approximate the state variables in all monitoring stations in 10 day time intervals results of the model for averaged dissolved oxygen concentration at different monitoring stations are depicted in fig 5 the results clearly show pronounced enhancement in do level relative to the current situation however application of the stackelberg game in fmpwla problem have resulted in higher do levels in comparison with simultaneous approach nash bargaining game this may be attributed to the higher authority of the leader in the stackelberg game who is tending to enhance the water quality status in all monitoring stations the time series of the phosphate concentration as the restricting parameter in algal growth is represented in fig 6 as illustrated po4 concentration shows significant reduction in comparison with the existing condition at the reservoir outlet monitoring station 27 according to the proposed methodology in the stackelberg game ir doe sets the environmental penalty tariff and determines the threshold of fish production in each aquaculture unit to control the release of pollutants the average of no3 and cbod concentrations during the simulation period are also depicted in figs 7 and 8 respectively the results indicate pollutant reductions in comparison with the present condition addressing water quality improvement in different checkpoints as shown in figs 7 and 8 the higher levels of no3 and cbod are resulted in monitoring station 17 due to the intense fish farming at 5th fish farming unit before this checkpoint releasing high amount of pollutants application of the proposed methodology has resulted in penalty tariffs for various pollutants fig 9 the results of the application of both management strategies offered a remarkable rise in the current environmental penalty tariffs by compelling the fish farming units to reduce the discharged nutrients through the improvement of their treatment facilities or decrease in fish production capacities higher penalties will make units to comply with pollutant discharge standards and consequently the water quality status in river reservoir system will be improved it could also be concluded that the current penalty tariffs are inadequate and should be revised in order to preserve the quality of freshwater resources prioritizing the leader s decision over the followers in the stackelberg game which seeks for water quality enhancement and the revise on the environmental fees has led to higher penalty tariff than the nash bargaining solution in the nash bargaining game all the stakeholders the leader and followers have equal positions in the decision making process and there is no priority between the conflicting players therefore implementation of the results of stackelberg game is expected to lead to more enhancements in water quality this is in fact supported by figs 7 and 8 where concentration of no3 and cbod are slightly lower than those of the nash bargaining at all controlled checkpoints one may argue the compromise cost effectiveness of the increased tariff implementation of the stackelberg and nash bargaining game has resulted in fish production thresholds of 0 68 and 0 9 respectively the threshold as defined 0 1 imposes a restriction on the fish production capacities where higher values is a measure of larger fish production capacities stakeholders participation in the stackelberg game of fmpwla problem have caused more effective water quality improvement and less threshold of fish production capacity in contrast the stakeholders cooperation in the nash bargaining game results in larger values of fish production due to the equal status of pollutant discharge units and ir doe in the decision making process the derived fish production capacities in the aquaculture units from the stackelberg and nash bargaining games are compared with the current capacities in fig 10 the lower fish capacity in the stackelberg game could also be attributed to the leader s priority in the decision making process with priority of aquatic ecosystems protection in other words despite their tendency to gain the most profit from fisheries the followers in the stackelberg game prefer to lower their fish production to avoid higher environmental fees the outcome reveals that implementation of both management policies may decrease fish production relative to the current condition this is because intensive aquaculture activities in the studied area are one of the major pollution sources threatening the ecosystem s health and limiting water use purposes according to fig 10 the least percentage of fish production derived from the stackelberg game is shown at the 5th pollutant unit 11th segment which has the most intense fish farming activities releasing significant amount of nutrients to the receiving water body the carlson index introduced by carlson 1977 is calculated based on phosphate loading to assess the system s trophic state the carlson index values in reservoir based on the type of stakeholders participations in the decision making process are compared with the current status as illustrated in fig 11 the carlson index decreased by 5 7 units in all monitoring stations after applying the fmpwla programs according to the results employing the proposed water quality management policies have led to the mesotrophic condition in the river reservoir system except the reservoir outlet to achieve the oligotrophic state other pollution sources should be considered in fmpwla program however application of the proposed framework was satisfying in reducing the eutrophication potential in the water bodies and preventing the occurrences of undesirable water quality conditions comparing the results of two approaches reveals that developing fmpwla program in stackelberg game caused lower carlson index meaning the better water quality and more decline in the eutrophication potential in the receiving water systems reduction in phosphate level and carlson index and enhanced dissolved oxygen concentration differentiate implementation of stackelberg game in comparison with the nash bargaining game the higher environmental penalty tariffs less fish production capacities and fish production threshold offered in the stackelberg game are the main factors contributing to better water quality improvement 4 conclusion in this study an equilibrium strategy based fmpwla have been developed to reach an agreement as the equilibrium point of conflicting situation the stackelberg game as a sequential move game by priority of the leader over the followers was abstracted as blpp and then solved by employing a hpso algorithm to deal with the sequence of decision making in the fmpwla program nash bargaining theory as a simultaneous decision making approach with equal players was solved by pso algorithm coded in the matlab environment the final solution derived from the application of the proposed fmpwla illustrated the eutrophication potential reduction in various monitoring stations prioritizing the leader ir doe in stackelberg application by setting environmental fees and determining the fish production threshold has led to higher penalty tariffs less fish production capacities and less carlson index better water quality in comparison with the cooperative approach nash bargaining employment efficient combination of the presented tools could cause a sustainable management program due to the consideration of multiple pollutants participation of various stakeholders with conflicting objectives employment of 2d hydrodynamic and wqsm to optimal usage of the dynamic assimilative capacity of water bodies in a cost effective way and dealing with uncertainties during the objective evaluation fuzzy membership functions by addressing the system s ambiguities could bridge the gap between the realities and modeling thus the results would be more reliable and applicable the acquired results of the comprehensive program disclose that not only a compromise between the involved stakeholders with conflicting goals is made but the decision making process is also being facilitated by introducing the

5497,increases in groundwater levels play an important role in triggering deep seated landslides as such it is important to be able to accurately predict variations in groundwater levels in order to select a more suitable method for the prediction of groundwater levels in relation to deep seated landslides a comparative study was conducted between a physical model and phenomenological model the physical model is a finite element seepage code named slide by rocscience the phenomenological model is a particle swarm optimization support vector machine pso svm in order to obtain more accurate calculated results from the physical seepage model the input parameters of the physical seepage model were calibrated by using a trial error method to compare the computed results with actual monitoring data the input data of the phenomenological model were also processed in order to obtain more accurate calculated results the results showed that the physical seepage model was difficult to well calibrate in the condition of less data and hence performed poorly the validation results showed that the phenomenological model performed better the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae of phenomenological model were 0 052 m and 0 043 m respectively compared with the values of physical seepage model were 0 92 m and 0 81 m respectively it means if constructing a satisfactory physical seepage model was difficult or understanding of physical process could not be considered the phenomenological model might be sufficient keywords deep seated landslides groundwater physical model phenomenological model 1 introduction groundwater level has been demonstrated as playing an important role in triggering deep seated landslides an increase in groundwater level is often accompanied by the occurrence of deep seated landslides sun et al 2012 wei et al 2019a an increase in the groundwater level may result in multiple processes that reduce the stability of a slope the process mainly involves increasing the positive pore pressure and reducing the suction of the sliding zone godt et al 2009 sun et al 2019b wei et al 2019b sun et al 2019a investigated the deformation process and the hydraulic characteristics of a deep seated landslide in zhejiang province china where they concluded that the slope deformation has a strong correlation with variation in groundwater level rosone et al 2018 investigated the mechanical influence of pore water pressure on the stability of a deep seated landslide and pointed out the effect that the passage of time had on the displacement of the pore water pressure variation induced by rainfall due to the importance of groundwater level in triggering deep seated landslides many researchers evaluated how the mobility of deep seated landslides is integrated with the calculation of groundwater level calvello et al 2008 proposed a hybrid model to calculate displacement rates based on rainfall data the model mainly contained a seepage finite element analysis to calculate changes in groundwater level induced by the rainfall then the displacement rate is calculated by an empirical equation conte et al 2017 proposed a simplified method to calculate the displacement rates of deep seated landslides the model used an analytical solution to evaluate changes in groundwater level then the calculated groundwater level was used as input parameters to predict displacement rates by a simple sliding block model cascini et al 2010 first used a seepage finite element procedure to calculate changes in groundwater level based on rainfall and monitoring data additionally a safety factor was calculated for conditions with different groundwater levels last an empirical model was used to describe the relationship between the safety factor and the displacement rate of the landslide and to calculate the displacement rates of the landslides therefore it is very important to be able to accurately calculate variations in groundwater level in order to predict the occurrence of deep seated landslides currently the primary methods for groundwater level calculation can be divided into two main approaches one approach utilizes a physical model and the other a phenomenological or empirical model cascini et al 2006 2010 the main feature of the physical approach is that it attempts to forecast variation in groundwater level by considering the hydraulic properties of the soil rock for the physical models there are mainly two different approaches one approach mainly utilizes a seepage finite element model to calculate variation in groundwater level while the other approach uses analytical solutions conte et al 2014 rahardjo et al 2010 currently the seepage model is the most commonly used as it is relatively easy to conduct for example cascini et al 2006 used a seepage model to calculate the groundwater regimes in a weathered gneissic covered landslide chung et al 2017 used the seep w model to explore the relationship between groundwater level and rainfall in order to determine the rainfall threshold for analytical solutions hong and wan 2011 proposed a model that combined a linear reservoir method and darcy s law to predict variation in groundwater level of a rainfall induced landslide in taiwan conte and troncone 2012 used a general time dependent function to evaluate the change in pore water pressure due to the rain infiltration the main advantages of the physical models are that they emphasize the physical process and have a better understanding of the mechanisms of increases in groundwater level vallet et al 2016 in addition it is not necessary to calibrate the parameters of physical models through field monitoring data the main disadvantages of the physical models are that they usually need several physical parameters such as hydraulic conductivity volumetric water content and matrix suction some of the physical parameters are difficult to obtain for complex landslides therefore there are some limitations in using physical models to calculate variations in groundwater level however the physical models also have some advantages such as help in understanding the system not like phenomenological models that rely on the relation between the input and output data the phenomenological model is typically called an empirical model the basis of the phenomenological model is use of continuous monitoring data the phenomenological model aims to predict changes in groundwater level by analyzing existing monitoring data khalil et al 2015 nourani and mousavi 2016 adamowski and chan 2011 juan et al 2015 the phenomenological models can be useful when it is difficult to build an adequate knowledge driven simulation model due to the lack of the ability to satisfactorily construct a physical model nourani et al 2014 2015 for example hong et al 2005 utilized a phenomenological model called a tank model to simulate variation in the groundwater level of the zentoku landslide in japan bernardie et al 2015 used a statistical impulse response model to simulate changes in the groundwater level of a deep seated landslide phenomenological models also include machine learning methods that have been used extensively to predict variations in groundwater level induced by rainfall huang et al 2017a krkač et al 2017 for example hong 2017 used artificial neural networks to forecast variation in groundwater levels of a landslide induced by a typhoon the main advantage of the phenomenological models is that the hydrological parameters of the sliding body and the boundary conditions of the landslide do not need to be considered due to the difficulty in collecting hydrological parameters for large landslides a phenomenological model may be more suitable for large landslides however phenomenological models usually do not emphasize the physical process and therefore can be limited in an understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in groundwater in addition field monitoring data is necessary when using phenomenological models as the input parameters of the phenomenological models must be calibrated by comparing field monitoring data with the calculated results to date both physical and phenomenological models have been used intensively to calculate variations in groundwater levels for landslides the relatively good performance of the two models relies highly on the features of a particular landslide for different cases various different approaches may be more accurate and comparisons are necessary to select the most suitable method however there are few studies comparing between physical models and phenomenological models to predict variation in groundwater level of deep seated landslides in order to highlight the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two methodologies this study utilizes a physical model and a phenomenological model to estimate the variation of groundwater level in a deep seated landslide the duxiantou landslide was used as a case study the physical model is a 2d finite element code called slide www rocscience com the phenomenological model is a machine learning method called particle swarm optimization support vector machine pso svm this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the study landslide section 3 presents a brief description of the two models section 4 presents the boundary conditions and the calibration process of the input parameters for the physical model then presents the processing of input data for the phenomenological model section 5 reports the validation results and a discussion about why the phenomenological model performed better the objective of this paper is to provide insights into the selection of groundwater level prediction methods which may provide a reference for similar slopes 2 study area and the field monitoring system the duxiantou landslide is located in longyou county zhejiang province china the average annual rainfall of the study area is about 1600 mm rainfall is mainly concentrated from april to june the slope of the upper part is about 20 in the lower part of the landslide the slope is about 35 the width of the front edge for the landslide was about 500 m and the length of the landslide was about 210 m fig 1 the mechanism that induced the landslide was excavation work for longli highway wei et al 2019a a cross section of the landslide is shown in fig 2 which was information from a geological investigation report the landslide body was mainly composed of unconsolidated quaternary sediment q4 the main component of the unconsolidated quaternary sediment was gravel soil gravel soil is regarded as a mixture of silt and gravel the content gravel for gravel soil is 40 50 and the common particle size of the gravel is from 4 cm to 8 cm the crystal tuff of upper jurassic was considered as the underlying bedrock according to the geological investigation report the landslide was thought to have been a result of slipping along the interface between the quaternary deposits and the upper jurassic bedrock a total of five hydrological boreholes were drilled to monitor groundwater levels however only two boreholes zk1 and zk3 were working as the remaining three boreholes collapsed there is an automatic water level recorder installed at the bottom of each borehole to measure groundwater level the recorders measured water level every 30 min the resolution of the monitoring recording is 0 8 mm a rain gauge was also installed on the roof of a house located about 200 m from the landslide site the rain gauge was an automatic rainfall tipping bucket recorder the rain gauge measured precipitation with a minimum value of 0 2 mm fig 3 shows observations of the groundwater level response to rainfall in 2009 the total precipitation from march 13 2009 to june 30 2009 was 504 mm and the maximum daily precipitation for this period was 47 mm the elevation of the groundwater was evaluated from the bottom of each borehole although there were only four months of monitoring recorded the available monitoring data was still considered as reflecting the critical hydrological response of the landslide site fig 4 shows the distribution of the monthly average rainfall at longyou station longyou station is located about 10 km from the landslide site fig 4 shows that most precipitation was concentrated from april through june and june had the highest rainfall generally a higher rainfall represents a higher groundwater level and a higher groundwater level usually means an increased probability of sliding therefore the groundwater level and rainfall recording of this period april through june could be considered as reflecting the critical hydrological response of the landslide site 3 methods 3 1 2d finite element seepage code for the physical model rainfall infiltration and the corresponding groundwater level changing are calculated by using a seepage code called slide www rocscience com based on darcy s law the governing equation is given as 1 x k x h x y k y h y q θ t where h is total head kx is the hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction ky is the hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction q is applied boundary flux θ is the volumetric water content and t is time the slide code is able to simulate unsaturated flows under steady state and transient conditions in this study transient seepage analysis was used to simulate the recharging process of groundwater level caused by the rainfall 3 2 pso svm model the phenomenological model used a pso svm model the support vector machine svm is a non linear kernel based regression method cortes and vapnik 1995 in order to build an effective svm model the parameters of the model cs and γ should be chosen properly in advance cs is named as a penalty parameter and γ is named as a kernel parameter parameter cs determines the tradeoff cost when minimizing the training error of the svm model parameter γ of the kernel function defines a nonlinear mapping from the input space to the high dimensional feature space hence the parameters cs and γ influence the efficiency and generalization performance of the svm model particle swarm optimization pso is an evolutionary algorithm developed in recent years bergh and engelbrecht 2006 that is usually used for solving optimization problems each particle in the algorithm indicates a potential solution to the problem a common feature is represented by position speed and fitness value the fitness value can be calculated through the fitness function which can estimate the merit of the particles considering the sensitivity of svm to the model parameters in this study we used pso to search for optimal parameters i e cs and γ of the svm model for prediction 4 selection of input parameters 4 1 boundary conditions and model calibration by back calculation this study focused on section a a to calculate the variation in groundwater level for the seepage model as section a a was considered the most dangerous geological section as the thickness of the silty soil with gravel layer is much smaller than the thickness of the gravelly soil layer and the similar material composition between the two layers the silty soil with gravel layer was considered as having a negligible influence on the overall trend of rainfall infiltration as such only two material types gravelly soil and crystal tuff were considered in the seepage model simulation the gravelly soil layer was regarded as the sliding body and the crystal tuff was regarded as the underlying rock the boundary conditions of the applied seepage model are shown in fig 5 the left side boundary ab was set as a constant head the right side boundary cd was also set as a constant head boundary with the water head equal to the groundwater level at the toe of the landslide a no flux boundary was set for the lower boundary bc the ground surface ad was regarded as a rainfall infiltration boundary and the daily unit rate of flow was equal to the measured daily rainfall data the initial conditions also play a key role in numerical modeling the actual elevation of groundwater level before each rainfall event was used as the initial condition in seepage simulations respectively the length of the model was 270 m and the height of the model was 150 m then the model was discretized into 1065 triangular elements in the transient state seepage analysis a rainfall hygrograph was used as input parameter to calculate the variation in groundwater level for each time step the time step of the model was set at one day in order to simulate the variation in groundwater level by using transient analysis the material of the sliding body should be regarded as unsaturated soil and assumed to have the characteristics of unsaturated soil the main characteristics of unsaturated soil are that the volumetric water content and the permeability coefficient of the soil are not constant volumetric water content and permeability should be regarded as functions of the matrix suction presently the relationship between matrix suction and permeability is usually described by the soil water characteristic curve swcc huang et al 2017b xie et al 2018 yang et al 2019 however measurement of swcc is usually difficult and time consuming due to the need for laboratory tests many empirical formulas have been used to fit the swcc among these empirical models the van genuchten formula is commonly applied van genuchten 1980 therefore we utilized the van genuchten model to reflect unsaturated soil characteristics in the transient seepage analyses the curve fitting parameters of the van genuchten formula were estimated with the retention curve code van genuchten et al 1991 for the transient seepage analyses saturated hydraulic conductivity was a very important parameter which determined the accuracy of the calculated results however the values of hydraulic conductivity are very sensitive to mechanical disturbance when the samples are collected in this study saturated hydraulic conductivity was selected by using a calibration process followed by paronuzzi et al 2013 as the hydraulic conductivity of crystal tuff was much smaller than the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soil and the elevation of the groundwater level was always higher than the upper boundary of the crystal tuff the effect of the crystal tuff layer on the overall transient seepage analysis could be neglected therefore only the hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil layer was considered for calibration then several seepage processes were simulated where the conditions for the hydraulic conductivities of the gravelly soil layer were assumed as different values in this way the outputs of various seepage models were then compared to the actual measured groundwater levels in zk1 and zk3 the calibrated period was from march 13th through june 5th a total of 84 days normally the performance of the physical and phenomenological models should be assessed by their precision and their accuracy respectively in order to obtain the best calibrated parameter the measures of the precision and accuracy were both used to verify the matching degree between the actual groundwater level and calculated groundwater level the measure of the precision was the root mean square error rmse and the measure of the accuracy was the mean absolute error mae the rmse was defined as eq 2 and the mae was defined as eq 3 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 3 mae 1 n i 1 n y i x i where x i is the measured value y i is the predicted value and n is the number of predicted values fig 6 a shows a comparison between the measured groundwater level and calculated groundwater level when considering different values of hydraulic conductivities in zk1 fig 6a shows that hydraulic conductivities have a great effect on the calculated groundwater level the calculated groundwater level is very sensitive to the values of hydraulic conductivities considering different values of hydraulic conductivities changing trends in the calculated groundwater level also present as a large difference in order to select the best fitting value of the hydraulic conductivities the values of rmse and mae when considering different hydraulic conductivities in zk1 are shown in fig 6b from the fig 6b it could be found that the difference between rmse and mae was small and the changing trend between mae and rmse were similar with an increase in hydraulic conductivities the values of rmse and mae first decreases to the smallest value and then increases gradually when the value of hydraulic conductivity was 2 10 4 m s the corresponding values of the rmse and mae were the smallest the smallest value of rmse was about 0 66 m and the smallest value of mae was about 0 51 m the variation trend of rmse and mae in this study also present the trend similar to that found in paronuzzi et al 2013 fig 6 shows that the calculated results obtained through the seepage model make it possible to assess the hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil to about k 2 10 4 m s the value of the calibrated hydraulic conductivity is relatively large however it has been demonstrated that a value of 2 10 4 m s is typical of gravelly soil materials which indicate that the calibrated value is reasonable paronuzzi et al 2013 fig 7 a shows a comparison between measured groundwater level and predicted groundwater level with different values of hydraulic conductivities in zk3 fig 7a shows that the difference between the calculated groundwater level and the measured groundwater level in zk3 was great the calculated values of the groundwater level were always larger than the actual values of the groundwater level this means that all the hydraulic conductivities used for calibration did not represent the actual hydraulic conductivities of zk3 fig 7b shows the variation trends of the rmse and mae in zk3 the difference between rmse and mae in zk3 was also small it could be found that the variation trends of the rmse and mae were quite different between zk1 and zk3 the variation trends of rmse and mae in zk3 were that first decrease to a relatively small value then increase gradually at last decrease rapidly to the smallest value fig 7b also shows that the values of rmse and mae in zk3 were much larger than the values of rmse and mae in zk1 the values of rmse and mae in zk3 were always larger than 4 4 m compared with the largest value of rmse and mae in zk1 were about 4 3 m even set the hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil as k 2 10 4 m s the values of rmse and mae in zk3 were also quite large this means that the performance of the calibration process for zk3 was inadequate due to the fact that the value of rmse was the smallest when the hydraulic conductivity was 2 10 4 m s for zk1 and no hydraulic conductivity could predict accurately the actual variation of groundwater recharging by rainfall infiltration for zk3 the value of 2 10 4 was regarded as the final calibrated parameter based on the van genuchten model and the calibrated value of hydraulic conductivity the used model parameters were determined as shown in table 1 then the fitted swcc was regarded as the input parameters in the validation process see section 5 1 4 2 processing input data for the phenomenological model processing input data was also important to improve the accuracy of the phenomenological model when using a phenomenological model to predict variations in groundwater level it is important to select the input variables as this may have an effect on the accuracy of the calculated results rajaee et al 2019 at present there are two different input variables commonly used one is elevation of groundwater level and the other is groundwater level fluctuation glf glf is defined as the difference between current and subsequent groundwater level data some researchers have demonstrated that the performance of forecasting models using groundwater level fluctuation were better than those using groundwater level krkač et al 2017 hong 2017 in this study groundwater level fluctuation was regarded as the input variable groundwater level fluctuation includes two main components 1 an increase due to rainfall named glfr and 2 a decrease due to drainage which is called glfd glfd represents the value of groundwater level as it decreases wei et al 2019a the relationships of glf glfr and glfd are shown in eq 4 4 glf glfr glfd groundwater level and local hydrological conditions were considered as the main influencing components of glfd wei et al 2019a proposed a procedure to calculate the value of glfd the method first presents the values of glf and the corresponding groundwater level in the same figure then considers the lower enveloping curve as representing the values of glfd the values of the glf and corresponding groundwater level of the monitoring data are shown in fig 8 as the rainfall data were counted in mm d fig 3 in order to keep consistency the groundwater level data were also counted in mm d the used groundwater level data in fig 8 were the average values of monitoring groundwater level in one day the used groundwater level data in fig 8 were the same as the groundwater level data presented in fig 3 the lower enveloping curves f x in fig 8 represent the values of glfd which are expressed as eqs 5 and 6 respectively totally 110 data points were used to decide the lower enveloping curves eqs 5 and 6 were determined by automatic fitting it also should be noted that the main limitation of the proposed method is that the method is an empirically based method and the fitting enveloping curves are only suited for the specific landslide 5 y z k 1 30 9715 3 015 x 1 0 0735 x 1 2 6 y z k 3 3 4886 0 392 x 2 0 01207 x 2 2 where y zk1 and y zk3 are the values of glfd for different groundwater level values in zk1 and zk3 respectively and x 1 and x 2 are the corresponding groundwater levels in zk1 and zk3 respectively the values of glfd in zk1 and zk3 could be obtained from eqs 5 and 6 the values of glfr can also be obtained by substituting glfd and glf in eq 4 then the values of the glfr which is induced by different rainfall conditions were calculated by the phenomenological model antecedent rainfall has been demonstrated as having a large effect on the value of glfr and the value of the glfr can be considered as a function of antecedent rainfall as such the effective period of antecedent precipitation is an important issue which needs to be addressed for different cases the effective period of antecedent rainfall was also different in this study the pearson correlation method was used to select the effective duration of the antecedent rainfall dai and lee 2001 a larger value of the pearson correlation coefficient means an increased relevance between the variables thus the value of glfr in zk1 and zk3 the precipitation on an earlier day s1 the sum of the precipitation two earlier days s2 three earlier days s3 four earlier days s4 five earlier days s5 six earlier days s6 and seven earlier days s7 were considered as variables in the correlation analysis table 2 shows the pearson correlation coefficient between glfr and the different effective periods of antecedent precipitation table 2 shows that the pearson correlation coefficient of s2 was the largest for both boreholes this means the rainfall that occurred two days earlier had the biggest impact on increasing the groundwater level the quick response of the groundwater level to precipitation also reflects the characteristics of the larger value of hydraulic conductivities which provides support that the calibrated results were reasonable han et al 2017 put forth that a strong relationship existed among the variables when the pearson correlation coefficient was greater than 0 6 from table 2 the pearson correlation coefficient of s5 was smaller than 0 6 and as such the 96 h four days was regarded as the influence duration based on the correlation analysis the input parameters of the phenomenological model were selected as rainfall on the same day p0 rainfall one day earlier p1 rainfall two days earlier p2 rainfall three days earlier p3 and rainfall four days earlier p4 the glfr of a future time was regarded as an output variable next precipitation from march 13 2009 to june 5 2009 78 of the database was chosen as a training sample and precipitation from june 6 2009 to june 29 2009 22 of the database was chosen as a test sample to verify model reliability rajaee et al 2019 made a review of the machine learning methods in groundwater level modeling the study considered that the majority of reviewed studies have been applied a data set size between 100 and 200 samples this can be considered as a suitable data set size in this study the used data set size was also between 100 and 200 samples so the number of the data set size in this study was acceptable the main statistical characteristics of the training samples and testing samples were shown in table 3 5 validation results 5 1 validation results of the physical model based on the calibrated parameters of the physical model the rainfall from june 6 2009 to june 29 2009 was also chosen as a test sample to verify the reliability of the physical models fig 9 shows the validation results of the physical model for the zk1 the rmse and mae of the validation results were 0 92 m and 0 81 m respectively the accuracy of the validation results was not as good as the calibrated results the agreement between the predicted groundwater level and the actual groundwater level was relatively poor for zk3 as the calibration parameters did not achieve good calculated results in the calibration process there is no doubt that the validation results were also poor fig 9b shows a comparison between the calculated groundwater level and actual groundwater level of the validation results for zk3 the rmse and mae of the validation results were 5 2 m and 5 17 m for zk3 all calculated results of the groundwater level were larger than the actual groundwater level this means that the physical model always overestimates the groundwater level for zk3 base on the validation results of zk3 the physical model was considered unsuitable for calculating the variation of groundwater level for zk3 we infer that the reason why the physical model performs better in zk1 as due to the thinner thickness of the sliding body for zk1 comparing the locations of zk1 and zk3 the location of zk1 was at the upper part of the landslide and the location of zk3 was at the lower part the lower part would likely have the thickness of its corresponding sliding body which is larger the larger thickness of the sliding body also means more complex hydrological conditions and larger spatial variation of the hydraulic properties which make the calculation more difficult 5 2 validation results of the phenomenological model fig 10 shows the validation results of the pso svm model for zk1 the rmse and mae of the validation results were 0 052 m and 0 043 m therefore the fit between the actual and predicted results is good for zk3 the rmse and mae of the validation results were not as good as the results of zk1 the rmse and mae of the validation results for zk3 were 0 079 m and 0 058 m fig 10 shows that the pso svm model is able to reproduce the groundwater levels in both of the two piezometers as well as the magnitude of their variation and the time occurrence of their peaks as such the phenomenological model satisfactorily modeled prediction of groundwater level 5 3 comparison between physical model and phenomenological model comparing the validation results of the physical model and the phenomenological model the phenomenological model better represented the relationship between rainfall and groundwater level and produced a better prediction of groundwater level we consider the main reason for this as due to the large spatial variation of the hydraulic properties of the deep seated landslide body for deep seated landslides the thickness of the sliding body was usually large the large thickness of the sliding body also means a larger spatial variation of hydraulic properties it has been demonstrated that changes of the groundwater level in landslides mainly depend on the hydraulic properties of the landslide body rahimi et al 2010 at present a finite element seepage model is used to explore the relationship between rainfall and the occurrence of landslides however most cases usually considered the landslide mass as a homogeneous material and ignore the spatial variation of the landslide properties for example rahimi et al 2011 used a seepage model to explore the effect of antecedent rainfall patterns on slope failure zhang et al 2018 used a seepage model to explore the influencing factors of the delay phenomenon for rainfall on slope stability in the above cases the landslide mass was considered as consisting of homogeneous materials however for deep seated landslides the thickness of the slide mass was always large meaning that the mechanism of rainfall infiltration to recharge the groundwater level is complicated thus it may be difficult to obtain an equally well calibrated process based seepage model to calculate the variations in groundwater levels in addition the hydrological conditions of deep seated landslides were usually complex and the spatial variation of the landslide properties was also large it has been demonstrated that obtaining the data about the heterogeneity is very difficult if not impossible therefore it will cost a huge expense of resources to create a well calibrated process based seepage model if considering the heterogeneity for the phenomenological model the calculation of groundwater level was only calibrated by the corresponding monitoring data in each hydrological hole for different hydrological holes the relationship between rainfall and groundwater level is also different thus in other words the phenomenological model has considered the own hydrogeological characters of the corresponding hydrological holes that is why the phenomenological model required less data rainfall time series than the process based model to calculate the groundwater level and performed better however although phenomenological models provide accurate performance and simplicity for prediction of the groundwater level they do not emphasize the physical process and therefore can be limited for understanding the recharging mechanism for groundwater levels it means if the objective is to have a simple model to forecast the groundwater levels or the understanding of physical process was not considered the phenomenological model could be used but in cases where process understanding is required there is still an urgent need to build the process based seepage model even if the effort involved is significantly greater than for the phenomenological model therefore in order to overcome the respective disadvantages of process based seepage model and phenomenological model an improved overview can be obtained by combining hybrid models that include phenomenological models with physically based mechanical models to calculate variation in groundwater level rajaee et al 2019 reviewed 67 journal papers which concerned about using machine learning methods for groundwater level forecasting the study recommended that the machine learning methods could be linked to physically based models such as modflow to develop an integrated model such that each method covers the weak points of the other method for example if a machine learning method generates accurate groundwater level in a special aquifer it can be used to prepare the groundwater level data required for modflow as the input 6 conclusion this comparative study investigated a physical model and phenomenological model for groundwater level prediction in a deep seated landslide the physical model utilized a 2d finite element seepage code named slide the phenomenological model was a machine learning method named pso svm in order to obtain more reasonable results the physical models were calibrated by using a trial error method to minimize errors between computed results and monitoring data the input data of the phenomenological model were also processed in order to obtain more accurate calculated results the calibrated results showed that the physical seepage model was difficult to equally well calibrate in the condition of less data the validation results also showed that the phenomenological model has better performance it means if the understanding physical process could be neglected or the objective is to have a simple model to forecast groundwater levels the phenomenological model will be considered as a good tool to calculate the groundwater level for deep seated landslides credit authorship contribution statement zhen lei

5497,increases in groundwater levels play an important role in triggering deep seated landslides as such it is important to be able to accurately predict variations in groundwater levels in order to select a more suitable method for the prediction of groundwater levels in relation to deep seated landslides a comparative study was conducted between a physical model and phenomenological model the physical model is a finite element seepage code named slide by rocscience the phenomenological model is a particle swarm optimization support vector machine pso svm in order to obtain more accurate calculated results from the physical seepage model the input parameters of the physical seepage model were calibrated by using a trial error method to compare the computed results with actual monitoring data the input data of the phenomenological model were also processed in order to obtain more accurate calculated results the results showed that the physical seepage model was difficult to well calibrate in the condition of less data and hence performed poorly the validation results showed that the phenomenological model performed better the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae of phenomenological model were 0 052 m and 0 043 m respectively compared with the values of physical seepage model were 0 92 m and 0 81 m respectively it means if constructing a satisfactory physical seepage model was difficult or understanding of physical process could not be considered the phenomenological model might be sufficient keywords deep seated landslides groundwater physical model phenomenological model 1 introduction groundwater level has been demonstrated as playing an important role in triggering deep seated landslides an increase in groundwater level is often accompanied by the occurrence of deep seated landslides sun et al 2012 wei et al 2019a an increase in the groundwater level may result in multiple processes that reduce the stability of a slope the process mainly involves increasing the positive pore pressure and reducing the suction of the sliding zone godt et al 2009 sun et al 2019b wei et al 2019b sun et al 2019a investigated the deformation process and the hydraulic characteristics of a deep seated landslide in zhejiang province china where they concluded that the slope deformation has a strong correlation with variation in groundwater level rosone et al 2018 investigated the mechanical influence of pore water pressure on the stability of a deep seated landslide and pointed out the effect that the passage of time had on the displacement of the pore water pressure variation induced by rainfall due to the importance of groundwater level in triggering deep seated landslides many researchers evaluated how the mobility of deep seated landslides is integrated with the calculation of groundwater level calvello et al 2008 proposed a hybrid model to calculate displacement rates based on rainfall data the model mainly contained a seepage finite element analysis to calculate changes in groundwater level induced by the rainfall then the displacement rate is calculated by an empirical equation conte et al 2017 proposed a simplified method to calculate the displacement rates of deep seated landslides the model used an analytical solution to evaluate changes in groundwater level then the calculated groundwater level was used as input parameters to predict displacement rates by a simple sliding block model cascini et al 2010 first used a seepage finite element procedure to calculate changes in groundwater level based on rainfall and monitoring data additionally a safety factor was calculated for conditions with different groundwater levels last an empirical model was used to describe the relationship between the safety factor and the displacement rate of the landslide and to calculate the displacement rates of the landslides therefore it is very important to be able to accurately calculate variations in groundwater level in order to predict the occurrence of deep seated landslides currently the primary methods for groundwater level calculation can be divided into two main approaches one approach utilizes a physical model and the other a phenomenological or empirical model cascini et al 2006 2010 the main feature of the physical approach is that it attempts to forecast variation in groundwater level by considering the hydraulic properties of the soil rock for the physical models there are mainly two different approaches one approach mainly utilizes a seepage finite element model to calculate variation in groundwater level while the other approach uses analytical solutions conte et al 2014 rahardjo et al 2010 currently the seepage model is the most commonly used as it is relatively easy to conduct for example cascini et al 2006 used a seepage model to calculate the groundwater regimes in a weathered gneissic covered landslide chung et al 2017 used the seep w model to explore the relationship between groundwater level and rainfall in order to determine the rainfall threshold for analytical solutions hong and wan 2011 proposed a model that combined a linear reservoir method and darcy s law to predict variation in groundwater level of a rainfall induced landslide in taiwan conte and troncone 2012 used a general time dependent function to evaluate the change in pore water pressure due to the rain infiltration the main advantages of the physical models are that they emphasize the physical process and have a better understanding of the mechanisms of increases in groundwater level vallet et al 2016 in addition it is not necessary to calibrate the parameters of physical models through field monitoring data the main disadvantages of the physical models are that they usually need several physical parameters such as hydraulic conductivity volumetric water content and matrix suction some of the physical parameters are difficult to obtain for complex landslides therefore there are some limitations in using physical models to calculate variations in groundwater level however the physical models also have some advantages such as help in understanding the system not like phenomenological models that rely on the relation between the input and output data the phenomenological model is typically called an empirical model the basis of the phenomenological model is use of continuous monitoring data the phenomenological model aims to predict changes in groundwater level by analyzing existing monitoring data khalil et al 2015 nourani and mousavi 2016 adamowski and chan 2011 juan et al 2015 the phenomenological models can be useful when it is difficult to build an adequate knowledge driven simulation model due to the lack of the ability to satisfactorily construct a physical model nourani et al 2014 2015 for example hong et al 2005 utilized a phenomenological model called a tank model to simulate variation in the groundwater level of the zentoku landslide in japan bernardie et al 2015 used a statistical impulse response model to simulate changes in the groundwater level of a deep seated landslide phenomenological models also include machine learning methods that have been used extensively to predict variations in groundwater level induced by rainfall huang et al 2017a krkač et al 2017 for example hong 2017 used artificial neural networks to forecast variation in groundwater levels of a landslide induced by a typhoon the main advantage of the phenomenological models is that the hydrological parameters of the sliding body and the boundary conditions of the landslide do not need to be considered due to the difficulty in collecting hydrological parameters for large landslides a phenomenological model may be more suitable for large landslides however phenomenological models usually do not emphasize the physical process and therefore can be limited in an understanding of the mechanisms behind changes in groundwater in addition field monitoring data is necessary when using phenomenological models as the input parameters of the phenomenological models must be calibrated by comparing field monitoring data with the calculated results to date both physical and phenomenological models have been used intensively to calculate variations in groundwater levels for landslides the relatively good performance of the two models relies highly on the features of a particular landslide for different cases various different approaches may be more accurate and comparisons are necessary to select the most suitable method however there are few studies comparing between physical models and phenomenological models to predict variation in groundwater level of deep seated landslides in order to highlight the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two methodologies this study utilizes a physical model and a phenomenological model to estimate the variation of groundwater level in a deep seated landslide the duxiantou landslide was used as a case study the physical model is a 2d finite element code called slide www rocscience com the phenomenological model is a machine learning method called particle swarm optimization support vector machine pso svm this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the study landslide section 3 presents a brief description of the two models section 4 presents the boundary conditions and the calibration process of the input parameters for the physical model then presents the processing of input data for the phenomenological model section 5 reports the validation results and a discussion about why the phenomenological model performed better the objective of this paper is to provide insights into the selection of groundwater level prediction methods which may provide a reference for similar slopes 2 study area and the field monitoring system the duxiantou landslide is located in longyou county zhejiang province china the average annual rainfall of the study area is about 1600 mm rainfall is mainly concentrated from april to june the slope of the upper part is about 20 in the lower part of the landslide the slope is about 35 the width of the front edge for the landslide was about 500 m and the length of the landslide was about 210 m fig 1 the mechanism that induced the landslide was excavation work for longli highway wei et al 2019a a cross section of the landslide is shown in fig 2 which was information from a geological investigation report the landslide body was mainly composed of unconsolidated quaternary sediment q4 the main component of the unconsolidated quaternary sediment was gravel soil gravel soil is regarded as a mixture of silt and gravel the content gravel for gravel soil is 40 50 and the common particle size of the gravel is from 4 cm to 8 cm the crystal tuff of upper jurassic was considered as the underlying bedrock according to the geological investigation report the landslide was thought to have been a result of slipping along the interface between the quaternary deposits and the upper jurassic bedrock a total of five hydrological boreholes were drilled to monitor groundwater levels however only two boreholes zk1 and zk3 were working as the remaining three boreholes collapsed there is an automatic water level recorder installed at the bottom of each borehole to measure groundwater level the recorders measured water level every 30 min the resolution of the monitoring recording is 0 8 mm a rain gauge was also installed on the roof of a house located about 200 m from the landslide site the rain gauge was an automatic rainfall tipping bucket recorder the rain gauge measured precipitation with a minimum value of 0 2 mm fig 3 shows observations of the groundwater level response to rainfall in 2009 the total precipitation from march 13 2009 to june 30 2009 was 504 mm and the maximum daily precipitation for this period was 47 mm the elevation of the groundwater was evaluated from the bottom of each borehole although there were only four months of monitoring recorded the available monitoring data was still considered as reflecting the critical hydrological response of the landslide site fig 4 shows the distribution of the monthly average rainfall at longyou station longyou station is located about 10 km from the landslide site fig 4 shows that most precipitation was concentrated from april through june and june had the highest rainfall generally a higher rainfall represents a higher groundwater level and a higher groundwater level usually means an increased probability of sliding therefore the groundwater level and rainfall recording of this period april through june could be considered as reflecting the critical hydrological response of the landslide site 3 methods 3 1 2d finite element seepage code for the physical model rainfall infiltration and the corresponding groundwater level changing are calculated by using a seepage code called slide www rocscience com based on darcy s law the governing equation is given as 1 x k x h x y k y h y q θ t where h is total head kx is the hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction ky is the hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction q is applied boundary flux θ is the volumetric water content and t is time the slide code is able to simulate unsaturated flows under steady state and transient conditions in this study transient seepage analysis was used to simulate the recharging process of groundwater level caused by the rainfall 3 2 pso svm model the phenomenological model used a pso svm model the support vector machine svm is a non linear kernel based regression method cortes and vapnik 1995 in order to build an effective svm model the parameters of the model cs and γ should be chosen properly in advance cs is named as a penalty parameter and γ is named as a kernel parameter parameter cs determines the tradeoff cost when minimizing the training error of the svm model parameter γ of the kernel function defines a nonlinear mapping from the input space to the high dimensional feature space hence the parameters cs and γ influence the efficiency and generalization performance of the svm model particle swarm optimization pso is an evolutionary algorithm developed in recent years bergh and engelbrecht 2006 that is usually used for solving optimization problems each particle in the algorithm indicates a potential solution to the problem a common feature is represented by position speed and fitness value the fitness value can be calculated through the fitness function which can estimate the merit of the particles considering the sensitivity of svm to the model parameters in this study we used pso to search for optimal parameters i e cs and γ of the svm model for prediction 4 selection of input parameters 4 1 boundary conditions and model calibration by back calculation this study focused on section a a to calculate the variation in groundwater level for the seepage model as section a a was considered the most dangerous geological section as the thickness of the silty soil with gravel layer is much smaller than the thickness of the gravelly soil layer and the similar material composition between the two layers the silty soil with gravel layer was considered as having a negligible influence on the overall trend of rainfall infiltration as such only two material types gravelly soil and crystal tuff were considered in the seepage model simulation the gravelly soil layer was regarded as the sliding body and the crystal tuff was regarded as the underlying rock the boundary conditions of the applied seepage model are shown in fig 5 the left side boundary ab was set as a constant head the right side boundary cd was also set as a constant head boundary with the water head equal to the groundwater level at the toe of the landslide a no flux boundary was set for the lower boundary bc the ground surface ad was regarded as a rainfall infiltration boundary and the daily unit rate of flow was equal to the measured daily rainfall data the initial conditions also play a key role in numerical modeling the actual elevation of groundwater level before each rainfall event was used as the initial condition in seepage simulations respectively the length of the model was 270 m and the height of the model was 150 m then the model was discretized into 1065 triangular elements in the transient state seepage analysis a rainfall hygrograph was used as input parameter to calculate the variation in groundwater level for each time step the time step of the model was set at one day in order to simulate the variation in groundwater level by using transient analysis the material of the sliding body should be regarded as unsaturated soil and assumed to have the characteristics of unsaturated soil the main characteristics of unsaturated soil are that the volumetric water content and the permeability coefficient of the soil are not constant volumetric water content and permeability should be regarded as functions of the matrix suction presently the relationship between matrix suction and permeability is usually described by the soil water characteristic curve swcc huang et al 2017b xie et al 2018 yang et al 2019 however measurement of swcc is usually difficult and time consuming due to the need for laboratory tests many empirical formulas have been used to fit the swcc among these empirical models the van genuchten formula is commonly applied van genuchten 1980 therefore we utilized the van genuchten model to reflect unsaturated soil characteristics in the transient seepage analyses the curve fitting parameters of the van genuchten formula were estimated with the retention curve code van genuchten et al 1991 for the transient seepage analyses saturated hydraulic conductivity was a very important parameter which determined the accuracy of the calculated results however the values of hydraulic conductivity are very sensitive to mechanical disturbance when the samples are collected in this study saturated hydraulic conductivity was selected by using a calibration process followed by paronuzzi et al 2013 as the hydraulic conductivity of crystal tuff was much smaller than the hydraulic conductivity of gravelly soil and the elevation of the groundwater level was always higher than the upper boundary of the crystal tuff the effect of the crystal tuff layer on the overall transient seepage analysis could be neglected therefore only the hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil layer was considered for calibration then several seepage processes were simulated where the conditions for the hydraulic conductivities of the gravelly soil layer were assumed as different values in this way the outputs of various seepage models were then compared to the actual measured groundwater levels in zk1 and zk3 the calibrated period was from march 13th through june 5th a total of 84 days normally the performance of the physical and phenomenological models should be assessed by their precision and their accuracy respectively in order to obtain the best calibrated parameter the measures of the precision and accuracy were both used to verify the matching degree between the actual groundwater level and calculated groundwater level the measure of the precision was the root mean square error rmse and the measure of the accuracy was the mean absolute error mae the rmse was defined as eq 2 and the mae was defined as eq 3 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 3 mae 1 n i 1 n y i x i where x i is the measured value y i is the predicted value and n is the number of predicted values fig 6 a shows a comparison between the measured groundwater level and calculated groundwater level when considering different values of hydraulic conductivities in zk1 fig 6a shows that hydraulic conductivities have a great effect on the calculated groundwater level the calculated groundwater level is very sensitive to the values of hydraulic conductivities considering different values of hydraulic conductivities changing trends in the calculated groundwater level also present as a large difference in order to select the best fitting value of the hydraulic conductivities the values of rmse and mae when considering different hydraulic conductivities in zk1 are shown in fig 6b from the fig 6b it could be found that the difference between rmse and mae was small and the changing trend between mae and rmse were similar with an increase in hydraulic conductivities the values of rmse and mae first decreases to the smallest value and then increases gradually when the value of hydraulic conductivity was 2 10 4 m s the corresponding values of the rmse and mae were the smallest the smallest value of rmse was about 0 66 m and the smallest value of mae was about 0 51 m the variation trend of rmse and mae in this study also present the trend similar to that found in paronuzzi et al 2013 fig 6 shows that the calculated results obtained through the seepage model make it possible to assess the hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil to about k 2 10 4 m s the value of the calibrated hydraulic conductivity is relatively large however it has been demonstrated that a value of 2 10 4 m s is typical of gravelly soil materials which indicate that the calibrated value is reasonable paronuzzi et al 2013 fig 7 a shows a comparison between measured groundwater level and predicted groundwater level with different values of hydraulic conductivities in zk3 fig 7a shows that the difference between the calculated groundwater level and the measured groundwater level in zk3 was great the calculated values of the groundwater level were always larger than the actual values of the groundwater level this means that all the hydraulic conductivities used for calibration did not represent the actual hydraulic conductivities of zk3 fig 7b shows the variation trends of the rmse and mae in zk3 the difference between rmse and mae in zk3 was also small it could be found that the variation trends of the rmse and mae were quite different between zk1 and zk3 the variation trends of rmse and mae in zk3 were that first decrease to a relatively small value then increase gradually at last decrease rapidly to the smallest value fig 7b also shows that the values of rmse and mae in zk3 were much larger than the values of rmse and mae in zk1 the values of rmse and mae in zk3 were always larger than 4 4 m compared with the largest value of rmse and mae in zk1 were about 4 3 m even set the hydraulic conductivity of the gravelly soil as k 2 10 4 m s the values of rmse and mae in zk3 were also quite large this means that the performance of the calibration process for zk3 was inadequate due to the fact that the value of rmse was the smallest when the hydraulic conductivity was 2 10 4 m s for zk1 and no hydraulic conductivity could predict accurately the actual variation of groundwater recharging by rainfall infiltration for zk3 the value of 2 10 4 was regarded as the final calibrated parameter based on the van genuchten model and the calibrated value of hydraulic conductivity the used model parameters were determined as shown in table 1 then the fitted swcc was regarded as the input parameters in the validation process see section 5 1 4 2 processing input data for the phenomenological model processing input data was also important to improve the accuracy of the phenomenological model when using a phenomenological model to predict variations in groundwater level it is important to select the input variables as this may have an effect on the accuracy of the calculated results rajaee et al 2019 at present there are two different input variables commonly used one is elevation of groundwater level and the other is groundwater level fluctuation glf glf is defined as the difference between current and subsequent groundwater level data some researchers have demonstrated that the performance of forecasting models using groundwater level fluctuation were better than those using groundwater level krkač et al 2017 hong 2017 in this study groundwater level fluctuation was regarded as the input variable groundwater level fluctuation includes two main components 1 an increase due to rainfall named glfr and 2 a decrease due to drainage which is called glfd glfd represents the value of groundwater level as it decreases wei et al 2019a the relationships of glf glfr and glfd are shown in eq 4 4 glf glfr glfd groundwater level and local hydrological conditions were considered as the main influencing components of glfd wei et al 2019a proposed a procedure to calculate the value of glfd the method first presents the values of glf and the corresponding groundwater level in the same figure then considers the lower enveloping curve as representing the values of glfd the values of the glf and corresponding groundwater level of the monitoring data are shown in fig 8 as the rainfall data were counted in mm d fig 3 in order to keep consistency the groundwater level data were also counted in mm d the used groundwater level data in fig 8 were the average values of monitoring groundwater level in one day the used groundwater level data in fig 8 were the same as the groundwater level data presented in fig 3 the lower enveloping curves f x in fig 8 represent the values of glfd which are expressed as eqs 5 and 6 respectively totally 110 data points were used to decide the lower enveloping curves eqs 5 and 6 were determined by automatic fitting it also should be noted that the main limitation of the proposed method is that the method is an empirically based method and the fitting enveloping curves are only suited for the specific landslide 5 y z k 1 30 9715 3 015 x 1 0 0735 x 1 2 6 y z k 3 3 4886 0 392 x 2 0 01207 x 2 2 where y zk1 and y zk3 are the values of glfd for different groundwater level values in zk1 and zk3 respectively and x 1 and x 2 are the corresponding groundwater levels in zk1 and zk3 respectively the values of glfd in zk1 and zk3 could be obtained from eqs 5 and 6 the values of glfr can also be obtained by substituting glfd and glf in eq 4 then the values of the glfr which is induced by different rainfall conditions were calculated by the phenomenological model antecedent rainfall has been demonstrated as having a large effect on the value of glfr and the value of the glfr can be considered as a function of antecedent rainfall as such the effective period of antecedent precipitation is an important issue which needs to be addressed for different cases the effective period of antecedent rainfall was also different in this study the pearson correlation method was used to select the effective duration of the antecedent rainfall dai and lee 2001 a larger value of the pearson correlation coefficient means an increased relevance between the variables thus the value of glfr in zk1 and zk3 the precipitation on an earlier day s1 the sum of the precipitation two earlier days s2 three earlier days s3 four earlier days s4 five earlier days s5 six earlier days s6 and seven earlier days s7 were considered as variables in the correlation analysis table 2 shows the pearson correlation coefficient between glfr and the different effective periods of antecedent precipitation table 2 shows that the pearson correlation coefficient of s2 was the largest for both boreholes this means the rainfall that occurred two days earlier had the biggest impact on increasing the groundwater level the quick response of the groundwater level to precipitation also reflects the characteristics of the larger value of hydraulic conductivities which provides support that the calibrated results were reasonable han et al 2017 put forth that a strong relationship existed among the variables when the pearson correlation coefficient was greater than 0 6 from table 2 the pearson correlation coefficient of s5 was smaller than 0 6 and as such the 96 h four days was regarded as the influence duration based on the correlation analysis the input parameters of the phenomenological model were selected as rainfall on the same day p0 rainfall one day earlier p1 rainfall two days earlier p2 rainfall three days earlier p3 and rainfall four days earlier p4 the glfr of a future time was regarded as an output variable next precipitation from march 13 2009 to june 5 2009 78 of the database was chosen as a training sample and precipitation from june 6 2009 to june 29 2009 22 of the database was chosen as a test sample to verify model reliability rajaee et al 2019 made a review of the machine learning methods in groundwater level modeling the study considered that the majority of reviewed studies have been applied a data set size between 100 and 200 samples this can be considered as a suitable data set size in this study the used data set size was also between 100 and 200 samples so the number of the data set size in this study was acceptable the main statistical characteristics of the training samples and testing samples were shown in table 3 5 validation results 5 1 validation results of the physical model based on the calibrated parameters of the physical model the rainfall from june 6 2009 to june 29 2009 was also chosen as a test sample to verify the reliability of the physical models fig 9 shows the validation results of the physical model for the zk1 the rmse and mae of the validation results were 0 92 m and 0 81 m respectively the accuracy of the validation results was not as good as the calibrated results the agreement between the predicted groundwater level and the actual groundwater level was relatively poor for zk3 as the calibration parameters did not achieve good calculated results in the calibration process there is no doubt that the validation results were also poor fig 9b shows a comparison between the calculated groundwater level and actual groundwater level of the validation results for zk3 the rmse and mae of the validation results were 5 2 m and 5 17 m for zk3 all calculated results of the groundwater level were larger than the actual groundwater level this means that the physical model always overestimates the groundwater level for zk3 base on the validation results of zk3 the physical model was considered unsuitable for calculating the variation of groundwater level for zk3 we infer that the reason why the physical model performs better in zk1 as due to the thinner thickness of the sliding body for zk1 comparing the locations of zk1 and zk3 the location of zk1 was at the upper part of the landslide and the location of zk3 was at the lower part the lower part would likely have the thickness of its corresponding sliding body which is larger the larger thickness of the sliding body also means more complex hydrological conditions and larger spatial variation of the hydraulic properties which make the calculation more difficult 5 2 validation results of the phenomenological model fig 10 shows the validation results of the pso svm model for zk1 the rmse and mae of the validation results were 0 052 m and 0 043 m therefore the fit between the actual and predicted results is good for zk3 the rmse and mae of the validation results were not as good as the results of zk1 the rmse and mae of the validation results for zk3 were 0 079 m and 0 058 m fig 10 shows that the pso svm model is able to reproduce the groundwater levels in both of the two piezometers as well as the magnitude of their variation and the time occurrence of their peaks as such the phenomenological model satisfactorily modeled prediction of groundwater level 5 3 comparison between physical model and phenomenological model comparing the validation results of the physical model and the phenomenological model the phenomenological model better represented the relationship between rainfall and groundwater level and produced a better prediction of groundwater level we consider the main reason for this as due to the large spatial variation of the hydraulic properties of the deep seated landslide body for deep seated landslides the thickness of the sliding body was usually large the large thickness of the sliding body also means a larger spatial variation of hydraulic properties it has been demonstrated that changes of the groundwater level in landslides mainly depend on the hydraulic properties of the landslide body rahimi et al 2010 at present a finite element seepage model is used to explore the relationship between rainfall and the occurrence of landslides however most cases usually considered the landslide mass as a homogeneous material and ignore the spatial variation of the landslide properties for example rahimi et al 2011 used a seepage model to explore the effect of antecedent rainfall patterns on slope failure zhang et al 2018 used a seepage model to explore the influencing factors of the delay phenomenon for rainfall on slope stability in the above cases the landslide mass was considered as consisting of homogeneous materials however for deep seated landslides the thickness of the slide mass was always large meaning that the mechanism of rainfall infiltration to recharge the groundwater level is complicated thus it may be difficult to obtain an equally well calibrated process based seepage model to calculate the variations in groundwater levels in addition the hydrological conditions of deep seated landslides were usually complex and the spatial variation of the landslide properties was also large it has been demonstrated that obtaining the data about the heterogeneity is very difficult if not impossible therefore it will cost a huge expense of resources to create a well calibrated process based seepage model if considering the heterogeneity for the phenomenological model the calculation of groundwater level was only calibrated by the corresponding monitoring data in each hydrological hole for different hydrological holes the relationship between rainfall and groundwater level is also different thus in other words the phenomenological model has considered the own hydrogeological characters of the corresponding hydrological holes that is why the phenomenological model required less data rainfall time series than the process based model to calculate the groundwater level and performed better however although phenomenological models provide accurate performance and simplicity for prediction of the groundwater level they do not emphasize the physical process and therefore can be limited for understanding the recharging mechanism for groundwater levels it means if the objective is to have a simple model to forecast the groundwater levels or the understanding of physical process was not considered the phenomenological model could be used but in cases where process understanding is required there is still an urgent need to build the process based seepage model even if the effort involved is significantly greater than for the phenomenological model therefore in order to overcome the respective disadvantages of process based seepage model and phenomenological model an improved overview can be obtained by combining hybrid models that include phenomenological models with physically based mechanical models to calculate variation in groundwater level rajaee et al 2019 reviewed 67 journal papers which concerned about using machine learning methods for groundwater level forecasting the study recommended that the machine learning methods could be linked to physically based models such as modflow to develop an integrated model such that each method covers the weak points of the other method for example if a machine learning method generates accurate groundwater level in a special aquifer it can be used to prepare the groundwater level data required for modflow as the input 6 conclusion this comparative study investigated a physical model and phenomenological model for groundwater level prediction in a deep seated landslide the physical model utilized a 2d finite element seepage code named slide the phenomenological model was a machine learning method named pso svm in order to obtain more reasonable results the physical models were calibrated by using a trial error method to minimize errors between computed results and monitoring data the input data of the phenomenological model were also processed in order to obtain more accurate calculated results the calibrated results showed that the physical seepage model was difficult to equally well calibrate in the condition of less data the validation results also showed that the phenomenological model has better performance it means if the understanding physical process could be neglected or the objective is to have a simple model to forecast groundwater levels the phenomenological model will be considered as a good tool to calculate the groundwater level for deep seated landslides credit authorship contribution statement zhen lei

5498,plant species growing in karst shallow soil areas always experience water deficit especially in seasonally dry moreover such water stress is aggravated by tunnel excavation in karst areas however the effects of tunnel excavation on karst ecosystems remain largely unknown this study aimed at investigating whether there were variations in soil water contents and shifts of water use strategies of plants between rainy and dry seasons in a karst trough valley affected by tunnel excavation and comparing their differences with those in a tunnel free karst trough valley in southwest china monthly soil water contents at two soil layers of the upper 0 20 cm and the lower 20 40 cm were measured from january 2017 to december 2018 foliage of woody plants were sampled in the dry season of december 2017 and march 2018 and in the rainy season of june and september 2018 respectively and leaf δ13c values were analyzed the soil water contents at both valleys showed significant seasonal variations and the soil water contents of two soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than that of the tunnel free valley at both seasons plant water use strategy changed from profligate water use pattern in the rainy season to conservative water use pattern in the dry season moreover increased leaf δ13c values at both seasons in the tunneling affected valley suggests that the water stress resulted from the tunnel excavation has significantly impacted the physiological process of plants in karst areas these results highlight that improving water use efficiency wue is a common water use strategy to overcome water limitation for native plants in karst areas during unfavorable drought conditions keywords carbon stable isotope tunnel excavation soil water karst trough valley southwest china 1 introduction karst a special landscape shaped by the dissolution of carbonates covers about 20 of the earth s dry ice free land and karst aquifers are at least a partial source of drinking water supply to almost a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 2007 however carbonates often occupy landscapes where water shortages are common due to pronounced seasonality in rainfall and double layer hydrogeological structures resulting in a very limited amount of water storage capacity with significant seasonal variation in the thin and rocky karst soils ford and williams 2007 therefore drought water stress is one of the most important factors in limiting the photosynthesis growth and survival of plants in karst habitats white et al 1985 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 heilman et al 2009 2014 nie et al 2010 2014 furthermore such stress on karst water resources resulted from the climate change increasing temperature and precipitation and excessive groundwater extraction for agriculture industry and urban has increased significantly in recent decades gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 because karst is particularly vulnerable to environment changes and human impacts due to their unique hydrogeological characteristics ford and williams 2007 meanwhile plateau and mountains are the dominant landforms in karst areas especially in europe and asia resulting in the insurmountable barriers to transport as a result excavation of tunnels has been a common necessity for efficient transport of both motorways and railways in these areas gisbert et al 2009 vincenzi et al 2009 butscher et al 2011 zarei et al 2012 liu et al 2019 generally tunnels are excavated below groundwater table in karst areas although some tunnels in karst mountains may start in the vadose zone at each end but pass into a transient zone or even a steady state phreatic zone in their central parts creating an elongated zone of depression to permit it to drain gravitationally resulting in a lowered groundwater table ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 karst groundwater drawdown can lead to drying up of karst spring discharges gisbert et al 2009 liu et al 2019 and losing or drying up of surface water completely vincenzi et al 2009 liu et al 2019 and then decreasing soil water contents and plants extracting more groundwater liu et al 2019 therefore any groundwater drawdown could alter the natural hydrogeological flow system and consequently impact groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology of surface water systems springs wells streams lakes wetlands and the associated aquatic ecosystems and associated ecosystems in karst areas furthermore such karst water stress for plant growth is likely to increase dramatically in the future resulted from an increasing tunnel excavation induced groundwater drawdown with fast development of transportation and urbanization in karst areas especially in asia such as china although karst shallow soil with a limited water supply is a big challenge for plant growth and survival lots of plants including broad leaved evergreen species can grow and survive in such water limited environments suggesting those plant species have developed various mechanisms for drought adaptation including development of deep roots white et al 1985 canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 schwinning 2008 hasselquist et al 2010 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2009 2014 barbeta and peñuelas 2016 liu et al 2019 carrière et al 2020 greater water use efficiency hasselquist et al 2010 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 nie et al 2014 olano et al 2014 lower stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 martínez vilalta et al 2014 changes in leaf morphology barbeta and peñuelas 2016 drought deciduous hasselquist et al 2010 and even slower growth olano et al 2014 thus with the decrease of soil water availability resulted from groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation in karst areas plants could activate several physiological mechanisms and even structural mechanisms to acclimate such water deficit the primary responses of plant species to such water stress could be the changes in water use strategies liu et al 2019 including changes in the water acquisitive strategy related to root systems and water use efficiency related to leaf and stem traits although liu et al 2019 found that tunnel excavation decreased the soil water contents and then changed plant water uptake patterns in karst areas shifting from a dominant soil water source to a dominant subcutaneous water source especially in the dry season how plants will respond remains largely unknown is poorly understood and the physiologic responses of plants to such water stress may be more idiosyncratic than expected due to the complexity of karst because leaf stomata can provide the most obvious mechanism allowing plants to control water transport and loss under drought conditions stomatal closure is one of the first responses to water deficit drought stress arndt et al 2001 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 martínez vilalta et al 2014 a decreasing stomatal conductance results in declining photosynthesis of plants hasselquist et al 2010 sade et al 2012 associated with the increase in water use efficiency hasselquist et al 2010 esmaeilpour et al 2016 wue water use efficiency may be estimated as the ratio between photosynthetic carbon fixation a and stomatal conductance gs which is known as intrinsic water use efficiency wuei physiological index farquhar et al 1982 1989 farquhar and richards 1984 boyer 1996 dawson et al 2002 although continuous monitoring of photosynthetic carbon fixation and stomatal conductance is limited in the field ghrab et al 2013 klein et al 2013 the time integrated wuei can be inferred using stable carbon isotope ratios δ13c of plant tissues because photosynthetic carbon fixation and stomatal conductance is correlated with the ratio of intercellular to ambient co2 partial pressures ci ca in c3 plants which reflects the balance between stomatal conductance and the photosynthetic capacity farquhar et al 1982 1989 farquhar and richards 1984 thus leaf δ13c values can be used as a proxy for wuei of c3 plants based on a positive correlation between δ13c values and wuei farquhar et al 1982 1989 farquhar and richards 1984 boyer 1996 dawson et al 2002 craven et al 2013 pascual et al 2013 esmaeilpour et al 2016 moreover foliar δ13c values can be used to evaluate plant response to water stress within and across species and ecosystems and provide information about the physiological performance in response to changes in the plant water status centritto et al 2002 hasselquist et al 2010 esmaeilpour et al 2016 thus it is feasible to reveal water use strategies of endemic species in response to tunnel excavation induced water stress in karst areas by analyzing the changes in their leaf δ13c values in this study we investigated soil moisture changes at two karst trough valleys with similar hydrogeological conditions but different impacts by tunnel excavation tunnel affected valley vs tunnel free valley in chongqing of southwest china and analyzed foliar carbon isotope δ13c of the four dominant woody plant species fraxinus chinensis roxb arbor citrus reticulate arbor viburnum chinshanense graebn shrub and berchemia polyphylla shrub in rainy and dry seasons at two karst trough valleys in order to better understand changes in water use strategies of plants to overcome water deficit resulted from groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation we hypothesized that tunnel excavation in saturated zone lowered karst groundwater and declined soil water availability and could result in the increasing wuei and then could lead to an increasing foliar δ13c of woody plants in karst areas thus the new aspects addressed here are to ascertain the changes in foliar δ13c and water use strategy of woody plants impacted by tunnel excavation during different seasons in karst trough valley areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the longfeng and longche karst trough valleys 106 23 15 106 28 05 e 29 40 30 29 48 10 n with an area of 11 7 km2 and 26 8 km2 respectively belong to the northern part of the zhongliang mountain located in the northwest of chongqing southwest china fig s1 the regional climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation of 1200 mm over 80 of precipitation occurring during the rainy season from april to october and the mean annual air temperature of 18 c the longfeng and longche watersheds are typical parallel folded karst trough valleys located in the guanyinxia anticline and consisted of three ridges and two valleys where the valleys are developed in the easily eroded middle and lower triassic limestone and dolomite t1 j and t2 l and the ridges are formed in the erosion resistant sandstone and shale lower triassic feixianguan formation t1 f and upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj fig s1 the karst soil is thin discontinuous and heterogeneous the dominant vegetation is evergreen broad leaf forests fraxinus chinensis roxb citrus reticulate a fruit tree etc and shrubs viburnum chinshanense graebn berchemia polyphylla etc three about 4 km long tunnels without any ventilation shafts excavated below the water level of the underground rivers saturated zone were built within an 8 km distance of the longfeng karst trough valley since 1999 hereafter referred to as tunneling affected valley abbreviated as tav resulting in lowering groundwater level gradually drying up of surface water and epikarst springs contrasted there is no any tunnel excavation in the longche karst trough valley hereafter referred to as tunneling unaffected valley abbreviated as tuav and it is a natural karst hydrogeological system detailed information on the study areas and tunnel excavation in longfeng karst trough valley was well described by liu et al 2019 2 2 sampling the air temperature and precipitation recorded at 15 min intervals with a resolution of 0 01 c and 0 1 mm respectively by the hobo field weather station located in the longfeng karst trough valley fig s1 were collected from january 2017 to december 2018 soil samples at the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm for analysis of soil water contents were collected monthly from january 2017 and december 2018 plant foliar and atmospheric co2 for carbon isotopic analysis δ13c were collected in the dry season of december 2017 and march 2018 and in the rainy season of june and september 2018 sampling of soils and plant species was conducted from 5 cross sections of the karst trough valleys which are the continuous limestone rock outcrops of which 3 cross sections were located at the top of three tunnels of the longfeng karst trough valley and 2 cross sections were located in the longche karst trough valley fig s1 there are 3 sampling points at each cross section of which two sampling points were located on both sides of the hillside and one was located in the bottom of valley at each sampling point soils and plant species were sampled if both arbors and shrubs could be found respectively at each sampling point two soil samples were collected using the hand probes at the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm below ground gravimetric soil moisture content smc was determined by drying at 105 c in the oven for 24 h fraxinus chinensis roxb viburnum chinshanense graebn and berchemia polyphylla typical aboriginal species of arbors and shrubs and citrus reticulate a typical fruit tree species for karst rocky desertification restoration were sampled at each sampling point two to four mature indicated by their ability to set seed plant individuals one sample per individual were randomly selected for each species one randomly selected canopy branches were cut from each individual using high branch scissors ten to twenty five 1 year old sun exposed leaves depending on the leaf size were collected from each branch all foliage samples were oven dried at 75 c for 48 h and then frozen in liquid n2 and ground to a powder pass an 80 mesh screen for δ13c analysis 2 3 isotopic analyses the carbon isotopic compositions of plant foliage samples were determined using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms the isotopic analyses were conducted in the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry stable carbon isotope results δ13c are expressed in the usual delta notation per mil deviation from the standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb the overall experimental accuracy for δ13c measurements was 0 2 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using the spss 20 0 program spss inc chicago il usa independent sample t test was used to detect significant differences in the soil moisture contents isotopic compositions of plant foliar δ13c between the tunneling affected and unaffected karst trough valleys during dry and rainy seasons and the results were considered significant at p 0 05 and p 0 01 respectively the relationships between monthly soil moisture contents and plant foliar δ13c values were calculated using pearson correlation analysis and the results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of precipitation the total precipitation was 1314 mm in 2017 and 1241 mm in 2018 respectively more than 80 of precipitation occurred during the vegetation growing season from april to october accompanying with a severe summer drought in august fig 1 the highest monthly precipitation usually occurred in september while the lowest was in december the amounts of most rainfall received between may and september were relatively large with high frequency of rainfall events on the contrary the amounts of most rainfall received between november and march were very small with low frequency of rainfall events fig 1 thus plants have to experience a pronounced 5 months dry season in winter early spring during which 20 of the total annual rainfall is received also it was believed that plants experienced no water stress in june and september while plants suffered from severe water deficit in november and march 3 2 differences in soil moisture contents between the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley as shown in fig 1 although the soil moisture contents of two valleys exhibited similar vertical and temporal variations soil moisture contents in upper soil layers and lower soil layers showed significant differences p 0 001 between two karst valleys fig 1 the soil moisture contents at both soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than in the tunnel free valley fig 1 as indicated by liu et al 2019 such obvious differences in soil moisture contents between two valleys suggested that groundwater drawdown resulted from tunnel excavation declined soil water availability in karst areas 3 3 differences in leaf δ13c values of different species in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley leaf δ13c values did not differ between arbor and shrub species at both valleys p 0 05 respectively although leaf δ13c values of arbor species showed slight higher values than shrub species fig 2 therefore arbor and shrub species were hereafter referred to as woody plants however leaf δ13c values of woody plants changed with the seasons at both valleys p 0 01 leaf δ13c values of woody plants were significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season and also showed obvious differences between two valleys at both seasons p 0 001 similarly leaf δ13c values of woody plants were significantly higher in the tunneling affected valley than in the tunnel free valley at both seasons fig 2 as shown in fig 2 leaf δ13c values of all species increased by about 0 95 and 0 75 from wet season to dry season in the tunneling affected and the tunnel free valley respectively also as shown in fig 2 leaf δ13c values of all species increased by about 0 95 from the tunnel free valley to the tunneling affected valley during monitoring periods therefore the increment of leaf δ13c value of woody plants caused by the tunnel excavation is almost equal to that by seasonal changes suggesting that the decline of soil water availability resulted from tunnel excavation increased leaf δ13c values of woody plants 4 discussion 4 1 variations of woody plant water use strategies revealed by seasonal differences in leaf δ13c in karst areas rainy season vs dry season all the selected four evergreen species whose foliar δ13c values varying from 28 1 to 32 8 with an average of 30 2 are typical c3 plants that have the δ13c values varying between 20 and 35 o leary 1981 this result is consistent with the photosynthetic pathway of the dominant species in the study area which is humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation of 1200 mm liu et al 2019 however mean leaf δ13c values of all the four species were more positive than typical subtropical species of no karst areas 30 5 qu et al 2001 indicating that they may have greater wue this difference resulted from the low levels of soil water availability in karst landscapes hasselquist et al 2010 fan et al 2011 nie et al 2014 indicates woody plants growing on the carbonate rock outcrops have to use water more efficient than other subtropical species in no karst areas meanwhile insignificant differences in leaf δ13c values between arbor and shrub species at both valleys suggest that woody plants use same strategies to overcome water limitations in karst areas on the other hand as shown in fig 3 there are no obvious relationships between leaf δ13c values of woody plants and soil water contents at different depths in both seasons especially in dry season suggesting that lower soil waters are not dominant water sources to support evergreen woody plants and they have access to a more permanent water source such as groundwater as indicated by some studies weathered limestone bedrock often allows roots to penestrate through a network of cracks fissures and channels to extract waters stored in epikarst and even underground river to overcome water limitations in karst areas white et al 1985 canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2009 2014 liu et al 2019 carrière et al 2020 in the study area the proportion of water uptake from deep sources for woody plants is more than 30 in rainy season and 60 in dry season respectively liu et al 2019 the relatively positive leaf δ13c values higher wuei for evergreen woody plants in karst areas seem to conflict with its utilization of deep water sources however as indicated by some studies the reliance on deep water sources for plant species growing in carbonate rocky environments usually correlated with relatively positive leaf δ13c values and high wuei hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2014 thus although plants growing on carbonate rock outcrops can rely on deep water sources they are also dominated by conservative water use strategies in the dry season during the rainy season woody plants showing profligate water use patterns characterized by relatively negative δ13c values lower wuei should be attributed to the easy accessibility of available water sources due to higher soil moisture contents resulted from lots of precipitation as described in pervious section a large amount of rainfall and high frequency of the rainfall events in the study area should be beneficial for karst plants to maintain more negative δ13c values and lower wuei in the rainy season profligate water use strategy allows plant species in karst areas to maximize photosynthesis and growth during the relatively narrow windows of opportunity when soil water availability is optimal in rainy season however with decrease in soil water availability in dry season a significant increase in leaf δ13c values of woody plants suggests that they suffer seriously from seasonal water stress plants respond to increased water stress by reducing stomatal conductance thereby increasing leaf δ13c values or decreasing carbon isotope discrimination which is interpreted as an increase in wuei farquhar et al 1989 thus the increased leaf δ13c values higher wuei of woody plants resulted from the reduced stomatal conductance during the dry season is a more conservative water use patterns for plants growing in carbonate rocky environments to overcome seasonal water limitations in such prolonged drought period in karst areas hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2014 therefore such seasonal differences in leaf δ13c values of woody plants should be attributed to the flexible water use strategies shifting from profligate water use pattern in the wet season to conservative water use pattern in the dry season in different seasons depending on the soil water availability such flexibility of water use strategies can help plants in karst areas to overcome water limitation resulted from seasonal variations of soil water availability 4 2 increased leaf δ13c values of woody plants resulted from tunnel excavation in karst areas water deficit resulted from seasonal variation of precipitation vs water deficit resulted from tunnels excavation compared to the tunnel free karst trough valley the lowered soil moisture contents of different soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at both seasons might result from the tunnel excavation as indicated by liu et al 2019 the modification of natural karst hydrogeological flow system caused by the tunnel excavation especially drilled below underground river could result in a rapid and great loss of soil and soil water along with the cracks and crevices developed in limestone and consequently dry soil water contents with decrease of soil water contents in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at both seasons plant foliar δ13c values have been significantly increased suggesting that plants growing in the tunneling affected karst trough valley suffer seriously from water stress although plants growing in the tunneling affected karst trough valley can use their deep roots to extract water from epikarst and even underground river as indicated by liu et al 2019 the proportion of water uptake from deep sources for woody plants is more than 76 in dry season it is always not easy and increases the cost of extracting water from depth for plants in karst areas schwinning 2010 and even as indicated by ryel et al 2010 plants have evolved to use deep water pools only for maintenance functions primarily to ensure survival even when plenty of deep water is available thus plants have to reduce stomatal conductance to control transpiration to adapt such water stress caused by tunnel excavation thereby improving leaf level wuei and then lead to an increase in leaf δ13c values therefore the increased leaf δ13c values of woody plants in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at both seasons should be attributed to the improving wuei resulted from the decrease of the soil water availability caused by tunnel excavation furthermore it should be noted that the increment of leaf δ13c values caused by the tunnel excavation is almost equal to that resulted from seasonal change of precipitation suggesting that such water stress caused by tunnel excavation has significantly impacted the physiological process of plants and has the same effects on plant physiological process as the water deficit resulted from seasonal variation of precipitation in karst areas also it can be concluded that improving wuei could be a common water use strategy for native plants in karst areas during unfavorable drought conditions such mechanism of drought adaptation improving leaf level wuei and thereby increasing leaf δ13c values can help plants in karst areas to avoid the threat of drought resulted from various factors such as climate change human activities etc 5 conclusions soil water contents and leaf δ13c values of woody plants were used to detect whether there were seasonal variations in soil water contents and shifts of water use strategies of plants between rainy and dry

soil water contents were found between two valleys but the soil water contents of different soil layers at both seasons in the tunneling affected valley were sinificantly lower than those in the tunnel free valley there were significant seasonal differences in the leaf δ13c values of woody plants at both valleys showing more positive leaf δ13c values higher wuei in the dry season than those

5498,plant species growing in karst shallow soil areas always experience water deficit especially in seasonally dry moreover such water stress is aggravated by tunnel excavation in karst areas however the effects of tunnel excavation on karst ecosystems remain largely unknown this study aimed at investigating whether there were variations in soil water contents and shifts of water use strategies of plants between rainy and dry seasons in a karst trough valley affected by tunnel excavation and comparing their differences with those in a tunnel free karst trough valley in southwest china monthly soil water contents at two soil layers of the upper 0 20 cm and the lower 20 40 cm were measured from january 2017 to december 2018 foliage of woody plants were sampled in the dry season of december 2017 and march 2018 and in the rainy season of june and september 2018 respectively and leaf δ13c values were analyzed the soil water contents at both valleys showed significant seasonal variations and the soil water contents of two soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than that of the tunnel free valley at both seasons plant water use strategy changed from profligate water use pattern in the rainy season to conservative water use pattern in the dry season moreover increased leaf δ13c values at both seasons in the tunneling affected valley suggests that the water stress resulted from the tunnel excavation has significantly impacted the physiological process of plants in karst areas these results highlight that improving water use efficiency wue is a common water use strategy to overcome water limitation for native plants in karst areas during unfavorable drought conditions keywords carbon stable isotope tunnel excavation soil water karst trough valley southwest china 1 introduction karst a special landscape shaped by the dissolution of carbonates covers about 20 of the earth s dry ice free land and karst aquifers are at least a partial source of drinking water supply to almost a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 2007 however carbonates often occupy landscapes where water shortages are common due to pronounced seasonality in rainfall and double layer hydrogeological structures resulting in a very limited amount of water storage capacity with significant seasonal variation in the thin and rocky karst soils ford and williams 2007 therefore drought water stress is one of the most important factors in limiting the photosynthesis growth and survival of plants in karst habitats white et al 1985 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 heilman et al 2009 2014 nie et al 2010 2014 furthermore such stress on karst water resources resulted from the climate change increasing temperature and precipitation and excessive groundwater extraction for agriculture industry and urban has increased significantly in recent decades gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 because karst is particularly vulnerable to environment changes and human impacts due to their unique hydrogeological characteristics ford and williams 2007 meanwhile plateau and mountains are the dominant landforms in karst areas especially in europe and asia resulting in the insurmountable barriers to transport as a result excavation of tunnels has been a common necessity for efficient transport of both motorways and railways in these areas gisbert et al 2009 vincenzi et al 2009 butscher et al 2011 zarei et al 2012 liu et al 2019 generally tunnels are excavated below groundwater table in karst areas although some tunnels in karst mountains may start in the vadose zone at each end but pass into a transient zone or even a steady state phreatic zone in their central parts creating an elongated zone of depression to permit it to drain gravitationally resulting in a lowered groundwater table ford and williams 2007 vincenzi et al 2009 karst groundwater drawdown can lead to drying up of karst spring discharges gisbert et al 2009 liu et al 2019 and losing or drying up of surface water completely vincenzi et al 2009 liu et al 2019 and then decreasing soil water contents and plants extracting more groundwater liu et al 2019 therefore any groundwater drawdown could alter the natural hydrogeological flow system and consequently impact groundwater dependent vegetation soil and hydrology of surface water systems springs wells streams lakes wetlands and the associated aquatic ecosystems and associated ecosystems in karst areas furthermore such karst water stress for plant growth is likely to increase dramatically in the future resulted from an increasing tunnel excavation induced groundwater drawdown with fast development of transportation and urbanization in karst areas especially in asia such as china although karst shallow soil with a limited water supply is a big challenge for plant growth and survival lots of plants including broad leaved evergreen species can grow and survive in such water limited environments suggesting those plant species have developed various mechanisms for drought adaptation including development of deep roots white et al 1985 canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 schwinning 2008 hasselquist et al 2010 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2009 2014 barbeta and peñuelas 2016 liu et al 2019 carrière et al 2020 greater water use efficiency hasselquist et al 2010 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 nie et al 2014 olano et al 2014 lower stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 martínez vilalta et al 2014 changes in leaf morphology barbeta and peñuelas 2016 drought deciduous hasselquist et al 2010 and even slower growth olano et al 2014 thus with the decrease of soil water availability resulted from groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation in karst areas plants could activate several physiological mechanisms and even structural mechanisms to acclimate such water deficit the primary responses of plant species to such water stress could be the changes in water use strategies liu et al 2019 including changes in the water acquisitive strategy related to root systems and water use efficiency related to leaf and stem traits although liu et al 2019 found that tunnel excavation decreased the soil water contents and then changed plant water uptake patterns in karst areas shifting from a dominant soil water source to a dominant subcutaneous water source especially in the dry season how plants will respond remains largely unknown is poorly understood and the physiologic responses of plants to such water stress may be more idiosyncratic than expected due to the complexity of karst because leaf stomata can provide the most obvious mechanism allowing plants to control water transport and loss under drought conditions stomatal closure is one of the first responses to water deficit drought stress arndt et al 2001 moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 martínez vilalta et al 2014 a decreasing stomatal conductance results in declining photosynthesis of plants hasselquist et al 2010 sade et al 2012 associated with the increase in water use efficiency hasselquist et al 2010 esmaeilpour et al 2016 wue water use efficiency may be estimated as the ratio between photosynthetic carbon fixation a and stomatal conductance gs which is known as intrinsic water use efficiency wuei physiological index farquhar et al 1982 1989 farquhar and richards 1984 boyer 1996 dawson et al 2002 although continuous monitoring of photosynthetic carbon fixation and stomatal conductance is limited in the field ghrab et al 2013 klein et al 2013 the time integrated wuei can be inferred using stable carbon isotope ratios δ13c of plant tissues because photosynthetic carbon fixation and stomatal conductance is correlated with the ratio of intercellular to ambient co2 partial pressures ci ca in c3 plants which reflects the balance between stomatal conductance and the photosynthetic capacity farquhar et al 1982 1989 farquhar and richards 1984 thus leaf δ13c values can be used as a proxy for wuei of c3 plants based on a positive correlation between δ13c values and wuei farquhar et al 1982 1989 farquhar and richards 1984 boyer 1996 dawson et al 2002 craven et al 2013 pascual et al 2013 esmaeilpour et al 2016 moreover foliar δ13c values can be used to evaluate plant response to water stress within and across species and ecosystems and provide information about the physiological performance in response to changes in the plant water status centritto et al 2002 hasselquist et al 2010 esmaeilpour et al 2016 thus it is feasible to reveal water use strategies of endemic species in response to tunnel excavation induced water stress in karst areas by analyzing the changes in their leaf δ13c values in this study we investigated soil moisture changes at two karst trough valleys with similar hydrogeological conditions but different impacts by tunnel excavation tunnel affected valley vs tunnel free valley in chongqing of southwest china and analyzed foliar carbon isotope δ13c of the four dominant woody plant species fraxinus chinensis roxb arbor citrus reticulate arbor viburnum chinshanense graebn shrub and berchemia polyphylla shrub in rainy and dry seasons at two karst trough valleys in order to better understand changes in water use strategies of plants to overcome water deficit resulted from groundwater drawdown caused by tunnel excavation we hypothesized that tunnel excavation in saturated zone lowered karst groundwater and declined soil water availability and could result in the increasing wuei and then could lead to an increasing foliar δ13c of woody plants in karst areas thus the new aspects addressed here are to ascertain the changes in foliar δ13c and water use strategy of woody plants impacted by tunnel excavation during different seasons in karst trough valley areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the longfeng and longche karst trough valleys 106 23 15 106 28 05 e 29 40 30 29 48 10 n with an area of 11 7 km2 and 26 8 km2 respectively belong to the northern part of the zhongliang mountain located in the northwest of chongqing southwest china fig s1 the regional climate is characterized by a humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation of 1200 mm over 80 of precipitation occurring during the rainy season from april to october and the mean annual air temperature of 18 c the longfeng and longche watersheds are typical parallel folded karst trough valleys located in the guanyinxia anticline and consisted of three ridges and two valleys where the valleys are developed in the easily eroded middle and lower triassic limestone and dolomite t1 j and t2 l and the ridges are formed in the erosion resistant sandstone and shale lower triassic feixianguan formation t1 f and upper triassic xujiahe formation t3 xj fig s1 the karst soil is thin discontinuous and heterogeneous the dominant vegetation is evergreen broad leaf forests fraxinus chinensis roxb citrus reticulate a fruit tree etc and shrubs viburnum chinshanense graebn berchemia polyphylla etc three about 4 km long tunnels without any ventilation shafts excavated below the water level of the underground rivers saturated zone were built within an 8 km distance of the longfeng karst trough valley since 1999 hereafter referred to as tunneling affected valley abbreviated as tav resulting in lowering groundwater level gradually drying up of surface water and epikarst springs contrasted there is no any tunnel excavation in the longche karst trough valley hereafter referred to as tunneling unaffected valley abbreviated as tuav and it is a natural karst hydrogeological system detailed information on the study areas and tunnel excavation in longfeng karst trough valley was well described by liu et al 2019 2 2 sampling the air temperature and precipitation recorded at 15 min intervals with a resolution of 0 01 c and 0 1 mm respectively by the hobo field weather station located in the longfeng karst trough valley fig s1 were collected from january 2017 to december 2018 soil samples at the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm for analysis of soil water contents were collected monthly from january 2017 and december 2018 plant foliar and atmospheric co2 for carbon isotopic analysis δ13c were collected in the dry season of december 2017 and march 2018 and in the rainy season of june and september 2018 sampling of soils and plant species was conducted from 5 cross sections of the karst trough valleys which are the continuous limestone rock outcrops of which 3 cross sections were located at the top of three tunnels of the longfeng karst trough valley and 2 cross sections were located in the longche karst trough valley fig s1 there are 3 sampling points at each cross section of which two sampling points were located on both sides of the hillside and one was located in the bottom of valley at each sampling point soils and plant species were sampled if both arbors and shrubs could be found respectively at each sampling point two soil samples were collected using the hand probes at the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm below ground gravimetric soil moisture content smc was determined by drying at 105 c in the oven for 24 h fraxinus chinensis roxb viburnum chinshanense graebn and berchemia polyphylla typical aboriginal species of arbors and shrubs and citrus reticulate a typical fruit tree species for karst rocky desertification restoration were sampled at each sampling point two to four mature indicated by their ability to set seed plant individuals one sample per individual were randomly selected for each species one randomly selected canopy branches were cut from each individual using high branch scissors ten to twenty five 1 year old sun exposed leaves depending on the leaf size were collected from each branch all foliage samples were oven dried at 75 c for 48 h and then frozen in liquid n2 and ground to a powder pass an 80 mesh screen for δ13c analysis 2 3 isotopic analyses the carbon isotopic compositions of plant foliage samples were determined using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer ea irms the isotopic analyses were conducted in the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry stable carbon isotope results δ13c are expressed in the usual delta notation per mil deviation from the standard vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb the overall experimental accuracy for δ13c measurements was 0 2 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using the spss 20 0 program spss inc chicago il usa independent sample t test was used to detect significant differences in the soil moisture contents isotopic compositions of plant foliar δ13c between the tunneling affected and unaffected karst trough valleys during dry and rainy seasons and the results were considered significant at p 0 05 and p 0 01 respectively the relationships between monthly soil moisture contents and plant foliar δ13c values were calculated using pearson correlation analysis and the results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of precipitation the total precipitation was 1314 mm in 2017 and 1241 mm in 2018 respectively more than 80 of precipitation occurred during the vegetation growing season from april to october accompanying with a severe summer drought in august fig 1 the highest monthly precipitation usually occurred in september while the lowest was in december the amounts of most rainfall received between may and september were relatively large with high frequency of rainfall events on the contrary the amounts of most rainfall received between november and march were very small with low frequency of rainfall events fig 1 thus plants have to experience a pronounced 5 months dry season in winter early spring during which 20 of the total annual rainfall is received also it was believed that plants experienced no water stress in june and september while plants suffered from severe water deficit in november and march 3 2 differences in soil moisture contents between the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley as shown in fig 1 although the soil moisture contents of two valleys exhibited similar vertical and temporal variations soil moisture contents in upper soil layers and lower soil layers showed significant differences p 0 001 between two karst valleys fig 1 the soil moisture contents at both soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than in the tunnel free valley fig 1 as indicated by liu et al 2019 such obvious differences in soil moisture contents between two valleys suggested that groundwater drawdown resulted from tunnel excavation declined soil water availability in karst areas 3 3 differences in leaf δ13c values of different species in the tunneling affected and tunneling unaffected karst trough valley leaf δ13c values did not differ between arbor and shrub species at both valleys p 0 05 respectively although leaf δ13c values of arbor species showed slight higher values than shrub species fig 2 therefore arbor and shrub species were hereafter referred to as woody plants however leaf δ13c values of woody plants changed with the seasons at both valleys p 0 01 leaf δ13c values of woody plants were significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season and also showed obvious differences between two valleys at both seasons p 0 001 similarly leaf δ13c values of woody plants were significantly higher in the tunneling affected valley than in the tunnel free valley at both seasons fig 2 as shown in fig 2 leaf δ13c values of all species increased by about 0 95 and 0 75 from wet season to dry season in the tunneling affected and the tunnel free valley respectively also as shown in fig 2 leaf δ13c values of all species increased by about 0 95 from the tunnel free valley to the tunneling affected valley during monitoring periods therefore the increment of leaf δ13c value of woody plants caused by the tunnel excavation is almost equal to that by seasonal changes suggesting that the decline of soil water availability resulted from tunnel excavation increased leaf δ13c values of woody plants 4 discussion 4 1 variations of woody plant water use strategies revealed by seasonal differences in leaf δ13c in karst areas rainy season vs dry season all the selected four evergreen species whose foliar δ13c values varying from 28 1 to 32 8 with an average of 30 2 are typical c3 plants that have the δ13c values varying between 20 and 35 o leary 1981 this result is consistent with the photosynthetic pathway of the dominant species in the study area which is humid subtropical monsoon climate with the average annual precipitation of 1200 mm liu et al 2019 however mean leaf δ13c values of all the four species were more positive than typical subtropical species of no karst areas 30 5 qu et al 2001 indicating that they may have greater wue this difference resulted from the low levels of soil water availability in karst landscapes hasselquist et al 2010 fan et al 2011 nie et al 2014 indicates woody plants growing on the carbonate rock outcrops have to use water more efficient than other subtropical species in no karst areas meanwhile insignificant differences in leaf δ13c values between arbor and shrub species at both valleys suggest that woody plants use same strategies to overcome water limitations in karst areas on the other hand as shown in fig 3 there are no obvious relationships between leaf δ13c values of woody plants and soil water contents at different depths in both seasons especially in dry season suggesting that lower soil waters are not dominant water sources to support evergreen woody plants and they have access to a more permanent water source such as groundwater as indicated by some studies weathered limestone bedrock often allows roots to penestrate through a network of cracks fissures and channels to extract waters stored in epikarst and even underground river to overcome water limitations in karst areas white et al 1985 canadell et al 1996 jackson et al 1999 mccole and stern 2007 querejeta et al 2007 hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2010 estrada medina et al 2013 heilman et al 2009 2014 liu et al 2019 carrière et al 2020 in the study area the proportion of water uptake from deep sources for woody plants is more than 30 in rainy season and 60 in dry season respectively liu et al 2019 the relatively positive leaf δ13c values higher wuei for evergreen woody plants in karst areas seem to conflict with its utilization of deep water sources however as indicated by some studies the reliance on deep water sources for plant species growing in carbonate rocky environments usually correlated with relatively positive leaf δ13c values and high wuei hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2014 thus although plants growing on carbonate rock outcrops can rely on deep water sources they are also dominated by conservative water use strategies in the dry season during the rainy season woody plants showing profligate water use patterns characterized by relatively negative δ13c values lower wuei should be attributed to the easy accessibility of available water sources due to higher soil moisture contents resulted from lots of precipitation as described in pervious section a large amount of rainfall and high frequency of the rainfall events in the study area should be beneficial for karst plants to maintain more negative δ13c values and lower wuei in the rainy season profligate water use strategy allows plant species in karst areas to maximize photosynthesis and growth during the relatively narrow windows of opportunity when soil water availability is optimal in rainy season however with decrease in soil water availability in dry season a significant increase in leaf δ13c values of woody plants suggests that they suffer seriously from seasonal water stress plants respond to increased water stress by reducing stomatal conductance thereby increasing leaf δ13c values or decreasing carbon isotope discrimination which is interpreted as an increase in wuei farquhar et al 1989 thus the increased leaf δ13c values higher wuei of woody plants resulted from the reduced stomatal conductance during the dry season is a more conservative water use patterns for plants growing in carbonate rocky environments to overcome seasonal water limitations in such prolonged drought period in karst areas hasselquist et al 2010 nie et al 2014 therefore such seasonal differences in leaf δ13c values of woody plants should be attributed to the flexible water use strategies shifting from profligate water use pattern in the wet season to conservative water use pattern in the dry season in different seasons depending on the soil water availability such flexibility of water use strategies can help plants in karst areas to overcome water limitation resulted from seasonal variations of soil water availability 4 2 increased leaf δ13c values of woody plants resulted from tunnel excavation in karst areas water deficit resulted from seasonal variation of precipitation vs water deficit resulted from tunnels excavation compared to the tunnel free karst trough valley the lowered soil moisture contents of different soil layers in the tunneling affected karst trough valley at both seasons might result from the tunnel excavation as indicated by liu et al 2019 the modification of natural karst hydrogeological flow system caused by the tunnel excavation especially drilled below underground river could result in a rapid and great loss of soil and soil water along with the cracks and crevices developed in limestone and consequently dry soil water

epikarst and even underground river as indicated by liu et al 2019 the proportion of water uptake from deep sources for woody plants is more than 76 in dry season it is always not easy and increases the cost of extracting water from depth for plants in karst areas schwinning 2010 and even as indicated by ryel et al 2010 plants have evolved to use deep water pools only for maintenance functions

the physiological process of plants and has the same effects on plant physiological process as the water deficit resulted from seasonal variation of precipitation in karst areas also it can be concluded that improving wuei could be a common water use strategy for native plants in karst areas during unfavorable drought conditions such mechanism of drought adaptation improving leaf level wuei and thereby increasing leaf δ13c values can help plants in karst areas to avoid the threat of drought resulted from various factors such as climate change human activities etc 5 conclusions soil water

can be envisioned as an upscaling problem accordingly thus pore scale models are significant for understanding the transport process in porous media with scaleinvariant property fractal geometry has been successfully applied to develop pore scale models for the transport processes of porous media many fractal models for darcy and non darcy flow yu and cheng 2002a xu and yu 2008 liang et al 2014

nondestructive characterization technique low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr can measure the hydrogen proton responses in magnetic fields and therefore has been used to investigate the pore structures and water content in porous media low field nmr is a spectroscopic techniques with good sensitivity nondestructiveness and high efficiency requiring only minimal or no sample preparation compared with micro ct and sac low field nmr technique is more straightforward and more rapid while providing convincing results therefore it has been applied to detect the microstructures of various porous media such as soil rock food concrete sludge etc jin et al 2013 tian et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 lv et al 2017 rao et al 2019 lu et al 2019 although the pore and water distribution can be characterized by low field nmr it is lacking in systematical and comparative study of pore structures since fractal dimension is taken as an effective indictor for characterizing the pore structure a new fractal model is presented to determine the pore fractal dimension base on low field nmr technique this paper is organized as five section in the following section 2 a new fractal probability

common descriptors in the field of porous media and have been widely used to predict physical properties such as porosity saturation permeability diffusivity heat conduction etc it has been proven that most natural porous media and a number of synthetic porous materials show statistical self similar fractal scaling laws over multiple scales katz and thompson 1985 rieu and sposito 1991 sahimi 1993 perfect and kay 1995 adler 1996 adler and thovert 1998 yu 2008 xu 2015 if the pore size distribution obeys the fractal scaling law the probability density function pdf can be written as yu and li 2001 yu and cheng 2002a 1 f p λ d f λ min d f λ d f 1 where f p is pdf λ is pore size subscripts p f and min denote pore fractal and minimum respectively the fractal dimension for pore size distribution d f is in the range of 1 d f 2 and 2 d f 3 in two and three dimensions respectively the cumulative distribution function cdf can be written accordingly as λ min λ f p λ d λ 1 λ min λ d f and the total number of pores in a representative volume element rve is n t λ max λ min d f where λ min and λ max are respectively minimum and maximum pore diameters it should be noted that most porous media are approximately self similar which may indicate fractal scaling law over a certain scale range the probability density function should satisfy the normalization condition λ min λ max f p λ d λ 1 which results in λ min λ max d f 0 where the subscript max denotes the maximum pore diameter therefore λ min λ max d f 0 01 is generally taken as an approximate criterion for fractal analysis of porous media yu et al 2014 the exactly self similar sierpinski carpets and menger sponge have been commonly employed to characterize the pore solid structures of porous media in two and three dimensional spaces respectively xu 2015 as shown in fig 1 the sierpinski carpet or menger sponge is constructed by starting with a square cube of size l initiator length for the first iteration i 1 n squares or cubes with length scale of l are removed the scaling factor is defined as s l l which is larger than 1 s 1 the same procedure is then appliedrecursivelyto the remaining subsquares or subcubes in the next iteration then the fractal dimension can be calculated as follows 2 d f log s d e n i log s i log s d e n log s where de and d f are euclidean and fractal dimensions i n and s are iteration number subsquare number and scaling factor in sierpinski carpet respectively the euclidean dimension de can be 2 or 3 in two and three dimensional spaces respectively the porosity of the i th sierpinski carpet or menger sponge ϕ can be determined by the scale factor s number of removing squares cubes n and iteration number i 3a ϕ i s d e n i s i d e with the aid of eq 2 the porosity can be also expressed as 3b ϕ i s i d f d e the ratio of minimum to maximum size λ min λ max in the sierpinski carpet and menger sponge can be determined by 4 λ min λ max 1 s i combining eqs 3b and 4 the porosity of the sierpinski carpet and menger sponge can be gotten as 5 ϕ λ min λ max d e d f where de and d f are euclidean and fractal dimensions λ min and λ max represent minimum and maximum pore diameters respectively it should be noted that yu and li 2001 proposed this relationship between the porosity and fractal dimension based on sierpinski carpet and gasket and they also presented validation of this formula by comparing with experimental data of fiber preforms and bi dispersed porous media yu and cheng 2002a the volume ratio of pores whose sizes are within the infinitesimal range λ to λ dλ can be calculated by θ λ f p v λ min λ max f p v d λ where v 4 3 π λ 2 3 is the volume of a round pore with diameter of λ and f p is the pdf of fractal scaling law with the aid of eqs 1 and 5 the volume ratio of pores with size of λ to λ dλ can be written as 6 θ λ 3 d f λ 2 d f λ max 3 d f λ min 3 d f where d f is fractal dimension for pore size distribution λ λ min and λ max denote pore diameter minimum and maximum pore diameters respectively the cumulative volume ratio of pores whose sizes are greater than or equal to the size λ follows 7 ψ ε λ λ λ max f p v d λ λ min λ max f p v d λ λ max 3 d f λ 3 d f λ max 3 d f λ min 3 d f the cumulative volume ratio of pores whose sizes are smaller than or equal to the size λ can be written as ψ ε λ λ 3 d f λ min 3 d f λ max 3 d f λ min 3 d f with the aid of eq 2 the following scaling law between cumulative volume ratio and pore size can be written as 8 f p ψ 1 1 ϕ ψ λ λ max 3 d f where f p is the cumulative volume function with porosity ϕ and cumulative volume ratio ψ with this proposed fractal probability density fpd model the pore fractal dimension can be determined by fitting the data of the cumulative volume function and pore size and also the pore fractal dimension of porous media can be calculated via eq 5 with measured porosity and ratio of minimum to maximum pore size 3 experimental apparatus and methods in order to analyze the fractal characteristics of porous media with the proposed fdp model ten porous samples were measured by the low field nmr analyzer the sludge porous samples from hangzhou qige wastewater treatment plant in china were pre dewatered by belt or filter presses the moisture content mc of which is around 80 in order to produce different microstructures of sludge porous samples mechanical press filtration mpf was executed on the pre dewatered sludge porous samples under different conditions as shown in fig 2 a the sludge porous sample with the weight of ws was compressed under pressure of pc and sludge porous cake was formed after dewatering time of td the mpf parameters are listed in table 1 the pressure was fixed at pc 10 mpa for all ten samples the ratio of dewatering time to sludge weight for samples s1 s5 was fixed as t d w s 30 min 100 g while the dewatering time for samples w1 w5 was kept as t d 90 min the dewatered sludge cakes were made into small round pieces for nmr experiments the thickness h c volume vc and weight wc of the dewatered sludge porous samples for nmr test are listed in table 1 the nmr analyzer mesomr23 060h i of suzhou niumag analytical instrument corporation ltd shown in fig 2 b was used to measure the moisture content and determine the pore size distribution of sludge porous cakes the main parameters of nmr analyzer are listed as follows magnetic field strength 0 5 0 05 t instrument main frequency 21 3 mhz probe coil diameter 60 mm effective sample detection range ø60 mm h60 mm relaxation can be used to characterize the speed of signal decay in nuclear magnetic physics the nuclear magnetic relaxation in porous media mainly includes bulk relaxation surface relaxation and diffusion relaxation however the surface relaxation dominates the nuclear magnetic relaxation when the liquid in pores is water and the magnetic field gradient is approximately 0 therefore the transverse and longitudinal relaxation time of porous media is only related to pore structures with the assumption of pipe pores the transverse relaxation time t 2 is directly related to the pore size 9 1 t 2 ρ s v p ρ 2 r where the specific surface area of pipe pore is s v p 2 r ρ 1 00 nm ms is the transverse relaxation rate which is related to the chemical property of sludge r is the pore radius carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg was performed to detect the t 2 distribution curves accordingly the size of interstitial pore can be reflected by t 2 distribution and the content of interstitial water is shown by the area of peaks in t 2 distribution the macroscopic magnetization vector is proportional to the spin number hydrogen nuclear number therefore the porosity and water content can be measured via detecting nmr signal amplitude the calibration curve was obtained by measuring the nuclear magnetic resonance signal amplitude of several standard samples with known water content as shown in fig 3 linear fitting was conducted between water content and signal amplitude it has been found that the signal amplitude ag indicates good linear correlation with water content cw 10 a g 2545 11 c w 111 21 4 results and discussion the moisture content and porosity for ten sludge porous cakes are summarized in table 2 it can be found from table 2 that the porosity ϕ for samples s1 s2 and s3 increases from 64 15 to 72 69 and 78 24 while it decreases to 76 81 and 75 87 for samples s4 and s5 however the porosity for samples w1 w5 keeps increasing from 36 68 to 82 53 as the sample weight increases from 100 g to 300 g under same mpf dewatering time and pressure the moisture content indicate similar trend with dewatering conditions as that of porosity that is the moisture content mc and porosity ϕ of dewatered samples are not the same even for the same pressure 10 mpa and ratio of dewatering time to sludge weight 30 min 100 g fig 4 a and b respectively shows the pore size distribution for samples s1 s5 and w1 w5 it can be seen that most of pores are in the range of 0 1 μm to 6 μm for samples s1 s5 the percentage of small pores 0 1 μm firstly increases and then decreases with the increment of sample weight and dewatering time however the percentage for pores in the range of 0 25 μm to 0 63 μm gradually decreases and that in the range of 1 μm to 4 μm increases for samples w1 w5 the percentages for pores in the ranges of 1 μm to 4 μm also increases with the increase of sample weight however the variation of percentage for pores in other ranges with sample weight w1 w5 are non monotonic it s difficult to extrapolate the variation of pore structures of porous samples with different mpf conditions and therefore new quantitative parameter should be introduced to perform in depth analysis on pore size distribution by nmr while fractal dimension can be used as an effective indicator for microstructures of porous media thus pore fractal dimension was employed here to characterize the heterogeneity of porous media under different mpf conditions it can vary from 2 for a perfectly regular surface to 3 for a highly complex pore structure based on nmr results the pore fractal dimension can be determined by eqs 8 and 5 fig 5 illustrates the pore fractal dimension d f 1 by fitting the data of cumulative volume function and pore radius based on fpd model f p ψ r r max 3 d f 1 because the signal amplitudes for small pores are very low and the cracks may affect the signal for large pores the range of pore sizes in fractal analysis should be determined firstly in fig 5 a the minimum and maximum pore radii for samples s1 s5 are 0 5 μm and 5 μm respectively while the minimum and maximum pore radii r min and r max for samples w1 w5 are different which are listed in table 2 it can be clearly seen from fig 5 that the pore structures of ten porous samples indicate good fractal scaling characteristics the pore fractal dimensions for samples s1 s5 are respectively 2 828 2 863 2 894 2 884 and 2 874 which indicate highly heterogeneous pore structures and the pore fractal dimension firstly increase and then decrease with the increment of dewatering time and sample weight as shown in fig 5 b the pore fractal dimensions for samples w1 w5 are 2 662 2 815 2 857 2 888 2 909 that is the heterogeneity for pore structures of samples w1 w5 increases significantly as sample weight increases the pore fractal dimension can be also calculated according to eq 5 with measured minimum and maximum pore size as well as porosity d f 2 3 log ϕ log r min r max the pore fractal dimensions by eq 5 are listed in table 2 the porosity of porous samples were measured by nmr and the minimum and maximum pore size were determined by fpd method in fig 5 the relative error is defined as σ d f 1 d f 2 d f 1 100 which is smaller than 1 σ 1 it means the pore fractal dimensions by fpd model eq 8 are in good accordance with that by the power law of porosity eq 5 5 conclusions in this paper a new fpd model has been developed for the pore structures of porous media the pore fractal dimension can be calculated by the power law between porosity and ratio of minimum to maximum pore size eq 5 it can be also determined by fitting the data of cumulative volume function and pore size eq 8 in order to analyze the fractal characteristics of porous media with the proposed fractal probability density model ten porous samples have been measured by the low field nmr technique the results indicate that the pore fractal dimension by eq 5 is in good accordance with that by eq 8 the pore fractal dimension increases with porosity under fixed pore size range the value of fractal dimension for the porous samples is larger than 2 6 indicating highly heterogeneous pore structures and the dewatering conditions show significant effect on the pore structures low field nmr technique provides a rapid and nondestructive method for pore structures via detecting transverse relaxation time and it has been widely applied in oil and gas reservoir water resources sludge dewatering food and construction engineering etc the proposed fpd model presents a general and effective method to determine the pore fractal dimension based on nmr results which can be used to quantitatively characterize the pore structures and help understanding the transport phenomenon in porous media credit authorship

pore size distribution by nmr while fractal dimension can be used as an effective indicator for microstructures of porous media thus pore fractal dimension was employed here to characterize the heterogeneity of porous media under different mpf conditions it can vary from 2 for a perfectly regular surface to 3 for a highly complex pore structure based on nmr results the pore fractal dimension can be determined by eqs 8 and 5 fig 5 illustrates the pore fractal dimension d f 1 by fitting the data of cumulative volume function and pore radius based on fpd model f p ψ r r max 3 d f 1 because the signal amplitudes for small pores are very low and the cracks may affect the signal for large pores the range of pore sizes in fractal analysis should be determined firstly in fig 5 a the minimum and maximum pore radii for samples s1 s5 are 0 5 μm and 5 μm respectively while the minimum and maximum pore radii r min and r max for samples w1 w5 are different which are listed in table 2 it can be clearly seen from fig 5 that the pore structures of ten porous samples indicate good fractal scaling characteristics the pore fractal dimensions for samples s1 s5 are respectively 2 828 2 863 2 894 2 884 and 2 874 which indicate highly heterogeneous pore structures and the pore fractal dimension firstly increase and then decrease with the increment of dewatering time and sample weight as shown in fig 5 b the pore fractal dimensions for samples w1 w5 are 2 662 2 815 2 857 2 888 2 909 that is the heterogeneity for pore structures of samples w1 w5 increases significantly as sample weight increases the pore fractal dimension can be also calculated according to eq 5 with measured minimum and maximum pore size as well as porosity d f 2 3 log ϕ log r min r max the pore fractal dimensions by eq 5 are listed in table 2 the porosity of porous samples were measured by nmr and the minimum and maximum pore size were determined by fpd method in fig 5 the relative error is defined as σ d f 1 d f 2 d f 1 100 which is smaller than 1 σ 1 it means the pore fractal dimensions by fpd model eq 8 are in good accordance with that by the power law of porosity eq 5 5 conclusions in this paper a new fpd model has been developed for the pore structures of porous media the pore fractal dimension can be calculated by the power law between porosity and ratio of minimum to maximum pore size eq 5 it can be also determined by fitting the data of cumulative volume function and pore size eq 8 in order to analyze the fractal characteristics of porous media with the proposed fractal probability density model ten porous samples have been measured by the low field nmr technique the results indicate that the pore fractal dimension by eq 5 is in good accordance with that by eq 8 the pore fractal dimension increases with porosity under fixed pore size range the value of fractal dimension for the porous samples is larger than 2 6 indicating highly heterogeneous pore structures and the dewatering conditions show significant effect on the pore structures low field nmr technique provides a rapid and nondestructive method for pore structures via detecting transverse relaxation time and it has been widely applied in oil and gas reservoir water resources sludge dewatering food and construction engineering etc the proposed fpd model presents a general and effective method to determine the pore fractal dimension based on nmr results which can be used to quantitatively characterize the pore structures and help understanding the transport phenomenon in porous media credit authorship
