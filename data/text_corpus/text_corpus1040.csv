5200,actual evaporation ea can be calculated as a fraction of potential evaporation pe which refers to the evaporation rate if supply water is unlimited potential evaporation depends on the available energy and the underlying material and different approaches to estimate potential evaporation exist nowadays this study provides a detailed analysis of the evaporation dynamics over fully saturated sandy soil pes and an open water surface pew moreover the performance of commonly used methods to estimate pe is assessed at the basis of these analyses is a lysimeter experiment in the guanzhong basin china which allowed a precise measurement of pe with a very high temporal resolution temperature profiles in lysimeters and meteorological data were also measured during the experiment a comparison of pes and pew was carried out for seven consecutive days august 11th to 17th 2016 results show that pew is smaller than pes on a daily scale with pew rates being bigger than pes at night but smaller during daytime furthermore the temporal dynamics of pew lags 4 5 h behind pes in accordance with the energy balance equation pe dynamics are mainly governed by available energy the pe rates calculated by penman monteith pm and priestly taylor pt based on these measurements were also evaluated the measured pe is relatively well reproduced by pm and pt equations finally the effect of using different approaches to estimate pe on calculating ea was tested by an integrated hydrological model that calculates water flow in the unsaturated zone by solving the richards equation the

soil evaporation open water evaporation energy balance equation lysimeter 1 introduction evaporation is the physical process by which liquid water is transferred to the gaseous state of water vapor jensen and allen 2016 evaporation has been extensively studied in hydrology agricultural sciences and meteorology and is of critical importance to the hydrological cycle morton 1994 burt et al 2005 trenberth et al 2009 or et al 2013 directly measuring actual evaporation rates ea is challenging bavel 1966 zhidong et al 1988 verhoef and campbell 2005 wang and dickinson 2012 lensky et al 2018 various methods are available to measure evaporation rates table a appendix a widely used approach in agricultural sciences is the bowen ratio energy balance method it requires accurate measurements of vertical gradients of air temperature humidity and net radiation to obtain the latent heat flux for evaporation le and sensible heat flux h tanner 1988 devitt et al 1998 kahler and brutsaert 2006 however the bowen ratio approach is associated with several uncertainties in addition to random and instrumental errors errors related to simplifying assumptions in the underlying theory cause biases for example the diffusivities of heat and moisture are assumed to be equal and the energy storage is neglected blad and rosenberg 1974 angus and watts 1984 gavilán and berengena 2007 another method is the eddy covariance ec method which measures le and h using high frequency sensors tanner 1988 verhoef and campbell 2005 wang and dickinson 2012 it is one of the main methods to measure evaporation rates despite the high installation and maintenance cost and problems related to closing the energy balance e g wilson et al 2002 franssen et al 2010 besides ec measurements are affected by large random errors e g hollinger and richardson 2005 richardson et al 2006 kessomkiat et al 2013 thus resulting in large uncertainties for hourly estimates of ea stable estimates of evaporation rates by ec can only be calculated over three hours of measurement depending on the site specific conditions culf et al 2004 mahrt 2010 huntington et al 2011 kessomkiat et al 2013 an alternative for estimating evaporation is using lysimeters lysimeters allow to directly measure evaporation rates even over short time periods hellwig 1973 holmes 1984 scanlon et al 1997 goss and ehlers 2010 jensen and allen 2016 pütz et al 2018 despite their high accuracy lysimeters are not routinely used because of the high installation cost random errors related for example to measurement uncertainty especially in arid regions they are rarely used also lysimeter data are not necessarily representive for larger regions as an alternative approach to directly estimating ea a commonly used strategy is to estimate potential evaporation rate pe first and on this basis calculate ea this approach is more extensively used compared to the above mentioned methods because it is based on meteorological data which are widely and readily available the ratio between ea and pe depends on factors such as soil type soil water availability federer et al 1996 kirono et al 2010 atmospheric resistance heat conductance mcilroy 1984 and radiative properties mahrt and ek 1984 of the surface numerous methods to estimate pe have been suggested we loosely assign these methods to the following three categories according to the surface type a evaporation from an open water surface pew shuttleworth for example defined pe as evaporation from an idealized extensive free water surface shuttleworth 1983 mahrt also defined pe as evaporation occurring over a free water surface which implies that pe rates are only controlled by the atmospheric conditions mahrt and ek 1984 mahrt 2010 different approaches to determine pew have been developed for example dalton type equations consisting of wind speed function and vapor pressure deficit and so called combination models such as de bruin keijman equations bruin 1982 b evaporation from a saturated soil surface pes the formulation to calculate evaporation from a saturated soil surface was originally proposed by penman penman 1948 the penman equation combines meteorological measurements with a surface energy balance it is one of the most important approaches to estimate pe mcjannet et al 2013 based on penman van bavel extended the definition of pe rate as when surface is wet and imposes no restriction upon the flow of water vapor bavel 1966 priestley and taylor developed a simpler model to estimate pes as opposed to the penman equation the aerodynamic term is not considered instead a correction factor to the energy balance is added priestley and taylor 1972 menenti and choudhury also defined pe in relation to the saturated soil surface as the rate of liquid to vapour transition which is not affected by the liquid water flow beneath the physical boundary of the evaporating body menenti and choudhury 1993 milly proposed that ea is equal to the potential value when the soil has a sufficiently high soil moisture content milly 1992 brutsaert introduced the apparent potential evaporation rate and defined it as the evaporation rate that would occur if the surface would be well supplied with water brutsaert 2013 a completely saturated soil surface is common in wetlands and areas where the depth to groundwater is smaller than the capillary rise height c potential evaporation for vegetation with fixed geometric and aerodynamic features reference evapo transpi ration et0 this concept also originated from penman he combined energy and aerodynamic terms and defined the et0 as the evaporation rate by a short green crop which completely shades the ground and is of uniform height with plenty of water penman 1948 federer et al 1996 the developed penman equation is widely used in agricultural and hydrological research providing a quantitative basis to estimate the crop water requirements such as proposed for example in the fao58 method monteith and unsworth 2008 calculating ea on the basis of pe is the most widely implemented approach in many disciplines including hydrogeology e g groundwater modelling hydrology watershed modelling and agricultural applications estimation of irrigation demand different approaches to calculate pe exist but it is unclear which approach should be used and how large the biases induced in estimating ea are in fact pes pew and et0 have all been used as a starting point to estimate actual ea granger 1989 allen et al 1989 westra 2009 kirono et al 2010 in addition ea can also be calculated based on energy balance considerations and coupling of the water and energy cycles as is usually done in land surface models and micrometeorological applications it is assumed that this approach can yield more precise ea estimates but it requires more input data than the other pe based approaches the aim of this paper is to provide a quantitative assessment and comparison of approaches to estimate potential evaporation over open water and saturated bare soil based on the energy balance method and equations to estimate pe such as the penman monteith and the priestly taylor equations the basis for this comparison is a unique lysimeter experiment in a warm temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate near xi an shaanxi province guanzhong basin china in which evaporation rates are measured for a water column and a fully saturated soil column the lysimeters are operated in a way that allows us to accurately measure evaporation rates with a high temporal discretization a measurement is taken every half an hour given that alternative methods to estimate evaporation rate cannot reach a high temporal resolution our study is unique moreover to the best of our knowledge the above mentioned pe estimation methods have so far not been compared with precise hourly measured pe data specifically the following questions are addressed what are the diurnal dynamics of measured pe for the water column pew and fully saturated soil column pes how can the differences be explained from a physical point of view how does the choice of pe estimation methods energy balance vs pm and pt methods compare to measured pe bare soil vs open water surface how does the choice of pe affect subsequent estimates of actual evaporation rate ea in numerical models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted at the semi arid groundwater and environment experimental site located at chang an university xi an china latitude 34 28 n longitude 108 93 e lysimeter observation columns made by fiberglass are buried and aligned with the ground surface and all have the same area 1 0 m2 and height 0 7 m see fig 1 the lysimeters are more than ten meters away from the roadside trees note that on the photo in fig 1 they appear closer this is due to the vantage point of the photograph from the only high rise building where a panorama photo of the experimental site can be taken the observation columns are filled with homogeneous fine sand from the guanzhong basin the particle composition is based on the standard for soil test method gb t50123 1999 shown in table 1 2 2 field measurements a standard meteorological station is located in the southwestern part of the experimental site measures air temperature humidity net radiation components wind speed and air pressure fig 1 illustrates the measurement setup including the height of the sensors all data were logged every 5 min the commercial names and model of the measurement devices employed are listed in table b appendix temperature sensors instrument 5tm and mps6 are buried at 3 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm depth in the soil of the lysimeter column as shown in fig 1 and 5 10 20 40 60 cm depth in the soil out of the lysimeter data are automatically recorded by the em50 data logger every 5 min water temperatures are measured at the same depth as in the soil by a resistor temperature sensor 1 3din and also automatically recorded every 5 min if a lysimeter has continuous water supply evaporation is not restricted by water availability but by the net available energy and environmental conditions westra 2009 we designed our setup in a way that the measured evaporation rate corresponds to the potential evaporation pe direct measurements of potential evaporation for saturated fine sand pes and water pew were made by the automatic water replenishing markov bottle this system was invented by chang an university and can provide reliable evaporation data with a high temporal resolution it got a utility model patent in 2014 shen et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 the water table in the columns was maintained at the soil water surface which means the water table depth is zero the markov bottle is installed in the basement connecting the columns with the balance cup when evaporation takes place water is rapidly replenished the device is based on the principle of connected vessels and given the principle of mass balance the water quantity evaporated in the lysimeter column ma equals to the quantity delivered by the markov bottle mc we can rewrite this as 1 π r a 2 δh a π r c 2 δh c where δha is the pe rate of the lysimeter δhc is the water level variation in the markov bottle which can be measured by pressure sensors in the bottle mpm489 microsensor see fig 1 ra 56 5 cm and rc 6 0 cm are the radius of the lysimeter column and the markov bottle respectively so that 2 δ h a δ h c 88 7 a drop of the water level in the markov bottle of 88 7 cm thus coincides with an evaporation rate in the lysimeter column of 1 cm the set up allows determining the evaporation with very high accuracy a linear statistical analysis was employed to assess the temporal dynamics of pes and pew in relation to meteorological data 3 v v i v min v max v min where vi represents a measured pe or a meteorological variable vmax and vmin are the maximum and minimum values in the measured time series the measured data also form the basis for the comparison with the upcoming methods 2 3 energy balance energy balance approaches are widely used to estimate evaporation rates singh and xu 2015 the energy balance at the land atmosphere interface is given by 4 a r n s g s h s le s soil b r n w g w h w le w water where the subscripts s and w refer to fine sand and water respectively rn w m2 is the net radiation nw w m2 represents the change of heat storage in the water body and gs w m2 is soil heat flux h w m2 is the sensible heat flux and le w m2 is the latent heat flux for evaporation rn gs and nw are positive in the downward direction while le and h are positive upwards the equations for all terms in eq 4 are provided in the appendix equations 17 31 net radiation rn is different for fine sand and water owing to their different albedos equations 17 21 of the appendix the sensible heat flux h calculated through equations 28 31 of the appendix is often negative as most of the energy over the lysimeter and water columns is used for evaporation the gradient method eq 22 is considered as a standard method for calculating the soil heat flux gs horton et al 1983 evett et al 2012 note however that it is difficult to measure the temperature at the soil surface in practice the gradient method is therefore based on temperature mseasurements in the shallow surface e g between 3 cm and 5 cm below ground in this study the heat flux within the soil abbreviated with g0 is not equivalent to gs as it neglects heat storage δ s between the location of the highest sensor and soil surface this can result in errors up to 10 massman 1993 heitman et al 2010 while in practice gs is often approximated through g0 we correct this estimate in the following way an et al 2017 5 g s g 0 δ s where δ s is calculated from temporal soil temperature variations braud et al 1993 roxy et al 2014 the temperature measured at 3 cm depth is used to estimate δ s in eq 5 ochsner et al 2007 assuming it represents the average temperature in the uppermost surface 6 δ s δ z c s t i 1 t i δ t where the subscript i refers to time t i 1 t i k is the temporal temperature variation δ z is the layer thickness over which the heat storage is calculated 3 cm in this work cs is the soil volumetric heat capacity and equal to 2 19 mj m3k calculated through eq 24 δ t is time step 30 min in this study for water heat storage nw is a significant component of the energy balance which can be calculated according to gallego elvira et al 2011 mcjannet et al 2013 7 n w ρ w c w z t i 1 t i δt where ρ w 1000 kg m 3 is the water density c w 4 2 k j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of water z m is the depth of a water layer the water column was divided into layers of 10 cm depth to calculate heat storage of water the temperature used to calculate nw for each layer is based on linear interpolation i refers to time t i 1 t i k is the temporal temperature variation and δ t is the time step 30 min one complication of our specific setup is that the net energy balance of the lysimeter is affected by horizontal energy exchange gh between the lysimeter column and the surroundings the horizontal heat fluxes for fine sand gh s and water gh w were estimated based on linear interpolation of measured temperature along vertical profiles inside and outside the lysimeter t outside t inside s or t outside t inside w gh s and gh w are calculated every 30 min by eq 22 with λ fiberglass 0 4 w m 1 k 1 li 2018 and thickness of the lysimeter wall equivalent to 0 02 m for the water column the horizontal heat flux gh w is an additional energy term and we assume that it affects latent heat in the same way as rn this is justified given the homogeneous vertical temperature profile for water see upcoming fig 6 for soil on the other hand the vertical temperature distribution inside the lysimeter column is not uniform the horizontal energy continuing to the soil lysimeter column in the deeper layers will contribute much less to an increase of the latent heat flux than the net radiation available to the upper soil layers we consider this effect by introducing an exponential type weighting function as a function of soil depth to estimate the average temperature inside t inside s 8 t inside s j 1 50 t j y j where the subscript j refers to depth t j corresponds to the soil temperatures at different depths yj is calculated in the following way 9 y j e φ j where yj represents the weight for the measured soil temperature at a particular depth φ is the shape parameter which is modified through trial and error to close the energy balance the value of 0 397 was employed in this study see fig 9 thus gh can be calculated as 10 g h s λ fiberglass t outside t inside s 0 02 λ fiberglass t outside j 1 50 t j e φj 0 02 soil g h w λ fiberglass t outside t inside w 0 02 water a further complication of this column experiment is that the water which is replenished to supply evaporation from the markov bottle located in the basement of the lysimeter site has a lower temperature than the soil water in the column the extra energy q kj d which is injected in the lysimeter related to this temperature difference δt c has to be taken into account if it is a significant component of the energy balance 11 q c w m δ t where cw 4 2 kj kg c is water heat capacity m kg d is the water flux which needs to be replenished related to evaporation per day a detailed assessment of the importance of this component was carried out and showed that the incoming flux only corresponds to about 1 3 of the latent heat this is related to the fact that the inflowing water flux as well as the temperature difference between the inflowing water and the lysimeter are small we therefore do not explicitly consider this term in the upcoming analysis as shown in fig 2 all additional energy terms were added in the energy balance equations for the sand and water lysimeter columns 12 a g h s r n

modelling with hydrogeosphere numerical models such as hydrogeosphere hgs are widely applied for applications at the field or catchment scale to simulate surface and subsurface flow processes including transpiration and evaporation processes as well as infiltration and capillary rise brunner and simmons 2012 potential evaporation is a critical input for these simulations here we explore the influence of potential evaporation on actual evaporation by using pe rates obtained from free water surface and pe obtained in the saturated soil actual evaporation dynamics under these different boundary conditions are tested for two soil types sand and silty clay for different depths of the water table we carry out the simulations for two soil types because the hydraulic properties of the soil strongly influence the relation between pe and ea an important parameter for these simulations is the extinction depth the extinction depth represents the groundwater table depth at which phreatic evaporation would approximate zero shah et al 2007 the extinction depth of sand was set to be 0 5 m ma et al 2019 and to 3 35 m for silty clay this value is based on shah et al 2007 the models are run until steady state conditions are reached for fixed water table depths of 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 m in sandy soils 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 4 m for silty clay the fixed water tables are maintained through a constant head boundary hgs is based on the richards equation which simulates flow in the unsaturated zone the richards equations relates fluxes to differences in hydraulic heads in the unsaturated zone capillary rise and infiltration processes are driven by head differences and are thus directly simulated by hgs the relation between saturation pressure and hydraulic conductivity is parametrized using the van genuchten approach van genuchten 1980 hydraulic properties from fine sand are taken from measurements hydraulic properties for silty clay are based on carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated water content θ s corresponds to the porosity an overview of the soil hydraulic parameters is shown in table 2 hgs uses pe as an upper boundary condition and calculates ea as a function of soil moisture content therrien et al 2010 15 e a α pe edf α 1 θ θ e 1 θ θ e 2 θ e 1 θ e 2 θ e 2 θ θ e 1 0 θ θ e 2 α is the wetness condition of the subsurface determined by soil moisture

water availability in the soil below θ e 2 the actual evaporation is zero θ is the actual soil moisture content calculated with the richards equation an additional condition for evaporation to occur is related to the pressure heads in the unsaturated zone if the pressure head drops below a certain threshold e g 1 m no evaporation occurs vertical discretization was sufficiently high 1 cm to avoid numerical problems related to solving the richards equation 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and lysimeter measurements 3 1 1 meteorology meteorological data from 2005 to 2020 15 years from jinghe national meteorological station a few kilometers away from our experiment site are shown in fig 3 the yearly cycles of the average temperature and pan evaporation are plotted in fig 3a the average monthly rainfall and sunshine duration are displayed in fig 3b the hottest period of the year is between the beginning of july and the middle of august with a mean temperature of 27 7 c based on the statistics over the period 2005 2020 evaporation during summer represents 38 of the evaporation of the whole year fig 4 shows that summer temperatures in 2016 were higher than the long term average with a mean value of 29 3 c historically rainfall is concentrated in august fig 3b average monthly precipitation 87 mm with less sunshine during that month 192 h in 2016 the august was drier 50 mm precipitation and sunnier 290 h sun the period of august 11 until august 17 was the hottest period in 2016 the meteorological conditions of our experimental period are closely following the multi annual characteristics in summer our selected period is therefore representative for warm dry periods in summer with a high evaporative demand for the guanzhong basin fig 5 shows the time series and average diurnal cycles for the different meteorological variables in this period this figure illustrates the typical daily cycles with maximum values for wind speed air temperature and incoming radiation terms in the afternoon and minimal daily values of relative humidity and vapor pressure the average wind speed reaches a maximum in the afternoon in general wind speed is relatively low in the guanzhong basin air temperature is fluctuating between 26 and 39 c during this week with a mean value of 32 3 c relative humidity varies between 33 and 75 with a mean value of 53 vapor pressure varies between 2 and 2 8 kpa incoming radiation is the energy input for evaporation incoming short wave radiation varies between 3 and 900 w m2 and incoming longwave radiation is around 450 w m2 the maximum value of radiation occurred around 12 50 beijing time as it is the local midday time in summer 3 1 2 temperature profiles in the lysimeter columns fig 6 shows the half hourly vertical temperature variation for saturated fine sand ts and water tw on the basis of measurements at 3 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm depth ts and tw roughly follow a sine function fig 6 c related to the net radiation balance the variations of ts with depth show considerable differences in time the timing of the maximum and minimum values for ts and corresponding amplitudes at different depths are shown in table 3 the amplitude of ts is smaller with increasing depth this is related to the fact that incoming radiation cannot penetrate soil and heat the soil surface only the downward heat transport is delayed because of heat storage and the relatively slow heat conduction in soil these dynamics are highlighted in fig 6a the slope of ts along the vertical soil profile is indicated by the angle β it is a proxy for the temperature transmission time in the vertical direction slower transmission associated with larger angles on the other hand tw is quite uniform over depth the temporal evolution of the vertical gradient of tw indicates that the water column is well mixed the black line in fig 6 b the angle of the gradient along the vertical profile β is 0 this can be explained as follows 1 water has a bigger heat capacity than soil and daily temperature variations are more strongly buffered than in soil 2 short wave radiation can penetrate deeper in the water column thus directly heating a larger vertical column than for soil 3 moreover vertical mixing might be increased through wind which is not the case for the soil column 3 2 potential evaporation fig 7 shows the measured daily average temperatures and pe rates from august 1st to 26th the differences in pe between fine sand and water are more obvious during hot days august 11th 17th detailed analyses were made for these seven consecutive days 3 2 1 diurnal pe dynamics fig 8 shows the diurnal time series of pes and pew together with the average diurnal cycles the time series of pes and pew were different in terms of absolute values and temporal dynamics for pes 78 of the daily evaporation took place between sunrise and sunset 5 30 19 30 the remaining 22 evaporate after sunset on the other hand for the water lysimeter nighttime evaporation is 5 larger than daytime evaporation as fig 8c illustrates between 9 00 and 17 30 pes pew but during night time pes pew the peak value for pes was larger than for pew and the average daily sum of pes was 21 higher than for pew the peak value of pes was measured in the afternoon 14 00 16 00 while pew reached its maximum later in the evening 20 00 22 00 the minimum of pes occurred during the night while for pew it was around noon the peak value of pew is lagging 6 h behind the one for pes also pes and pew were lagging behind the diurnal cycles of meteorological variables me but for pew this lag was much larger than for pes linear correlation analysis was used to determine this specific lag time in order to assess the lag time a simple time shift was introduced and the linear correlation coefficients between pe and the meteorological variable were calculated tables 4 and 5 show that for time lag zero t 0 pes has a positive correlation with net radiation air temperature and wind speed negative correlations are observed with humidity and vapour pressure pew has a relatively strong positive correlation with wind speed while for other variables the correlation coefficients reach their maximum value for relatively large time lags of 4 6 h illustrating that pew lags behind the meteorological variables in summary the diurnal cycle of pew lagged almost 4 5 h behind the one for pes during summer this can be explained by energy balance considerations as discussed in the next section 3 3 energy fluxes 3 3 1 net radiation fig 9 shows the diurnal variation of the calculated flux terms for the saturated fine sand and water columns in equation 12 fig 9a shows the net radiation rn which is the energy input for the fine sand and water columns net radiation was slightly negative during nighttime and increased after sunrise 7 00 reaching a maximum around 13 00 water 720 w m2 saturated fine sand 540 w m2 and decreasing afterwards again turning into negative in the beginning of the evening around sunset the green curve fig 9a right represents the difference between rn w and rn s the value is positive during the daytime as the albedo of water is lower than for fine sand 3 3 2 heat flux storage gs for fine sand and nw for water represent the energy variation related to heat storage inside the column system fig 9b the curves of gs and nw have different shapes with nw having a much more pronounced daily amplitude both nw and gs are negative during the night and nw has more negative values than gs 250 w m2 resp 50 w m2 on average 340 w m2 resp 64 w m2 as minimum values the time series for gs and nw reach positive values during day time 8 00 17 30 the green time series in the right of fig 9b displays the diurnal cycle of the average difference between nw and gs during daytime the water column stores more heat than saturated bare soil the maximum difference is around 540 w m2 and releases more energy during the night this is related to the increased heat capacity of water compared to the soil 3 3 3 horizontal heat flux horizontal energy exchange between the lysimeter and the surroundings gh s or water gh w is important for energy closure the results are shown in fig 9c the two curves show a similar trend gh s is positive from 18 00 13 00 as heat is transferred from the surroundings into saturated fine sand reaching the maximum value 110 w m2 before dawn and is negative in the afternoon gh w is negative most of the time except from 2 30 10 00 as heat is transferred from the water column to the surroundings in general the lysimeter columns are absorbing heat during the night and releasing heat at day 3 3 4 sensible heat flux the sensible heat flux h represents the turbulent exchange of sensible heat at the interface of the land and the atmosphere results are shown in fig 9d hw is negative from 10 30 20 30 as heat is transferred from the overlying air into the water and positive from 21 30 10 00 as water is releasing sensible heat to the air the net sum of h is close to zero in general during the summer months hw is close to zero finch 2001 hs is negative most of the time except around noon in this experimental setup we have a so called oasis effect which occurs primarily in summer it is related to the fact that the lysimeter is always saturated and shows a strong evaporation whereas the surroundings have low soil moisture content net radiation is therefore mainly used for sensible heat flux hao et al 2016 the evaporation over the lysimeter is enhanced by the high air temperatures in the surrounding of the lysimeter so that the soil surface temperature is smaller than the measured air temperature ts ta 0 the oasis effect induces lateral transfer of sensible heat towards the lysimeter causing lower h and larger le than in normal situations therefore the sensible heat flux above the lysimeter is small and almost all available energy is used for evaporation and heat storage in sand and water columns during summer the absolute value of h above a well watered surface is significantly smaller than the latent heat flux a range of studies found that h can be negligible compared with net radiation or latent heat flux tanner and pelton 1960 katul and parlange 1992 finch 2001 gallego elvira et al 2011 3 3 5 latent heat flux for both lysimeters fig 10 shows the measured and calculated time series of latent heat for evaporation les and lew according to the energy balance method the penman monteith pm and priestly taylor pt equations based on half hourly data table 6 shows the daily average value of pe calculated by pm pt and the energy balance equations in order to compare the different approaches different evaluation statistics were calculated the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe between calculated and measured le for seven days and for the average diurnal cycles table 7 shows the evaluation statistics all three methods resulted in a relatively good estimation of pe the estimation of les corresponds better to the measurements than the estimation of lew with bigger r2 based on the different statistical measures the quality of the estimated values of le by the three different methods was similar with slightly better performance of the energy balance method for the soil

zero with the increase of the water table depth the depth where evaporation drops to zero can be slightly larger than the extinction depth because the imposed extinction depth has not been established jointly with the soil evaporation parameters for sandy soil the absolute value of relative differences were up to 17 5 fig 11 b for silty clay relative differences decreased with the increase of water table depth fig 11 d 4 discussion 4 1 experimental setup and data analysis the experimental setup developed in this study allows for a unique comparison between evaporation dynamics over an open water surface as well as saturated bare soil with a very high temporal resolution the employed markov bottle approach proved suitable in this experimental setup the size of the lysimeters was relatively large 1 0 m2 each and deep 0 7 m each to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a detailed study on the dynamics of potential evaporation has been carried for a warm temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate region a complication of the study was the horizontal heat exchange between the lysimeter and the surrounding soil insulating the lysimeters could reduce heat exchange with the surrounding soil but even with additional insulation horizontal heat exchange will not be zero we have considered this effect by estimating horizontal heat exchange using average values of the vertical temperatures in the lysimeters this is straightforward for the water column as vertically no relevant temperature differences were observed for soil it is more complicated our suggested depth weighted approach constitutes a simple calibration procedure by manually modifying φ in equation 9 to close the energy balance under consideration of horizontal heat exchange clearly this is a simplification of the underlying physics a more complete analysis however would require a spatially distributed numerical model of the energy fluxes which was beyond the scope of this paper the study focused on a relatively short time span but our selected period is representative for warm dry periods in summer with a high evaporative demand in addition to analyzing daily dynamics studying long term seasonal dynamics would certainly also be of interest but was also not the focus of this study in summary the chosen experimental setup and the subsequent treatment of the data were considered to be of sufficient accuracy for the subsequent analysis 4 2 potential evaporation over open water and saturated bare soil the comparison between the two lysimeters revealed differences in both the absolute value as well as the temporal dynamics for the analyzed period differences up to 21 between the two average pe rates were observed the diurnal cycle of pew lagged almost 4 5 h behind the one for pes during summer this can be explained by energy balance considerations these differences show the importance of the composition of the ground for estimating potential evaporation rates these two findings have a range of implications for example precision agriculture requires accurate temporal estimates of evaporation dynamics of the soil to estimate hourly irrigation rates the differences in the absolute values are important for all approaches which estimate actual evaporation based on potential evaporation the following physical properties differ between the saturated bare soil and water columns 1 the surface albedo 2 the thermal properties including the differences in heat capacity thermal conductance and the depth of energy adsorption in our case the albedo of the soil is larger than the albedo of water as shown in fig 9a resulting in a decreased amount of absorbed energy note that this does not necessarily mean that the latent heat flux for evaporation is smaller for soil because the re distribution of energy is also significantly affected by the physical properties of the underlying material our analysis identified significant differences in the soil heat flux related to vertical differences of temperature and the heat storage in the water fig 12 shows the temperature data used to calculate nw and gs g0 δs although the vertical temperature gradient is smaller for water than for soil nw is much larger than gs shown in fig 9b leaving less energy for evaporation which is caused by the differences in thermal properties the difference in vertical temperature gradients between the soil and water columns which influence gs and nw can be explained during the day for saturated fine sand net radiation can only heats a thin surface layer of the soil column and heat slowly diffuses downwards resulting in a relatively small value for the soil heat flux gs therefore a more important fraction of the net radiation is available for evaporation for water on the other hand gh w rn w is mainly used to heat water we found that gh w rn w nw gh s rn s gs so less energy is available for latent heat flux even though rn for the water column is higher than for the fine sand column during the night besides gh s both rn gs and nw are negative and nw is more negative than gs thus gh w rn w nw gh s rn s gs water releases energy stored during the daytime for evaporation so that water has a bigger evaporation rate than saturated fine sand at night 4 3 performance of approaches to estimate pe 4 3 1 energy balance method and priestly taylor equations given that the priestly taylor and the energy balance resulted in nearly identical diurnal curves the discussion of the energy balance likewise applies to the pt method the results calculated from the energy balance equation are discussed by introducing the energy balance ratio ebr le measured h g h r n g s or n w is equal to 1 if the energy budget is closed if ebr 1 calculated le is underestimated compared to lemeasured if ebr 1 calculated le is overestimated for water the energy balance cannot be closed satisfactorily lew is significantly underestimated from 13 00 15 30 ebr 1 and overestimated from 17 30 19 00 ebr 1 the imbalance from 13 00 15 30 can be explained with errors associated with the overestimation of heat storage nw these errors are related to the vertical temperature variations as can be seen in fig 6 some stratification took place however the vertical discretization to calculate changes in heat storage might have been too coarse to capture these variations adequatly the second imbalance occurred in the evening this might be related to the high wind speed and turbulence in the evening which leads to ripples in the water column potentially causing measurement errors arnon et al 2014 lensky et al 2018 for saturated fine sand the energy balance closure could be achieved during daytime however an imbalance existed between 8 00 11 00 ebr 1 and 19 30 23 00 ebr 1 the first imbalance occurred in the morning the calculation overestimates les there appears to be a certain time lag between available energy and the onset of evaporation the second imbalance occurred after sunset when les was underestimated this might be related to the relative importance of the soil heat flux at night already small biases of g0 will play a major role in the estimation of the latent heat flux at night the inability to close the energy balance during these periods can therefore be related to inaccuracies in estimating g0 an et al 2016 errors on gs includes ground heat flux g0 and heat storage δs are as suggested by foken 2008 probably the most important source of error affecting the energy balance in most conditions although during some periods the energy balance could not be closed for both open water and fine sand columns it did not significantly affect the reliability of this study balance closure is difficult to achieve and the improvement of theory and observation methods in the future should allow for reducing this error 4 3 2 penman monteith equation the application of the pm equation on the fine sand and water columns shows a satisfactory correlation with measured data on a daily time scale fig 13 shows the time series for calculated aerodynamic resistance ra the aerodynamic term for evaporation leaero equation 13 and parameter αpt based on the penman monteith equation αpt lepm leenergy the values of ra were inversely proportional to wind speed and leaero mahrt and ek 1984 choudhury et al 1986 viney 1991 yang et al 2001 liu et al 2007 its influence on the evaporation rate mainly depends on wind speed and the surface roughness during the research period wind speed was higher in the evenings resulting in smaller ra and higher leaero rates fig 13 a b c for both soil and water during the evening in the pt equation αpt 1 26 which impies that the leaero value is replaced with 0 26 αpt 1 times of leenergy as shown in fig 13 d instead of a fixed value actual αpt varies over a large range the contribution of leaero to total le was different for the soil and water columns for the saturated bare soil column the available energy term gh s rn s gs is bigger at day so that the aerodynamic resistance contribution to les is smaller at day and bigger in the evening on the other hand for the water column the energy term is smaller around noon resulting in a larger contribution of the aerodynamic term our results also suggest that the good performance of the three methods highly depends on accurate calculation of the energy balance terms especially also the total heat flux or heat storage 4 4 the effect of different pe on calculating ea using numerical models ea was calculated by hgs for both sandy soil and silty clay using measured pes and pew as input differences up to 17 5 of the resulting ea were observed given the dependency of pe on the surface properties we propose to calculate pe in hydrological modelling studies for different surface types instead of imposing one value of pe across the entire modelling domain the above mentioned results are especially important for large scale distributed hydrological models an alternative is to employ land surface models where water and energy balances are solved in a coupled fashion however in many hydrological modelling studies this is not feasible so that the pe choice becomes of high importance further research will provide a more solid assessment based on larger time series 5 conclusions potential evaporation was measured during august 2016 for saturated fine sand pes and water pew columns using lysimeters installed in the guanzhong basin china the experimental setup allowed for a very high temporal resolution of all measured quantities this study therefore goes beyond previous assessments of potential evaporation to the best of our knowledge it is also the first time these dynamics were studied in such detail for semi arid climates the measurement data were analyzed with the help of energy balance considerations and numerical calculations the following conclusions can be drawn the application of lysimeters as suggested in this study proved to be highly beneficial it allowed to achieve an unprecedented temporal resolution on the dynamics of potential evaporation diurnal dynamics of pes and pew are significantly different pes was higher than pew pew was lagging 4 5 h behind pes this has important implications for all applications where a high temporal resolution of evaporation estimates is required for example for precision agriculture all three methods employed to estimate pe performed well the penman monteith equation and the energy balance approach describe both the radiative and aerodynamic processes during day and night from a theoretical point of view it is based on a comprehensive description of the relevant processes nevertheless the priestly taylor approach performed approximately as good as the penman monteith approach in spite of the simplifications the energy balance approach performed slightly better than the other approaches for the sand column note that these findings are specific to the climate conditions tested the calculation of actual evaporation based on the potential evaporation is not surprisingly strongly influenced by the choice of calculating pe saturated bare soil or water we observed relative differences in actual evaporation up to 17 5 if evaporation is calculated at the regional scale with a hydrological model the estimation of pe has to carefully consider the

5200,actual evaporation ea can be calculated as a fraction of potential evaporation pe which refers to the evaporation rate if supply water is unlimited potential evaporation depends on the available energy and the underlying material and different approaches to estimate potential evaporation exist nowadays this study provides a detailed analysis of the evaporation dynamics over fully saturated sandy soil pes and an open water surface pew moreover the performance of commonly used methods to estimate pe is assessed at the basis of these analyses is a lysimeter experiment in the guanzhong basin china which allowed a precise measurement of pe with a very high temporal resolution temperature profiles in lysimeters and meteorological data were also measured during the experiment a comparison of pes and pew was carried out for seven consecutive days august 11th to 17th 2016 results show that pew is smaller than pes on a daily scale with pew rates being bigger than pes at night but smaller during daytime furthermore the temporal dynamics of pew lags 4 5 h behind pes in accordance with the energy balance equation pe dynamics are mainly governed by available energy the pe rates calculated by penman monteith pm and priestly taylor pt based on these measurements were also evaluated the measured pe is relatively well reproduced by pm and pt equations finally the effect of using different approaches to estimate pe on calculating ea was tested by an integrated hydrological model that calculates water flow in the unsaturated zone by solving the richards equation the

jensen and allen 2016 evaporation has been extensively studied in hydrology agricultural sciences and meteorology and is of critical importance to the hydrological cycle morton 1994 burt et al 2005 trenberth et al 2009 or et al 2013 directly measuring actual evaporation rates ea is challenging bavel 1966 zhidong et al 1988 verhoef and campbell 2005 wang and dickinson 2012 lensky et al 2018 various methods are available to measure evaporation rates table a appendix a widely used approach in agricultural sciences is the bowen ratio energy balance method it requires accurate measurements of vertical gradients of air temperature humidity and net radiation to obtain the latent heat flux for evaporation le and sensible heat flux h tanner 1988 devitt et al 1998 kahler and brutsaert 2006 however the bowen ratio approach is associated with several uncertainties in addition to random and instrumental errors errors related to simplifying assumptions in the underlying theory cause biases for example the diffusivities of heat and moisture are assumed to be equal and the energy storage is neglected blad and rosenberg 1974 angus and watts 1984 gavilán and berengena 2007 another method is the eddy covariance ec method which measures le and h using high frequency sensors tanner 1988 verhoef and campbell 2005 wang and dickinson 2012 it is one of the main methods to measure evaporation rates despite the high installation and maintenance cost and problems related to closing the energy balance e g wilson et al 2002 franssen et al 2010 besides ec measurements are affected by large random errors e g hollinger and richardson 2005 richardson et al 2006 kessomkiat et al 2013 thus resulting in large uncertainties for hourly estimates of ea stable estimates of evaporation rates by ec can only be calculated over three hours of measurement depending on the site specific conditions culf et al 2004 mahrt 2010 huntington et al 2011 kessomkiat et al 2013 an alternative for estimating evaporation is using lysimeters lysimeters allow to directly measure evaporation rates even over short time periods hellwig 1973 holmes 1984 scanlon et al 1997 goss and ehlers 2010 jensen and allen 2016 pütz et al 2018 despite their high accuracy lysimeters are not routinely used because of the high installation cost random errors related for example to measurement uncertainty especially in arid regions they are rarely used also lysimeter data are not necessarily representive for larger regions as an alternative approach to directly estimating ea a commonly used strategy is to estimate potential evaporation rate pe first and on this basis calculate ea this approach is more extensively used compared to the above mentioned methods because it is based on meteorological data which are widely and readily available the ratio between ea and pe depends on factors such as soil type soil water availability federer et al 1996 kirono et al 2010 atmospheric resistance heat conductance mcilroy 1984 and radiative properties mahrt and ek 1984 of the surface numerous methods to estimate pe have been suggested we loosely assign these methods to the following three categories according to the surface type a evaporation from an open water surface pew shuttleworth for example defined pe as evaporation from an idealized extensive free water surface shuttleworth 1983 mahrt also defined pe as evaporation occurring over a free water surface which implies that pe rates are only controlled by the atmospheric conditions mahrt and ek 1984 mahrt 2010 different approaches to determine pew have been developed for example dalton type equations consisting of wind speed function and vapor pressure deficit and so called combination models such as de bruin keijman equations bruin 1982 b evaporation from a saturated soil surface pes the formulation to calculate evaporation from a saturated soil surface was originally proposed by penman penman 1948 the penman equation combines meteorological measurements with a surface energy balance it is one of the most important approaches to estimate pe mcjannet et al 2013 based on penman van bavel extended the definition of pe rate as when surface is wet and imposes no restriction upon the flow of water vapor bavel 1966 priestley and taylor developed a simpler model to estimate pes as opposed to the penman equation the aerodynamic term is not considered instead a correction factor to the energy balance is added priestley and taylor 1972 menenti and choudhury also defined pe in relation to the saturated soil surface as the rate of liquid to vapour transition which is not affected by the liquid water flow beneath the physical boundary of the evaporating body menenti and choudhury 1993 milly proposed that ea is equal to the potential value when the soil has a sufficiently high soil moisture content milly 1992 brutsaert introduced the apparent potential evaporation rate and defined it as the evaporation rate that would occur if the surface would be well supplied with water brutsaert 2013 a completely saturated soil surface is common in wetlands and areas where the depth to groundwater is smaller than the capillary rise height c potential evaporation for vegetation with fixed geometric and aerodynamic features reference evapo transpi ration et0 this concept also originated from penman he combined energy and aerodynamic terms and defined the et0 as the evaporation rate by a short green crop which completely shades the ground and is of uniform height with plenty of water penman 1948 federer et al 1996 the developed penman equation is widely used in agricultural and hydrological research providing a quantitative basis to estimate the crop water requirements such as proposed for example in the fao58 method monteith and unsworth 2008 calculating ea on the basis of pe is the most widely implemented approach in many disciplines including hydrogeology e g groundwater modelling hydrology watershed modelling and agricultural applications estimation of irrigation demand different approaches to calculate pe exist but it is unclear which approach should be used and how large the biases induced in estimating ea are in fact pes pew and et0 have all been used as a starting point to estimate actual ea granger 1989 allen et al 1989 westra 2009 kirono et al 2010 in addition ea can also be calculated based on energy balance considerations and coupling of the water and energy cycles as is usually done in land surface models and micrometeorological applications it is assumed that this approach can yield more precise ea estimates but it requires more input data than the other pe based approaches the aim of this paper is to provide a quantitative assessment and comparison of approaches to estimate potential evaporation over open water and saturated bare soil based on the energy balance method and equations to estimate pe such as the penman monteith and the priestly taylor equations the basis for this comparison is a unique lysimeter experiment in a warm temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate near xi an shaanxi province guanzhong basin china in which evaporation rates are measured for a water column and a fully saturated soil column the lysimeters are operated in a way that allows us to accurately measure evaporation rates with a high temporal discretization a measurement is taken every half an hour given that alternative methods to estimate evaporation rate cannot reach a high temporal resolution our study is unique moreover to the best of our knowledge the above mentioned pe estimation methods have so far not been compared with precise hourly measured pe data specifically the following questions are addressed what are the diurnal dynamics of measured pe for the water column pew and fully saturated soil column pes how can the differences be explained from a physical point of view how does the choice of pe estimation methods energy balance vs pm and pt methods compare to measured pe bare soil vs open water surface how does the choice of pe affect subsequent estimates of actual evaporation rate ea in numerical models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted at the semi arid groundwater and environment experimental site located at chang an university xi an china latitude 34 28 n longitude 108 93 e lysimeter observation columns made by fiberglass are buried and aligned with the ground surface and all have the same area 1 0 m2 and height 0 7 m see fig 1 the lysimeters are more than ten meters away from the roadside trees note that on the photo in fig 1 they appear closer this is due to the vantage point of the photograph from the only high rise building where a panorama photo of the experimental site can be taken the observation columns are filled with homogeneous fine sand from the guanzhong basin the particle composition is based on the standard for soil test method gb t50123 1999 shown in table 1 2 2 field measurements a standard meteorological station is located in the southwestern part of the experimental site measures air temperature humidity net radiation components wind speed and air pressure fig 1 illustrates the measurement setup including the height of the sensors all data were logged every 5 min the commercial names and model of the measurement devices employed are listed in table b appendix temperature sensors instrument 5tm and mps6 are buried at 3 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm depth in the soil of the lysimeter column as shown in fig 1 and 5 10 20 40 60 cm depth in the soil out of the lysimeter data are automatically recorded by the em50 data logger every 5 min water temperatures are measured at the same depth as in the soil by a resistor temperature sensor 1 3din and also automatically recorded every 5 min if a lysimeter has continuous water supply evaporation is not restricted by water availability but by the net available energy and environmental conditions westra 2009 we designed our setup in a way that the measured evaporation rate corresponds to the potential evaporation pe direct measurements of potential evaporation for saturated fine sand pes and water pew were made by the automatic water replenishing markov bottle this system was invented by chang an university and can provide reliable evaporation data with a high temporal resolution it got a utility model patent in 2014 shen et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 the water table in the columns was maintained at the soil water surface which means the water table depth is zero the markov bottle is installed in the basement connecting the columns with the balance cup when evaporation takes place water is rapidly replenished the device is based on the principle of connected vessels and given the principle of mass balance the water quantity evaporated in the lysimeter column ma equals to the quantity delivered by the markov bottle mc we can rewrite this as 1 π r a 2 δh a π r c 2 δh c where δha is the pe rate of the lysimeter δhc is the water level variation in the markov bottle which can be measured by pressure sensors in the bottle mpm489 microsensor see fig 1 ra 56 5 cm and rc 6 0 cm are the radius of the lysimeter column and the markov bottle respectively so that 2 δ h a δ h c 88 7 a drop of the water level in the markov bottle of 88 7 cm thus coincides with an evaporation rate in the lysimeter column of 1 cm the set up allows determining the evaporation with very high accuracy a linear statistical analysis was employed to assess the temporal dynamics of pes and pew in relation to meteorological data 3 v v i v min v max v min where vi represents a measured pe or a meteorological variable vmax and vmin are the maximum and minimum values in the measured time series the measured data also form the basis for the comparison with the upcoming methods 2 3 energy balance energy balance approaches are widely used to estimate evaporation rates

flux for evaporation rn gs and nw are positive in the downward direction while le and h are positive upwards the equations for all terms in eq 4 are provided in the appendix equations 17 31 net radiation rn is different for fine sand and water owing to their different albedos equations 17 21 of the appendix the sensible heat flux h calculated through equations 28 31 of the appendix is often negative as most of the energy over the lysimeter and water columns is used for evaporation the gradient method eq 22 is considered as a standard method for calculating the soil heat flux gs horton et al 1983 evett et al 2012 note however that it is difficult to measure the temperature at the soil surface in practice the gradient method is therefore based on temperature mseasurements in the shallow surface e g between 3 cm and 5 cm below ground in this study the heat flux within the soil abbreviated with g0 is not equivalent to gs as it neglects heat storage δ s between the location of the highest sensor and soil surface this can result in errors up to 10 massman 1993 heitman et al 2010 while in practice gs is often approximated through g0 we correct this estimate in the following way an et al 2017 5 g s g 0 δ s where δ s is calculated from temporal soil temperature variations braud et al 1993 roxy et al 2014 the temperature measured at 3 cm depth is used to estimate δ s in eq 5

time step 30 min one complication of our specific setup is that the net energy balance of the lysimeter is affected by horizontal energy exchange gh between the lysimeter column and the surroundings the horizontal heat fluxes for fine sand gh s and water gh w were estimated based on linear interpolation of measured temperature along vertical profiles inside and outside the lysimeter t outside t inside s or t outside t inside w gh s and gh w are calculated every 30 min by eq 22 with λ fiberglass 0 4 w m 1 k 1 li 2018 and thickness of the lysimeter wall equivalent to 0 02 m for the water column the horizontal heat flux gh w is an additional energy term and we assume that it affects latent heat in the same way as rn this is justified given the homogeneous vertical temperature profile for water see upcoming fig 6 for soil on the other hand the vertical temperature distribution inside the lysimeter column is not uniform the horizontal energy continuing to the soil lysimeter column in the deeper layers will contribute much less to an increase of the latent heat flux than the net radiation available to the upper soil layers we consider this effect by introducing an exponential type weighting function as a function of soil depth to estimate the average temperature inside t inside s 8 t inside s j 1 50 t j y j where the subscript j refers to depth t j corresponds to the soil temperatures at different depths yj is calculated in the following way 9 y j e φ j where yj represents the weight for the measured soil temperature at a particular depth φ is the shape parameter which is modified through trial and error to close the energy balance the value of 0 397 was employed in this study see fig 9 thus gh can be calculated as 10 g h s λ fiberglass t outside t inside s 0 02 λ fiberglass t outside j 1 50 t j e φj 0 02 soil g h w λ fiberglass t outside t inside w 0 02 water a further complication of this column experiment is that the water which is replenished to supply evaporation from the markov bottle located in the basement of the lysimeter site has a lower temperature than the soil water in the column the extra energy q kj d which is injected in the lysimeter related to this temperature difference δt c has to be taken into account if it is a significant component of the energy balance 11 q c w m δ t where cw 4 2 kj kg c is water heat capacity m kg d is the water flux which needs to be replenished related to evaporation per day a detailed assessment of the importance of this component was carried out and showed that the incoming flux only corresponds to about 1 3 of the latent heat this is related to the fact that the inflowing water flux as well as the temperature difference between the inflowing water and the lysimeter are small we therefore do not explicitly consider this term in the upcoming analysis as shown in fig 2 all additional energy terms were added in the energy balance equations for the sand and water lysimeter columns 12 a g h s r n

modelling with hydrogeosphere numerical models such as hydrogeosphere hgs are widely applied for applications at the field or catchment scale to simulate surface and subsurface flow processes including transpiration and evaporation processes as well as infiltration and capillary rise brunner and simmons 2012 potential evaporation is a critical input for these simulations here we explore the influence of potential evaporation on actual evaporation by using pe rates obtained from free water surface and pe obtained in the saturated soil actual evaporation dynamics under these different boundary conditions are tested for two soil types sand and silty clay for different depths of the water table we carry out the simulations for two soil types because the hydraulic properties of the soil strongly influence the relation between pe and ea an important parameter for these simulations is the extinction depth the extinction depth represents the groundwater table depth at which phreatic evaporation would approximate zero shah et al 2007 the extinction depth of sand was set to be 0 5 m ma et al 2019 and to 3 35 m for silty clay this value is based on shah et al 2007 the models are run until steady state conditions are reached for fixed water table depths of 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 m in sandy soils 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 4 m for silty clay the fixed water tables are maintained through a constant head boundary hgs is based on the richards equation which simulates flow in the unsaturated zone the richards equations relates fluxes to differences in hydraulic heads in the unsaturated zone capillary rise and infiltration processes are driven by head differences and are thus directly simulated by hgs the relation between saturation pressure and hydraulic conductivity is parametrized using the van genuchten approach van genuchten 1980 hydraulic properties from fine sand are taken from measurements hydraulic properties for silty clay are based on carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated water content θ s corresponds to the porosity an overview of the soil hydraulic parameters is shown in table 2 hgs uses pe as an upper boundary condition and calculates ea as a function of soil moisture content therrien et al 2010 15 e a α pe edf α 1 θ θ e 1 θ θ e 2 θ e 1 θ e 2 θ e 2 θ θ e 1 0 θ θ e 2 α is the wetness condition of the subsurface determined by soil moisture

water availability in the soil below θ e 2 the actual evaporation is zero θ is the actual soil moisture content calculated with the richards equation an additional condition for evaporation to occur is related to the pressure heads in the unsaturated zone if the pressure head drops below a certain threshold e g 1 m no evaporation occurs vertical discretization was sufficiently high 1 cm to avoid numerical problems related to solving the richards equation 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and lysimeter measurements 3 1 1 meteorology meteorological data from 2005 to 2020 15 years from jinghe national meteorological station a few kilometers away from our experiment site are shown in fig 3 the yearly cycles of the average temperature and pan evaporation are plotted in fig 3a the average monthly rainfall and sunshine duration are displayed in fig 3b the hottest period of the year is between the beginning of july and the middle of august with a mean temperature of 27 7 c based on the statistics over the period 2005 2020 evaporation during summer represents 38 of the evaporation of the whole year fig 4 shows that summer temperatures in 2016 were higher than the long term average with a mean value of 29 3 c historically rainfall is concentrated in august fig 3b average monthly precipitation 87 mm with less sunshine during that month 192 h in 2016 the august was drier 50 mm precipitation and sunnier 290 h sun the period of august 11 until august 17 was the hottest period in 2016 the meteorological conditions of our experimental period are closely following the multi annual characteristics in summer our selected period is therefore representative for warm dry periods in summer with a high evaporative demand for the guanzhong basin fig 5 shows the time series and average diurnal cycles for the different meteorological variables in this period this figure illustrates the typical daily cycles with maximum values for wind speed air temperature and incoming radiation terms in the afternoon and minimal daily values of relative humidity and vapor pressure the average wind speed reaches a maximum in the afternoon in general wind speed is relatively low in the guanzhong basin air temperature is fluctuating between 26 and 39 c during this week with a mean value of 32 3 c relative humidity varies between 33 and 75 with a mean value of 53 vapor pressure varies between 2 and 2 8 kpa incoming radiation is the energy input for evaporation incoming short wave radiation varies between 3 and 900 w m2 and incoming longwave radiation is around 450 w m2 the maximum value of radiation occurred around 12 50 beijing time as it is the local midday time in summer 3 1 2 temperature profiles in the lysimeter columns fig 6 shows the half hourly vertical temperature variation for saturated fine sand ts and water tw on the basis of measurements at 3 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm depth ts and tw roughly follow a sine function fig 6 c related to the net radiation balance the variations of ts with depth show considerable differences in time the timing of the maximum and minimum values for ts and corresponding amplitudes at different depths are shown in table 3 the amplitude of ts is smaller with increasing depth this is related to the fact that incoming radiation cannot penetrate soil and heat the soil surface only the downward heat transport is delayed because of heat storage and the relatively slow heat conduction in soil these dynamics are highlighted in fig 6a the slope of ts along the vertical soil profile is indicated by the angle β it is a proxy for the temperature transmission time in the vertical direction slower transmission associated with larger angles on the other hand tw is quite uniform over depth the temporal evolution of the vertical gradient of tw indicates that the water column is well mixed the black line in fig 6 b the angle of the gradient along the vertical profile β is 0 this can be explained as follows 1 water has a bigger heat capacity than soil and daily temperature variations are more strongly buffered than in soil 2 short wave radiation can penetrate deeper in the water column thus directly heating a larger vertical column than for soil 3 moreover vertical mixing might be increased through wind which is not the case for the soil column 3 2 potential evaporation fig 7 shows the measured daily average temperatures and pe rates from august 1st to 26th the differences in pe between fine sand and water are more obvious during hot days august 11th 17th detailed analyses were made for these seven consecutive days 3 2 1 diurnal pe dynamics fig 8 shows the diurnal time series of pes and pew together with the average diurnal cycles the time series of pes and pew were different in terms of absolute values and temporal dynamics for pes 78 of the daily evaporation took place between sunrise and sunset 5 30 19 30 the remaining 22 evaporate after sunset on the other hand for the water lysimeter nighttime evaporation is 5 larger than daytime evaporation as fig 8c illustrates between 9 00 and 17 30 pes pew but during night time pes pew the peak value for pes was larger than for pew and the average daily sum of pes was 21 higher than for pew the peak value of pes was measured in the afternoon 14 00 16 00 while pew reached its maximum later in the evening 20 00 22 00 the minimum of pes occurred during the night while for pew it was around noon the peak value of pew is lagging 6 h behind the one for pes also pes and pew were lagging behind the diurnal cycles of meteorological variables me but for pew this lag was much larger than for pes linear correlation analysis was used to determine this specific lag time in order to assess the lag time a simple time shift was introduced and the linear correlation coefficients between pe and the meteorological variable were calculated tables 4 and 5 show that for time lag zero t 0 pes has a positive correlation with net radiation air temperature and wind speed negative correlations are observed with humidity and vapour pressure pew has a relatively strong positive correlation with wind speed while for other variables the correlation coefficients reach their maximum value for relatively large time lags of 4 6 h illustrating that pew lags behind the meteorological variables in summary the diurnal cycle of pew lagged almost 4 5 h behind the one for pes during summer this can be explained by energy balance considerations as discussed in the next section 3 3 energy fluxes 3 3 1 net radiation fig 9 shows the diurnal variation of the calculated flux terms for the saturated fine sand and water columns in equation 12 fig 9a shows the net radiation rn which is the energy input for the fine sand and water columns net radiation was slightly negative during nighttime and increased after sunrise 7 00 reaching a maximum around 13 00 water 720 w m2 saturated fine sand 540 w m2 and decreasing afterwards again turning into negative in the beginning of the evening around sunset the green curve fig 9a right represents the difference between rn w and rn s the value is positive during the daytime as the albedo of water is lower than for fine sand 3 3 2 heat flux storage gs for fine sand and nw for water represent the energy variation related to heat storage inside the column system fig 9b the curves of gs and nw have different shapes with nw having a much more pronounced daily amplitude both nw and gs are negative during the night and nw has more negative values than gs 250 w m2 resp 50 w m2 on average 340 w m2 resp 64 w m2 as minimum values the time series for gs and nw reach positive values during day time 8 00 17 30 the green time series in the right of fig 9b displays the diurnal cycle of the average difference between nw and gs during daytime the water column stores more heat than saturated bare soil the maximum difference is around 540 w m2 and releases more energy during the night this is related to the increased heat capacity of water compared to the soil 3 3 3 horizontal heat flux horizontal energy exchange between the lysimeter and the surroundings gh s or water gh w is important for energy closure the results are shown in fig 9c the two curves show a similar trend gh s is positive from 18 00 13 00 as heat is transferred from the surroundings into saturated fine sand reaching the maximum value 110 w m2 before dawn and is negative in the afternoon gh w is negative most of the time except from 2 30 10 00 as heat is transferred from the water column to the surroundings in general the lysimeter columns are absorbing heat during the night and releasing heat at day 3 3 4 sensible heat flux the sensible heat flux h represents the turbulent exchange of sensible heat at the interface of the land and the atmosphere results are shown in fig 9d hw is negative from 10 30 20 30 as heat is transferred from the overlying air into the water and positive from 21 30 10 00 as water is releasing sensible heat to the air the net sum of h is close to zero in general during the summer months hw is close to zero finch 2001 hs is negative most of the time except around noon in this experimental setup we have a so called oasis effect which occurs primarily in summer it is related to the fact that the lysimeter is always saturated and shows a strong evaporation whereas the surroundings have low soil moisture content net radiation is therefore mainly used for sensible heat flux hao et al 2016 the evaporation over the lysimeter is enhanced by the high air temperatures in the surrounding of the lysimeter so that the soil surface temperature is smaller than the measured air temperature ts ta 0 the oasis effect induces lateral transfer of sensible heat towards the lysimeter causing lower h and larger le than in normal situations therefore the sensible heat flux above the lysimeter is small and almost all available energy is used for evaporation and heat storage in sand and water columns during summer the absolute value of h above a well watered surface is significantly smaller than the latent heat flux a range of studies found that h can be negligible compared with net radiation or latent heat flux tanner and pelton 1960 katul and parlange 1992 finch 2001 gallego elvira et al 2011 3 3 5 latent heat flux for both lysimeters fig 10 shows the measured and calculated time series of latent heat for evaporation les and lew according to the energy balance method the penman monteith pm and priestly taylor pt equations based on half hourly data table 6 shows the daily average value of pe calculated by pm pt and the energy balance equations in order to compare the different approaches different evaluation statistics were calculated the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe between calculated and measured le for seven days and for the average diurnal cycles table 7 shows the evaluation statistics all three methods resulted in a relatively good estimation of pe the estimation of les corresponds better to the measurements than the estimation of lew with bigger r2 based on the different statistical measures the quality of the estimated values of le by the three different methods was similar with slightly better performance of the energy balance method for the soil columns lowest rmse and mae among methods while for the water column none of the methods clearly outperforms another method pm provides the best results in terms of rmse and mae but energy balance in terms of r2 and pt in terms of mbe 3 4 calculation of actual evaporation ea using numerical models fig 11 shows the results of the numerical simulations ea s is the actual evaporation rate calculated from measured pes ea w is the actual evaporation rate calculated from measured pew with their differences δea ea s ea w the relative difference between ea s and ea w calculated by hgs were highlighted as rd fig 11 b d 16 rd e a w e a s 1 100 differences over 17 can occur for the estimates of ea fig 11 fig 11 a c also illustrates that both ea s and ea w along with their differences δea approximate zero with the increase of the water table depth the depth where evaporation drops to zero can be slightly larger than the extinction depth because the imposed extinction depth has not been established jointly with the soil evaporation parameters for sandy soil the absolute value of relative differences were up to 17 5 fig 11 b for silty clay relative differences decreased with the increase of water table depth fig 11 d 4 discussion 4 1 experimental setup and data analysis the experimental setup developed in this study allows for a unique comparison between evaporation dynamics over an open water surface as well as saturated bare soil with a very high temporal resolution the employed markov bottle approach proved suitable in this experimental setup the size of the lysimeters was relatively large 1 0 m2 each and deep 0 7 m each to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a detailed study on the dynamics of potential evaporation has been carried for a warm temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate region a complication of the study was the horizontal heat exchange between the lysimeter and the surrounding soil insulating the lysimeters could reduce heat exchange with the surrounding soil but even with additional insulation horizontal heat exchange will not be zero we have considered this effect by estimating horizontal heat exchange using average values of the vertical temperatures in the lysimeters this is straightforward for the water column as vertically no relevant temperature differences were observed for soil it is more complicated our suggested depth weighted approach constitutes a simple calibration procedure by manually modifying φ in equation 9 to close the energy balance under consideration of horizontal heat exchange clearly this is a simplification of the underlying physics a more complete analysis however would require a spatially distributed numerical model of the energy fluxes which was beyond the scope of this paper the study focused on a relatively short time span but our selected period is representative for warm dry periods in summer with a high evaporative demand in addition to analyzing daily dynamics studying long term seasonal dynamics would certainly also be of interest but was also not the focus of this study in summary the chosen experimental setup and the subsequent treatment of the data were considered to be of sufficient accuracy for the subsequent analysis 4 2 potential evaporation over open water and saturated bare soil the comparison between the two lysimeters revealed differences in both the absolute value as well as the temporal dynamics for the analyzed period differences up to 21 between the two average pe rates were observed the diurnal cycle of pew lagged almost 4 5 h behind the one for pes during summer this can be explained by energy balance considerations these differences show the importance of the composition of the ground for estimating potential evaporation rates these two findings have a range of implications for example precision agriculture requires accurate temporal estimates of evaporation dynamics of the soil to estimate hourly irrigation rates the differences in the absolute values are important for all approaches which estimate actual evaporation based on potential evaporation the following physical properties differ between the saturated bare soil and water columns 1 the surface albedo 2 the thermal properties including the differences in heat capacity thermal conductance and the depth of energy adsorption in our case the albedo of the soil is larger than the albedo of water as shown in fig 9a resulting in a decreased amount of absorbed energy note that this does not necessarily mean that the latent heat flux for evaporation is smaller for soil because the re distribution of energy is also significantly affected by the physical properties of the underlying material our analysis identified significant differences in the soil heat flux related to vertical differences of temperature and the heat storage in the water fig 12 shows the temperature data used to calculate nw and gs g0 δs although the vertical temperature gradient is smaller for water than for soil nw is much larger than gs shown in fig 9b leaving less energy for evaporation which is caused by the differences in thermal properties the difference in vertical temperature gradients between the soil and water columns which influence gs and nw can be explained during the day for saturated fine sand net radiation can only heats a thin surface layer of the soil column and heat slowly diffuses downwards resulting in a relatively small value for the soil heat flux gs therefore a more important fraction of the net radiation is available for evaporation for water on the other hand gh w rn w is mainly used to heat water we found that gh w rn w nw gh s rn s gs so less energy is available for latent heat flux even though rn for the water column is higher than for the fine sand column during the night besides gh s both rn gs and nw are negative and nw is more negative than gs thus gh w rn w nw gh s rn s gs water releases energy stored during the daytime for evaporation so that water has a bigger evaporation rate than saturated fine sand at night 4 3 performance of approaches to estimate pe 4 3 1 energy balance method and priestly taylor equations given that the priestly taylor and the energy balance resulted in nearly identical diurnal curves the discussion of the energy balance likewise applies to the pt method the results calculated from the energy balance equation are discussed by introducing the energy balance ratio ebr le measured h g h r n g s or n w is equal to 1 if the energy budget is closed if ebr 1 calculated le is underestimated compared to lemeasured if ebr 1 calculated le is overestimated for water the energy balance cannot be closed satisfactorily lew is significantly underestimated from 13 00 15 30 ebr 1 and overestimated from 17 30 19 00 ebr 1 the imbalance from 13 00 15 30 can be explained with errors associated with the overestimation of heat storage nw these errors are related to the vertical temperature variations as can be seen in fig 6 some stratification took place however the vertical discretization to calculate changes in heat storage might have been too coarse to capture these variations adequatly the second imbalance occurred in the evening this might be related to the high wind speed and turbulence in the evening which leads to ripples in the water column potentially causing measurement errors arnon et al 2014 lensky et al 2018 for saturated fine sand the energy balance closure could be achieved during daytime however an imbalance existed between 8 00 11 00 ebr 1 and 19 30 23 00 ebr 1 the first imbalance occurred in the morning the calculation overestimates les there appears to be a certain time lag between available energy and the onset of evaporation the second imbalance occurred after sunset when les was underestimated this might be related to the relative importance of the soil heat flux at night already small biases of g0 will play a major role in the estimation of the latent heat flux at night the inability to close the energy balance during these periods can therefore be related to inaccuracies in estimating g0 an et al 2016 errors on gs includes ground heat flux g0 and heat storage δs are as suggested by foken 2008 probably the most important source of error affecting the energy balance in most conditions although during some periods the energy balance could not be closed for both open water and fine sand columns it did not significantly affect the reliability of this study balance closure is difficult to achieve and the improvement of theory and observation methods in the future should allow for reducing this error 4 3 2 penman monteith equation the application of the pm equation on the fine sand and water columns shows a satisfactory correlation with measured data on a daily time scale fig 13 shows the time series for calculated aerodynamic resistance ra the aerodynamic term for evaporation leaero equation 13 and parameter αpt based on the penman monteith equation αpt lepm leenergy the values of ra were inversely proportional to wind speed and leaero mahrt and ek 1984 choudhury et al 1986 viney 1991 yang et al 2001 liu et al 2007 its influence on the evaporation rate mainly depends on wind speed and the surface roughness during the research period wind speed was higher in the evenings resulting in smaller ra and higher leaero rates fig 13 a b c for both soil and water during the evening in the pt equation αpt 1 26 which impies that the leaero value is replaced with 0 26 αpt 1 times of leenergy as shown in fig 13 d instead of a fixed value actual αpt varies over a large range the contribution of leaero to total le was different for the soil and water columns for the saturated bare soil column the available energy term gh s rn s gs is bigger at day so that the aerodynamic resistance contribution to les is smaller at day and bigger in the evening on the other hand for the water column the energy term is smaller around noon resulting in a larger contribution of the aerodynamic term our results also suggest that the good performance of the three methods highly depends on accurate calculation of the energy balance terms especially also the total heat flux or heat storage 4 4 the effect of different pe on calculating ea using numerical models ea was calculated by hgs for both sandy soil and silty clay using measured pes and pew as input differences up to 17 5 of the resulting ea were observed given the dependency of pe on the surface properties we propose to calculate pe in hydrological modelling studies for different surface types instead of imposing one value of pe across the entire modelling domain the above mentioned results are especially important for large scale distributed hydrological models an alternative is to employ land surface models where water and energy balances are solved in a coupled fashion however in many hydrological modelling studies this is not feasible so that the pe choice becomes of high importance further research will provide a more solid assessment based on larger time series 5 conclusions potential evaporation was measured during august 2016 for saturated fine sand pes and water pew columns using lysimeters installed in the guanzhong basin china the experimental setup allowed for a very high temporal resolution of all measured quantities this study therefore goes beyond previous assessments of potential evaporation to the best of our knowledge it is also the first time these dynamics were studied in such detail for semi arid climates the measurement data were analyzed with the help of energy balance considerations and numerical calculations the following conclusions can be drawn the application of lysimeters as suggested in this study proved to be highly beneficial it allowed to achieve an unprecedented temporal resolution on the dynamics of potential evaporation diurnal dynamics of pes and pew are significantly different pes was higher than pew pew was lagging 4 5 h behind pes this has important implications for all applications where a high temporal resolution of evaporation estimates is required for example for precision agriculture all three methods employed to estimate pe performed well the penman monteith equation and the energy balance approach describe both the radiative and aerodynamic processes during day and night from a theoretical point of view it is based on a comprehensive description of the relevant processes nevertheless the priestly taylor approach performed approximately as good as the penman monteith approach in spite of the simplifications the energy balance approach performed slightly better than the other approaches for the sand column note that these findings are specific to the climate conditions tested the calculation of actual evaporation based on the potential evaporation is not surprisingly strongly influenced by the choice of calculating pe saturated bare soil or water we observed relative differences in actual evaporation up to 17 5 if evaporation is calculated at the regional scale with a hydrological model the estimation of pe has to carefully consider the

5201,pumping tests are routinely performed to characterize aquifers in particular recovery tests involve analyzing the residual drawdown after the termination of pumping evaluating the radius of investigation of pumping tests is important for test design and interpretation however the radius of investigation during the recovery phase has rarely been discussed in the literature here we derive exact semi analytical and approximate fully analytical solutions for the radius of investigation during the recovery phase and present a sensitivity analysis for typical parameter values during recovery the radius of investigation shows non monotonic behavior it first increases then decreases and eventually vanishes the maximum radius can be up to five times larger than that at the end of the pumping phase in the investigated range of parameter values however the conditions yielding a large radius of investigation are such that the time at which the maximum occurs is relatively large up to one hundred times the pumping duration depending on the parameters thus in practice one may need to find a compromise between the size of the investigated area and the time required for the test in addition to the aquifer parameters we observe that the pumping rate and duration and the apparent measurement resolution are key parameters controlling the radius of investigation during recovery finally the approach is applied to a field example this study provides fundamental insight on the radius of investigation of recovery tests as well as practical solutions thereby facilitating the design and interpretation of recovery tests in practice keywords radius of investigation recovery test buildup test pumping test aquifer test well test 1 introduction pumping tests i e aquifer tests or well tests in petroleum engineering are routinely conducted to gain conceptual understanding about aquifers and estimate their hydraulic parameters it is a popular method as it provides direct insight into aquifer properties at a relevant scale when performing a pumping test recording and analyzing the residual drawdown after the termination of pumping is commonly called a recovery test or buildup test in petroleum engineering in general the recovery phase is less impacted than the pumping phase by complicating factors such as uncontrolled pumping rate fluctuations and turbulent losses close to and inside the pumping well bourdet 2002 fetter 2001 kresic 2006 trabucchi et al 2018 consequently measurements obtained during recovery are typically less noisy and easier to interpret than during pumping especially at the pumping well hence recovery tests are generally preferred if no wells are available nearby for observation during a pumping test the radius of investigation provides information on the area of the aquifer tested as a function of time bourdet 2002 bresciani et al 2020 copty et al 2011 ferroud et al 2018 meier et al 1998 oliver 1990 renard 2006 as such estimating the radius of investigation is critical for the design and interpretation of pumping tests namely before conducting a test studying the expected evolution of the radius of investigation using a priori estimates of the hydraulic parameters allows for determining the minimum required duration of the test for covering an area of interest after conducting a test calculating the radius of investigation using final estimates of the hydraulic parameters allows for determining the area of the aquifer actually investigated note that in line with previous studies bourdet 2002 bresciani et al 2020 daungkaew et al 2000 oliver 1990 tabatabaie et al 2017 we make a clear distinction between the radius of investigation and the radius of influence of a pumping test or well the former informs on how far from the pumping well the aquifer properties can be informed by measurements obtained at the pumping well while the latter informs on how far from the pumping well the perturbation induced by pumping can be felt the radius of investigation is typically half of the radius of influence bresciani et al 2020 jones 1962 oliver 1990 also note that when using the concept of radius of investigation it is assumed that the investigated area is circular centered on the pumping well this property is only verified when the observation well is also the pumping well otherwise the investigated area is approximately an ellipse around the pumping and observation wells oliver 1993 this ellipse can be easily determined once the radius of investigation of the pumping well i e assuming it is also the observation well is known refer to oliver 1993 or bresciani et al 2020 for details the concept of radius of investigation is generally well understood during the pumping phase of a pumping test although its precise definition is not unambiguous bresciani et al 2020 the concept of radius of investigation during the recovery phase is more prone to confusion bourdet 2002 namely early studies identified the radius of investigation to the recovery front that is associated with the termination of pumping hurst et al 1961 ishteiwy and van poollen 1969 fig 1 thus these studies implied that the radius of investigation is equal to zero at the beginning of recovery thereby assuming that the residual drawdown only depends on the aquifer properties relatively close to the well this assumption is valid when a steady state is reached during the pumping phase however in practice this is rarely the case agarwal 1980 raghavan 1980 in contrast more recent studies stressed that during recovery the radius of investigation increases beyond the distance reached during the pumping phase daungkaew et al 2000 ewens and pooladi darvish 2009 the fundamental reason for this is illustrated in fig 1 after pumping is stopped the initial perturbation induced by pumping continues to diffuse into the aquifer new aquifer properties are thus explored and influence the residual drawdown at the well in return daungkaew et al 2000 and ewens and pooladi darvish 2009 also suggested that the increase of the radius of investigation during recovery is in practice limited by the presence of noise in the measurements yet they did not quantify the radius of investigation during recovery as a function of the apparent measurement resolution i e including noise stewart 2011 partially addressed this gap by presenting an expression for the maximum radius of investigation during recovery as a function of the apparent measurement resolution however the origin of the expression was not explained its conditions of validity were not discussed as will be shown below the expression is not exact and the typical magnitude of the maximum radius of investigation was not quantified for usual conditions furthermore to the best of our knowledge the temporal evolution of the radius of investigation during recovery has not been investigated accounting for measurement noise in this work we develop exact and approximate analytical solutions for the temporal evolution of the radius of investigation during recovery tests as a function of the apparent measurement resolution furthermore we present specific solutions for the maximum radius of investigation reached during recovery the time at which this maximum occurs and the time at which the radius of investigation vanishes i e the maximum time until which taking measurements is useful these quantities are the most informative in practice we then present a sensitivity analysis of the radius of investigation for a range of typical parameter values in particular we investigate the event that the radius of investigation may be significantly larger during recovery than during pumping finally we illustrate the theory using a field example the methods and findings of this study will help practitioners to design and interpret recovery tests 2 methods 2 1 definition of radius of investigation the radius of investigation of a pumping test can be qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from the pumping well up to which aquifer properties influence the drawdown at the well significantly bresciani et al 2020 a more precise definition is given below although this definition was originally introduced for constant pumping conditions i e to describe the pumping phase of a pumping test we propose that it is equally meaningful to describe the recovery phase of a pumping test the drawdown is the residual drawdown in that case the qualitative definition is such because it does not specify what significant influence precisely means leaving the door open to different interpretations we recently reviewed these interpretations for the pumping phase bresciani et al 2020 but key findings are also relevant for the recovery phase in particular we highlighted that there are two fundamentally different types of definition depending on whether the term significant influence is interpreted in an absolute sense i e referring to an absolute threshold e g 1 cm or in a relative sense i e referring to a relative threshold e g 1 absolute interpretations provide a suitable framework for determining the maximum distance up to which measurements contain information on aquifer properties considering a finite measurement resolution conversely relative interpretations are more appropriate for determining the area of the aquifer of which equivalent homogeneous aquifer parameters derived from curve fitting are representative indeed an influence on drawdown under 1 would translate into a negligible influence on the derived parameter values thus the choice between an absolute interpretation and a relative interpretation depends on the question asked here we focus on how far measurements contain information on aquifer properties considering a finite measurement resolution hence we adopt an absolute interpretation note that absolute interpretations imply that the radius of investigation depends on the pumping rate while relative interpretations imply that the radius of investigation is independent of the pumping rate bresciani et al 2020 following stewart 2011 we define the radius of investigation as the maximum distance from the pumping well at which the presence of an imaginary barrier assumed linear infinite and perfectly impervious would have an observable influence on drawdown at the well at a given time fig 2 the choice of a barrier as a particular form of heterogeneity that should have an observable influence on drawdown is somewhat arbitrary but relevant it may be interpreted either literally in which case the radius of investigation can assist in determining the presence of and distance to aquifer boundaries or as the limit case of a local heterogeneity in which case the radius of investigation provides an upper limit for the distance up to which variations in aquifer properties would have an effective influence on the measurements indeed any realistic type of heterogeneity would have a smaller influence than a barrier this choice is also convenient because it allows for relatively straightforward analytical developments as will be shown below nonetheless it must be acknowledged that there is no universal right choice thus one may adapt the definition to other types of heterogeneities ramakrishnan et al 2020 to be observable the influence of the imaginary barrier must be larger than the apparent resolution of the measurements which is defined as the gauge resolution plus the natural background noise kuchuk 2009 hence the apparent resolution is taken as an absolute threshold value to define what is significant i e observable accounting for noise in practice apparent resolutions are typically in the range 1 7 cm dragoni 1998 kuchuk 2009 interestingly kuchuk 2009 presented an example where the apparent resolution at the pumping well was approximately four times finer during recovery than during pumping in line with the above remarks section 1 note that if the drawdown derivative is analyzed bourdet et al 1989 ramos et al 2017 and not simply the drawdown our definition must in principle be adapted by replacing drawdown by drawdown derivative bresciani et al 2020 for simplicity we only focus on the analysis of the drawdown in this study 2 2 semi analytical solution let us consider a fully penetrating well in a homogeneous nonleaky confined aquifer of infinite extent pumping is operated at a constant rate for a finite duration after which it is stopped the hydraulic head is initially uniform flat and it is assumed to remain equal to its initial level at all times at infinite distance from the well under these conditions the solution for drawdown during pumping as a function of space and time is theis 1935 1 s r t q 4 π t e 1 s r 2 4 t t the symbols are defined in table 1 e 1 is defined by 2 e 1 x x e ξ ξ d ξ with x 0 where ξ is a dummy integration variable in particular at the well further accounting for potential skin effect van everdingen 1953 and quadratic head losses induced by turbulent flow inside and close to the well jacob 1947 3 s w t q 4 π t e 1 s r w 2 4 t t 2 f c q 2 the residual drawdown during recovery can be calculated using the superposition principle domenico and schwartz 1997 theis 1935 that is the residual drawdown can be obtained by summing the drawdown caused by a pumping well that is continuously active from the beginning of pumping and throughout the recovery phase and the buildup caused by a recharging well of the same strength and at the same location that is active from the time at which pumping is stopped the residual drawdown as a function of space and time is thus theis 1935 4 s r t q 4 π t e 1 s r 2 4 t t q 4 π t e 1 s r 2 4 t t t p with t t p in particular at the well note that there are no skin effect and nonlinear head losses during recovery since these are caused by the flow into the well which is close to zero during recovery 5 s w t q 4 π t e 1 s r w 2 4 t t q 4 π t e 1 s r w 2 4 t t t p we will also need the solution for residual drawdown in the presence of a barrier which can be easily obtained using the method of images domenico and schwartz 1997 horner 1951 that is a barrier located at distance r inv from the pumping well can be simulated by considering an imaginary mirror well located at distance 2 r inv from the real well orthogonally to the barrier having the same pumping scheme as the real well summing the contribution of the mirror well and that of the real well effectively realizes an impervious barrier midway between the two wells the solution for residual drawdown at the well during recovery in the presence of a barrier at distance r inv is thus 6 s wb t s w t q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 tt q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 t t t p where the last two terms represent the contribution of the mirror well the definition of radius of investigation section 2 1 translates into the equation 7 s wb t s w t s c where s c is the apparent resolution of the drawdown data using eq 6 we obtain 8 q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 tt q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 t t t p s c this equation can be solved for r inv which is the only unknown but not analytically note that the logarithmic approximation of e 1 e g cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 cannot be used here because r inv is expected to be relatively large implying that the argument of e 1 is typically beyond the range of validity of the logarithmic approximation bresciani et al 2020 dragoni 1998 a numerical procedure is thus needed making the approach semi analytical a simple python code relying on a root finding function from the scipy package jones et al 2001 was developed for this purpose this code was made available as part of the open source package wellradpy which provides solutions for both the radius of influence and the radius of investigation of pumping wells bresciani 2020 eq 8 is independent of the well radius skin effect and nonlinear head losses hence the radius of investigation is also independent of these parameters to permit a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the problem we introduce dimensionless variables t p and r p t t p s are considered as the reference time and distance respectively r p is thus equal to the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase when calculated based on the impulse response difference peak definition bresciani et al 2020 and q 4 π t is considered as the reference drawdown dimensionless variables are defined accordingly table 2 the dimensionless form of eq 8 is 9 e 1 r inv 2 t e 1 r inv 2 t 1 s c with t 1 thus r inv depends on two parameters t and s c note that the second term on the left hand side of eq 9 is equal to zero when t 1 this is evident from the fact that the start of the recovery phase coincides with the end of the pumping phase hence when t 1 this equation reduces to 10 e 1 r inv p 2 s c and it follows that 11 r inv p e 1 1 s c where e 1 1 is the inverse function of e 1 e 1 1 can only be found numerically but an approximate analytical expression was developed by bresciani et al 2020 12 e 1 1 s c 3 656 s c 0 1295 3 445 the errors on e 1 1 implied by this approximation are less than 2 3 for usual values of s c 0 0036 s c 0 63 2 3 fully analytical solution at large times at large times the duration of the pumping phase becomes small relative to the total time from the start of pumping thus we can derive an approximate solution for the residual drawdown at large times by assuming that the total volume of water withdrawn during the pumping phase v q t p is withdrawn instantaneously at t 0 the exact solution for the drawdown induced by an instantaneous pressure impulse corresponding to the withdrawal of a given volume of water in an unbounded aquifer is well known bear 1979 in terms of the dimensionless variables defined here this solution as a function of space and time is 13 s r t e r 2 4 t t in particular at the well neglecting potential skin effects and nonlinear head losses 14 s w t e r w 2 4 t t using the method of images we can also obtain an approximate expression for the residual drawdown at large times in the presence of a barrier if the barrier is located at distance r inv from the well the solution at the well is 15 s wb t s w t e r inv 2 t t the definition of radius of investigation eq 7 then yields 16 e r inv 2 t t s c a fully analytical solution for r inv at large times is thus obtained as 17 r inv t ln s c t the validity of this solution is investigated in section 3 2 4 solutions for the maximum radius of investigation during the recovery phase the radius of investigation increases for some time then decreases and eventually vanishes section 3 the magnitude of the maximum radius of investigation and the time at which it is attained are important characteristics of the recovery test in this section we derive solutions for these quantities a possible strategy to find the maximum radius of investigation would be to determine the zero of its time derivative however since our solution is only semi analytical section 2 2 this would require a procedure with several nested numerical steps therefore we propose a different strategy that only requires one numerical step as already explained the influence of a barrier on the drawdown at the pumping well can be simulated using an imaginary mirror well this contribution will go through a maximum with time because the mirror well as the real well is only active during the pumping phase if this maximum is smaller than the apparent resolution the barrier is too far to have any observable influence conversely if this maximum is larger than the apparent resolution the barrier could be farther and still have an observable influence thus a unique distance exists at which the barrier would have its maximum influence through time be equal to the apparent resolution this distance corresponds to the maximum radius of investigation during the recovery phase the latter can thus be obtained by first deriving an equation for the time at which the influence of a barrier on drawdown at the pumping well is maximum and then equating this maximum to the apparent resolution more details are given below first step the influence of a barrier located at distance r inv from the pumping well on the drawdown at the pumping well is given by the last two terms of eq 6 this influence reaches a maximum through time when its derivative with respect to time is zero the latter condition provides after basic manipulations a relationship between r inv m a x and t max 18 r inv m a x t max t max 1 ln t max t max 1 second step equating the maximum influence through time given by the last two terms of eq 6 evaluated in t max and r inv m a x to the apparent resolution and using the above relationship provides an equation for t max 19 e 1 t max 1 ln t max t max 1 e 1 t max ln t max t max 1 s c this equation can be solved numerically using a root finding algorithm a solution is implemented in the wellradpy package bresciani 2020 after finding t max r inv m a x can be calculated from the previous expression note that r inv m a x and t max only depend on one parameter s c a fully analytical though approximate solution can also be derived using the approach developed in section 2 3 this approach is reasonable if the maximum radius of investigation is attained at a relatively large time which is indeed often the case as seen in section 3 with this approach the zero of the derivative of the radius of investigation with respect to time can be found analytically from eq 17 a fully analytical solution for t max is thus obtained 20 t max 1 e s c then by evaluating eq 17 at t max a fully analytical solution for r inv m a x is obtained 21 r inv m a x 1 e s c eqs 20 and 21 are equivalent to expressions presented without derivation by stewart 2011 eqs 3 19 and 3 20 therein 2 5 solutions for the termination time of the test the time at which the radius of investigation becomes zero informs on the maximum time until which it is useful to take measurements this time can thus be considered as the termination time of the test it can be obtained by solving eq 9 with r inv 0 however this poses a practical difficulty because the two terms on the left hand side of eq 9 tend to and respectively when r inv tends to 0 we overcome this difficulty by taking a small value of r inv e g r inv 10 10 although this value is arbitrary we verified that taking a smaller value does not affect the results significantly thus we determine t end by solving the equation 22 e 1 10 10 t end e 1 10 10 t end 1 s c which can be solved numerically using a root finding algorithm a solution is implemented in the wellradpy package bresciani 2020 a fully analytical solution can also be derived using the approach developed in section 2 3 this approach is reasonable if t end is relatively large which is often the case as seen in section 3 under this assumption t end is obtained by solving eq 17 with r inv 0 yielding 23 t end 1 s c 3 results 3 1 insights from an example before conducting a systematic analysis of the influence of the parameters we offer some physical insights to explain why the radius of investigation defined according to section 2 1 continues to increase for some time after pumping is stopped fig 3 shows an example of contribution of an imaginary barrier to the drawdown at the pumping well during both the pumping and recovery phases in this example the distance between the pumping well and barrier is such that the signal induced by the barrier has not effectively reached the pumping well during the pumping phase i e its contribution to the drawdown remains smaller than the apparent resolution however this signal continues to propagate during recovery and at some time becomes observable at the pumping well this shows that the radius of investigation is larger during recovery than during pumping at least over some time 3 2 evolution of the radius of investigation during recovery fig 4 a shows r inv as a function of t for several values of s c these results were obtained by solving eq 9 the range of values used for s c 0 0036 s c 0 63 was derived from typical values for the ratio q t 1 q t 35 m and s c 1 s c 5 cm dragoni 1998 thus it includes typical cases met in practice note that throughout this work time is counted from the start of pumping hence recovery starts at t 1 and the figure focuses on t 1 the results show that r inv increases to a peak value then decreases and eventually vanishes the timing and magnitude of the peak as well as the termination time of the test strongly depend on s c smaller values of s c imply a later peak a larger peak magnitude and a larger termination time of the test to understand this result note that smaller values of s c are related to higher pumping rate smaller transmissivity or smaller apparent resolution the first two factors lead to a more pronounced cone of depression so that the imaginary barrier can be located further away and still have the same influence on the drawdown the last factor implies a higher sensitivity to differences in drawdown and thus a better ability to inform on distant variations of aquifer properties the approximate solution for r inv eq 17 is also shown in fig 4a the results reveal an overall good performance of the approximate solution even at early times which is somewhat surprising given that the solution was derived by assuming large times the approximation is more accurate at larger times as expected as smaller values of s c imply a later peak and a larger termination time of the test the results show that the peak magnitude the time at which it occurs and the termination time of the test are all better predicted by the approximate solution for smaller values of s c we now analyze the ratio of the radius of investigation during the recovery phase to the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase 24 r inv r inv r inv p r inv r inv p this ratio informs on how much farther we can see into the aquifer during the recovery phase in comparison with the pumping phase we refer to this ratio as the investigation ratio of the recovery test r inv is of the same order of magnitude as r inv because the latter is equal to r inv r p where r p is equal to the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase when it is defined according to the impulse response difference peak definition bresciani et al 2020 however as r inv relies on consistent definitions of the radius of investigation for both phases it enables an accurate comparison between the recovery and pumping phases namely r inv 1 at t 1 fig 4b shows r inv as a function of t for several values of s c similarly to r inv r inv first increases to a peak value then decreases and eventually vanishes we also see that smaller values of s c imply a later peak a larger peak magnitude and a larger termination time of the test r inv can be also be obtained using the approximate solution for r inv derived in section 2 3 eq 17 and the exact solution for r inv p derived in section 2 2 eq 11 we obtain 25 r inv t ln s c t e 1 1 s c this solution is not fully analytical owing to the presence of e 1 1 however a fully analytical solution can be formulated using the analytical approximation of e 1 1 given in eq 12 the resulting solution i e using eq 12 is also plotted in fig 4b the results show that this approximation is overall satisfactory and that it is especially good at large times the reason is the same as for the approximate solution of r inv discussed above 3 3 maximum radius of investigation r inv m a x and t max are plotted as a function of s c in fig 5 a and b respectively the results show that both quantities decrease with increasing s c consistently with previous observations they are more sensitive to s c when the latter is smaller especially when s c 0 1 the approximate solutions for r inv m a x eq 21 and t max eq 20 and the corresponding approximation errors are shown in fig 5a and b respectively the error on r inv m a x increases with s c but remains small 6 for all tested values of s c the error on t max is significantly larger but may be deemed acceptable when s c is small e g 10 when s c 0 08 the maximum investigation ratio of the recovery test r inv m a x can be found using r inv m a x in place of r inv in eq 24 26 r inv m a x r inv m a x r inv p r inv m a x r inv p r inv m a x shows similar trends as r inv m a x when varying s c although it is slightly less sensitive than r inv m a x to s c fig 5c an approximate expression for r inv m a x can also be obtained by evaluating eq 25 for t t max with t max obtained from eq 20 yielding 27 r inv m a x 1 e s c e 1 1 s c this approximation is fully analytical when the function e 1 1 is evaluated with eq 12 the resulting approximation using eq 12 and the implied errors are plotted in fig 5c the error is small 7 for all tested values of s c 3 4 termination time of the test t end is shown as a function of s c in fig 5d the results show that t end decreases with increasing s c similarly to t max although with a slightly higher sensitivity the approximate solution for t end eq 23 is also plotted in fig 5d as well as the approximation errors the error behaves similarly to but is smaller than the error implied by the approximate solution for t max compare with fig 5b the error may be deemed acceptable when s c is small e g 10 when s c 0 21 4 discussion 4 1 maximum radius of investigation the results show that the radius of investigation can be up to five times larger during recovery than at the end of the pumping phase for the range of tested parameter values fig 5c this is significant and confirms previous studies that demonstrated that we can see farther into the aquifer in the recovery phase than in the pumping phase daungkaew et al 2000 ewens and pooladi darvish 2009 moreover the apparent resolution was assumed to be identical in both phases however in practice the apparent resolution is typically smaller i e the data are less noisy during recovery than during pumping bourdet 2002 fetter 2001 kresic 2006 kuchuk 2009 hence the propensity of the radius of investigation to be larger during recovery than at the end of the pumping phase may be underestimated in this study another important result is that the maximum radius of investigation may sometimes only be reached after a relatively long time up to approximately one hundred times the pumping duration for the range of tested parameter values fig 5b in all cases when s c is smaller r inv m a x and t max are larger thus in practice the maximum radius of investigation may be missed if the data are not recorded for a long enough time nonetheless even if the peak cannot be reached a substantial increase of the radius of investigation may still occur within a reasonable time frame 4 2 controlling factors the controlling factors of the radius of investigation during recovery are probably best highlighted through the dimensional versions of the approximate expressions derived in this study these are 28 r inv tt s ln 4 π t s c t q t p 29 r inv m a x 1 2 q t p π s s c e 30 t max q t p 4 π t s c e 31 t end q t p 4 π t s c 32 r inv t ln 4 π t s c t q t p t p 3 656 4 π t s c q 0 1295 3 445 33 r inv m a x 1 4 π t s c e q 3 656 4 π t s c q 0 1295 3 445 eq 28 highlights an important difference between the radii of investigation during pumping and recovery namely while the radius of investigation is proportional to tt during pumping regardless of the precise definition adopted bresciani et al 2020 it is a non monotonic function of tt during recovery first increasing and then decreasing in contrast the radius of investigation is proportional to 1 s in both phases all of the above quantities increase with the increasing pumping rate and with the decreasing apparent resolution demonstrating the importance of these two parameters in determining the ability to explore a large area during a recovery test the pumping duration has an equivalent role and thus importance as the pumping rate for all quantities except the maximum investigation ratio for which it has no influence the latter outcome indicates that the pumping duration has a proportional influence on the maximum radius of investigation and the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase transmissivity also has an important influence on most of the derived quantities nonetheless a somewhat surprising result is that the maximum radius of investigation appears to be independent of transmissivity eq 29 this is partly a consequence of the approximation made to derive these expressions the exact maximum radius of investigation shows some dependence to transmissivity even though it is small for common values of s c and especially for small values the time at which the maximum occurs the termination time of the test and the maximum investigation ratio all decrease with the increasing transmissivity eqs 30 31 and 33 while they do not depend on storativity in contrast the radius of investigation and its maximum value both decrease with the increasing storativity eqs 28 and 29 4 3 relevance and limitations of the presented solutions the solutions derived in this study allow for a rapid assessment of the radius of investigation and its controlling factors during recovery this is useful during both the design and the interpretation of recovery tests as explained in the introduction in particular knowing the time at which the maximum radius of investigation is attained may be useful to decide when to stop the test indeed it may be deemed sufficient to pursue the test only until the maximum radius of investigation is reached in any case it would be meaningless to pursue the test beyond t end note that the calculations may in principle be updated in real time during the test using continuously updated parameters values i e assuming real time interpretation of the data further we suggest that the maximum radius of investigation reached during the test evaluated using the final parameter estimates constitutes important information that could be reported along with the results of the test note that this value may be smaller than the theoretical maximum radius of investigation if the test is aborted before t max the solutions derived in this study are based on the theis solution which has well known limitations due to the simplifying assumptions on which it relies these include aquifer homogeneity full well penetration and the absence of leakage through aquifer top and bottom and wellbore storage despite the ubiquitous heterogeneity of aquifers the assumption of aquifer homogeneity is not deemed critical indeed heterogeneity mostly affects the drawdown at the beginning of pumping and recovery phases when it essentially depends on local properties near the well later into these phases heterogeneity is typically well sampled by the perturbation so that an equivalent homogeneous model often provides a reasonable approximation of the drawdown response copty and findikakis 2004 meier et al 1998 neuman et al 2007 sánchez vila et al 1999 zech et al 2016 as the radius of investigation at the beginning of each phase only has a limited practical interest an equivalent homogeneous model will often be suitable similarly the effects of wellbore storage are only significant during a short period of time after pumping starts or stops agarwal et al 1970 papadopulos and cooper 1967 van everdingen and hurst 1949 hence these effects should not be a concern for typical uses of the radius of investigation the assumptions of full well penetration and absence of leakage are likely more critical when they are not satisfied the solutions derived in this work should be extended to include these effects this may be done using available solutions hantush 1964 5 field example we illustrate the theory using a long duration pumping test conducted in the cuise sands aquifer which is a confined aquifer located in the paris basin france klinka 2017 the drawdown was only measured at the pumping well as no other well was available nearby the drawdown data are shown in fig 6 a together with the modeled drawdown calculated with eqs 3 and 5 for the pumping and recovery phases respectively relevant parameters are listed in table 3 the model well reproduces the measurements in both phases the high frequency of the measurements 30 s time step throughout the pumping test allowed us to determining the apparent resolution fig 6b the apparent resolution is slightly finer in the recovery phase s c 3 2 cm than in the pumping phase s c 3 5 cm the radius of investigation was estimated during both pumping and recovery phases using these values fig 6a the results indicate r inv 449 m at the end of the pumping phase and r inv 464 m at the beginning of the recovery phase the discontinuity is a consequence of the differences in s c between the two phases the maximum radius of investigation obtained at t max 39 8 h is r inv m a x 544 m this is 21 larger than the radius of investigation reached at the end of pumping t end 81 h which is 15 h before the last measurement was acquired thus the duration of the data acquisition was close to optimal since most of the recorded signal is meaningful i e larger than noise 6 conclusions we derived exact semi analytical as well as approximate fully analytical solutions for the radius of investigation during recovery and related key quantities maximum radius of investigation the time at which it occurs and the termination time of the test as a function of the apparent resolution and other relevant parameters all these solutions are new except for the approximate solutions for the maximum radius of investigation and the time at which it occurs which were already shown by stewart 2011 though without derivation the semi analytical solutions require simple numerical procedures which were implemented in the open source wellradpy package written in python bresciani 2020 evaluating the fully analytical solutions is straightforward and these solutions imply relatively small errors in many cases all these solutions will facilitate the design and interpretation of recovery tests in practice during recovery the radius of investigation shows a non monotonic behavior it first increases for some time then decreases and eventually vanishes the radius of investigation can be up to five times larger during recovery than at the end of the pumping phase for the range of tested parameter values however relatively large radii of investigation are associated with relatively large times as the time at which the maximum occurs can be up to one hundred times the pumping duration thus in practice one may need to find a compromise between the size of the investigated area and the time required for the test our analysis also highlights that in addition to aquifer parameters the pumping rate pumping duration and apparent measurements resolution are key parameters controlling the radius of investigation during recovery finally the theoretical approach was illustrated by a field example in this example the maximum radius of investigation was found to be 544 m which is 21 larger than at the end of the pumping phase we also found that the duration of the data acquisition was close to optimal i e most of the recorded signal is larger than noise credit authorship contribution

5201,pumping tests are routinely performed to characterize aquifers in particular recovery tests involve analyzing the residual drawdown after the termination of pumping evaluating the radius of investigation of pumping tests is important for test design and interpretation however the radius of investigation during the recovery phase has rarely been discussed in the literature here we derive exact semi analytical and approximate fully analytical solutions for the radius of investigation during the recovery phase and present a sensitivity analysis for typical parameter values during recovery the radius of investigation shows non monotonic behavior it first increases then decreases and eventually vanishes the maximum radius can be up to five times larger than that at the end of the pumping phase in the investigated range of parameter values however the conditions yielding a large radius of investigation are such that the time at which the maximum occurs is relatively large up to one hundred times the pumping duration depending on the parameters thus in practice one may need to find a compromise between the size of the investigated area and the time required for the test in addition to the aquifer parameters we observe that the pumping rate and duration and the apparent measurement resolution are key parameters controlling the radius of investigation during recovery finally the approach is applied to a field example this study provides fundamental insight on the radius of investigation of recovery tests as well as practical solutions thereby facilitating the design and interpretation of recovery tests in practice keywords radius of investigation recovery test buildup test pumping test aquifer test well test 1 introduction pumping tests i e aquifer tests or well tests in petroleum engineering are routinely conducted to gain conceptual understanding about aquifers and estimate their hydraulic parameters it is a popular method as it provides direct insight into aquifer properties at a relevant scale when performing a pumping test recording and analyzing the residual drawdown after the termination of pumping is commonly called a recovery test or buildup test in petroleum engineering in general the recovery phase is less impacted than the pumping phase by complicating factors such as uncontrolled pumping rate fluctuations and turbulent losses close to and inside the pumping well bourdet 2002 fetter 2001 kresic 2006 trabucchi et al 2018 consequently measurements obtained during recovery are typically less noisy and easier to interpret than during pumping especially at the pumping well hence recovery tests are generally preferred if no wells are available nearby for observation during a pumping test the radius of investigation provides information on the area of the aquifer tested as a function of time bourdet 2002 bresciani et al 2020 copty et al 2011 ferroud et al 2018 meier et al 1998 oliver 1990 renard 2006 as such estimating the radius of investigation is critical for the design and interpretation of pumping tests namely before conducting a test studying the expected evolution of the radius of investigation using a priori estimates of the hydraulic parameters allows for determining the minimum required duration of the test for covering an area of interest after conducting a test calculating the radius of investigation using final estimates of the hydraulic parameters allows for determining the area of the aquifer actually investigated note that in line with previous studies bourdet 2002 bresciani et al 2020 daungkaew et al 2000 oliver 1990 tabatabaie et al 2017 we make a clear distinction between the radius of investigation and the radius of influence of a pumping test or well the former informs on how far from the pumping well the aquifer properties can be informed by measurements obtained at the pumping well while the latter informs on how far from the pumping well the perturbation induced by pumping can be felt the radius of investigation is typically half of the radius of influence bresciani et al 2020 jones 1962 oliver 1990 also note that when using the concept of radius of investigation it is assumed that the investigated area is circular centered on the pumping well this property is only verified when the observation well is also the pumping well otherwise the investigated area is approximately an ellipse around the pumping and observation wells oliver 1993 this ellipse can be easily determined once the radius of investigation of the pumping well i e assuming it is also the observation well is known refer to oliver 1993 or bresciani et al 2020 for details the concept of radius of investigation is generally well understood during the pumping phase of a pumping test although its precise definition is not unambiguous bresciani et al 2020 the concept of radius of investigation during the recovery phase is more prone to confusion bourdet 2002 namely early studies identified the radius of investigation to the recovery front that is associated with the termination of pumping hurst et al 1961 ishteiwy and van poollen 1969 fig 1 thus these studies implied that the radius of investigation is equal to zero at the beginning of recovery thereby assuming that the residual drawdown only depends on the aquifer properties relatively close to the well this assumption is valid when a steady state is reached during the pumping phase however in practice this is rarely the case agarwal 1980 raghavan 1980 in contrast more recent studies stressed that during recovery the radius of investigation increases beyond the distance reached during the pumping phase daungkaew et al 2000 ewens and pooladi darvish 2009 the fundamental reason for this is illustrated in fig 1 after pumping is stopped the initial perturbation induced by pumping continues to diffuse into the aquifer new aquifer properties are thus explored and influence the residual drawdown at the well in return daungkaew et al 2000 and ewens and pooladi darvish 2009 also suggested that the increase of the radius of investigation during recovery is in practice limited by the presence of noise in the measurements yet they did not quantify the radius of investigation during recovery as a function of the apparent measurement resolution i e including noise stewart 2011 partially addressed this gap by presenting an expression for the maximum radius of investigation during recovery as a function of the apparent measurement resolution however the origin of the expression was not explained its conditions of validity were not discussed as will be shown below the expression is not exact and the typical magnitude of the maximum radius of investigation was not quantified for usual conditions furthermore to the best of our knowledge the temporal evolution of the radius of investigation during recovery has not been investigated accounting for measurement noise in this work we develop exact and approximate analytical solutions for the temporal evolution of the radius of investigation during recovery tests as a function of the apparent measurement resolution furthermore we present specific solutions for the maximum radius of investigation reached during recovery the time at which this maximum occurs and the time at which the radius of investigation vanishes i e the maximum time until which taking measurements is useful these quantities are the most informative in practice we then present a sensitivity analysis of the radius of investigation for a range of typical parameter values in particular we investigate the event that the radius of investigation may be significantly larger during recovery than during pumping finally we illustrate the theory using a field example the methods and findings of this study will help practitioners to design and interpret recovery tests 2 methods 2 1 definition of radius of investigation the radius of investigation of a pumping test can be qualitatively defined as the maximum distance from the pumping well up to which aquifer properties influence the drawdown at the well significantly bresciani et al 2020 a more precise definition is given below although this definition was originally introduced for constant pumping conditions i e to describe the pumping phase of a pumping test we propose that it is equally meaningful to describe the recovery phase of a pumping test the drawdown is the residual drawdown in that case the qualitative definition is such because it does not specify what significant influence precisely means leaving the door open to different interpretations we recently reviewed these interpretations for the pumping phase bresciani et al 2020 but key findings are also relevant for the recovery phase in particular we highlighted that there are two fundamentally different types of definition depending on whether the term significant influence is interpreted in an absolute sense i e referring to an absolute threshold e g 1 cm or in a relative sense i e referring to a relative threshold e g 1 absolute interpretations provide a suitable framework for determining the maximum distance up to which measurements contain information on aquifer properties considering a finite measurement resolution conversely relative interpretations are more appropriate for determining the area of the aquifer of which equivalent homogeneous aquifer parameters derived from curve fitting are representative indeed an influence on drawdown under 1 would translate into a negligible influence on the derived parameter values thus the choice between an absolute interpretation and a relative interpretation depends on the question asked here we focus on how far measurements contain information on aquifer properties considering a finite measurement resolution hence we adopt an absolute interpretation note that absolute interpretations imply that the radius of investigation depends on the pumping rate while relative interpretations imply that the radius of investigation is independent of the pumping rate bresciani et al 2020 following stewart 2011 we define the radius of investigation as the maximum distance from the pumping well at which the presence of an imaginary barrier assumed linear infinite and perfectly impervious would have an observable influence on drawdown at the well at a given time fig 2 the choice of a barrier as a particular form of heterogeneity that should have an observable influence on drawdown is somewhat arbitrary but relevant it may be interpreted either literally in which case the radius of investigation can assist in determining the presence of and distance to aquifer boundaries or as the limit case of a local heterogeneity in which case the radius of investigation provides an upper limit for the distance up to which variations in aquifer properties would have an effective influence on the measurements indeed any realistic type of heterogeneity would have a smaller influence than a barrier this choice is also convenient because it allows for relatively straightforward analytical developments as will be shown below nonetheless it must be acknowledged that there is no universal right choice thus one may adapt the definition to other types of heterogeneities ramakrishnan et al 2020 to be observable the influence of the imaginary barrier must be larger than the apparent resolution of the measurements which is defined as the gauge resolution plus the natural background noise kuchuk 2009 hence the apparent resolution is taken as an absolute threshold value to define what is significant i e observable accounting for noise in practice apparent resolutions are typically in the range 1 7 cm dragoni 1998 kuchuk 2009 interestingly kuchuk 2009 presented an example where the apparent resolution at the pumping well was approximately four times finer during recovery than during pumping in line with the above remarks section 1 note that if the drawdown derivative is analyzed bourdet et al 1989 ramos et al 2017 and not simply the drawdown our definition must in principle be adapted by replacing drawdown by drawdown derivative bresciani et al 2020 for simplicity we only focus on the analysis of the drawdown in this study 2 2 semi analytical solution let us consider a fully penetrating well in a homogeneous nonleaky confined aquifer of infinite extent pumping is operated at a constant rate for a finite duration after which it is stopped the hydraulic head is initially uniform flat and it is assumed to remain equal to its initial level at all times at infinite distance from the well under these conditions the solution for drawdown during pumping as a function of space and time is theis 1935 1 s r t q 4 π t e 1 s r 2 4 t t the symbols are defined in table 1 e 1 is defined by 2 e 1 x x e ξ ξ d ξ with x 0 where ξ is a dummy integration variable in particular at the well further accounting for potential skin effect van everdingen 1953 and quadratic head losses induced by turbulent flow inside and close to the well jacob 1947 3 s w t q 4 π t e 1 s r w 2 4 t t 2 f c q 2 the residual drawdown during recovery can be calculated using the superposition principle domenico and schwartz 1997 theis 1935 that is the residual drawdown can be obtained by summing the drawdown caused by a pumping well that is continuously active from the beginning of pumping and throughout the recovery phase and the buildup caused by a recharging well of the same strength and at the same location that is active from the time at which pumping is stopped the residual drawdown as a function of space and time is thus theis 1935 4 s r t q 4 π t e 1 s r 2 4 t t q 4 π t e 1 s r 2 4 t t t p with t t p in particular at the well note that there are no skin effect and nonlinear head losses during recovery since these are caused by the flow into the well which is close to zero during recovery 5 s w t q 4 π t e 1 s r w 2 4 t t q 4 π t e 1 s r w 2 4 t t t p we will also need the solution for residual drawdown in the presence of a barrier which can be easily obtained using the method of images domenico and schwartz 1997 horner 1951 that is a barrier located at distance r inv from the pumping well can be simulated by considering an imaginary mirror well located at distance 2 r inv from the real well orthogonally to the barrier having the same pumping scheme as the real well summing the contribution of the mirror well and that of the real well effectively realizes an impervious barrier midway between the two wells the solution for residual drawdown at the well during recovery in the presence of a barrier at distance r inv is thus 6 s wb t s w t q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 tt q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 t t t p where the last two terms represent the contribution of the mirror well the definition of radius of investigation section 2 1 translates into the equation 7 s wb t s w t s c where s c is the apparent resolution of the drawdown data using eq 6 we obtain 8 q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 tt q 4 π t e 1 s r inv 2 t t t p s c this equation can be solved for r inv which is the only unknown but not analytically note that the logarithmic approximation of e 1 e g cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 cannot be used here because r inv is expected to be relatively large implying that the argument of e 1 is typically beyond the range of validity of the logarithmic approximation bresciani et al 2020 dragoni 1998 a numerical procedure is thus needed making the approach semi analytical a simple python code relying on a root finding function from the scipy package jones et al 2001 was developed for this purpose this code was made available as part of the open source package wellradpy which provides solutions for both the radius of influence and the radius of investigation of pumping wells bresciani 2020 eq 8 is independent of the well radius skin effect and nonlinear head losses hence the radius of investigation is also independent of these parameters to permit a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the problem we introduce dimensionless variables t p and r p t t p s are considered as the reference time and distance respectively r p is thus equal to the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase when calculated based on the impulse response difference peak definition bresciani et al 2020 and q 4 π t is considered as the reference drawdown dimensionless variables are defined accordingly table 2 the dimensionless form of eq 8 is 9 e 1 r inv 2 t e 1 r inv 2 t 1 s c with t 1 thus r inv depends on two parameters t and s c note that the second term on the left hand side of eq 9 is equal to zero when t 1 this is evident from the fact that the start of the recovery phase coincides with the end of the pumping phase hence when t 1 this equation reduces to 10 e 1 r inv p 2 s c and it follows that 11 r inv p e 1 1 s c where e 1 1 is the inverse function of e 1 e 1 1 can only be found numerically but an approximate analytical expression was developed by bresciani et al 2020 12 e 1 1 s c 3 656 s c 0 1295 3 445 the errors on e 1 1 implied by this approximation are less than 2 3 for usual values of s c 0 0036 s c 0 63 2 3 fully analytical solution at large times at large times the duration of the pumping phase becomes small relative to the total time from the start of pumping thus we can derive an approximate solution for the residual drawdown at large times by assuming that the total volume of water withdrawn during the pumping phase v q t p is withdrawn instantaneously at t 0 the exact solution for the drawdown induced by an instantaneous pressure impulse corresponding to the withdrawal of a given volume of water in an unbounded aquifer is well known bear 1979 in terms of the dimensionless variables defined here this solution as a function of space and time is 13 s r t e r 2 4 t t in particular at the well neglecting potential skin effects and nonlinear head losses 14 s w t e r w 2 4 t t using the method of images we can also obtain an approximate expression for the residual drawdown at large times in the presence of a barrier if the barrier is located at distance r inv from the well the solution at the well is 15 s wb t s w t e r inv 2 t t the definition of radius of investigation eq 7 then yields 16 e r inv 2 t t s c a fully analytical solution for r inv at large times is thus obtained as 17 r inv t ln s c t the validity of this solution is investigated in section 3 2 4 solutions for the maximum radius of investigation during the recovery phase the radius of investigation increases for some time then decreases and eventually vanishes section 3 the magnitude of the maximum radius of investigation and the time at which it is attained are important characteristics of the recovery test in this section we derive solutions for these quantities a possible strategy to find the maximum radius of investigation would be to determine the zero of its time derivative however since our solution is only semi analytical section 2 2 this would require a procedure with several nested numerical steps therefore we propose a different strategy that only requires one numerical step as already explained the influence of a barrier on the drawdown at the pumping well can be simulated using an imaginary mirror well this contribution will go through a maximum with time because the mirror well as the real well is only active during the pumping phase if this maximum is smaller than the apparent resolution the barrier is too far to have any observable influence conversely if this maximum is larger than the apparent resolution the barrier could be farther and still have an observable influence thus a unique distance exists at which the barrier would have its maximum influence through time be equal to the apparent resolution this distance corresponds to the maximum radius of investigation during the recovery phase the latter can thus be obtained by first deriving an equation for the time at which the influence of a barrier on drawdown at the pumping well is maximum and then equating this maximum to the apparent resolution more details are given below first step the influence of a barrier located at distance r inv from the pumping well on the drawdown at the pumping well is given by the last two terms of eq 6 this influence reaches a maximum through time when its derivative with respect to time is zero the latter condition provides after basic manipulations a relationship between r inv m a x and t max 18 r inv m a x t max t max 1 ln t max t max 1 second step equating the maximum influence through time given by the last two terms of eq 6 evaluated in t max and r inv m a x to the apparent resolution and using the above relationship provides an equation for t max 19 e 1 t max 1 ln t max t max 1 e 1 t max ln t max t max 1 s c this equation can be solved numerically using a root finding algorithm a solution is implemented in the wellradpy package bresciani 2020 after finding t max r inv m a x can be calculated from the previous expression note that r inv m a x and t max only depend on one parameter s c a fully analytical though approximate solution can also be derived using the approach developed in section 2 3 this approach is reasonable if the maximum radius of investigation is attained at a relatively large time which is indeed often the case as seen in section 3 with this approach the zero of the derivative of the radius of investigation with respect to time can be found analytically from eq 17 a fully analytical solution for t max is thus obtained 20 t max 1 e s c then by evaluating eq 17 at t max a fully analytical solution for r inv m a x is obtained 21 r inv m a x 1 e s c eqs 20 and 21 are equivalent to expressions presented without derivation by stewart 2011 eqs 3 19 and 3 20 therein 2 5 solutions for the termination time of the test the time at which the radius of investigation becomes zero informs on the maximum time until which it is useful to take measurements this time can thus be considered as the termination time of the test it can be obtained by solving eq 9 with r inv 0 however this poses a practical difficulty because the two terms on the left hand side of eq 9 tend to and respectively when r inv tends to 0 we overcome this difficulty by taking a small value of r inv e g r inv 10 10 although this value is arbitrary we verified that taking a smaller value does not affect the results significantly thus we determine t end by solving the equation 22 e 1 10 10 t end e 1 10 10 t end 1 s c which can be solved numerically using a root finding algorithm a solution is implemented in the wellradpy package bresciani 2020 a fully analytical solution can also be derived using the approach developed in section 2 3 this approach is reasonable if t end is relatively large which is often the case as seen in section 3 under this assumption t end is obtained by solving eq 17 with r inv 0 yielding 23 t end 1 s c 3 results 3 1 insights from an example before conducting a systematic analysis of the influence of the parameters we offer some physical insights to explain why the radius of investigation defined according to section 2 1 continues to increase for some time after pumping is stopped fig 3 shows an example of contribution of an imaginary barrier to the drawdown at the pumping well during both the pumping and recovery phases in this example the distance between the pumping well and barrier is such that the signal induced by the barrier has not effectively reached the pumping well during the pumping phase i e its contribution to the drawdown remains smaller than the apparent resolution however this signal continues to propagate during recovery and at some time becomes observable at the pumping well this shows that the radius of investigation is larger during recovery than during pumping at least over some time 3 2 evolution of the radius of investigation during recovery fig 4 a shows r inv as a function of t for several values of s c these results were obtained by solving eq 9 the range of values used for s c 0 0036 s c 0 63 was derived from typical values for the ratio q t 1 q t 35 m and s c 1 s c 5 cm dragoni 1998 thus it includes typical cases met in practice note that throughout this work time is counted from the start of pumping hence recovery starts at t 1 and the figure focuses on t 1 the results show that r inv increases to a peak value then decreases and eventually vanishes the timing and magnitude of the peak as well as the termination time of the test strongly depend on s c smaller values of s c imply a later peak a larger peak magnitude and a larger termination time of the test to understand this result note that smaller values of s c are related to higher pumping rate smaller transmissivity or smaller apparent resolution the first two factors lead to a more pronounced cone of depression so that the imaginary barrier can be located further away and still have the same influence on the drawdown the last factor implies a higher sensitivity to differences in drawdown and thus a better ability to inform on distant variations of aquifer properties the approximate solution for r inv eq 17 is also shown in fig 4a the results reveal an overall good performance of the approximate solution even at early times which is somewhat surprising given that the solution was derived by assuming large times the approximation is more accurate at larger times as expected as smaller values of s c imply a later peak and a larger termination time of the test the results show that the peak magnitude the time at which it occurs and the termination time of the test are all better predicted by the approximate solution for smaller values of s c we now analyze the ratio of the radius of investigation during the recovery phase to the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase 24 r inv r inv r inv p r inv r inv p this ratio informs on how much farther we can see into the aquifer during the recovery phase in comparison with the pumping phase we refer to this ratio as the investigation ratio of the recovery test r inv is of the same order of magnitude as r inv because the latter is equal to r inv r p where r p is equal to the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase when it is defined according to the impulse response difference peak definition bresciani et al 2020 however as r inv relies on consistent definitions of the radius of investigation for both phases it enables an accurate comparison between the recovery and pumping phases namely r inv 1 at t 1 fig 4b shows r inv as a function of t for several values of s c similarly to r inv r inv first increases to a peak value then decreases and eventually vanishes we also see that smaller values of s c imply a later peak a larger peak magnitude and a larger termination time of the test r inv can be also be obtained using the approximate solution for r inv derived in section 2 3 eq 17 and the exact solution for r inv p derived in section 2 2 eq 11 we obtain 25 r inv t ln s c t e 1 1 s c this solution is not fully analytical owing to the presence of e 1 1 however a fully analytical solution can be formulated using the analytical approximation of e 1 1 given in eq 12 the resulting solution i e using eq 12 is also plotted in fig 4b the results show that this approximation is overall satisfactory and that it is especially good at large times the reason is the same as for the approximate solution of r inv discussed above 3 3 maximum radius of investigation r inv m a x and t max are plotted as a function of s c in fig 5 a and b respectively the results show that both quantities decrease with increasing s c consistently with previous observations they are more sensitive to s c when the latter is smaller especially when s c 0 1 the approximate solutions for r inv m a x eq 21 and t max eq 20 and the corresponding approximation errors are shown in fig 5a and b respectively the error on r inv m a x increases with s c but remains small 6 for all tested values of s c the error on t max is significantly larger but may be deemed acceptable when s c is small e g 10 when s c 0 08 the maximum investigation ratio of the recovery test r inv m a x can be found using r inv m a x in place of r inv in eq 24 26 r inv m a x r inv m a x r inv p r inv m a x r inv p r inv m a x shows similar trends as r inv m a x when varying s c although it is slightly less sensitive than r inv m a x to s c fig 5c an approximate expression for r inv m a x can also be obtained by evaluating eq 25 for t t max with t max obtained from eq 20 yielding 27 r inv m a x 1 e s c e 1 1 s c this approximation is fully analytical when the function e 1 1 is evaluated with eq 12 the resulting approximation using eq 12 and the implied errors are plotted in fig 5c the error is small 7 for all tested values of s c 3 4 termination time of the test t end is shown as a function of s c in fig 5d the results show that t end decreases with increasing s c similarly to t max although with a slightly higher sensitivity the approximate solution for t end eq 23 is also plotted in fig 5d as well as the approximation errors the error behaves similarly to but is smaller than the error implied by the approximate solution for t max compare with fig 5b the error may be deemed acceptable when s c is small e g 10 when s c 0 21 4 discussion 4 1 maximum radius of investigation the results show that the radius of investigation can be up to five times larger during recovery than at the end of the pumping phase for the range of tested parameter values fig 5c this is significant and confirms previous studies that demonstrated that we can see farther into the aquifer in the recovery phase than in the pumping phase daungkaew et al 2000 ewens and pooladi darvish 2009 moreover the apparent resolution was assumed to be identical in both phases however in practice the apparent resolution is typically smaller i e the data are less noisy during recovery than during pumping bourdet 2002 fetter 2001 kresic 2006 kuchuk 2009 hence the propensity of the radius of investigation to be larger during recovery than at the end of the pumping phase may be underestimated in this study another important result is that the maximum radius of investigation may sometimes only be reached after a relatively long time up to approximately one hundred times the pumping duration for the range of tested parameter values fig 5b in all cases when s c is smaller r inv m a x and t max are larger thus in practice the maximum radius of investigation may be missed if the data are not recorded for a long enough time nonetheless even if the peak cannot be reached a substantial increase of the radius of investigation may still occur within a reasonable time frame 4 2 controlling factors the controlling factors of the radius of investigation during recovery are probably best highlighted through the dimensional versions of the approximate expressions derived in this study these are 28 r inv tt s ln 4 π t s c t q t p 29 r inv m a x 1 2 q t p π s s c e 30 t max q t p 4 π t s c e 31 t end q t p 4 π t s c 32 r inv t ln 4 π t s c t q t p t p 3 656 4 π t s c q 0 1295 3 445 33 r inv m a x 1 4 π t s c e q 3 656 4 π t s c q 0 1295 3 445 eq 28 highlights an important difference between the radii of investigation during pumping and recovery namely while the radius of investigation is proportional to tt during pumping regardless of the precise definition adopted bresciani et al 2020 it is a non monotonic function of tt during recovery first increasing and then decreasing in contrast the radius of investigation is proportional to 1 s in both phases all of the above quantities increase with the increasing pumping rate and with the decreasing apparent resolution demonstrating the importance of these two parameters in determining the ability to explore a large area during a recovery test the pumping duration has an equivalent role and thus importance as the pumping rate for all quantities except the maximum investigation ratio for which it has no influence the latter outcome indicates that the pumping duration has a proportional influence on the maximum radius of investigation and the radius of investigation at the end of the pumping phase transmissivity also has an important influence on most of the derived quantities nonetheless a somewhat surprising result is that the maximum radius of investigation appears to be independent of transmissivity eq 29 this is partly a consequence of the approximation made to derive these expressions the exact maximum radius of investigation shows some dependence to transmissivity even though it is small for common values of s c and especially for small values the time at which the maximum occurs the termination time of the test and the maximum investigation ratio all decrease with the increasing transmissivity eqs 30 31 and 33 while they do not depend on storativity in contrast the radius of investigation and its maximum value both decrease with the increasing storativity eqs 28 and 29 4 3 relevance and limitations of the presented solutions the solutions derived in this study allow for a rapid assessment of the radius of investigation and its controlling factors during recovery this is useful during both the design and the interpretation of recovery tests as explained in the introduction in particular knowing the time at which the maximum radius of investigation is attained may be useful to decide when to stop the test indeed it may be deemed sufficient to pursue the test only until the maximum radius of investigation is reached in any case it would be meaningless to pursue the test beyond t end note that the calculations may in principle be updated in real time during the test using continuously updated parameters values i e assuming real time interpretation of the data further we suggest that the maximum radius of investigation reached during the test evaluated using the final parameter estimates constitutes important information that could be reported along with the results of the test note that this value may be smaller than the theoretical maximum radius of investigation if the test is aborted before t max the solutions derived in this study are based on the theis solution which has well known limitations due to the simplifying assumptions on which it relies these include aquifer homogeneity full well penetration and the absence of leakage through aquifer top and bottom and wellbore storage despite the ubiquitous heterogeneity of aquifers the assumption of aquifer homogeneity is not deemed critical indeed heterogeneity mostly affects the drawdown at the beginning of pumping and recovery phases when it essentially depends on local properties near the well later into these phases heterogeneity is typically well sampled by the perturbation so that an equivalent homogeneous model often provides a reasonable approximation of the drawdown response copty and findikakis 2004 meier et al 1998 neuman et al 2007 sánchez vila et al 1999 zech et al 2016 as the radius of investigation at the beginning of each phase only has a limited practical interest an equivalent homogeneous model will often be suitable similarly the effects of wellbore storage are only significant during a short period of time after pumping starts or stops agarwal et al 1970 papadopulos and cooper 1967 van everdingen and hurst 1949 hence these effects should not be a concern for typical uses of the radius of investigation the assumptions of full well penetration and absence of leakage are likely more critical when they are not satisfied the solutions derived in this work should be extended to include these effects this may be done using available solutions hantush 1964 5 field example we illustrate the theory using a long duration pumping test conducted in the cuise sands aquifer which is a confined aquifer located in the paris basin france klinka 2017 the drawdown was only measured at the pumping well as no other well was available nearby the drawdown data are shown in fig 6 a together with the modeled drawdown calculated with eqs 3 and 5 for the pumping and recovery phases respectively relevant parameters are listed in table 3 the model well reproduces the measurements in both phases the high frequency of the measurements 30 s time step throughout the pumping test allowed us to determining the apparent resolution fig 6b the apparent resolution is slightly finer in the recovery phase s c 3 2 cm than in the pumping phase s c 3 5 cm the radius of investigation was estimated during both pumping and recovery phases using these values fig 6a the results indicate r inv 449 m at the end of the pumping phase and r inv 464 m at the beginning of the recovery phase the discontinuity is a consequence of the differences in s c between the two phases the maximum radius of investigation obtained at t max 39 8 h is r inv m a x 544 m this is 21 larger than the radius of investigation reached at the end of pumping t end 81 h which is 15 h before the last measurement was acquired thus the duration of the data acquisition was close to optimal since most of the recorded signal is meaningful i e larger than noise 6 conclusions we derived exact semi analytical as well as approximate fully analytical solutions for the radius of investigation during recovery and related key quantities maximum radius of investigation the time at which it occurs and the termination time of the test as a function of the apparent resolution and other relevant parameters all these solutions are new except for the approximate solutions for the maximum radius of investigation and the time at which it occurs which were already shown by stewart 2011 though without derivation the semi analytical solutions require simple numerical procedures which were implemented in the open source wellradpy package written in python bresciani 2020 evaluating the fully analytical solutions is straightforward and these solutions imply relatively small errors in many cases all these solutions will facilitate the design and interpretation of recovery tests in practice during recovery the radius of investigation shows a non monotonic behavior it first increases for some time then decreases and eventually vanishes the radius of investigation can be up to five times larger during recovery than at the end of the pumping phase for the range of tested parameter values however relatively large radii of investigation are associated with relatively large times as the time at which the maximum occurs can be up to one hundred times the pumping duration thus in practice one may need to find a compromise between the size of the investigated area and the time required for the test our analysis also highlights that in addition to aquifer parameters the pumping rate pumping duration and apparent measurements resolution are key parameters controlling the radius of investigation during recovery finally the theoretical approach was illustrated by a field example in this example the maximum radius of investigation was found to be 544 m which is 21 larger than at the end of the pumping phase we also found that the duration of the data acquisition was close to optimal i e most of the recorded signal is larger than noise credit authorship contribution

5202,as one of the most important crop producing bases the north china plain ncp has suffered serious groundwater depletion due to drying climate and intensive human activities an accurate estimation of groundwater storage gws is of great importance for the sustainable development of local society and region s economy this study investigates a methodology to determine improved gws variation throughout the ncp based on assimilation of terrestrial water storage tws data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data into the community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable model we found that the cable model is not able to compute the prolonged decrease and accelerated since 2013 in the gws change around the southwestern region of the ncp where major cities are located the model incorrectly characterizes the spatial patterns of interannual and annual changes of water storage variation mainly caused by errors in the precipitation forcing data the interannual tws change is indicative of gws while the observed seasonal variation is primarily that of root zone soil moisture the grace data assimilation most effectively improves gws computation the gws assimilation results were validated against a total of 156 in situ groundwater level data in the ncp compared to the model computation there was a significant improvement in terms of cross correlation on average from 0 12 before assimilation to 0 54 after assimilation this study demonstrates the effectiveness of grace data assimilation toward reliable estimation of ground water storage variation in the ncp and its promise to quantify the potential implication of water supply from the south to north water transfer project within the ncp keywords grace cable model the north china plain data assimilation ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction groundwater is a key component of the global hydrological cycle that plays an important role in agriculture industry and ecosystems in many parts of the world döll et al 2015 long et al 2020 groundwater is the primary water source for over two billion people and more than 50 of irrigation water for global food supply hu et al 2019 hence accurate estimation of groundwater storage gws variations is crucial for sustainable management of water resources and food security despite the importance of acquiring reliable estimates of gws knowledge on its tempo spatial variations is generally deficient particularly on a large scale due to the lack of in situ monitoring networks ground based measurements albeit high accuracy only provide point wise estimates which generally exhibit many gaps through time and over space hu and jiao 2015 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 with the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission in 2002 it becomes possible to observe terrestrial water storage tws at large spatial scales with unprecedented accuracy zheng et al 2012 khaki et al 2018 tws is a vertically integrated measurement of water storage changes that represents the sum of soil moisture groundwater surface water snow and ice yin et al 2018 the disaggregation of grace tws anomalies into changes of different hydrologic components through for example data assimilation or downscaling technique would greatly enrich their application in hydrologic and agricultural studies and water management li et al 2019 the widely used approach to vertical disaggregation of grace data is to utilize auxiliary information from hydrological models or in situ observations for example yeh et al 2006 used ground based observations of soil moisture to isolate groundwater storage variations from the grace tws data in the state of illinois usa for the period 2002 2005 feng et al 2013 estimated groundwater depletion in north china by removing simulated soil moisture sm changes from the grace derived tws changes huang et al 2019 computed 2003 2013 monthly groundwater storage anomalies in the southwest china from the grace derived tws data by using the ancillary data of surface water storage and soil moisture storage from the water global assessment and prognosis global hydrology model wghm simulations although comparable estimates may be achieved in some areas the method is based on an unreasonable premise that surface water and soil moisture storage are accurately known for removing their effects from the regionally averaged tws observations moreover the spatial resolutions of the model outputs and in situ data are typically much smaller than the grace tws measurements leading to a difficulty in combing two different datasets to draw reliable computation of gws long et al 2016 nie et al 2018 therefore it will inevitably produce a large uncertainty to the gws estimates hydrological models have many advantages of providing spatially distributed estimates and differentiating tws components thus widely employed for joint analysis with the grace data hu et al 2016 long et al 2017 however the accuracy of the models is restricted by uncertainties in climate forcing particularly precipitation and model parameters and by deficiencies in the model structure dumedah and walker 2014 as well as other measurement noises involved in the model run data assimilation da can be employed to statistically combine the strengths of hydrological model outputs and grace observations while mitigating respective weakness such as imperfect parameterization in hydrological models and coarse spatial resolution of grace data girotto et al 2016 a number of studies have shown that grace da is an effective way to improve and disaggregate the estimates of tws observations zaitchik et al 2008 for the first time demonstrated assimilation of the grace derived monthly tws anomalies into the catchment land surface model using an ensemble kalman smoother over the four major sub basins of mississippi usa tangdamrongsub et al 2017 improved estimates of hydrologic components in a semi arid region by assimilating grace data into the pcraster global water balance pcr globwb model using an ensemble kalman filter tian et al 2017 jointly assimilated tws observations from the grace and near surface sm observations from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos into the world wide water model using the ensemble kalman smoother from 2010 to 2013 for the australian continent additionally many studies have explored to enrich the hydrological applications of grace da e g drought detection houborg et al 2012 eicker et al 2014 and improve its performance from assimilation algorithms and anthropogenic processes impact khaki et al 2017 nie et al 2019 compared with the traditional method of separating tws data the da approach has a number of advantages the da essentially runs through the statistical uncertainty information variance and covariance of the model outputs and the observations the model state variables are continuously updated by combining the model results and the grace data in an optimal sense it leads to improved prediction of the state parameters by minimizing the associated model errors girotto et al 2017 additionally the da is a viable approach to integrate various observational datasets of mixed information on the model variables at different spatial and temporal resolutions commensurate with the model results for example the regionally integrate grace tws data can be downscaled horizontally vertically and in time through da lastly the assimilated observation of tws also improves besides water storage computation dynamic simulation of runoff and ground heat transfer for example within the land surface model zaitchik et al 2008 the conflict between available water resources and agricultural demand is alarming in the ncp and the over exploitation of groundwater has caused devastating consequences the shallow groundwater tables have dropped by 20 40 m across hebei and beijing from 1991 to 2003 wang et al 2016a the associated ground subsidence prevails around 120 000 km2 in the ncp and an extensive area of 17 500 km2 has been subsiding at a rate of 20 mm yr ye et al 2016 the gws estimates provided by independent measures e g hydrological models and grace suffer from coarse spatial resolution and high uncertainty thus this research is conducted to investigate the performance of grace da based on cable model under the condition similar to the ncp and declare the status of gws estimates specifically we 1 examine the influence of data assimilation of tws anomalies on individual water storage components 2 analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal and interannual changes of tws and gws estimates after data assimilation 3 evaluate the performance of the posteriori estimates of the gws anomalies based on independent in situ groundwater level measurements 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp is located in the eastern part of china fig 1 which borders on taihang mountain yanshan mountain and yellow river to the west north and south respectively covering a total area of 139 000 km2 the ncp is a typical plain landscape and the flat terrain slopes generally west to east with an elevation of 100 1 2 m above the sea level the climate is continental arid climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 c su et al 2018 the annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 600 mm yr and the potential evaporation is about 1100 2000 mm yr cao et al 2014 the plain is drained by the haihe river the luanhe river and their tributaries most rivers have become seasonal or even dry out due to lack of precipitation and the reservoir construction in the upstream reaches 2 2 grace observations the monthly 1 grid grace tws datasets are computed from the time variable gravity field models provided by the center for space research csr at the university of texas hereafter csr sh andam akorful et al 2015 the study period is between january 2003 and december 2015 covering a total of 156 months due to the sampling and post processing of grace observations surface mass variations at small spatial scales tend to be attenuated the scaling factors are applied to restore the overall magnitude grace tws changes to individual basins and regions globally long et al 2015a b a separate file of the scaling factors derived from the ncar clm 4 0 is obtained to correct for grace signals during low pass filtering hereafter csr scaled in addition grace mascon mass concentration solutions from csr are also used for comparison hereafter csr m the csr m solutions have no striping errors and capture the signals observed by grace within the measurement noise level a detailed process of mason solutions is seen in save et al 2016 2 3 meteorological data the 3 hourly 0 5 grid precipitation air temperature snowfall rate wind speed humidity surface pressure shortwave and long wave downward radiations are used to run the cable land surface model for this study decker 2015 the meteorological data are provided by the global land data assimilation system gldasv2 covering the period from 2003 to 2015 https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas tangdamrongsub et al 2018a indicated that the water storage estimates from the land surface model are most sensitive to the precipitation product and relatively less sensitive to the change in other forcing data four different precipitation products are used and compared in this study so as to find the representative precipitation forcing data within the ncp table 1 they include the gldas tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann the precipitation data in gldasv1 were obtained from disaggregated noaa climate prediction center merged analysis of precipitation cmap while the one used in gldasv2 is from the global meteorological forcing data provided by the princeton university rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2016 the trmm 3b42 precipitation products are available with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h within 50 s 50 n huffman et al 2007 the persiann was developed by the center from hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california the estimates of rainfall rate are computed by using neural network function classification approximation procedures and cover 60 s 60 n all the forcing data are re sampled to a 0 5 0 5 spatial grid to reconcile with the cable spatial resolution 2 4 ground based measurements monthly groundwater level data in the ncp from january 2000 to december 2014 were collected from beijing water resources bulletin of china mwr 2010 the observation wells are widely spread over the study area as shown in fig 1 the change of groundwater level in each 0 5 pixel is estimated using the simple average of groundwater level of all observation wells within the pixel so as to validate the accuracy of simulation and assimilation results the in situ data are mostly continuous during the study period of 2003 2014 some well observations include abnormal jumps data gaps and outliers which are deducted in the preprocessing stage note that the groundwater level measurements are mainly used for qualitative validation without converting to groundwater storage in order to avoid possible errors associated with unknown specific yield the summary of the datasets used in this study is shown in table 1 3 methods 3 1 community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable model the cable is a publicly available land surface model that simulates energy water and carbon fluxes and partitioning of net radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes ukkola et al 2016 it consists of three subcomponents for modeling canopy microclimate i e soil and snow dynamic of plant and litter and soil carbon pools zhang et al 2013 the cable model can provide estimates of soil moisture and groundwater components with a temporal and spatial resolution of 3 h and 0 5 0 5 respectively the soil is divided into six layers with a thickness of 0 022 0 058 0 154 0 409 1 085 and 2 872 m from top to bottom the groundwater is simulated by assuming a thickness of 20 m below the soil layers as the unit of soil moisture and groundwater estimates is given in m3 m3 tangdamrongsub et al 2018a the storage estimates are simply calculated by multiplying the thickness of each layer with the respective simulation outputs soil moisture and groundwater are the major components of tws anomalies as in our study region ncp with arid climate while the contribution of surface water storage is insignificant therefore we decompose the cable simulated tws into three main components namely smtop smrz and gws anomalies where smtop is defined as the sum of top soil moisture and surface water storage including snow storage and smrz stands for the variation accumulated between the second and the bottom soil layers depth from 0 022 to 4 6 m the detailed information about the cable model is given in decker 2015 and zhang et al 2013 the source code for cable is freely available at https trac nci org au trac cable the used cable model is the modification version from decker 2015 which incorporates a groundwater model subgrid scale runoff parameterizations and a different parameterization for soil evaporation these new developments mitigated the overestimation of evapotranspiration a known bias in cable while improved the simulation of soil hydrology and mean runoff decker 2015 a finer model space may reduce the uncertainty when comparing the in situ groundwater level observations with the gridded model estimation in this study the resolution of model parameters was limited to 0 25 as such this study was performed based on the highest resolution possible the initial state of the cable model is obtained through the model spin up firstly the model propagation is performed using an arbitrary initial value e g zero over the study period between january 2003 and december 2015 then the state obtained in december 2015 is used as the initial state to run the cable model again through the repeated process the model simulated variables are updated until they reach the convergence typically a few loops are needed until the model converges the schematic illustration of the applied processing steps in this study i e data integration procedure data assimilation and water storage estimations is provided in fig 2 3 2 model uncertainty two primary sources of error in the cable model outputs are the uncertainties in the meteorological forcing data and the model parameters the generation of ensemble sets is a critical step in ensemble based assimilation which mainly involves a determination of the perturbation type intervals and ensemble size the perturbation of meteorological forcing data is referred to kumar et al 2016 and tian et al 2017 the zero mean normally distributed additive perturbation with a standard deviation 1 σ of 50 w m2 are applied to the downward longwave lw radiation forcing and the lognormal multiplicative perturbations with a standard deviation of 30 are applied to the downward shortwave sw radiation fields we also assumed a multiplicative error in precipitation by taking univariate random samples between 0 2 20 to avoid negative rainfall for low or zero rainfall values other forcing data have little impact on the simulation results thus remain unchanged as far as model parameters are concerned a total of ten tws related parameters in each pixel are perturbed using the additive gaussian noise with a mean of zero and a standard deviation equal to 10 of the range of values that occurs over the ncp dumedah and walker 2014 in this study the model states are perturbed as a result of model propagation associated with the perturbed forcing data and model parameters therefore the correlation between soil and gws layers is mainly controlled by the land surface model the state variables are not perturbed directly as done in e g land information system because the accurate correlation between soil and gws layers are unknown table 2 summarizes the forcing and parameters perturbation of this study in this study 200 ensemble members are used determined based on a trial and error analysis to maintain the accuracy of model error covariance representation and computational efficiency 3 3 grace observation uncertainty the full error information of grace level 2 products is obtained from the institute of geodesy gravity field model for the period between 2002 and 2016 https www tugraz at institute ifg downloads gravity field models itsg grace2016 the monthly full error information of the stokes coefficients is used to compute an observation error covariance matrix for the grace tws fields to be used for data assimilation the detailed algorithm can refer to tangdamrongsub et al 2017 3 4 evaluation indices two indices are used to quantitatively assess the performances of satellite or model data products with ground based measurements spatially averaged at 0 5 pixel these include the pearson s correlation coefficient pr and root mean square error rmse shown as 1 pr i 1 n g i g p i p i 1 n g i g 2 p i p 2 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n g i p i 2 where n is the total number of data g is the ground based observations p is the satellite or model products and g and p are their average values the pr was adopted as a primary evaluation index to quantitatively assess the degree of correlation and rmse was used to further measure the deviation between simulated and assimilated results and observed values in each grid cell 3 5 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter enkf is a monte carlo implementation of the bayesian state update problem that improves the computation feasibility for high dimensional systems evensen 1994 in the enkf an ensemble of model states is integrated forward in time using the non linear forward model with replicates of system noise at update stages the error covariance is given by computing the variance of the differences between each ensemble value and the ensemble mean clark et al 2008 the enkf algorithm tailored to our problem is briefly explained let x denote a matrix composed of the model state vectors with the dimension of nm n where n m n represent the number of model state parameters model grid cells and ensemble members respectively in this study the parameter n is equal to 3 namely smtop smrz and gws anomalies 3 x x 1 x n where xi is an nm 1 vector of model variables for each ensemble the ensemble mean is calculated as 4 x 1 n i 1 n x i the anomaly of each ensemble is defined as x i x i x i and the matrix of the anomalies is given by 5 x x 1 x n then the variance covariance matrix pnm nm of the model state parameters can be estimated from the ensemble of the anomalies as follows 6 p 1 n 1 x x t finally the model state can be updated based on the initial state and the variance covariance matrix of the model and grace data through the kalman gain matrix 7 x i a x i k y i h x i where k stands for the kalman gain factor and h is a constant matrix used to transform the model states to observation space as follows 8 k p h t h p h t r 1 9 h 1 1 1 1 n 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 n 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 n m n m in eq 7 x i a nm n is the updated model states hereafter assimilated results yi denotes randomly perturbed grace observations with the dimension of m n rm m stands for the error variance covariance matrix of the grace observations cable tws long term mean computed between jan 2004 and dec 2009 is added to grace observed tws anomalies to reconcile the tws climatology between model and observation 4 comparisons of different precipitation products 4 1 influence on tws using different loops fig 3 shows the comparison of cable simulated tws anomalies using different precipitation products evaluated at different loops it is observed that tws variations show larger discrepancies between loop 1 and 3 when gldasv1 and persiann products used fig 3a and b respectively with the number of loops increases the differences among tws anomalies become smaller when the number of loops reaches 7 or larger all tws variations basically remain the same the final converged tws anomalies show typical seasonal variations between 2003 and 2015 for all cases of gldasv1 gldasv2 trmm and persiann products fig 3c however it is found that the amplitude of the seasonal changes is relatively smaller when the model is forced with persiann it is necessary to choose the appropriate precipitation data to be used for the rest of our analysis 4 2 evaluation of precipitation products in order to evaluate the accuracy of different precipitation products pr and rmse between in situ observations and four different precipitation data from gldasv1 gldasv2 trmm and persiann are computed fig 4 the detailed information about these rain gauge stations is introduced in table 3 it is found that trmm agrees better with in situ rainfall observations in most cases than the other three products with pr of 0 89 0 96 while persiann presents the lowest pr of 0 54 0 74 the correlation is 0 88 and 0 86 for gldasv1 and gldasv2 respectively fig 4a similarly wang et al 2016b found that although the bias correction of the gldasv2 precipitation data greatly improves temporal continuity it makes gldasv2 precipitation less correlated with observed precipitation than gldsav1 in china the rmse quantifies the overall difference between various precipitation data products and in situ observation fig 4b trmm product exhibits the least rmse 24 53 mm on average while gldasv1 gldasv2 and persiann have a rmse of 30 11 mm 36 46 mm and 46 31 mm respectively it indicates that trmm product has the smallest discrepancy with observed rainfall records than the other three data products spatially a rmse of trmm in the central part of ncp is 24 42 mm which is smaller than that in the southern and northern regions 25 96 mm and 26 22 mm respectively generally speaking trmm data match the in situ observations in the ncp presenting the largest pr and smallest rmse compared to other datasets therefore trmm data are selected as the representative precipitation forcing data over the ncp in this study 5 results and discussion 5 1 terrestrial water storage changes the basin averaged tws anomalies are calculated from grace for the ncp by averaging the results at each of the model grids lying within the spatial domain of the basin as shown in fig 5 due to the smoothing and post processing of grace observations tws anomalies from csr sh solution are attenuated tws variations from csr scaled are larger than csr sh solutions the average seasonal change increases by 65 over the period from 2003 to 2015 the tws anomalies show a prolonged declining trend with the rate between 7 72 1 14 mm yr csr sh and 12 30 1 83 mm yr csr scaled as shown in table 4 precisely speaking the tws anomalies from csr m solutions like other solutions exhibit a modest decrease from 2003 to 2012 followed by a sharply downward trend between 2013 and 2015 with the mean trend of 10 01 mm yr 2003 2012 and 53 69 mm yr 2013 2015 the exacerbated downtrend may be a mixture of precipitation decrease and intensive groundwater abstraction in recent years gong et al 2018 the grace measurement errors in monthly tws anomalies from csr scaled for example is about 1 5 cm as shown in the shadow area fig 5 in general csr m solutions agree better with csr scaled solutions than csr sh some studies also demonstrated that csr m solutions provide tws estimates comparable to traditional spherical harmonic solutions without any post processing applied luthcke et al 2008 scanlon et al 2016 therefore the csr m solutions are selected to describe the characteristics of tws variations in the following discussions 5 2 impact of data assimilation the monthly averaged tws anomalies and individual storage components in the ncp are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that assimilated tws anomalies are between simulated open loop results and grace observations there is a considerable difference between the cable model and the grace data during the second half of the time series where the grace observations decrease sharply while the cable results do not fig 6a the reason is likely due to the fact that the anthropogenic factor like increased agricultural irrigation is not considered in the cable model pan et al 2017 overall the data assimilation improves the long term trends of the tws anomalies from 3 11 1 31 mm yr to 6 15 1 32 mm yr making the tws results consistent with grace observations grace da could result in a spurious update of model state flux estimate particularly when the redistribution of the update is limited by some boundary condition of the model however the behavior is not observed in this study it is likely that the groundwater dynamics and size of groundwater store of cable is larger than other lsms e g clsm girotto et al 2017 li et al 2019 and noah mp nie et al 2019 as such most grace da update are distributed to the groundwater layer consequently the near surface and root zone soil moisture receives only a small update which explains the insignificant change in other fluxes such as evapotranspiration the tws anomalies in the ncp are divided into three main components of top soil moisture smtop root zone soil moisture smrz and groundwater storage gws their model simulation and grace data assimilation results are shown in fig 6b the data assimilation has the largest influence on gws that is the most uncertain storage component in hydrological modeling especially in recent years 2013 2015 the trends increase from 1 66 0 40 mm yr to 4 45 0 62 mm yr table 5 the trend observed in gws estimates is smaller than previous studies pan et al 2017 gong et al 2018 due to the unavailability of a groundwater consumption routine in the cable it is also noted that the groundwater parameters of the cable model are not calibrated in the ncp this results in a small dynamic range of gws estimates leading to an underestimated trend as also found in tangdamrongsub et al 2018b the seasonal variation of smtop is much smaller than others the smrz anomalies show the largest seasonal fluctuation and little trend it is estimated that gws anomalies contribute 70 of the tws long term trend and smrz accounts for 86 of the tws annual change the groundwater is responsible for the interannual variation observed in grace tws data while the root zone soil moisture derives mainly the seasonal change in the measured tws data over the ncp 5 3 spatial patterns of the interannual variation fig 7 compares the spatial patterns of the long term trends in the annual trmm precipitation tws and gws anomalies from 2003 to 2015 grace observations detect 10 20 mm yr of tws decrease in the southwestern part of the ncp the conjunction area of henan and hebei province shown in fig 7a it is reported that the annual average groundwater consumption is largest in hebei 15 64 km3 and henan provinces 2 54 km3 among eight provinces within the ncp during the period from 2003 to 2012 wrpb 2012 in recent years intensive agricultural irrigation and warming climate cause great pressure on water resources resulting in groundwater over abstraction e g anyang zhang et al 2019 and even land subsidence e g guo et al 2015 however the spatial patterns of the cable simulated tws and gws anomalies show decreasing trends in the southern part of the ncp inside shandong province as shown in fig 7b the trmm precipitation used to drive the cable model implies less annual rainfall in the southern part which is consistent with the patterns of the model tws and gws anomalies fig 7b d the inefficacy of the cable model is primarily due to the uncertainties associated with the trmm forcing data in addition to the lack of groundwater consumption modeling fig 7e and f demonstrate that how the grace data assimilation improves the cable model results of water storage computation reconciling the spatial patterns of tws and gws trends with the grace observations over the ncp 5 4 spatial patterns of the seasonal variation the grace observations also show the largest annual changes of tws anomalies in the southwestern part of the ncp as shown in fig 8 a however the spatial pattern of the simulated tws presents the dominant annual change in the southeastern part the model indicates that large seasonal precipitation induced by the wet climate in the southeastern part mainly influences the greater tws variation fig 8d in the seasonal time scale the simulated smrz exhibits a similar spatial pattern as tws anomalies as it contributes to 86 of the annual amplitude fig 8b c with small contribution from the groundwater storage the grace data assimilation tends to reduce the overestimated annual tws in the southeastern part and leads to more consistent spatial patterns with the grace observations fig 8e and f however there still exists a sensible difference between fig 8 a and e possibly due possibly to the inefficacy of the model error covariance information computed with a finite set of the model runs ensemble the effect of precipitation error might be underestimated 5 5 validation of gws anomalies against in situ level data the time series of the modeled and assimilated gws anomalies against in situ groundwater level data are presented in fig 9 the model gws variation does not agree with the relative changes found in most of in situ level observations the gws time series after the grace data assimilation are significantly improved in comparison to the measured groundwater level in the ncp the assimilated results are also capable of capturing significant groundwater depletion between 2005 and 2015 in most cases the negative gws trend is mainly induced by the excessive demand of groundwater required for agriculture during the 2003 2009 rainfall deficiency period with the average annual groundwater withdrawal of 25 gigatonnes 2 5 1010 m3 feng et al 2013 li et al 2013 apparently a missing groundwater consumption component in the cable model leads to the failure of groundwater storage change computation table 6 quantifies the comparison between the simulated assimilated gws anomalies and in situ observations at various locations in terms of pr and rmse the statistical significance test for the correlation is conducted based on the two tailed t test for rmse computation two time series are normalized to 11 the simulated gws is in general negatively correlated with the observations in some areas e g pixels of g69 g70 and g102 the grace data assimilation leads to increase in pr and decrease in rmse indicating the improved gws computation after assimilation nearly in all cases the higher correlations are seen in all pixels on average from 0 12 before assimilation to 0 54 after assimilation the best case of assimilation occurs in g70 with the pr increasing from 0 59 to 0 64 at the 95 confidence level the assimilated results show higher correlation with in situ level in southern parts than that in northern parts with the correlation of 0 66 and 0 41 respectively overall the results indicate the da process increases the correlation coefficients between gws estimates and the in situ measurements by 0 42 on average and reduces the rmse by 31 22 on average the bold numbers in table 6 denote the improvements in pr and rmse by da are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level see also tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary material the least agreement between the assimilated results and groundwater level is found near bohai gulf the possible reasons may include the larger grace errors in the area close to ocean the fewer number of continuous observation wells and the limitation of cable model i e the boundary condition to simulate gws near coastal regions 6 conclusion the grace satellite mission has for the first time provided measurements of the integrated tws changes averaged over hundreds of km the separate estimates of gws are not readily available from grace data alone in areas with severe groundwater depletion including the north china plain the accurate knowledge about spatial and temporal variations of tws and its sub components like gws is critical we demonstrate that the grace data assimilation with a land surface model like cable is a viable approach to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of different water storage components in the ncp by reducing the uncertainty of the cable model computation primarily propagated from the uncertainty in the precipitation forcing data four precipitation datasets including gldasv1 gldasv2 trmm and persiann are validated against with the rain gauge measurements at different stations it is found that the trmm data match with the in situ rainfall observations better than others in the ncp yielding the largest pr and smallest rmse thus trmm was chosen as the representative precipitation forcing data for the cable modeling and the subsequent analysis with grace data the enkf is used to statistically combine the model outputs and grace tws data a number of interesting aspects on precipitation and water storage computation in the ncp are identified from the grace data assimilation 1 the model is not able to compute the prolonged decrease and accelerated during the last several years in the water storage change around the southwestern region of the ncp due to the shortage of in situ measurements the human activity such as ground water depletion is not considered in the cable model which may yield a large uncertainty in water storage computation over that region 2 the model incorrectly characterizes the spatial patterns of interannual and annual changes of tws mainly caused by errors in the trmm precipitation data 3 the interannual tws change observed by grace is an indicative of gws while the observed seasonal variation is primarily that of root zone soil moisture 4 the grace data assimilation is most effective in gws computation that is gws is the least accurately calculated in land surface models 5 the soil moisture computation is less affected by the grace data assimilation as also seen from other regions tian et al 2019 tangdamrongsub et al 2020 the grace data assimilation results of gws are validated using numerous in situ groundwater level data the simulated gws anomalies fail to capture dynamic changes of in situ groundwater level and even show a negative correlation in some areas consistent improvement in gws computation by grace data assimilation can be seen from nearly all test sites which is shown with increased cross correlation and decreased rms difference for example in g70 the pr increases from 0 59 to 0 64 in order to ease the water crisis over northern china the south to north water diversion snwd project was implemented since 2003 especially the middle route of the snwd project was officially opened on december 2014 which runs from danjiangkou reservoir in hubei province to beijing tianjin and hebei provinces with the main conveyance canal length of 1277 km zou et al 2016 grace da scheme has proven to interact closely with groundwater improvement and perform well in such a condition moreover grace da can strengthen the value of grace observations by enabling spatial downscaling and vertical decomposition into individually storage components which are more useful for those who focus on the ncp groundwater issues therefore this study may be applied to quantify the effect of snwd water supply to this

5202,as one of the most important crop producing bases the north china plain ncp has suffered serious groundwater depletion due to drying climate and intensive human activities an accurate estimation of groundwater storage gws is of great importance for the sustainable development of local society and region s economy this study investigates a methodology to determine improved gws variation throughout the ncp based on assimilation of terrestrial water storage tws data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data into the community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable model we found that the cable model is not able to compute the prolonged decrease and accelerated since 2013 in the gws change around the southwestern region of the ncp where major cities are located the model incorrectly characterizes the spatial patterns of interannual and annual changes of water storage variation mainly caused by errors in the precipitation forcing data the interannual tws change is indicative of gws while the observed seasonal variation is primarily that of root zone soil moisture the grace data assimilation most effectively improves gws computation the gws assimilation results were validated against a total of 156 in situ groundwater level data in the ncp compared to the model computation there was a significant improvement in terms of cross correlation on average from 0 12 before assimilation to 0 54 after assimilation this study demonstrates the effectiveness of grace data assimilation toward reliable estimation of ground water storage variation in the ncp and its promise to quantify the potential implication of water supply from the south to north water transfer project within the ncp keywords grace cable model the north china plain data assimilation ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction groundwater is a key component of the global hydrological cycle that plays an important role in agriculture industry and ecosystems in many parts of the world döll et al 2015 long et al 2020 groundwater is the primary water source for over two billion people and more than 50 of irrigation water for global food supply hu et al 2019 hence accurate estimation of groundwater storage gws variations is crucial for sustainable management of water resources and food security despite the importance of acquiring reliable estimates of gws knowledge on its tempo spatial variations is generally deficient particularly on a large scale due to the lack of in situ monitoring networks ground based measurements albeit high accuracy only provide point wise estimates which generally exhibit many gaps through time and over space hu and jiao 2015 tangdamrongsub et al 2015 with the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission in 2002 it becomes possible to observe terrestrial water storage tws at large spatial scales with unprecedented accuracy zheng et al 2012 khaki et al 2018 tws is a vertically integrated measurement of water storage changes that represents the sum of soil moisture groundwater surface water snow and ice yin et al 2018 the disaggregation of grace tws anomalies into changes of different hydrologic components through for example data assimilation or downscaling technique would greatly enrich their application in hydrologic and agricultural studies and water management li et al 2019 the widely used approach to vertical disaggregation of grace data is to utilize auxiliary information from hydrological models or in situ observations for example yeh et al 2006 used ground based observations of soil moisture to isolate groundwater storage variations from the grace tws data in the state of illinois usa for the period 2002 2005 feng et al 2013 estimated groundwater depletion in north china by removing simulated soil moisture sm changes from the grace derived tws changes huang et al 2019 computed 2003 2013 monthly groundwater storage anomalies in the southwest china from the grace derived tws data by using the ancillary data of surface water storage and soil moisture storage from the water global assessment and prognosis global hydrology model wghm simulations although comparable estimates may be achieved in some areas the method is based on an unreasonable premise that surface water and soil moisture storage are accurately known for removing their effects from the regionally averaged tws observations moreover the spatial resolutions of the model outputs and in situ data are typically much smaller than the grace tws measurements leading to a difficulty in combing two different datasets to draw reliable computation of gws long et al 2016 nie et al 2018 therefore it will inevitably produce a large uncertainty to the gws estimates hydrological models have many advantages of providing spatially distributed estimates and differentiating tws components thus widely employed for joint analysis with the grace data hu et al 2016 long et al 2017 however the accuracy of the models is restricted by uncertainties in climate forcing particularly precipitation and model parameters and by deficiencies in the model structure dumedah and walker 2014 as well as other measurement noises involved in the model run data assimilation da can be employed to statistically combine the strengths of hydrological model outputs and grace observations while mitigating respective weakness such as imperfect parameterization in hydrological models and coarse spatial resolution of grace data girotto et al 2016 a number of studies have shown that grace da is an effective way to improve and disaggregate the estimates of tws observations zaitchik et al 2008 for the first time demonstrated assimilation of the grace derived monthly tws anomalies into the catchment land surface model using an ensemble kalman smoother over the four major sub basins of mississippi usa tangdamrongsub et al 2017 improved estimates of hydrologic components in a semi arid region by assimilating grace data into the pcraster global water balance pcr globwb model using an ensemble kalman filter tian et al 2017 jointly assimilated tws observations from the grace and near surface sm observations from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos into the world wide water model using the ensemble kalman smoother from 2010 to 2013 for the australian continent additionally many studies have explored to enrich the hydrological applications of grace da e g drought detection houborg et al 2012 eicker et al 2014 and improve its performance from assimilation algorithms and anthropogenic processes impact khaki et al 2017 nie et al 2019 compared with the traditional method of separating tws data the da approach has a number of advantages the da essentially runs through the statistical uncertainty information variance and covariance of the model outputs and the observations the model state variables are continuously updated by combining the model results and the grace data in an optimal sense it leads to improved prediction of the state parameters by minimizing the associated model errors girotto et al 2017 additionally the da is a viable approach to integrate various observational datasets of mixed information on the model variables at different spatial and temporal resolutions commensurate with the model results for example the regionally integrate grace tws data can be downscaled horizontally vertically and in time through da lastly the assimilated observation of tws also improves besides water storage computation dynamic simulation of runoff and ground heat transfer for example within the land surface model zaitchik et al 2008 the conflict between available water resources and agricultural demand is alarming in the ncp and the over exploitation of groundwater has caused devastating consequences the shallow groundwater tables have dropped by 20 40 m across hebei and beijing from 1991 to 2003 wang et al 2016a the associated ground subsidence prevails around 120 000 km2 in the ncp and an extensive area of 17 500 km2 has been subsiding at a rate of 20 mm yr ye et al 2016 the gws estimates provided by independent measures e g hydrological models and grace suffer from coarse spatial resolution and high uncertainty thus this research is conducted to investigate the performance of grace da based on cable model under the condition similar to the ncp and declare the status of gws estimates specifically we 1 examine the influence of data assimilation of tws anomalies on individual water storage components 2 analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal and interannual changes of tws and gws estimates after data assimilation 3 evaluate the performance of the posteriori estimates of the gws anomalies based on independent in situ groundwater level measurements 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp is located in the eastern part of china fig 1 which borders on taihang mountain yanshan mountain and yellow river to the west north and south respectively covering a total area of 139 000 km2 the ncp is a typical plain landscape and the flat terrain slopes generally west to east with an elevation of 100 1 2 m above the sea level the climate is continental arid climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 c su et al 2018 the annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 600 mm yr and the potential evaporation is about 1100 2000 mm yr cao et al 2014 the plain is drained by the haihe river the luanhe river and their tributaries most rivers have become seasonal or even dry out due to lack of precipitation and the reservoir construction in the upstream reaches 2 2 grace observations the monthly 1 grid grace tws datasets are computed from the time variable gravity field models provided by the center for space research csr at the university of texas hereafter csr sh andam akorful et al 2015 the study period is between january 2003 and december 2015 covering a total of 156 months due to the sampling and post processing of grace observations surface mass variations at small spatial scales tend to be attenuated the scaling factors are applied to restore the overall magnitude grace tws changes to individual basins and regions globally long et al 2015a b a separate file of the scaling factors derived from the ncar clm 4 0 is obtained to correct for grace signals during low pass filtering hereafter csr scaled in addition grace mascon mass concentration solutions from csr are also used for comparison hereafter csr m the csr m solutions have no striping errors and capture the signals observed by grace within the measurement noise level a detailed process of mason solutions is seen in save et al 2016 2 3 meteorological data the 3 hourly 0 5 grid precipitation air temperature snowfall rate wind speed humidity surface pressure shortwave and long wave downward radiations are used to run the cable land surface model for this study decker 2015 the meteorological data are provided by the global land data assimilation system gldasv2 covering the period from 2003 to 2015 https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets keywords gldas tangdamrongsub et al 2018a indicated that the water storage estimates from the land surface model are most sensitive to the precipitation product and relatively less sensitive to the change in other forcing data four different precipitation products are used and compared in this study so as to find the representative precipitation forcing data within the ncp table 1 they include the gldas tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann the precipitation data in gldasv1 were obtained from disaggregated noaa climate prediction center merged analysis of precipitation cmap while the one used in gldasv2 is from the global meteorological forcing data provided by the princeton university rodell et al 2004 beaudoing and rodell 2016 the trmm 3b42 precipitation products are available with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h within 50 s 50 n huffman et al 2007 the persiann was developed by the center from hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california the estimates of rainfall rate are computed by using neural network function classification approximation procedures and cover 60 s 60 n all the forcing data are re sampled to a 0 5 0 5 spatial grid to reconcile with the cable spatial resolution 2 4 ground based measurements monthly groundwater level data in the ncp from january 2000 to december 2014 were collected from beijing water resources bulletin of china mwr 2010 the observation wells are widely spread over the study area as shown in fig 1 the change of groundwater level in each 0 5 pixel is estimated using the simple average of groundwater level of all observation wells within the pixel so as to validate the accuracy of simulation and assimilation results the in situ data are mostly continuous during the study period of 2003 2014 some well observations include abnormal jumps data gaps and outliers which are deducted in the preprocessing stage note that the groundwater level measurements are mainly used for qualitative validation without converting to groundwater storage in order to avoid possible errors associated with unknown specific yield the summary of the datasets used in this study is shown in table 1 3 methods 3 1 community atmosphere biosphere land exchange cable model the cable is a publicly available land surface model that simulates energy water and carbon fluxes and partitioning of net radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes ukkola et al 2016 it consists of three subcomponents for modeling canopy microclimate i e soil and snow dynamic of plant and litter and soil carbon pools zhang et al 2013 the cable model can provide estimates of soil moisture and groundwater components with a temporal and spatial resolution of 3 h and 0 5 0 5 respectively the soil is divided into six layers with a thickness of 0 022 0 058 0 154 0 409 1 085 and 2 872 m from top to bottom the groundwater is simulated by assuming a thickness of 20 m below the soil layers as the unit of soil moisture and groundwater estimates is given in m3 m3 tangdamrongsub et al 2018a the storage estimates are simply calculated by multiplying the thickness of each layer with the respective simulation outputs soil moisture and groundwater are the major components of tws anomalies as in our study region ncp with arid climate while the contribution of surface water storage is insignificant therefore we decompose the cable simulated tws into three main components namely smtop smrz and gws anomalies where smtop is defined as the sum of top soil moisture and surface water storage including snow storage and smrz stands for the variation accumulated between the second and the bottom soil layers depth from 0 022 to 4 6 m the detailed information about the cable model is given in decker 2015 and zhang et al 2013 the source code for cable is freely available at https trac nci org au trac cable the used cable model is the modification version from decker 2015 which incorporates a groundwater model subgrid scale runoff parameterizations and a different parameterization for soil evaporation these new developments mitigated the overestimation of evapotranspiration a known bias in cable while improved the simulation of soil hydrology and mean runoff decker 2015 a finer model space may reduce the uncertainty when comparing the in situ groundwater level observations with the gridded model estimation in this study the resolution of model parameters was limited to 0 25 as such this study was performed based on the highest resolution possible the initial state of the cable model is obtained through the model spin up firstly the model propagation is performed using an arbitrary initial value e g zero over the study period between january 2003 and december 2015 then the state obtained in december 2015 is used as the initial state to run the cable model again through the repeated process the model simulated variables are updated until they reach the convergence typically a few loops are needed until the model converges the schematic illustration of the applied processing steps in this study i e data integration procedure data assimilation and water storage estimations is provided in fig 2 3 2 model uncertainty two primary sources of error in the cable model outputs are the uncertainties in the meteorological forcing data and the model parameters the generation of ensemble sets is a critical step in ensemble based assimilation which mainly involves a determination of the perturbation type intervals and ensemble size the perturbation of meteorological forcing data is referred to kumar et al 2016 and tian et al 2017 the zero mean normally distributed additive perturbation with a standard deviation 1 σ of 50 w m2 are applied to the downward longwave lw radiation forcing and the lognormal multiplicative perturbations with a standard deviation of 30 are applied to the downward shortwave sw radiation fields we also assumed a multiplicative error in precipitation by taking univariate random samples between 0 2 20 to avoid negative rainfall for low or zero rainfall values other forcing data have little impact on the simulation results thus remain unchanged as far as model parameters are concerned a total of ten tws related parameters in each pixel are perturbed using the additive gaussian noise with a mean of zero and a standard deviation equal to 10 of the range of values that occurs over the ncp dumedah and walker 2014 in this study the model states are perturbed as a result of model propagation associated with the perturbed forcing data and model parameters therefore the correlation between soil and gws layers is mainly controlled by the land surface model the state variables are not perturbed directly as done in e g land information system because the accurate correlation between soil and gws layers are unknown table 2 summarizes the forcing and parameters perturbation of this study in this study 200 ensemble members are used determined based on a trial and error analysis to maintain the accuracy of model error covariance representation and computational efficiency 3 3 grace observation uncertainty the full error information of grace level 2 products is obtained from the institute of geodesy gravity field model for the period between 2002 and 2016 https www tugraz at institute ifg downloads gravity field models itsg grace2016 the monthly full error information of the stokes coefficients is used to compute an observation error covariance matrix for the grace tws fields to be used for data assimilation the detailed algorithm can refer to tangdamrongsub et al 2017 3 4 evaluation indices two indices are used to quantitatively assess the performances of satellite or model data products with ground based measurements spatially averaged at 0 5 pixel these include the pearson s correlation coefficient pr and root mean square error rmse shown as 1 pr i 1 n g i g p i p i 1 n g i g 2 p i p 2 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n g i p i 2 where n is the total number of data g is the ground based observations p is the satellite or model products and g and p are their average values the pr was adopted as a primary evaluation index to quantitatively assess the degree of correlation and rmse was used to further measure the deviation between simulated and assimilated results and observed values in each grid cell 3 5 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter enkf is a monte carlo implementation of the bayesian state update problem that improves the computation feasibility for high dimensional systems evensen 1994 in the enkf an ensemble of model states is integrated forward in time using the non linear forward model with replicates of system noise at update stages the error covariance is given by computing the variance of the differences between each ensemble value and the ensemble mean clark et al 2008 the enkf algorithm tailored to our problem is briefly explained let x denote a matrix composed of the model state vectors with the dimension of nm n where n m n represent the number of model state parameters model grid cells and ensemble members respectively in this study the parameter n is equal to 3 namely smtop smrz and gws anomalies 3 x x 1 x n where xi is an nm 1 vector of model variables for each ensemble the ensemble mean is calculated as 4 x 1 n i 1 n x i the anomaly of each ensemble is defined as x i x i x i and the matrix of the anomalies is given by 5 x x 1 x n then the variance covariance matrix pnm nm of the model state parameters can be estimated from the ensemble of the anomalies as follows 6 p 1 n 1 x x t finally the model state can be updated based on the initial state and the variance covariance matrix of the model and grace data through the kalman gain matrix 7 x i a x i k y i h x i where k stands for the kalman gain factor and h is a constant matrix used to transform the model states to observation space as follows 8 k p h t h p h t r 1 9 h 1 1 1 1 n 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 n 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 n m n m in eq 7 x i a nm n is the updated model states hereafter assimilated results yi denotes randomly perturbed grace observations with the dimension of m n rm m stands for the error variance covariance matrix of the grace observations cable tws long term mean computed between jan 2004 and dec 2009 is added to grace observed tws anomalies to reconcile the tws climatology between model and observation 4 comparisons of different precipitation products 4 1 influence on tws using different loops fig 3 shows the comparison of cable simulated tws anomalies using different precipitation products evaluated at different loops it is observed that tws variations show larger discrepancies between loop 1 and 3 when gldasv1 and persiann products used fig 3a and b respectively with the number of loops increases the differences among tws anomalies become smaller when the number of loops reaches 7 or larger all tws variations basically remain the same the final converged tws anomalies show typical seasonal variations between 2003 and 2015 for all cases of gldasv1 gldasv2 trmm and persiann products fig 3c however it is found that the amplitude of the seasonal changes is relatively smaller when the model is forced with persiann it is necessary to choose the appropriate precipitation data to be used for the rest of our analysis 4 2 evaluation of precipitation products in order to evaluate the accuracy of different precipitation products pr and rmse between in situ observations and four different precipitation data from gldasv1 gldasv2 trmm and persiann are computed fig 4 the detailed information about these rain gauge stations is introduced in table 3 it is found that trmm agrees better with in situ rainfall observations in most cases than the other three products with pr of 0 89 0 96 while persiann presents the lowest pr of 0 54 0 74 the correlation is 0 88 and 0 86 for gldasv1 and gldasv2 respectively fig 4a similarly wang et al 2016b found that although the bias correction of the gldasv2 precipitation data greatly improves temporal continuity it makes gldasv2 precipitation less correlated with observed precipitation than gldsav1 in china the rmse quantifies the overall difference between various precipitation data products and in situ observation fig 4b trmm product exhibits the least rmse 24 53 mm on average while gldasv1 gldasv2 and persiann have a rmse of 30 11 mm 36 46 mm and 46 31 mm respectively it indicates that trmm product has the smallest discrepancy with observed rainfall records than the other three data products spatially a rmse of trmm in the central part of ncp is 24 42 mm which is smaller than that in the southern and northern regions 25 96 mm and 26 22 mm respectively generally speaking trmm data match the in situ observations in the ncp presenting the largest pr and smallest rmse compared to other datasets therefore trmm data are selected as the representative precipitation forcing data over the ncp in this study 5 results and discussion 5 1 terrestrial water storage changes the basin averaged tws anomalies are calculated from grace for the ncp by averaging the results at each of the model grids lying within the spatial domain of the basin as shown in fig 5 due to the smoothing and post processing of grace observations tws anomalies from csr sh solution are attenuated tws variations from csr scaled are larger than csr sh solutions the average seasonal change increases by 65 over the period from 2003 to 2015 the tws anomalies show a prolonged declining trend with the rate between 7 72 1 14 mm yr csr sh and 12 30 1 83 mm yr csr scaled as shown in table 4 precisely speaking the tws anomalies from csr m solutions like other solutions exhibit a modest decrease from 2003 to 2012 followed by a sharply downward trend between 2013 and 2015 with the mean trend of 10 01 mm yr 2003 2012 and 53 69 mm yr 2013 2015 the exacerbated downtrend may be a mixture of precipitation decrease and intensive groundwater abstraction in recent years gong et al 2018 the grace measurement errors in monthly tws anomalies from csr scaled for example is about 1 5 cm as shown in the shadow area fig 5 in general csr m solutions agree better with csr scaled solutions than csr sh some studies also demonstrated that csr m solutions provide tws estimates comparable to traditional spherical harmonic solutions without any post processing applied luthcke et al 2008 scanlon et al 2016 therefore the csr m solutions are selected to describe the characteristics of tws variations in the following discussions 5 2 impact of data assimilation the monthly averaged tws anomalies and individual storage components in the ncp are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that assimilated tws anomalies are between simulated open loop results and grace observations there is a considerable difference between the cable model and the grace data during the second half of the time series where the grace observations decrease sharply while the cable results do not fig 6a the reason is likely due to the fact that the anthropogenic factor like increased agricultural irrigation is not considered in the cable model pan et al 2017 overall the data assimilation improves the long term trends of the tws anomalies from 3 11 1 31 mm yr to 6 15 1 32 mm yr making the tws results consistent with grace observations grace da could result in a spurious update of model state flux estimate particularly when the redistribution of the update is limited by some boundary condition of the model however the behavior is not observed in this study it is likely that the groundwater dynamics and size of groundwater store of cable is larger than other lsms e g clsm girotto et al 2017 li et al 2019 and noah mp nie et al 2019 as such most grace da update are distributed to the groundwater layer consequently the near surface and root zone soil moisture receives only a small update which explains the insignificant change in other fluxes such as evapotranspiration the tws anomalies in the ncp are divided into three main components of top soil moisture smtop root zone soil moisture smrz and groundwater storage gws their model simulation and grace data assimilation results are shown in fig 6b the data assimilation has the largest influence on gws that is the most uncertain storage component in hydrological modeling especially in recent years 2013 2015 the trends increase from 1 66 0 40 mm yr to 4 45 0 62 mm yr table 5 the trend observed in gws estimates is smaller than previous studies pan et al 2017 gong et al 2018 due to the unavailability of a groundwater consumption routine in the cable it is also noted that the groundwater parameters of the cable model are not calibrated in the ncp this results in a small dynamic range of gws estimates leading to an underestimated trend as also found in tangdamrongsub et al 2018b the seasonal variation of smtop is much smaller than others the smrz anomalies show the largest seasonal fluctuation and little trend it is estimated that gws anomalies contribute 70 of the tws long term trend and smrz accounts for 86 of the tws annual change the groundwater is responsible for the interannual variation observed in grace tws data while the root zone soil moisture derives mainly the seasonal change in the measured tws data over the ncp 5 3 spatial patterns of the interannual variation fig 7 compares the spatial patterns of the long term trends in the annual trmm precipitation tws and gws anomalies from 2003 to 2015 grace observations detect 10 20 mm yr of tws decrease in the southwestern part of the ncp the conjunction area of henan and hebei province shown in fig 7a it is reported that the annual average groundwater consumption is largest in hebei 15 64 km3 and henan provinces 2 54 km3 among eight provinces within the ncp during the period from 2003 to 2012 wrpb 2012 in recent years intensive agricultural irrigation and warming climate cause great pressure on water resources resulting in groundwater over abstraction e g anyang zhang et al 2019 and even land subsidence e g guo et al 2015 however the spatial patterns of the cable simulated tws and gws anomalies show decreasing trends in the southern part of the ncp inside shandong province as shown in fig 7b the trmm precipitation used to drive the cable model implies less annual rainfall in the southern part which is consistent with the patterns of the model tws and gws anomalies fig 7b d the inefficacy of the cable model is primarily due to the uncertainties associated with the trmm forcing data in addition to the lack of groundwater consumption modeling fig 7e and f demonstrate that how the grace data assimilation improves the cable model results of water storage computation reconciling the spatial patterns of tws and gws trends with the grace observations over the ncp 5 4 spatial patterns of the seasonal variation the grace observations also show the largest annual changes of tws anomalies in the southwestern part of the ncp as shown in fig 8 a however the spatial pattern of the simulated tws presents the dominant annual change in the southeastern part the model indicates that large seasonal precipitation induced by the wet climate in the southeastern part mainly influences the greater tws variation fig 8d in the seasonal time scale the simulated smrz exhibits a similar spatial pattern as tws anomalies as it contributes to 86 of the annual amplitude fig 8b c with small contribution from the groundwater storage the grace data assimilation tends to reduce the overestimated annual tws in the southeastern part and leads to more consistent spatial patterns with the grace observations fig 8e and f however there still exists a sensible difference between fig 8 a and e possibly due possibly to the inefficacy of the model error covariance information computed with a finite set of the model runs ensemble the effect of precipitation error might be underestimated 5 5 validation of gws anomalies against in situ level data the time series of the modeled and assimilated gws anomalies against in situ groundwater level data are presented in fig 9 the model gws variation does not agree with the relative changes found in most of in situ level observations the gws time series after the grace data assimilation are significantly improved in comparison to the measured groundwater level in the ncp the assimilated results are also capable of capturing significant groundwater depletion between 2005 and 2015 in most cases the negative gws trend is mainly induced by the excessive demand of groundwater required for agriculture during the 2003 2009 rainfall deficiency period with the average annual groundwater withdrawal of 25 gigatonnes 2 5 1010 m3 feng et al 2013 li et al 2013 apparently a missing groundwater consumption component in the cable model leads to the failure of groundwater storage change computation table 6 quantifies the comparison between the simulated assimilated gws anomalies and in situ observations at various locations in terms of pr and rmse the statistical significance test for the correlation is conducted based on the two tailed t test for rmse computation two time series are normalized to 11 the simulated gws is in general negatively correlated with the observations in some areas e g pixels of g69 g70 and g102 the grace data assimilation leads to increase in pr and decrease in rmse indicating the improved gws computation after assimilation nearly in all cases the higher correlations are seen in all pixels on average from 0 12 before assimilation to 0 54 after assimilation the best case of assimilation occurs in g70 with the pr increasing from 0 59 to 0 64 at the 95 confidence level the assimilated results show higher correlation with in situ level in southern parts than that in northern parts with the correlation of 0 66 and 0 41 respectively overall the results indicate the da process increases the correlation coefficients between gws estimates and the in situ measurements by 0 42 on average and reduces the rmse by 31 22 on average the bold numbers in table 6 denote the improvements in pr and rmse by da are statistically significant at a 95 confidence level see also tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary material the least agreement between the assimilated results and groundwater level is found near bohai gulf the possible reasons may include the larger grace errors in the area close to ocean the fewer number of continuous observation wells and the limitation of cable model i e the boundary condition to simulate gws near coastal regions 6 conclusion the grace satellite mission has for the first time provided measurements of the integrated tws changes averaged over hundreds of km the separate estimates of gws are not readily available from grace data alone in areas with severe groundwater depletion including the north china plain the accurate knowledge about spatial and temporal variations of tws and its sub components like gws is critical we demonstrate that the grace data assimilation with a land surface model like cable is a viable approach to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of different water storage components in the ncp by reducing the uncertainty of the cable model computation primarily propagated from the uncertainty in the precipitation forcing data four precipitation datasets including gldasv1 gldasv2 trmm and persiann are validated against with the rain gauge measurements at different stations it is found that the trmm data match with the in situ rainfall observations better than others in the ncp yielding the largest pr and smallest rmse thus trmm was chosen as the representative precipitation forcing data for the cable modeling and the subsequent analysis with grace data the enkf is used to statistically combine the model outputs and grace tws data a number of interesting aspects on precipitation and water storage computation in the ncp are identified from the grace data assimilation 1 the model is not able to compute the prolonged decrease and accelerated during the last several years in the water storage change around the southwestern region of the ncp due to the shortage of in situ measurements the human activity such as ground water depletion is not considered in the cable model which may yield a large uncertainty in water storage computation over that region 2 the model incorrectly characterizes the spatial patterns of interannual and annual changes of tws mainly caused by errors in the trmm precipitation data 3 the interannual tws change observed by grace is an indicative of gws while the observed seasonal variation is primarily that of root zone soil moisture 4 the grace data assimilation is most effective in gws computation that is gws is the least accurately calculated in land surface models 5 the soil moisture computation is less affected by the grace data assimilation as also seen from other regions tian et al 2019 tangdamrongsub et al 2020 the grace data assimilation results of gws are validated using numerous in situ groundwater level data the simulated gws anomalies fail to capture dynamic changes of in situ groundwater level and even show a negative correlation in some areas consistent improvement in gws computation by grace data assimilation can be seen from nearly all test sites which is shown with increased cross correlation and decreased rms difference for example in g70 the pr increases from 0 59 to 0 64 in order to ease the water crisis over northern china the south to north water diversion snwd project was implemented since 2003 especially the middle route of the snwd project was officially opened on december 2014 which runs from danjiangkou reservoir in hubei province to beijing tianjin and hebei provinces with the main conveyance canal length of 1277 km zou et al 2016 grace da scheme has proven to interact closely with groundwater improvement and perform well in such a condition moreover grace da can strengthen the value of grace observations by enabling spatial downscaling and vertical decomposition into individually storage components which are more useful for those who focus on the ncp groundwater issues therefore this study may be applied to quantify the effect of snwd water supply to this

5203,this study assesses the predictive capability of the high resolution national centre for medium range weather and forecasting ncmrwf regional unified model ncum r for pre and post genesis characteristics associated with a tc we have selected an extremely severe cyclonic storm escs fani which formed over bay of bengal bob during 26 april 04 may 2019 for the study to examine the pre genesis of the storm we used the model analyses and forecasts of ncum r three days prior to the genesis i e 26th april 2019 of the tc the results clearly show the establishment of a moisture conveyor belt mcb during the pre genesis period which connects the tc inner core with underlying oceanic region the mcb plays an important role in the transport of large amounts of moisture towards the storm inner core from the oceanic regions and subsequently for the release of latent heat in the vicinity of the storm resulting the intensification of tc these processes were clearly predicted by the ncum r model during the pre genesis period the study also examined role of various dynamic and thermodynamic variables intensity track and its errors and various indexes at different stages of tc the evolution of intensity based on mean sea level pressure mslp and 10 m maximum sustainable wind msw clearly shows the rapid intensification and dissipation of the storm in ncum r simulations the pattern is reasonably well matched with the observations the area averaged thermodynamical variables around the eyewall of the storm in the forecast based on different initial conditions ics are well simulated by the model and the pattern is well matched with the era5 reanalyses the model predicted track from different ics are reasonably well matched with the observed track the large scale environmental flow plays a vital role in the recurvature of the tc the study clearly suggested that the ncum r model is able to predict the intensity movement and structure of the storm during pre and post genesis period however the model results show intense storm during early stage as compared to observation keywords ncum r model tropical cyclone cyclone fani moisture conveyor belt era5 reanalyses 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs over north indian ocean nio such as bay of bengal bob and arabian sea are one of the most violent weather systems as compared to other basins the nio region contributes 5 of total global tcs i e four tcs per year singh 2010 they produced most damaging natural hazards due to high surface winds heavy rainfall storm surge etc along the coast of littoral countries like india bangladesh sri lanka myanmar etc besides the natural hazards the tcs can have significant impact on human life and also their socio economic aspects fraedrich and leslie 1989 in nio basin the frequency and landfall of tcs are considerably higher in bob than the arabian sea the tcs formed over this region are characterized by quick growth and short life span than other oceanic basin therefore government authorities do not get sufficient time for disaster preparedness and mitigation it is very important for weather forecaster to improve the forecast skills with respect to the movement and intensity of tcs over these regions so that effective mitigation is possible there is no doubt that the track forecasting is considerably improved over the years due to improved observational coverage and advancement of numerical weather prediction nwp models and data assimilation system in recent years however the improvement of intensity forecast is comparatively less than the improvement of track forecast cangialosi and franklin 2013 mohapatra et al 2013a b in last couple of decades all operational weather forecasting agencies in world are largely depend on nwp models to provide advanced information of intensity and track of tcs by replacing their statistical models and synoptic methods mohanty and gupta 1997 gupta 2006 chen et al 2013 mohapatra et al 2013a b lei et al 2016 routray et al 2019 however the high resolution regional models are significantly enhanced their forecast skill for prediction of track and intensity of the tcs the reason is that proper representation of inner core structure storm size increase of vertical and horizontal resolution of the model resolve mesoscale dynamics advanced data assimilation techniques assimilation of high quality dense observations etc davis et al 2008 rao et al 2009 osuri et al 2013 2015 tien et al 2013 gopalakrishnan et al 2012 routray et al 2016 a comparative study was carried out by routray et al 2017 to evaluate the performance of national centre for medium range weather and forecasting ncmrwf regional unified model ncum r adapted from unified model of uk met office over the operational global ncum ncum g model with horizontal resolution 12 and 25 km respectively considering four land falling tcs over bob the study delineates that the ncum r is more skillful for simulation of track intensity of tcs than ncum g many recent studies demonstrated that the high resolution version of uk met office unified model um has capable to correctly represent the meso convective cells and time of initiations associated with the synoptic weather systems lean et al 2008 o hara and webster 2012 orr et al 2014 dutta et al 2019a rajasree et al 2016 studied the genesis of sequence of tcs through the marsupial paradigm using high resolution analysis obtained from wrf three dimensional variational data assimilation 3dvar modeling system the studies suggested that the genesis of tcs over nio region follows the concepts of marsupial theory the high resolution 4 4 km regional ncum r with 4dvar analysis system is operationally running at ncmrwf davies et al 2005 dutta et al 2019b the prime objective of the study is to analyze the predictive capability of the ncum r for pre and post genesis characteristics associated with the tc for this purpose we considered an extremely severe cyclonic storm escs fani formed over bob during 26 april 04 may 2019 as a case study the synoptic conditions associated with the escs fani are provided in the following section section 3 presents a brief description of the high resolution ncum r model and 4dvar analysis system the details of the numerical experiment as well as methodology are described in the section 4 while the simulation results during the pre and post genesis of the tc are discussed in section 5 finally the conclusions of the present study are provided in section 6 2 synoptic conditions associated with escs fani a well marked low pressure wml area formed over eastern part of equatorial indian ocean eio around equator lat 2 70n and long 88 70e and adjoining southeast bob in the morning 08 30 ist of 25th april 2019 during 26th to early morning of 27th april the wml concentrated from depression d to a deep depression dd over the eio region the system further intensified into a cyclonic storm cs named as fani around1130 ist of 27th april over southeast part of bob and adjoining east eio the storm moved north northwestward direction the storm maintained the cs stage upto the evening of 29th april and intensified into a severe cyclonic storm scs over central parts of south bob during 30th april early morning to evening the system further intensified from very severe cyclonic storm vscs to escs laid over west central and adjoining southwest bob and moved west northwestward direction the rapid intensification of the storm during afternoon of 29th to evening of 30th april over the westcentral parts of the bob due to higher oceanic heat and sudden increase of maximum sustained wind msw from 48 kts to 95 kts the storm started recurving north northeastwards from 1st may early morning 0530 ist it reached the peak intensity during 2nd 1430 ist to 3rd may 0230 ist with maximum sustained wind msw speed of 115 kts gusting 200 to 230 kmph and lowest estimated central pressure 932 hpa it crossed the odisha coast close to puri lat 19 750n and long 85 70e as an escs between 0800 and 1000 ist of 3rd may with msw 110 kts 175 to 185 kmph gusting 205 kmph and continuously moved north northeastwards across the odisha coast and west bengal upto northeastern states with varying intensities this clockwise recurving track of the storm was mainly due to the presence of the anticyclonic circulation in middle and upper tropospheric levels in the northeast of the system centre the system gradually started weakens into vscs over coastal odisha around noon 1130 ist close to east of bhubaneswar around 1430 ist near to cuttack and scs stage over north coastal odisha west of balasore at night 2030 h ist of 3rd may it further weakened to cs in the early morning of 4th may laid over western parts of gangetic west bengal and moved northeastwards became wml over northeastern states of india on morning of 5th may the genesis of the tc near equator is very rare and such type of disturbance was earlier observed nio region during january 2005 the escs fani is one of the most intense storm crossed the odisha coast during pre monsoon season since 1982 the last escs i e 31st may to 05th june 1982 was developed over southeast bob near andaman sea and crossed the odisha coast between paradip and chandbali in the midnight of 3rd june 1982 with msw 80 kts fig 1 a shows the track of storms crossing odisha coast during pre monsoon seasons for the period of 1891 2018 source of data international best track archive for climate stewardship ibtracs the 12 h averaged intensity calculated based on msw kts of tc fani is around 62 kts which is higher than the averaged intensity of individual storms occurred during the period 1891 2018 table 1 also fani has one of the longest track with 3030 km length as reported by imd fig 1b and also an extremely intense cyclone over bob during pre monsoon season which crossed the odisha coast table 1 the heavy to very heavy rainfall were reported associated with the escs fani over coastal odisha and gangetic west bengal adjoining areas of bangladesh and northeastern states of assam meghalaya and arunachal pradesh during 3rd to 5th may 2019 the salient features associated with escs fani can be found from imd rsmc 2019 report 3 modeling system 3 1 ncum r model configuration the high resolution ncum r model is running operationally at ncmrwf the uniqueness of the ncum nwp system is that it follows the seamless modeling approach and can be used for a broad range of spatial and temporal scales with same even newer dynamics for general atmospheric modeling of the environment endgame dynamical core the ncum model is non hydrostatic terrain following hybrid height vertical coordinate with rotated latitude longitude horizontal grid with arakawa c grid staggering for horizontal and a semi implicit semi lagrangian predictor corrector numerical scheme used to solve the deep atmosphere dynamics cullen et al 1997 davies et al 2005

microphysics based on wilson and ballard 1999 etc the fully explicit treatment of convection is used in ncum r modeling system the main ncum variables are three components of wind potential temperature exner pressure density and moisture components i e vapour cloud water and cloud ice the details about the regional model of ncum can be found in routray et al 2017 and dutta et al 2019b 3 2 4dvar analysis system the 4dvar data assimilation da system is an incremental four dimensional scheme rawlins et al 2007 with a single outer loop of a non linear model which provides linearization states and background fields for the assimilation of various atmospheric observations the previous 6 h forecast is considered as background state to calculate the increments the linear perturbation forecast pf model with a lower horizontal resolution 08 km lower resolution than the resolution of forecast model is used in the 4dvar da system to produce time varying increments over the assimilation window ballard et al 2016 the 4dvar system is to find the perturbation δw by minimizing the penalty function of background observation and weak constraint terms the cost function is defined in eq 1 as follows 1 j δ w 1 2 δ w δ w b t b 1 δ w δ w b 1 2 i 1 n y y o t e f 1 y y o j c where δw is the analysis increment xb is the background model state y is observation vector b is the background error covariance e and f are the covariances of the observation error such as instrumental and representativity errors respectively h is non linear observation operator that transfer the model variables to the observation space y hx the weak constraint term jc is included in eq 1 the more detailed about the 4dvar da system can be found from rawlins et al 2007 li et al 2018 the complete flow chart of the 4dvar da of the ncum r forecast system is given in fig 1c 4 numerical experiment and methodology the high resolution horizontal resolution 4 4 km with 80 vertical levels ncum r version um10 8 forecast model with 4dvar analysis system is operationally running at ncmrf twice daily at 00 and 12 utc and provide real time numerical forecast upto 76 h the regional domain is fixed between 62 1070e and 60s 420n 1200 1200 points fig 1d the boundary conditions for the ncum r system are provided by interpolating ncum global model forecasts for regional model domain the initial conditions are provided to the regional model from the 4dvar analysis system the boundary conditions are updated 3hrly interval and model integration time step is 120 s for ncum r the operational ncum r model outputs are considered in this study to analyze the different characteristics associated during the life span of the escs fani the ncum r model configuration along with different physical parameterization schemes used in the operational setup is summarized in table 2 the ncum r model predictions are evaluated by evaluating various dynamical and thermodynamical parameters at differ stages of the tc along with the standard verification metrics like direct position error dpe cross track ct along track at etc routray et al 2016 2017 osuri et al 2013 these errors are calculated with respect to the imd estimated best track data the spatial distribution of wind fields equivalent potential temperature at 850 hpa vertically integrated moisture transport vimt kg m 1 s 1 integrated upto 300 hpa latent heat flux lhf and potential vorticity pvu 1 pvu is 10 6 k m2 kg 1 s 1 on 320 k isentropic surface from model analyses and simulations are compared with the high resolution european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era5 data sets the horizontal grid resolution of era5 is about 30 km with 137 pressure levels from the surface upto 80 km height 0 01 hpa the details about the era5 can be found from the technical document prepared by karl hennermann and paul berrisford https confluence ecmwf int display ckb era5 data documentation the time series of vimt vimc genesis potential parameter gpp lhf etc from model simulations are analyzed at different stages of the tc which are also verified with the era5 reanalyses data the ertel potential vorticity hereafter pv on the 320 k isentropic surface gives a very useful dynamical framework for understanding the tc intensification by interacting with the upper tropospheric vorticity the pv has quasi conservation properties by using the potential temperature instead of the using of temperature specific humidity the pv can be describes as a ratio of the absolute vorticity of the air parcel to the depth of the vortex holton and hakim 2012 the pv is conserved in adiabatic and frictionless flow and further it act like a tracer on the flow the power dissipative index pdi emanuel 2005 2007 and accumulated cyclone energy ace bell et al 2000 camargo and sobel 2005 klotzbach 2006 indexes are computed by considering the lifetime of storms and the msw the pdi is computed using the msw cubed at any given time in a storm whereas the ace is sum of the squares of 06 h msw over the period the indexes are calculated for the periods when the wind speed was more than 34 knots i e cs stage although the indices pdi and ace seem to appear similar in their structure klotzbach 2006 however both the indices are different in their physical representation the ace is proportional to the kinetic energy generated by the tcs as well as pdi is generally correspondent to the monetary damage thus both the energy indices have their importance and dependency on msw and duration of the cyclones the concept of the storm relative helicity srh mainly used for the prediction of tornado supercells which evolve with large value of helicity and sustain for long lifetimes numerous studies have verified that the high values of srh in the surrounding area of tornadic supercells associated with tropical cyclones hurricanes mccaul 1987 bogner et al 2000 heymsfield et al 2001 molinari and vollaro 2008 etc bogner et al 2000 and molinari and vollaro 2008 examined the spatial variation of srh in the vicinity of the eyewall of the tropical cyclones hurricanes through the dropsonde observation datasets in the present study we calculated the srh at the lowest 01 km and 03 km layers above ground level which can provides the nature of strong convection associated with the tc the presence of the high values of srh helped the storm to maintain its intensity and effectively resist dissipation the srh at different layers gives a measure of the potential for cyclonic updraft rotation in right moving supercells generally it is noticed that high values of srh are found in the 0 3 km layer rather than the 0 1 km however there is no clear threshold value fixed for the srh the area 2 2 around the centre of tc and time upto 72 h forecasts averaged model simulated srh at 0 1 km and 0 3 km from different ics based runs are calculated the results are also verified with the srh obtained from era5 during the same period in addition the potential instability pi is computed as the difference between the equivalent potential temperature at 500 hpa and 850 hpa the low value of pi corresponds to the higher thermal instability unstable of atmosphere the higher thermal instability in the mid troposphere plays a crucial role to formation and intensification of the cyclone the genesis potential parameter gpp is used to track the tcs genesis intensification and movement kotal et al 2009 kotal and bhattacharya 2013 goswami et al 2015 the gpp is calculated by considering two dynamic and two thermodynamic variables such as wind shear s 850 to 200 hpa relative vorticity v at 850 hpa relative humidity rh mean of 700 to 500 hpa and temperature difference between 850 and 500 hpa the formulation of gpp is given in eq 2 as below 2 gpp v r h t 850 t 500 s the gpp with higher values indicates the high potential zone for intensification of developing systems at the early stages of development 5 results and discussion 5 1 predictability of pre genesis of tc fani this section discusses whether the ncum r model is able to predict pre genesis of the tc three days prior to the genesis for this purpose analyses and three days model forecasts from different initial conditions ics such as 00 utc of 23 to 25 april 2019 are considered as per imd report rsmc 2019 the storm originated from a wml pressure area formed over east equatorial indian ocean eio and adjoining southeast bob on 25th april 2019 the storm further concentrated into a depression over the same region during early morning of 26th april 2019 under favorable environmental conditions the ncum r model analyses and forecasts are verified against the era5 reanalyses the model initial time analysis and upto day 3 forecasts of wind vectors and magnitude m s at 850 hpa are shown in fig 2 from different ics runs the model analyses and simulated wind fields at 850 hpa are verified against the era5 reanalyses during the period 23rd to 28th april 2019 depicted in fig 3 a f respectively from fig 2 the cyclonic wind flow at 850 hpa is noticed in all analyses and forecasts during the period 23rd to 28th april the features are reasonably well correlated with the corresponding era5 reanalyses the ncum r analysis fig 2a shows a feeble cyclonic circulation over eio and southeast bob with wind magnitude 16 20 m s the pattern and magnitude of wind are similar to the era5 reanalysis fig 3a the strong wind flow is found in the both the analyses figs 2a and 3a over the southwest sector of the low pressure system from ic 23rdapril the day 1 forecast fig 2b valid at 00 utc 24th april clearly shows an elongated cyclonic circulation with strong wind 12 16 m s over southwest sector of the storm the magnitude and structure of wind pattern is reasonably well matched with the era5 reanalysis fig 3b in general the southwest sw sector of the storm gets high winds during the pre genesis period as compared to other sectors northeast ne northwest nw and southeast se and gradually the magnitude of wind of sw sector will be smaller than the other sectors with the enhancement of intensity of the storm chan and kwok 1999 the strongest winds are located in the eyewall and the right front quadrant of the fully developed storm in day 2 forecast fig 2c valid at 00 utc 25th april it is clearly showing that the system further developed by increasing the right front quadrant ne and nw sector of wind magnitude over a large area as compared to the day 1 forecast fig 2b the cyclonic circulation is more prominent in day 3 forecast fig 2d valid at 00 utc 26th april as compared to other forecasts the day 2 and day 3 forecasts are well comparable with the corresponding era5 reanalyses fig 3c and d however the winds are more confined around the system in the era5 reanalysis fig 3d than the day 3 forecast the model analysis valid at 24th april 2019 fig 2e is showing a well defined cyclonic circulation with magnitude of wind 8 12 m s over se sector the features are well correlated with the era5 reanalysis fig 3b the model simulated wind fields are shown that the cyclonic circulation is more prominent as the forecast lengths increased fig 2f h the pattern is reasonably well matched with the era5 reanalyses however the magnitude of wind surrounding the system are stronger in the era5 reanalyses fig 3c e as compared to the corresponding model forecasts fig 2f h similarly a well organized cyclonic circulation with wind magnitude 16 20 m s over se and ne sectors of the system is represented in the model analysis valid at 25th april fig 2i which is well matched with the era5 reanalysis fig 3c the intensity of the storm gradually increased with the increase of forecast lengths fig 2j l and matched well with the corresponding era5 reanalyses fig 3d f however the day 3 forecast fig 2l is showing more intense cyclonic storm with strong magnitude of wind around 4 to 6 m s than the era5 reanalysis fig 3f as per imd report rsmc 2019 the storm gradually intensified from d to cs stages during the period 26th to 28th april 2019 the maximum sustained surface winds msw are 13 m s 16 m s and 23 m s estimated by the imd respectively during the period the model simulated msw 16 m s 18 m s and 24 m s are reasonably well matched with the observations respectively whereas the era5 reanalyses during the period are underestimated the msw 12 m s 13 m s and 12 m s the averaged 3 days absolute error ae of msw is 2 m s and 5 m s is seen in the forecast 72 forecast based on ic 25th april and era5 reanalyses respectively the era5 reanalysis is not able to capture the intensity of the storm may be due to its low spatial resolution 30 km the model analyses fig 2a e and i are clearly showed the evolution of the storm the day 1 forecasts fig 2b f and j from various ics 23rd to 25th april are also depicted the development of the storm and similar features are seen in other model forecasts it is worth to mention that the ncum r model is able to predict the pre genesis of the storm three days in advance fig 4 is similar to fig 2 but for the spatial distribution of vertically integrated moisture transport vimt vectors and its magnitude shaded kg m 1 s 1 the vimt from model analyses and forecasts are compared with the era5 reanalyses fig 3g l for the period 23rd to 28th april 2019 the moisture transport and its convergence mostly affect the latent heat distribution in the tc system it is well known that the latent heating is playing a major role in the development and intensity of the tc hill and lackmann 2009 huang et al 2014 fujiwara et al 2017 makarieva et al 2017 in era5 on 23rd april at 00 utc fig 3g the moist westerly flows around the indian ocean is clearly seen in the early stage of the tc system as the day progress fig 3h and i the eastward transport of moisture are gradually increased over indian ocean and southeast of bob region the eastward moisture is consistently churning around the storm over the regions hence the increased moisture associated with the system resulting in the forming of a moisture conveyor belt mcb over the region a wml system was developed at 00 utc 25 april reported by imd the wml system is prominently seen in the fig 3i the storm is intensified from d to cs during the period 26 to 28 april fig 3j k and l respectively and moved further northwestward over the southeast bob and adjoining east eio region even though the storm moved northwestward over the region the mcb is still retained more than 550 kg m 1 s 1 magnitude of moisture fluxes this suggests that a large scale transport of moisture into the inner region of the cyclonic system from the ocean through mcb and further enhanced the intensity of the tc fujiwara et al 2017 kudo et al 2014 takakura et al 2018 the steady progress of the storm is clearly represented in all the model analyses fig 4a e and i the magnitude of vimt and pattern of mcb over indian ocean is considerably well matched with the era5 reanalyses fig 3g h and i the model forecasts from different ics are successfully reproduced the aforesaid features seen in the era5 reanalyses the day 1 forecasts fig 4b f and j from various ics are clearly depicted the development of the storm with increase of the magnitude of the vimt around the storm similar structure and progress of the storm are also seen in other forecasts day 2 and day 3 from different ics which are also well correlated with the respective era5 reanalyses the time evolution of mcb is reasonably well predicted by the model it is notable that the similar features of moisture transport are also simulated through regional atmospheric models by hegde et al 2016 and fujiwara et al 2017 over indian ocean and south china sea the development of mcb plays an active role to import moisture into the inner core of the system from the remote oceans increased the latent heating which leads to intensification of the storm the continuous intensification of the storm results in further development of mcb in day 3 forecast valid at 00 utc 28th april based on ics 25th april run fig 4l the magnitude of vimt more than 650 kg m 1 s 1 surrounding and inner region of the tc is higher than the era5 reanalyses fig 3l the storm was observed as cs stage by the imd during the period the high resolution ncum r model is able to predict the time evolution of the large scale vapour transport over oceanic region during early stage of the tc system fig 5 a l is similar to fig 2 a l but for the spatial distribution of surface turbulent latent heat flux lhf w m 2 overlap with 850 hpa moisture flux when the mcb is well organized from the indian ocean to the inner region of the storm it is clearly seen in fig 5 that the surface evaporation from the underlying ocean is intensified over the indian ocean the value of lhfs exceed to 150 w m 2 over these region the spatial patterns of the lhfs are well correlated with the distributions of vimt in the fig 4 these features suggested that the air parcels through mcb may be considerably modified by the moisture supplied over the oceanic region it is well known that the lhf plays crucial roles in genesis and intensification of the tc the significant role of lhf is that first occurs in the outer region during early developing stage of the tc and gradually intrudes into the inner region chen et al 2014 gao et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the similar features are predicted by the model and also in the analyses as the days increase the lhf is slowly encroached the inner region of the tc the genesis of the tc was observed on 26th april by imd the day 3 fig 5d day 2 fig 5g and day 1 fig 5j forecasts valid at 00 utc 26th april 2019 from the model ics 23rd to 25th respectively are well predicted the genesis of the tc and the lhfs are more concentrated around the inner core of the storm however the magnitude of the lhfs is higher about 50 70 w m 2 in the fig 5j day 1 as compared to other forecasts fig 5d and g the day 2 forecast fig 5g is showing the feeble cyclonic circulation with low intensity lhfs around the inner region it is also manifested that the model predicted lhfs are increased markedly after the genesis of the tc indeed the features of the co evolution of the moisture fluxes and lhfs travelled over the underlying ocean are quite similar fig 6 is same as fig 2 but for the spatial distribution of ertel potential vorticity hereafter pv on the 320 k isentropic surface the pv from model analyses and forecasts are compared with the era5 reanalyses fig 3m r for the period 23rd to 28th april 2019 these reanalyses are revealed that the gradual increase of intensity of the pv around inner region of the tc from early stage to developed stage the distribution of high pv exceeding 3 0 pvu 1 pvu 10 6 k m2 kg 1 s 1 inner region of the storm is clearly predicted by the model in the same time the low pv is noticed around the southwest part of the cyclonic disturbance this dynamical variation emerged to cause the establishment of a strong transport of moisture fluxes fig 4 from underlying ocean into the vicinity of inner core of the storm the high pv zone aggravated the cyclonic flow the reanalyses showed conspicuous band shaped pv around the storm the value of pv increases with lead time similar structure of pv also predicted around the tc by the model in all days the predicted values of pv gradually increased and swirling around the tc with the increase of forecast lengths it is clearly suggested that the storm retains the intensity and structure from one stage to another stage the above discussions clearly suggested that the high resolution ncum r model is capable to predict the pre genesis genesis of the storm three days before we further discuss the predictability of the storm fani by the ncum r modeling system in the following section 5 2 prediction of tc fani this section dealt the prediction of the tc based on dynamic thermodynamic parameters intensity track and its errors and various indexes the model simulated results are verified with the era5 reanalyses 5 2 1 equivalent potential temperature and moisture flux the equivalent potential temperature θe within the boundary layer plays a crucial role for triggering and maintaining the convection around the eyewall of the tc as well as spiral rainbands by which the conversion of kinematic energy is accomplished emanuel 1986 hogsett and zhang 2009 the low level θe k and vertically integrated moisture flux upto 850 hpa streamline kg m 1 s 1 from model analyses and forecasts upto day 3 at different stages of tc dd cs vscs escs and 24 h before landfall are illustrated in fig 7 a d e h i l m p and q t respectively the model analyses and forecasts are verified against the era5 reanalyses during the period 27th and 29th april to 05 may 2019 in reanalysis fig 8 a the low value of θe 340 k is noticed over the eio region in the early stage of tc along with weak flow of moisture flux however the model analysis fig 7a has shown similar pattern over the same region with a little higher value of θe 343 k a systematic increase and spreading of θe and spiraling of moisture flux are clearly indicated during day 1 to day 3 forecasts fig 7b d it is worth to mention that the model analysis and forecasts based on ic27 is reasonably well represented the evolution of intensity from dd to vscs stage of the tc fig 7i the spatial pattern of θe and moisture flux in the forecast is reasonably well matched with era5 reanalyses fig 8a c over the period but the magnitude of θe from the model is higher by 6 9 k than the era5 the run based on ic29 fig 7ii storm intensified dd to cs stage the magnitude of the analyzed θe and inward transport of moisture flux fig 7e is increased around the storm as compared to the previous day analyses from day 1 to day 3 forecasts fig 7f h it is noticed that the values of θe increase inward rapidly in the eyewall region and also seen the organized moisture flux convergence around the storm it is a clear indication of large scale inflow of moist air continually which is acquiring energy from the underlying ocean towards the inner region of the cyclonic system therefore the system further enhanced the intensity from vscs to escs stage the era5 reanalyses are also clearly shows the monotonically increase of θe over the region during the period similarly with a prominent inward increase of θe and transport of moisture flux in close proximity to the storm s eyewall is seen in the analysis and forecasts from the ic30 based model runs fig 7iii vscs stage these images clearly differentiate the intensification and northwestward movement of the tc during 30th april to 03rd may 2019 fig 7i l the increase of θe plays an important role for intensification of the storm malkus and riehl 1960 emanuel 1986 therefore one can certainly expect that sudden increase of eyewall updraft condense more water and consequently supply larger amounts of latent heating eastin et al 2005 also found that the meso vortices embedded with the tc transferred high amount of θe in the eye into the eyewall enhanced more buoyant updraft as per imd report the tc was landfall at puri odisha coast on 3rd may 2019 early morning with maximum wind speed 100 kts and gradually weakened when moved northeastward from the model runs based on ic01 fig 7iv escs stage the analysis fig 7m is showing well organized and high amount of θe as compared to the previous days of analyses the value of θe is progressively increased around the storm 346 to 355 k from analysis to day 2 forecast fig 7m o thereafter from day 2 03rd may 2019 the model is simulated low values of θe 346 k and inward moisture flux around the storm s eyewall i e the tendency to dissipate of the tc from fig 7v run based on ic02 i e 24 h before landfall of tc the high magnitude of θe 352 k and strong convergence of moisture flux around the eyewall of the storm is noticed in the model initial time that time the tc was escs stage as per imd report the value of θe is significantly reduced to 343 k in day 1 forecast while the cyclone touched the odisha coast the decreasing tendency of θe and transport of moisture flux is also simulated by the model in subsequent forecasts similar tendency also noticed in the era5 reanalyses fig 8 during the period from the fig 7 it can be clearly inferred that the model is reasonably well predicted the various stages of the tc in analyses and forecasts the pattern and spatial distribution of model analyses and simulated θe is reasonably well matched with the era5 reanalyses fig 8 however the magnitude of θe and strength of moisture flux transport around the storm are higher in the model analyses and forecasts as compared to the era5 reanalyses this discrepancy is due to the high resolution model analyses and forecasts 04 km in contrast to the era5 reanalyses 30 km resolution 5 2 2 prediction of intensity fig 9 a e shows the evolution of intensity 06 h intervals in terms of mslp hpa and msw kts from various model runs based on the different stages of tc such as dd ic27 cs ic29 vscs ic30 escs ic01 and 24hr before landfall ic02 respectively along with imd best estimated msw data the root mean square error rmse of mslp and msw from initial hour to 72 h forecasts is depicted in fig 9f the rmse and correlation coefficient cc are calculated with respect to the imd best estimated data in dd stage ic27 fig 9a the model simulated central mslps are well aggregated with imd observations upto 24 h forecasts afterward the model shows rapid intensification of the storm however the imd estimated central mslp of the storm is showing little variation during the period the observed msw shows early intensification upto 12 h no changes in intensity upto 48 h and subsequently the intensity of the storm increased the pattern of the evolution of model simulated msw is reasonably well match with the observation though the intensity is over predicted by the model during the period the rmse cc of mslp and msw are 12 79 hpa 0 98 and 14 86 kts 0 94 respectively from model runs based on ic29 i e cs stage of tc fig 9b the simulated mslp indicates rapid intensification of the storm upto 48 h however the observation showed a gradual deepening of mslp during the period the values of mslp at 60 and 72 h forecast are well matched with the observation during this period the storm rapidly intensified from cs scs vscs and escs stages i e developing stage to mature stage every 12 h intervals as per imd report the observed values of msw rapidly increased from 45 to 105 kts during the period however similar trend is also seen in the model simulated msw upto 48 h 42 to 106 kts with a higher intensity as compared to imd observed msw and subsequently showing a gradual weakening of the system it is deduced that the model is able to sustain the rapid intensification upto 48 h in this case the rmse cc of mslp and msw are 12 39 hpa 0 82 and 17 75 kts 0 67 respectively from fig 9c as the model initialized at vscs stage ic30 the model simulated pattern of evolution of the intensity in terms of mslp and msw is exactly matched with the observed pattern of imd however the model simulated intensity is under predicted as compared to imd observations throughout the period the forecasted storm reached its peak intensity with mslp 942 hpa at 60 h and msw 96 kts at 48 h while imd observed that the mslp 932 hpa and msw 115 kts at 60 h time the rmse and cc of mslp msw are 12 60 hpa 24 13 kts and 0 97 0 91 during this period respectively in fig 9d ic01 initialized at escs stage the model simulated intensity and observations are well correlated each other during the period with rmsc 16 83 hpa and 17 94 kts and cc 0 84 and 0 94 for mslp and msw respectively the time of peak intensity at 36 h is exactly captured by the model as compared to observation but the value of predicted intensity is lower than the observations it is clearly seen from the figure the model is reasonably well captured the time of dissipation after 48 h forecast i e 00 utc 03 may 2019 of the storm the intensity of the storm during dissipation stage is also reasonably well matched with observation imd clearly reported that the storm suddenly weakened at 00 utc 03 may 2019 onward by increasing 13 hpa of mslp and decreasing 10 kts in msw within 03 h interval the model predicted similar trend exactly by increasing of 12 hpa mslp and decreasing of 08 kts msw the rmsc and cc of mslp msw are 16 83 17 94 and 0 84 0 94 respectively in similar fashion the peak intensity time at 12 h and weakening of the storm are well predicted when the model was initialized at 24 h before landfall of the storm ic02 fig 9e the sudden pressure drop around 11 hpa and rapid increase of msw about 20 kts within 12 h interval is simulated by the model the features are well correlated with the observation by estimated pressure drop 13 hpa and increase of msw 10 kts the model is also well simulated the process of rapid dissipation as the storm get landfall 24 h by increase decrease of central pressure msw about 14 hpa 29 kts the model simulated pattern of mslp 0 97 and msw 0 93 is highly correlated with the observations while the rmsc of mslp and msw is about 20 6 hpa and 28 44 kts during the period respectively the rmse calculated at different forecasts length upto 72 h during the life span of storm is depicted in fig 9f the rmse of mslp 18 hpa and msw 27 kts from model initial time is higher than the other forecast hours the rmse of mslp is gradually decreased after 24 h forecast with increase of forecast length the similar trend is not followed by the msw the overall results from the fig 9 a e deduced that the pattern of intensification and dissipation of the storm is reasonably captured by the model when it initialized at higher intensity stages more than cs category routray et al 2016 2019 it is also clearly seen from the fig 9 the intensity is under over predicted when the model initialized at the scs stage or more cs or lower stage respectively the pdi 1010 kts3 and ace 104 kts2 calculated from different model runs based on various ics during the life span of the storm are depicted in fig 10 a and b respectively both the model and observation the pdi fig 10a values are gradually increased upto 30 00 i e model run based on ic30 afterward the values are decreased with the advancement of the model runs based on different ics the model simulated pdi values are higher than the observation upto ic29 run it is clearly suggested that the model is predicted more intense storm when the model initialized at low category stage of storm when the cyclone fully matured with high msw the model simulated pdi is drastically reduced than the observed pdi it inferred that the model is not able to capture the exact intensity of the storm as compared to the observed however the evolution pattern of the pdi of the storm from the model is reasonably well correlated with the observed pattern during different stages of the tc the maximum pdi is simulated on ic30 run mature stage of the tc i e vscs to escs about 32 1010 kts3 whereas the observation is around 39 1010 kts3 from ic27 based run i e dd to scs stage the model predicted pdi is 17 1010 kts3 as compared to observed pdi 7 1010 kts3 the model pdi is increased by about 12 1010 kts3 from the preceding value while the observed pdi increased around 5 1010 kts3 from ic01 run from escs to cs the value of model pdi is suddenly reduced by 15 1010 kts3 as compared to observation 5 1010 kts3 the pdi is deduced that the model has shown a tendency of early rapidification with sudden dissipation of the storm the pattern of the ace fig 10b is similar to pdi with high value about 10 104 kts2 on ic30 run as compared to 13 104 kts2 however the ace value is increased by 3 104 kts2 in the observation like the pdi the model simulated ace is also showing early intensification and sudden dissipation of the storm during the life span 5 2 3 storm relative helicity and potential instability both the area 2 2 around the centre of tc and time upto 72 h forecasts averaged model simulated srh at 0 1 km and 0 3 km from different ics based runs and verified with the corresponding era5 reanalyses are depicted in fig 11 a and b respectively the averaged srh values from model and era5 at 0 1 km fig 11a and 0 3 km fig 11b are gradually increased from early stage to mature stage of the tc upto 30 00 ic30 run afterward the values are slowly decreased in the ic30 based run the model forecasts exclusively covered the most intense period of the cyclone vscs to escs as per imd observations the cyclone is rapidly intensified during this period which is clearly seen from the value of the msw and mslp in the fig 9c it is noted that the peak values of srh from model and era5 in both layers found in the ic30 based run which coincide with the fig 9c it is assumed that the intense convection and updraft within the eyewall of the tc is reasonably well simulated by the model during the period however the model simulated srh values at 0 1 km and 0 3 km layers are higher than the era5 about 08 m2 s 2 and 12 m2 s 2 respectively in the next day based run ic01 the storm entered into the dissipation stage after 48 h i e 03 april 2019 the srh values are reduced during the period relative to the preceding day in the model era5 by 07 12 and 33 45 m2 s 2 at 0 1 km and 0 3 km layers respectively it means that the model is gradually slowdown the convection and started downdraft around the eyewall during the period from the figure the model simulated srh is higher than the era5 on 0 1 km layer fig 11a throughout the life span of the storm except in ic02 and ic03 based runs in contrast to fig 11a the value of srh fig 11b from era5 is higher than the model simulated srh value upto ic29 based runs whereas the model value of srh increased afterward it is worth to mention that the srh values from model and era5 at 0 3 km layer are relatively higher than the corresponding values of srh obtained from 0 to 1 km layer molinari and vollaro 2008 also found similar results from their observational study using dropsound datasets around the eyewall of the hurricane bonnie 1998 that the srh values were higher in the upper layer than the srh values in lower layer based on the results of this study they suggested that large value of srh plays an important role for favoring strong convection the presence of large srh grew the deep and long lasting cells in the vicinity of the storm from the figure it is clearly inferred that the model is able to predict the srh reasonably well at different stages of the storm and the values are comparable with the era5 the area and time averaged like srh potential thermal instability pi calculated from different ics based runs and verified with the corresponding era5 reanalyses is described in fig 11c the low value of pi corresponds to the higher thermal instability unstable of atmosphere from the figure it is clearly seen that the pi values are higher during early stages of the storm and gradually decreased as the storm intensified further it shows that the pi values slowly increase as the storm move towards dissipation stage the minimum values of pi is simulated by the model with ic30 4 02 c and ic01 4 14 c based runs during this period the cyclone was fully matured mainly ic30 based run whereas the tc entered into the dissipation stage after 48 h in ic01 based run i e 03 april 2019 as a result the model simulated pi value slightly increased in the ic01 as compared to the ic30 based runs the era5 is also showing in similar trends with high values of pi during the dissipating period it is clear that the increased convective instability during the periods with maximum intensification and wind speeds the feature is plausible well matched with the pdi and ace fig 10 the high thermal instability triggered the eyewall convection contributing to strong updraft of the cells that enhance the srh fig 11a and b the pi values from era5 are slightly higher in the early stages of the tc upto ic28 and further increased and comparable to the model simulated pi values the pattern of distribution of model simulated pi values is correlated reasonably well with the era5 during the life span of the storm 5 2 4 time series of thermodynamical parameters the area averaged 2 2 time variations of thermodynamical variables such as vimt lhf gpp and vertically integrated moisture convergence vimc from the model simulations at different stages of cyclone and its comparison with era5 reanalyses are represented in fig 12 a b c d e f and g h respectively the various model simulations upto 72 h are obtained from the ic27 dd ic29 cs ic30 vscs ic01 escs and ic02 24 h before landfall and the corresponding era5 reanalyses 5 2 4 1 vertical integrated moisture transport vimt the model simulated vimt fig 12a is progressively increased with the increase of the forecast length in ic27 based run dd stage during this period the storm intensified from dd to vscs stage as per imd report it shows that the simulated moisture transport clearly associated with the intensity of the storm during the period the model simulated vimt is little higher at initial forecast hours upto 24 h and decreased afterward as compared to the era5 sd27 fig 12b in both ic29 and ic30 based simulations it is clearly seen that the storm is rapidly intensified as the value of vimt shot up from 600 to 1500 kg m 1 s 1 during the period the features are reasonably well matched with the imd and simulated msw in fig 9b and c it is also seen that the high thermal instability fig 11c is noticed during the period which certainly enhanced the transport of moisture from the underlying ocean into the vicinity of the storm core from era5 reanalyses sd30 fig 12b it is observed that the temporally variation of vimt occurred several times during the intensification of the storm it means that the era5 reanalyses are not properly maintained the rapid intensification of the storm the rapid intensification of the tc is appropriately represented by the model simulation based on ic29 and ic30 runs it is evident that the strong moisture transport is simulated in ic30 run compared to the ic29 runs in ic01 simulation the slow increment of vimt is observed during the mature phase of the storm it is also known that the intensity of the storm does not vary much during the mature phase and gradually entered into the dissipation stage hence the variation of model simulated vimt is relatively less among the forecast hours during the mature stage as compared to the developing phase of the storm however the value of vimt is higher in this run than the preceding runs another indication is that the weakening of the storm is simulated by the model i e decreased of vimt after 48 h forecast 03 may 2019 these features are also noticed in the era5 sd01 with the fluctuation of the vimt during the period in ic02 run the value of vimt after 12 h forecast is gradually decreased with increase of the forecast length it meant that the storm is slowly dissipated which captured by the model on the other hand at pick phase the vimt at 12 h is lower than the initial time in era5 sd02 which disagrees with the imd best track data the pattern of vimt during dissipation stage of the storm is well comparable with the era5 reanalyses however the model simulated little stronger vimt during the dissipation period 5 2 4 2 latent heat flux lhf the lhf from model simulations based on various ics and era5 are depicted in fig 12c and d respectively from the era5 sd27 fig 12d the lhf is varying from the range 153 to 157 w m 2 in the early phase of the storm dd stage upto 12 h the lhf increased significantly in subsequent hours while the tc intensified at initial time 00 utc of 27 april 2019 the tc was dd stage after 12 h the storm became cs continued upto 54 h and further intensified from scs to vscs stage as per imd best track data from the ic27 based run fig 12c the lhf values are steadily increased upto 36 h and further increased significantly the lhf value is increased from initial time to 12 h forecast dd to cs stage by 27 w m 2 while the era5 sd27 decreased by 5 w m 2 during the period the era5 is showing the early intensification of the tc about 30 h as compared to the model simulation 18 h the intensification of the tc in this model simulation ic27 is reasonably well correlated with the imd best track data the maximum minimum value of lhf is predicted by the model 310 154 w m 2 as compared to the lhf from era5 around 362 153 w m 2 during the period it is important to mention that the lhf value changes associated with the storm are consistent with the time series of central pressure fig 9a during 24 72 h forecast during this period the high value of lhf 310 w m 2 is predicted at 72 h forecast as the tc deepened to vscs stage at the same time the model predicted the minimum mslp 953 hpa from sd29 it is clearly seen that the lhf values are considerably increased with the increase of analyses hours while the tc intensified from cs to escs stage during the period the distribution pattern of the lhf from sd29 is well matched with the time series of the msw and mslp fig 9b during the period however the model simulated lhf is gradually increased without much variation during the period as compared to the era5 the model predicted lhf values are lesser than the era5 in ic30 based run the lhf is increased with forecast hours upto 48 h the maximum values of the lhf are found at 36 h 391 w m 2 and 48 h 496 w m 2 forecasts however the era5 sd30 shows the increase of lhf upto 36 h with the maximum value 573 w m 2 and gradually decreased afterward the decrease trend of lhf is noticed at the peak intensity time of tc in sd30 the lhf value is significantly raised by 110 w m 2 from 24 h to 36 h forecast time whereas 62 w m 2 of lhf increase in sd30 during the period the rapid intensification of the storm is clearly represented by the model as compared to sd30 the pattern of the lhf is closely followed the simulated pattern of the msw in fig 9c as per imd best track data the tc attained the peak intensity at 60 h 12 utc 02 may 2019 with msw 115 kts the ic30 and sd30 showed the occurrence of peak intensity of the tc i e high values of lhf 12 and 24 h earlier than the actual occurrence respectively the simulated lhf increased substantially in ic30 based run consistent with the increase of the moisture transport during the period fig 12a the considerable increase of moisture transport to core of the tc leads to intensification of the storm through enhance of latent heating from ic01 based run escs stage the lhf value increased gradually upto 24 h and peak value 456 w m 2 simulated at 36 h forecast the model is able to simulate the peak phase of the storm with high value of lhf the peak phase of the tc was observed at 12 utc 02 may 2019 with maximum msw 115 kts and central pressure drop about 66 hpa however the high value of lhf 573 w m 2 is noticed at 12 h in the era5 sd01 during dissipation stage the model simulated lhf drastically reduced after 48 h forecast the sd01 followed the similar trend of sudden fall of the lhf after 48 h the evolution of lhf from the model is closely followed the time variations of the vimt fig 12a during the period it is essential to discuss that the shrink of moisture transport fig 12a into the storm is systematically reduced the lhf fig 12c thus causing the attenuated intensity of the tc it is also observed that the evolution of the lhf is strongly correlated with the mslp and msw fig 9d during the period in ic02 based run 24 h before landfall the storm starts dissipate with decreased of the lhf after landfall 24 h 00 utc 03 may 2019 the sd02 is also showing the dissipation of the storm after 24 h the time variations of lhf from model and era5 are well correlated with the msw and mslp pattern from the figure it is deduced that the model initialized at different stages of storm is able to produce the lhf around the tc and established a strong correlation between the lhf and msw as well as with the mslp 5 2 4 3 genesis potential parameter gpp the gpp from model simulations based on different ics run and era5 reanalyses are illustrated in fig 12e and f respectively the sd27 fig 12f is showing the substantial increase of analyzed gpp throughout the analysis time clearly indicate that the storm have potential to intensify further during the developing phase in similar fashion the model simulated gpp ic27 fig 12e is also increased throughout the forecast hours however the values of gpp are higher in the era5 as compared to ic27 from the ic29 the steady growth of gpp is simulated by the model during the period whereas the rise and fall pattern of the gpp is seen in the sd29 during the period the simulated values of gpp are lesser than the era5 it is suggested that the sd29 restrain high potential to intensify the storm during the period from ic30 based runs the gpp is increased slowly upto 24 h forecast and rise significantly afterward as the tc intensified in contrast the gpp values sd30 are decreased upto 24 h while the increase trend of the gpp is observed afterward it is noticed that the gpp values are higher at the peak phase of the tc the gpp is determining the potential for intensification of the storm the time variations of gpp from the model are relative well correlated with the pattern of the lhf fig 12c the increase of gpp is evidently caused due to the large transport of moisture flux into the vicinity of the storm fig 12a it substantially leads to the intensification of the tc through enhance of the lhf goswami et al 2015 fujiwara et al 2017 from ic01 the quite slow growth of gpp is simulated by the model during the mature stage of the tc it is also noticed that the dip of the gpp value is simulated by the model during weakening phase of tc however the gpp from sd01 is significantly increased upto 48 h and sudden decreased afterward the value of gpp from the sd01 is higher than the ic01 throughout forecast hours the high value of gpp is noticed upto 12 h and 24 h from model simulation and era5 respectively both the ic02 and sd02 are showing sudden decrease of gpp during the dissipation phase of the tc it infers from the figure that the pattern of gpp is strongly correlated with the pattern of the vimt and lhf 5 2 4 4 vertical integrated moisture convergence vimc fig 12g and h demonstrated the vimc from model simulations based on various ics runs and era5 reanalyses the rising trend of the vimc is observed in the early to developing stages of the storm in ic27 based run however the era5 sd27 is showing the variation of the vimc values during the period this contradict is due to the low resolution of the era5 in compared to model simulation the strong moisture convergence around the tc is simulated by the model than the era5 the increase of vimc is evidently caused by the large moisture transport from underlying ocean fig 12a into the vicinity of the tc during the period the pattern of the vimc from era5 is not well matched with the vimt fig 12b the vimc is increased throughout the forecast hours in both ic29 and ic30 based runs the similar trend is also noticed in the era5 reanalyses but the value of vimc decreased at 60 and 72 h in sd30 the result inferred that the evolution of vimc from the model is closely associated with the intensity of the cyclone during the period from ic01 and ic02 the magnitude of the vimc is higher in the mature stage of the tc and gradually decreased during the weakening phase of the tc however the ic01 and sd01 are shown early dissipation of the storm with time lag 24 h as the value of vimc decreases after 24 h it is seen from the figure the time variations of the vimc from model simulations and era5 are considerably well correlated with vimt yoshida and itoh 2012 the study by chansaengkrachang et al 2018 established a relationship between precipitation and vimc over thailand region during rainy and summer seasons from the years 1999 to 2013 they found that a large positive correlation between precipitation and vimc we have calculated the rainrate from different ics based runs figure not provided it is observed that a strong correlation is also noticed in the evolution of both rainrate and vimc 5 2 5 track and its errors the predicted tracks 12hrly from various ics based runs and imd best track data are shown in fig 13 a the initial position error and mean direct position errors dpes from the model simulations from different sets of ics and era5 are depicted in fig 13b and c respectively the errors are calculated with respect to the imd best track data the imd best track shows that the tc initially moved northwestwards upto 30th april 2019 and then recurved northeastwards from 01st may 2019 the cyclone crossed the odisha coast between 03 and 05 utc of 03rd may 2019 it is observed that all the predicted tracks from different ics based run coincide comparatively well with the imd best track although the movement of the simulated tc is somewhat too fast during early phases upto ic28 during developing and mature stages the migrating speed of the predicted cyclone is closely matched with the observed track in the ic26 and ic29 it is seen that there is a northeastward deviation in the initial position of the tc from the observation hence the initial position errors fig 13b are appreciably large during this period the initial position errors from era5 are also considerably high during the period the forecasted position of the tc is diverged from the observed track after 24 h forecast in ic26 based run as well as the movement of tc is fast to some extent therefore the model simulated mean dpe fig 13c is about 171 km in this run the initial position errors from ic27 ic28 are higher lower than the era5 respectively subsequently the mean dpes are higher lower in the ic27 ic28 as compared to the era5 the simulated track from the ic29 coincides relatively well with the observed track in all the forecast hours which is clearly reflected in the mean dpe about 86 km it is noted that the model is able to predict the recurvature of the storm after 48 h forecast 01 may 2019 and moved northeastward along the observed track the time of the recurvature is exactly matched with the imd best track data in similar fashion the ic30 is able to predict the recurvature of the tc 12 h early the simulated track is considerably drifted away from the observed track throughout the forecast hours therefore the mean dpe is higher 193 km during this period even if the initial position is less than 50 km the initial error and mean dpe from era5 are lesser than the ncum r it is clearly seen from the fig 13b the initial position errors are notably reduced in ic01 39 km ic02 35 km and ic03 24 km as compared to the era5 i e 40 17 and 19 km respectively consequently the model simulated position and migrating speed of the tc are remarkably matched overlapped with the imd best track data during these periods hence the mean dpes are reduced to 66 72 and 72 km in ic01 ic02 and ic03 as compared to era5 i e 28 29 and 35 km respectively it is worth mentioning that the mean dpes are less than 100 km predicted by the model in 05 instants out of 08 during the life span of the tc it is manifested that the mean dpes are decreased with increase of the forecast lengths except in ic30 it means that the prediction of the track is improved when the model initialized as the tc intensity is greater than cs category routray et al 2017 2019 the landfall position and time errors are calculated from the ic01 ic02 and ic03 based model runs the landfall position error is reduced to 15 km in the ic02 based runs in comparison to the ic01 97 km and ic03 29 km however the error at the time of landfall is delayed by 04 h 30 min in the ic02 it is suggested that the simulated speed of the tc is lower than the observed during the landfall time in the case of ic01 and ic03 the landfall time error is 02 h 30 min ahead and 30 min delay respectively the mean rmse of dpe cross track ct and along track at is provided in fig 13d the mean rmse of dpe and ct are shown the increasing tendency as the forecast length increased however the mean rmses of at are showing mix results throughout the forecast hours it is interesting to mention that the ic29 and ic30 based runs show the recurvature of the tc after 00 utc 01 may 2019 and moved north northeastward however the ic30 simulated track deviated more northeastward as compared to the ic29 simulated track hence the high value of mean dpe is noticed in the ic30 fig 13c even if less initial position error fig 13b it is necessary to understand the possible reasons for deviation of the track in the ic30 based run it is well known that the movement of the storm is generally steered by the environmental large scale flows as well as interact with the tcs environment holland 1983 wu and wang 2000 osuri et al 2017 etc fig 14 a b and c d provides the simulated streamline at 500 hpa and total precipitable water tpw mm from ic29 and ic30 based runs valid at 00 utc of 01 and 02 may 2019 respectively as shown in the fig 14a i e day 2 forecast valid at 00 utc 01 may 2019 of ic29 the land ridge over southwestern part of india ridge axis running from 120 to 190n thick black line and subtropical ridge extended from 220 to 350n do not permit the tc to move northwestward direction hence the tc recurved towards the north northeastward unlike in the ic29 the land ridge became stronger axis of ridge extended to higher latitude and longitude and leaning more towards the northeast as well as close to the vortex of the storm in the ic30 fig 14b therefore the tc is pushed more towards northeast direction as compared to the ic29 the maximum tpw is also simulated by ic30 in the eastern sector of the tc as compared to the ic29 the orientation of the tpw distribution clearly suggested that the tc intends to move more towards northeast direction fig 14b in the fig 14c i e day 3 forecast valid at 00 utc 02 may 2019 ic29 it is clearly seen that the storm is trapped in between the diverged flow of streamline around central part of india and an elongated ridge black curved line from southeastern to northern sectors of the tc so the tc maintained the recurvature and did not drift away from the observed track during the period in contrast to ic29 the features of diverged streamline flow are more closed to the east coast of india in the ic30 based run fig 14d it is also seen that a spurious ridge developed in the northern sector as well as high values of tpw and strong south westerlies in the northeast sector of the storm simulated by the ic30 run it is also observed in this particular run the south westerlies became purely strong westerlies after crossed the myanmar coast which drag the tc more towards northeastward these aforesaid features may be responsible to push the tc more towards northeast direction in ic30 as compared to the ic29 many previous studies suggested that the storm moved towards the maximum area of pv wu and wang 2000 osuri et al 2017 etc the spatial distribution of pv of day 1 and day 2 from ic29 and the difference plots day 1 minus day 2 and day 2 minus day 3 of pv valid at 00 utc 01 and 02 may 2019 from ic30 and ic29 represented in fig 15 a b and c d respectively from the fig 15a and b it is clearly seen that the orientation of positive pv distribution is more towards north northwest direction in ic29 run however in the difference plots fig 15c and d the distribution of positive pv is east northeast direction it is clearly inferred that the ic30 based run is showing positive tendency of pv towards the northeast direction hence the deviation of the track of the tc is more in the ic30 run as compared to the ic29 track the steering flow environmental flow plays a significant role for movement of the system by advecting vorticity to the front of the storm chan and gray 1982 osuri et al 2015 similar to fig 15 a b and c d the composite deep layer 850 200 hpa mean wind m s 1 is calculated and presented in fig 15 e f and g h there is a clear difference in northeastward steering flow in the fig 15g and h which caused the storm to move further northeastward in ic30 based run it is evident that the environmental flow is considerably strong in ic30 than the ic29 and makes the tc to move along the flow similar results were also obtained by osuri et al 2015 2017 the latitudinally 09 16on averaged vertical cross section time and longitude of upper air divergence field 10 5s 1 and wind between 300 and 100 hpa layers are analyzed in fig 15i and j from the ic29 and ic30 based runs respectively in the ic29 based run fig 15i the wind pattern clearly shows that the storm moved northwestward upto 48 h forecast 00 utc 01 may 2019 then moved north northeast direction therefore the upper air divergence field follows the correct path with the forecast time the feature is well correlated with the predicted track fig 13a and also imd best estimated track in contrast to ic29 the wind pattern from the ic30 shows the northwestward flow in early forecast hours upto 18 utc 30 april 2019 subsequently the high magnitude of northeastward wind is seen in higher forecast hours fig 15j the vertical cross section of the divergence field and the wind pattern distinctly depicts a preferential northeastward movement with time in the ic30 based run fig 15j which steered the tc northeastward with the forecast lead time 6 summary and conclusion the present study investigated the predictive capability of the ncum r for pre and post genesis characteristics associated with the escs fani occurred over bob during 26 april 04 may 2019 to examine the pre genesis of the storm we considered the model analyses and forecasts of ncum r three days prior to the genesis i e 26th april 2019 of the tc the study also further examined the prediction of the tc based on dynamic thermodynamic parameters intensity track and its errors and various indexes the model simulated results during pre and post genesis period are verified with the era5 reanalyses the spatial distribution of the wind fields at 850 hpa is able to predict the pre genesis of the storm three days advance the model simulated wind fields are shown that the cyclonic circulation is more prominent as the forecast lengths increased the model analyses are clearly showed the evolution of the storm during pre genesis period the model simulated and analyzed pattern of the wind fields are well correlated with the era5 reanalyses during the period we further examined the positive feedback process between the intensification of the tc and moisture transport over the underlying ocean through the spatial distribution of vimt during the pre genesis period from the ncum r analyses and forecasts it is clearly seen that the moist westerly flows over the indian ocean and southeast of bob region are gradually increased as the day progress which formed a mcb over the region the strong magnitude more than 550 kg m 1 s 1 of eastward moisture flow through mcb is consistently churning around the storm over the regions as the storm moved northwestward it is clearly suggested that a large scale transport of moisture into the inner region of the cyclonic system from the ocean through mcb further enhanced the intensity of the tc the time evolution of mcb is reasonably well predicted by the model the results from ncum r are well correlated with the previous results obtained from the regional atmospheric models by hegde et al 2016 fujiwara et al 2017 makarieva et al 2017 etc the magnitude of vimt and pattern of mcb over indian ocean is considerably well matched with the era5 reanalyses during the pre genesis period however the magnitude of the vimt from ncum r is slightly higher than the era5 reanalyses the establishment and reinforcement of well organized mcb over the oceanic region facilitate to import moisture into the inner core of the system resulting in the increase of latent heat within the inner vicinity of the tc generally the lhf plays an important role in genesis and intensification of the tc it is noticed in the ncum r analyses and forecasts that the lhf occurs in the outer region during early developing stage and gradually incursion into the inner region of the tc the feature has been suggested by many previous researches chen et al 2014 gao et al 2019 it is worth to mention that the model predicted lhfs are increased noticeably after the genesis of the tc it is also seen that the co evolution of the moisture fluxes and lhfs are quite similar the high resolution ncum r model is able to predict systematically the time evolution of the large scale vapour transport over oceanic region and lhf in the vicinity of the storm during early stages of the system the intensity of the pv from model analyses and simulations is gradually increased around inner region of the tc from early stages to developed stage the low value of pv is also noticed around the southwest part of the cyclonic disturbance the gradient of the pv surrounding the tc is to establish a strong transport of moisture fluxes from the oceanic region into the vicinity of inner core of the storm consequently the intensity of the tc is gradually increased with lead time the model analyses and simulations are clearly shown that the storm retains the intensity and structure during early stage of the tc the features are well correlated with the era5 reanalyses with high magnitude of pv the spatial distribution of θe and moisture fluxes are well simulated by ncum r at different stages of tc dd cs vscs escs and 24 h before landfall and the magnitude gradually increased whenever the tc move from one stage to another stage during life span the evolution of intensity based on mslp and msw clearly shows the rapid intensification and dissipation of the storm in ncum r as compare to imd observations the averaged pdi and ace clearly suggested that the model is predicted more low intense storm when the model initialized at the cs lower matured stage however the evolution pattern of the pdi and ace of the storm from the model is reasonably well correlated with the observed pattern during different stages of the tc the averaged srh at 0 1 km and 0 3 km as well as pi from different ics based runs are well simulated by the model the pattern is also well correlated with the pdi and ace the pattern is also well matched with the era5 the evolution of the area averaged time variations of thermodynamical variables is properly simulated by the ncum r at different stages of cyclone the pattern is well compared with the era5 and also with the imd best track data however it is noticed that the era5 reanalyses having temporal variations in certain parameters these features sometimes disagree with the imd best track data the predicted tracks from different ics based run coincide comparatively well with the imd best track although the movement of the modeled tc is somewhat too fast during early phases the recurvature of the tc is well simulated by the model in ic29 and ic30 based runs and moved northeastward along with the observed track however the simulated track from the ic30 is more diverged from the observed track therefore the dpes are higher in ic30 even if low initial position error as compared to the ic29 the possible reasons for deviation of the track in the ic30 based run are investigated by considering environmental large scale flows which interact with the tcs environment it is noticed that the intense land ridge over indian continent and strong south westerlies in the northeast sector of the storm became strong westerlies after it crossed the myanmar coast are simulated in the ic30 these features may be responsible to drag the storm more towards eastward as compared to the ic29 the orientation of the tpw distribution is clearly suggested that the tc intends to move more towards northeast direction in ic30 the high values of positive pv and strong steering flow over east northeast sector is simulated in the ic30 which caused the storm to move further northeastward the results are well correlated with the previous studies osuri et al 2015 2017 the vertical cross section of the upper air divergence field and the wind pattern distinctly depicts a preferential northeastward movement with time in the ic30 based run which steered the tc northeastward along with the forecast times the study clearly suggested that the ncum r model is able to predict the early genesis genesis and post genesis of the storm the model results show high intensification during early stage of the storm however the rapid intensification and dissipation of the storm are well captured by the model and evolution pattern is reasonably well matched with the imd observations to further support of the conclusion drawn from the present case study more cyclone cases over nio region arabian sea and bob during pre

5203,this study assesses the predictive capability of the high resolution national centre for medium range weather and forecasting ncmrwf regional unified model ncum r for pre and post genesis characteristics associated with a tc we have selected an extremely severe cyclonic storm escs fani which formed over bay of bengal bob during 26 april 04 may 2019 for the study to examine the pre genesis of the storm we used the model analyses and forecasts of ncum r three days prior to the genesis i e 26th april 2019 of the tc the results clearly show the establishment of a moisture conveyor belt mcb during the pre genesis period which connects the tc inner core with underlying oceanic region the mcb plays an important role in the transport of large amounts of moisture towards the storm inner core from the oceanic regions and subsequently for the release of latent heat in the vicinity of the storm resulting the intensification of tc these processes were clearly predicted by the ncum r model during the pre genesis period the study also examined role of various dynamic and thermodynamic variables intensity track and its errors and various indexes at different stages of tc the evolution of intensity based on mean sea level pressure mslp and 10 m maximum sustainable wind msw clearly shows the rapid intensification and dissipation of the storm in ncum r simulations the pattern is reasonably well matched with the observations the area averaged thermodynamical variables around the eyewall of the storm in the forecast based on different initial conditions ics are well simulated by the model and the pattern is well matched with the era5 reanalyses the model predicted track from different ics are reasonably well matched with the observed track the large scale environmental flow plays a vital role in the recurvature of the tc the study clearly suggested that the ncum r model is able to predict the intensity movement and structure of the storm during pre and post genesis period however the model results show intense storm during early stage as compared to observation keywords ncum r model tropical cyclone cyclone fani moisture conveyor belt era5 reanalyses 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs over north indian ocean nio such as bay of bengal bob and arabian sea are one of the most violent weather systems as compared to other basins the nio region contributes 5 of total global tcs i e four tcs per year singh 2010 they produced most damaging natural hazards due to high surface winds heavy rainfall storm surge etc along the coast of littoral countries like india bangladesh sri lanka myanmar etc besides the natural hazards the tcs can have significant impact on human life and also their socio economic aspects fraedrich and leslie 1989 in nio basin the frequency and landfall of tcs are considerably higher in bob than the arabian sea the tcs formed over this region are characterized by quick growth and short life span than other oceanic basin therefore government authorities do not get sufficient time for disaster preparedness and mitigation it is very important for weather forecaster to improve the forecast skills with respect to the movement and intensity of tcs over these regions so that effective mitigation is possible there is no doubt that the track forecasting is considerably improved over the years due to improved observational coverage and advancement of numerical weather prediction nwp models and data assimilation system in recent years however the improvement of intensity forecast is comparatively less than the improvement of track forecast cangialosi and franklin 2013 mohapatra et al 2013a b in last couple of decades all operational weather forecasting agencies in world are largely depend on nwp models to provide advanced information of intensity and track of tcs by replacing their statistical models and synoptic methods mohanty and gupta 1997 gupta 2006 chen et al 2013 mohapatra et al 2013a b lei et al 2016 routray et al 2019 however the high resolution regional models are significantly enhanced their forecast skill for prediction of track and intensity of the tcs the reason is that proper representation of inner core structure storm size increase of vertical and horizontal resolution of the model resolve mesoscale dynamics advanced data assimilation techniques assimilation of high quality dense observations etc davis et al 2008 rao et al 2009 osuri et al 2013 2015 tien et al 2013 gopalakrishnan et al 2012 routray et al 2016 a comparative study was carried out by routray et al 2017 to evaluate the performance of national centre for medium range weather and forecasting ncmrwf regional unified model ncum r adapted from unified model of uk met office over the operational global ncum ncum g model with horizontal resolution 12 and 25 km respectively considering four land falling tcs over bob the study delineates that the ncum r is more skillful for simulation of track intensity of tcs than ncum g many recent studies demonstrated that the high resolution version of uk met office unified model um has capable to correctly represent the meso convective cells and time of initiations associated with the synoptic weather systems lean et al 2008 o hara and webster 2012 orr et al 2014 dutta et al 2019a rajasree et al 2016 studied the genesis of sequence of tcs through the marsupial paradigm using high resolution analysis obtained from wrf three dimensional variational data assimilation 3dvar modeling system the studies suggested that the genesis of tcs over nio region follows the concepts of marsupial theory the high resolution 4 4 km regional ncum r with 4dvar analysis system is operationally running at ncmrwf davies et al 2005 dutta et al 2019b the prime objective of the study is to analyze the predictive capability of the ncum r for pre and post genesis characteristics associated with the tc for this purpose we considered an extremely severe cyclonic storm escs fani formed over bob during 26 april 04 may 2019 as a case study the synoptic conditions associated with the escs fani are provided in the following section section 3 presents a brief description of the high resolution ncum r model and 4dvar analysis system the details of the numerical experiment as well as methodology are described in the section 4 while the simulation results during the pre and post genesis of the tc are discussed in section 5 finally the conclusions of the present study are provided in section 6 2 synoptic conditions associated with escs fani a well marked low pressure wml area formed over eastern part of equatorial indian ocean eio around equator lat 2 70n and long 88 70e and adjoining southeast bob in the morning 08 30 ist of 25th april 2019 during 26th to early morning of 27th april the wml concentrated from depression d to a deep depression dd over the eio region the system further intensified into a cyclonic storm cs named as fani around1130 ist of 27th april over southeast part of bob and adjoining east eio the storm moved north northwestward direction the storm maintained the cs stage upto the evening of 29th april and intensified into a severe cyclonic storm scs over central parts of south bob during 30th april early morning to evening the system further intensified from very severe cyclonic storm vscs to escs laid over west central and adjoining southwest bob and moved west northwestward direction the rapid intensification of the storm during afternoon of 29th to evening of 30th april over the westcentral parts of the bob due to higher oceanic heat and sudden increase of maximum sustained wind msw from 48 kts to 95 kts the storm started recurving north northeastwards from 1st may early morning 0530 ist it reached the peak intensity during 2nd 1430 ist to 3rd may 0230 ist with maximum sustained wind msw speed of 115 kts gusting 200 to 230 kmph and lowest estimated central pressure 932 hpa it crossed the odisha coast close to puri lat 19 750n and long 85 70e as an escs between 0800 and 1000 ist of 3rd may with msw 110 kts 175 to 185 kmph gusting 205 kmph and continuously moved north northeastwards across the odisha coast and west bengal upto northeastern states with varying intensities this clockwise recurving track of the storm was mainly due to the presence of the anticyclonic circulation in middle and upper tropospheric levels in the northeast of the system centre the system gradually started weakens into vscs over coastal odisha around noon 1130 ist close to east of bhubaneswar around 1430 ist near to cuttack and scs stage over north coastal odisha west of balasore at night 2030 h ist of 3rd may it further weakened to cs in the early morning of 4th may laid over western parts of gangetic west bengal and moved northeastwards became wml over northeastern states of india on morning of 5th may the genesis of the tc near equator is very rare and such type of disturbance was earlier observed nio region during january 2005 the escs fani is one of the most intense storm crossed the odisha coast during pre monsoon season since 1982 the last escs i e 31st may to 05th june 1982 was developed over southeast bob near andaman sea and crossed the odisha coast between paradip and chandbali in the midnight of 3rd june 1982 with msw 80 kts fig 1 a shows the track of storms crossing odisha coast during pre monsoon seasons for the period of 1891 2018 source of data international best track archive for climate stewardship ibtracs the 12 h averaged intensity calculated based on msw kts of tc fani is around 62 kts which is higher than the averaged intensity of individual storms occurred during the period 1891 2018 table 1 also fani has one of the longest track with 3030 km length as reported by imd fig 1b and also an extremely intense cyclone over bob during pre monsoon season which crossed the odisha coast table 1 the heavy to very heavy rainfall were reported

states and background fields for the assimilation of various atmospheric observations the previous 6 h forecast is considered as background state to calculate the increments the linear perturbation forecast pf model with a lower horizontal resolution 08 km lower resolution than the resolution of forecast model is used in the 4dvar da system to produce time varying increments over the

different physical parameterization schemes used in the operational setup is summarized in table 2 the ncum r model predictions are evaluated by evaluating various dynamical and thermodynamical parameters at differ stages of the tc along with the standard verification metrics like direct position error dpe cross track ct along track at etc routray et al 2016 2017 osuri et al 2013 these errors are calculated with respect to the imd estimated best track data the spatial distribution of wind fields equivalent potential temperature at 850 hpa vertically integrated moisture transport vimt kg m 1 s 1 integrated upto 300 hpa latent heat flux lhf and potential vorticity pvu 1 pvu is 10 6 k m2 kg 1 s 1 on 320 k isentropic surface from model analyses and simulations are compared with the high resolution european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era5 data sets the horizontal grid resolution of era5 is about 30 km with 137 pressure levels from the surface upto 80 km height 0 01 hpa the details about the era5 can be found from the technical document prepared by karl hennermann and paul berrisford https confluence ecmwf int display ckb era5 data documentation the time series of vimt vimc genesis potential parameter gpp lhf etc from model simulations are analyzed at different stages of the tc which are also verified with the era5 reanalyses data the ertel potential vorticity hereafter pv on the 320 k isentropic surface gives a very useful dynamical framework for understanding the tc intensification by interacting with the upper tropospheric vorticity the pv has quasi conservation properties by using the potential temperature instead of the using of temperature specific humidity the pv can be describes as a ratio of the absolute vorticity of the air parcel to the depth of the vortex holton and hakim 2012 the pv is conserved in adiabatic and frictionless flow and further it act like a tracer on the flow the power dissipative index pdi emanuel 2005 2007 and accumulated cyclone energy ace bell et al 2000 camargo and sobel 2005 klotzbach 2006 indexes are computed by considering the lifetime of storms and the msw the pdi is computed using the msw cubed at any given time in a storm whereas the ace is sum of the squares of 06 h msw over the period the indexes are calculated for the periods when the wind speed was more than 34 knots i e cs stage although the indices pdi and ace seem to appear similar in their structure klotzbach 2006 however both the indices are different in their physical representation the ace is proportional to the kinetic energy generated by the tcs as well as pdi is generally correspondent to the monetary damage thus both the energy indices have their importance and dependency on msw and duration of the cyclones the concept of the storm relative helicity srh mainly used for the prediction of tornado supercells which evolve with large value of helicity and sustain for long lifetimes numerous studies have verified that the high values of srh in the surrounding area of tornadic supercells associated with tropical cyclones hurricanes mccaul 1987 bogner et al 2000 heymsfield et al 2001 molinari and vollaro 2008 etc bogner et al 2000 and molinari and vollaro 2008 examined the spatial variation of srh in the vicinity of the eyewall of the tropical cyclones hurricanes through the dropsonde observation datasets in the present study we calculated the srh at the lowest 01 km and 03 km layers above ground level which can provides the nature of strong convection associated with the tc the presence of the high values of srh helped the storm to maintain its intensity and effectively resist dissipation the srh at different layers gives a measure of the potential for cyclonic updraft rotation in right moving supercells generally it is noticed that high values of srh are found in the 0 3 km layer rather than the 0 1 km however there is no clear threshold value fixed for the srh the area 2 2 around the centre of tc and time upto 72 h forecasts averaged model simulated srh at 0 1 km and 0 3 km from different ics based runs are calculated the results are also verified with the srh obtained from era5 during the same period in addition the potential instability pi is computed as the difference between the equivalent potential temperature at 500 hpa and 850 hpa the low value of pi corresponds to the higher thermal instability unstable of atmosphere the higher thermal instability in the mid troposphere plays a crucial role to formation and intensification of the cyclone the genesis potential parameter gpp is used to track the tcs genesis intensification and movement kotal et al 2009 kotal and bhattacharya 2013 goswami et al 2015 the gpp is calculated by considering two dynamic and two thermodynamic variables such as wind shear s 850 to 200 hpa relative vorticity v at 850 hpa relative humidity rh mean of 700 to 500 hpa and temperature difference between 850 and 500 hpa the formulation of gpp is given in eq 2 as below 2 gpp v r h t 850 t 500 s the gpp with higher values indicates the high potential zone for intensification of developing systems at the early stages of development 5 results and discussion 5 1 predictability of pre genesis of tc fani this section discusses whether the ncum r model is able to predict pre genesis of the tc three days prior to the genesis for this purpose analyses and three days model forecasts from different initial conditions ics such as 00 utc of 23 to 25 april 2019 are considered as per imd report rsmc 2019 the storm originated from a wml pressure area formed over east equatorial indian ocean eio and adjoining southeast bob on 25th april 2019 the storm further concentrated into a depression over the same region during early morning of 26th april 2019 under favorable environmental conditions the ncum r model analyses and forecasts are verified against the era5 reanalyses the model initial time analysis and upto day 3 forecasts of wind vectors and magnitude m s at 850 hpa are shown in fig 2 from different ics runs the model analyses and simulated wind fields at 850 hpa are verified against the era5 reanalyses during the period 23rd to 28th april 2019 depicted in fig 3 a f respectively from fig 2 the cyclonic wind flow at 850 hpa is noticed in all analyses and forecasts during the period 23rd to 28th april the features are reasonably well correlated with the corresponding era5 reanalyses the ncum r analysis fig 2a shows a feeble cyclonic circulation over eio and southeast bob with wind magnitude 16 20 m s the pattern and magnitude of wind are similar to the era5 reanalysis fig 3a the strong wind flow is found in the both the analyses figs 2a and 3a over the southwest sector of the low pressure system from ic 23rdapril the day 1 forecast fig 2b valid at 00 utc 24th april clearly shows an elongated cyclonic circulation with strong wind 12 16 m s over southwest sector of the storm the magnitude and structure of wind pattern is reasonably well matched with the era5 reanalysis fig 3b in general the southwest sw sector of the storm gets high winds during the pre genesis period as compared to other sectors northeast ne northwest nw and southeast se and gradually the magnitude of wind of sw sector will be smaller than the other sectors with the enhancement of intensity of the storm chan and kwok 1999 the strongest winds are located in the eyewall and the right front quadrant of the fully developed storm in day 2 forecast fig 2c valid at 00 utc 25th april it is clearly showing that the system further developed by increasing the right front quadrant ne and nw sector of wind magnitude over a large area as compared to the day 1 forecast fig 2b the cyclonic circulation is more prominent in day 3 forecast fig 2d valid at 00 utc 26th april as compared to other forecasts the day 2 and day 3 forecasts are well comparable with the corresponding era5 reanalyses fig 3c and d however the winds are more confined around the system in the era5 reanalysis fig 3d than the day 3 forecast the model analysis valid at 24th april 2019 fig 2e is showing a well defined cyclonic circulation with magnitude of wind 8 12 m s over se sector the features are well correlated with the era5 reanalysis fig 3b the model simulated wind fields are shown that the cyclonic circulation is more prominent as the forecast lengths increased fig 2f h the pattern is reasonably well matched with the era5 reanalyses however the magnitude of wind surrounding the system are stronger in the era5 reanalyses fig 3c e as compared to the corresponding model forecasts fig 2f h similarly a well organized cyclonic circulation with wind magnitude 16 20 m s over se and ne sectors of the system is represented in the model analysis valid at 25th april fig 2i which is well matched with the era5 reanalysis fig 3c the intensity of the storm gradually increased with the increase of forecast lengths fig 2j l and matched well with the corresponding era5 reanalyses fig 3d f however the day 3 forecast fig 2l is showing more intense cyclonic storm with strong magnitude of wind around 4 to 6 m s than the era5 reanalysis fig 3f as per imd report rsmc 2019 the storm gradually intensified from d to cs stages during the period 26th to 28th april 2019 the maximum sustained surface winds msw are 13 m s 16 m s and 23 m s estimated by the imd respectively during the period the model simulated msw 16 m s 18 m s and 24 m s are reasonably well matched with the observations respectively whereas the era5 reanalyses during the period are underestimated the msw 12 m s 13 m s and 12 m s the averaged 3 days absolute error ae of msw is 2 m s and 5 m s is seen in the forecast 72 forecast based on ic 25th april and era5 reanalyses respectively the era5 reanalysis is not able to capture the intensity of the storm may be due to its low spatial resolution 30 km the model analyses fig 2a e and i are clearly showed the evolution of the storm the day 1 forecasts fig 2b f and j from various ics 23rd to 25th april are also depicted the development of the storm and similar features are seen in other model forecasts it is worth to mention that the ncum r model is able to predict the pre genesis of the storm three days in advance fig 4 is similar to fig 2 but for the spatial distribution of vertically integrated moisture transport vimt vectors and its magnitude shaded kg m 1 s 1 the vimt from model analyses and forecasts are compared with the era5 reanalyses fig 3g l for the period 23rd to 28th april 2019 the moisture transport and its convergence mostly affect the latent heat distribution in the tc system it is well known that the latent heating is playing a major role in the development and intensity of the tc hill and lackmann 2009 huang et al 2014 fujiwara et al 2017 makarieva et al 2017 in era5 on 23rd april at 00 utc fig 3g the moist westerly flows around the indian ocean is clearly seen in the early stage of the tc system as the day progress fig 3h and i the eastward transport of moisture are gradually increased over indian ocean and southeast of bob region the eastward moisture is consistently churning around the storm over the regions hence the increased moisture associated with the system resulting in the forming of a moisture conveyor belt mcb over the region a wml system was developed at 00 utc 25 april reported by imd the wml system is prominently seen in the fig 3i the storm is intensified from d to cs during the period 26 to 28 april fig 3j k and l respectively and moved further northwestward over the southeast bob and adjoining east eio region even though the storm moved northwestward over the region the mcb is still retained more than 550 kg m 1 s 1 magnitude of moisture fluxes this suggests that a large scale transport of moisture into the inner region of the cyclonic system from the ocean through mcb and further enhanced the intensity of the tc fujiwara et al 2017 kudo et al 2014 takakura et al 2018 the steady progress of the storm is clearly represented in all the model analyses fig 4a e and i the magnitude of vimt and pattern of mcb over indian ocean is considerably well matched with the era5 reanalyses fig 3g h and i the model forecasts from different ics are successfully reproduced the aforesaid features seen in the era5 reanalyses the day 1 forecasts fig 4b f and j from various ics are clearly depicted the development of the storm with increase of the magnitude of the vimt around the storm similar structure and progress of the storm are also seen in other forecasts day 2 and day 3 from different ics which are also well correlated with the respective era5 reanalyses the time evolution of mcb is reasonably well predicted by the model it is notable that the similar features of moisture transport are also simulated through regional atmospheric models by hegde et al 2016 and fujiwara et al 2017 over indian ocean and south china sea the development of mcb plays an active role to import moisture into the inner core of the system from the remote oceans increased the latent heating which leads to intensification of the storm the continuous intensification of the storm results in further development of mcb in day 3 forecast valid at 00 utc 28th april based on ics 25th april run fig 4l the magnitude of vimt more than 650 kg m 1 s 1 surrounding and inner region of the tc is higher than the era5 reanalyses fig 3l the storm was observed as cs stage by the imd during the period the high resolution ncum r model is able to predict the time evolution of the large scale vapour transport over oceanic region during early stage of the tc system fig 5 a l is similar to fig 2 a l but for the spatial distribution of surface turbulent latent heat flux lhf w m 2 overlap with 850 hpa moisture flux when the mcb is well organized from the indian ocean to the inner region of the storm it is clearly seen in fig 5 that the surface evaporation from the underlying ocean is intensified over the indian ocean the value of lhfs exceed to 150 w m 2 over these region the spatial patterns of the lhfs are well correlated with the distributions of vimt in the fig 4 these features suggested that the air parcels through mcb may be considerably modified by the moisture supplied over the oceanic region it is well known that the lhf plays crucial roles in genesis and intensification of the tc the significant role of lhf is that first occurs in the outer region during early developing stage of the tc and gradually intrudes into the inner region chen et al 2014 gao et al 2019 it is noteworthy that the similar features are predicted by the model and also in the analyses as the days increase the lhf is slowly encroached the inner region of the tc the genesis of the tc was observed on 26th april by imd the day 3 fig 5d day 2 fig 5g and day 1 fig 5j forecasts valid at 00 utc 26th april 2019 from the model ics 23rd to 25th respectively are well predicted the genesis of the tc and the lhfs are more concentrated around the inner core of the storm however the magnitude of the lhfs is higher about 50 70 w m 2 in the fig 5j day 1 as compared to other forecasts fig 5d and g the day 2 forecast fig 5g is showing the feeble cyclonic circulation with low intensity lhfs around the inner region it is also manifested that the model predicted lhfs are increased markedly after the genesis of the tc indeed the features of the co evolution of the moisture fluxes and lhfs travelled over the underlying ocean are quite similar fig 6 is same as fig 2 but for the spatial distribution of ertel potential vorticity hereafter pv on the 320 k isentropic surface the pv from model analyses and forecasts are compared with the era5 reanalyses fig 3m r for the period 23rd to 28th april 2019 these reanalyses are revealed that the gradual increase of intensity of the pv around inner region of the tc from early stage to developed stage the distribution of high pv exceeding 3 0 pvu 1 pvu 10 6 k m2 kg 1 s 1 inner region of the storm is clearly predicted by the model in the same time the low pv is noticed around the southwest part of the cyclonic disturbance this dynamical variation emerged to cause the establishment of a strong transport of moisture fluxes fig 4 from underlying ocean into the vicinity of inner core of the storm the high pv zone aggravated the cyclonic flow the reanalyses showed conspicuous band shaped pv around the storm the value of pv increases with lead time similar structure of pv also predicted around the tc by the model in all days the predicted values of pv gradually increased and swirling around the tc with the increase of forecast lengths it is clearly suggested that the storm retains the intensity and structure from one stage to another stage the above discussions clearly suggested that the high resolution ncum r model is capable to predict the pre genesis genesis of the storm three days before we further discuss the predictability of the storm fani by the ncum r modeling system in the following section 5 2 prediction of tc fani this section dealt the prediction of the tc based on dynamic thermodynamic parameters intensity track and its errors and various indexes the model simulated results are verified with the era5 reanalyses 5 2 1 equivalent potential temperature and moisture flux the equivalent potential temperature θe within the boundary layer plays a crucial role for triggering and maintaining the convection around the eyewall of the tc as well as spiral rainbands by which the conversion of kinematic energy is accomplished emanuel 1986 hogsett and zhang 2009 the low level θe k and vertically integrated moisture flux upto 850 hpa streamline kg m 1 s 1 from model analyses and forecasts upto day 3 at different stages of tc dd cs vscs escs and 24 h before landfall are illustrated in fig 7 a d e h i l m p and q t respectively the model analyses and forecasts are verified against the era5 reanalyses during the period 27th and 29th april to 05 may 2019 in reanalysis fig 8 a the low value of θe 340 k is noticed over the eio region in the early stage of tc along with weak flow of moisture flux however the model analysis fig 7a has shown similar pattern over the same region with a little higher value of θe 343 k a systematic increase and spreading of θe and spiraling of moisture flux are clearly indicated during day 1 to day 3 forecasts fig 7b d it is worth to mention that the model analysis and forecasts based on ic27 is reasonably well represented the evolution of intensity from dd to vscs stage of the tc fig 7i the spatial pattern of θe and moisture flux in the forecast is reasonably well matched with era5 reanalyses fig 8a c over the period but the magnitude of θe from the model is higher by 6 9 k than the era5 the run based on ic29 fig 7ii storm intensified dd to cs stage the magnitude of the analyzed θe and inward transport of moisture flux fig 7e is increased around the storm as compared to the previous day analyses from day 1 to day 3 forecasts fig 7f h it is noticed that the values of θe increase inward rapidly in the eyewall region and also seen the organized moisture flux convergence around the storm it is a clear indication of large scale inflow of moist air continually which is acquiring energy from the underlying ocean towards the inner region of the cyclonic system therefore the system further enhanced the intensity from vscs to escs stage the era5 reanalyses are also clearly shows the monotonically increase of θe over the region during the period similarly with a prominent inward increase of θe and transport of moisture flux in close proximity to the storm s eyewall is seen in the analysis and forecasts from the ic30 based model runs fig 7iii vscs stage these images clearly differentiate the intensification and northwestward movement of the tc during 30th april to 03rd may 2019 fig 7i l the increase of θe plays an important role for intensification of the storm malkus and riehl 1960 emanuel 1986 therefore one can certainly expect that sudden increase of eyewall updraft condense more water and consequently supply larger amounts of latent heating eastin et al 2005 also found that the meso vortices embedded with the tc transferred high amount of θe in the eye into the eyewall enhanced more buoyant updraft as per imd report the tc was landfall at puri odisha coast on 3rd may 2019 early morning with maximum wind speed 100 kts and gradually weakened when moved northeastward from the model runs based on ic01 fig 7iv escs stage the analysis fig 7m is showing well organized and high amount of θe as compared to the previous days of analyses the value of θe is progressively increased around the storm 346 to 355 k from analysis to day 2 forecast fig 7m o thereafter from day 2 03rd may 2019 the model is simulated low values of θe 346 k and inward moisture flux around the storm s eyewall i e the tendency to dissipate of the tc from fig 7v run based on ic02 i e 24 h before landfall of tc the high magnitude of θe 352 k and strong convergence of moisture flux around the eyewall of the storm is noticed in the model initial time that time the tc was escs stage as per imd report the value of θe is significantly reduced to 343 k in day 1 forecast while the cyclone touched the odisha coast the decreasing tendency of θe and transport of moisture flux is also simulated by the model in subsequent forecasts similar tendency also noticed in the era5 reanalyses fig 8 during the period from the fig 7 it can be clearly inferred that the model is reasonably well predicted the various stages of the tc in analyses and forecasts the pattern and spatial distribution of model analyses and simulated θe is reasonably well matched with the era5 reanalyses fig 8 however the magnitude of θe and strength of moisture flux transport around the storm are higher in the model analyses and forecasts as compared to the era5 reanalyses this discrepancy is due to the high resolution model analyses and forecasts 04 km in contrast to the era5 reanalyses 30 km resolution 5 2 2 prediction of intensity fig 9 a e shows the evolution of intensity 06 h intervals in terms of mslp hpa and msw kts from various model runs based on the different stages of tc such as dd ic27 cs ic29 vscs ic30 escs ic01 and 24hr before landfall ic02 respectively along with imd best estimated msw data the root mean square error rmse of mslp and msw from initial hour to 72 h forecasts is depicted in fig 9f the rmse and correlation coefficient cc are calculated with respect to the imd best estimated data in dd stage ic27 fig 9a the model simulated central mslps are well aggregated with imd observations upto 24 h forecasts afterward the model shows rapid intensification of the storm however the imd estimated central mslp of the storm is showing little variation during the period the observed msw shows early intensification upto 12 h no changes in intensity upto 48 h and subsequently the intensity of the storm increased the pattern of the evolution of model simulated msw is reasonably well match with the observation though the intensity is over predicted by the model during the period the rmse cc of mslp and msw are 12 79 hpa 0 98 and 14 86 kts 0 94 respectively from model runs based on ic29 i e cs stage of tc fig 9b the simulated mslp indicates rapid intensification of the storm upto 48 h however the observation showed a gradual deepening of mslp during the period the values of mslp at 60 and 72 h forecast are well matched with the observation during this period the storm rapidly intensified from cs scs vscs and escs stages i e developing stage to mature stage every 12 h intervals as per imd report the observed values of msw rapidly increased from 45 to 105 kts during the period however similar trend is also seen in the model simulated msw upto 48 h 42 to 106 kts with a higher intensity as compared to imd observed msw and subsequently showing a gradual weakening of the system it is deduced that the model is able to sustain the rapid intensification upto 48 h in this case the rmse cc of mslp and msw are 12 39 hpa 0 82 and 17 75 kts 0 67 respectively from fig 9c as the model initialized at vscs stage ic30 the model simulated pattern of evolution of the intensity in terms of mslp and msw is exactly matched with the observed pattern of imd however the model simulated intensity is under predicted as compared to imd observations throughout the period the forecasted storm reached its peak intensity with mslp 942 hpa at 60 h and msw 96 kts at 48 h while imd observed that the mslp 932 hpa and msw 115 kts at 60 h time the rmse and cc of mslp msw are 12 60 hpa 24 13 kts and 0 97 0 91 during this period respectively in fig 9d ic01 initialized at escs stage the model simulated intensity and observations are well correlated each other during the period with rmsc 16 83 hpa and 17 94 kts and cc 0 84 and 0 94 for mslp and msw respectively the time of peak intensity at 36 h is exactly captured by the model as compared to observation but the value of predicted intensity is lower than the observations it is clearly seen from the figure the model is reasonably well captured the time of dissipation after 48 h forecast i e 00 utc 03 may 2019 of the storm the intensity of the storm during dissipation stage is also reasonably well matched with observation imd clearly reported that the storm suddenly weakened at 00 utc 03 may 2019 onward by increasing 13 hpa of mslp and decreasing 10 kts in msw within 03 h interval the model predicted similar trend exactly by increasing of 12 hpa mslp and decreasing of 08 kts msw the rmsc and cc of mslp msw are 16 83 17 94 and 0 84 0 94 respectively in similar fashion the peak intensity time at 12 h and weakening of the storm are well predicted when the model was initialized at 24 h before landfall of the storm ic02 fig 9e the sudden pressure drop around 11 hpa and rapid increase of msw about 20 kts within 12 h interval is simulated by the model the features are well correlated with the observation by estimated pressure drop 13 hpa and increase of msw 10 kts the model is also well simulated the process of rapid dissipation as the storm get landfall 24 h by increase decrease of central pressure msw about 14 hpa 29 kts the model simulated pattern of mslp 0 97 and msw 0 93 is highly correlated with the observations while the rmsc of mslp and msw is about 20 6 hpa and 28 44 kts during the period respectively the rmse calculated at different forecasts length upto 72 h during the life span of storm is depicted in fig 9f the rmse of mslp 18 hpa and msw 27 kts from model initial time is higher than the other forecast hours the rmse of mslp is gradually decreased after 24 h forecast with increase of forecast length the similar trend is not followed by the msw the overall results from the fig 9 a e deduced that the pattern of intensification and dissipation of the storm is reasonably captured by the model when it initialized at higher intensity stages more than cs category routray et al 2016 2019 it is also clearly seen from the fig 9 the intensity is under over predicted when the model initialized at the scs stage or more cs or lower stage respectively the pdi 1010 kts3 and ace 104 kts2 calculated from different model runs based on various ics during the life span of the storm are depicted in fig 10 a and b respectively both the model and observation the pdi fig 10a values are gradually increased upto 30 00 i e model run based on ic30 afterward the values are decreased with the advancement of the model runs based on different ics the model simulated pdi values are higher than the observation upto ic29 run it is clearly suggested that the model is predicted more intense storm when the model initialized at low category stage of storm when the cyclone fully matured with high msw the model simulated pdi is drastically reduced than the observed pdi it inferred that the model is not able to capture the exact intensity of the storm as compared to the observed however the evolution pattern of the pdi of the storm from the model is reasonably well correlated with the observed pattern during different stages of the tc the maximum pdi is simulated on ic30 run mature stage of the tc i e vscs to escs about 32 1010 kts3 whereas the observation is around 39 1010 kts3 from ic27 based run i e dd to scs stage the model predicted pdi is 17 1010 kts3 as compared to observed pdi 7 1010 kts3 the model pdi is increased by about 12 1010 kts3 from the preceding value while the observed pdi increased around 5 1010 kts3 from ic01 run from escs to cs the value of model pdi is suddenly reduced by 15 1010 kts3 as compared to observation 5 1010 kts3 the pdi is deduced that the model has shown a tendency of early rapidification with sudden dissipation of the storm the pattern of the ace fig 10b is similar to pdi with high value about 10 104 kts2 on ic30 run as compared to 13 104 kts2 however the ace value is increased by 3 104 kts2 in the observation like the pdi the model simulated ace is also showing early intensification and sudden dissipation of the storm during the life span 5 2 3 storm relative helicity and potential instability both the area 2 2 around the centre of tc and time upto 72 h forecasts averaged model simulated srh at 0 1 km and 0 3 km from different ics based runs and verified with the corresponding era5 reanalyses are depicted in fig 11 a and b respectively the averaged srh values from model and era5 at 0 1 km fig 11a and 0 3 km fig 11b are gradually increased from early stage to mature stage of the tc upto 30 00 ic30 run afterward the values are slowly decreased in the ic30 based run the model forecasts exclusively covered the most intense period of the cyclone vscs to escs as per imd observations the cyclone is rapidly intensified during this period which is clearly seen from the value of the msw and mslp in the fig 9c it is noted that the peak values of srh from model and era5 in both layers found in the ic30 based run which coincide with the fig 9c it is assumed that the intense convection and updraft within the eyewall of the tc is reasonably well simulated by the model during the period however the model simulated srh values at 0 1 km and 0 3 km layers are higher than the era5 about 08 m2 s 2 and 12 m2 s 2 respectively in the next day based run ic01 the storm entered into the dissipation stage after 48 h i e 03 april 2019 the srh values are reduced during the period relative to the preceding day in the model era5 by 07 12 and 33 45 m2 s 2 at 0 1 km and 0 3 km layers respectively it means that the model is gradually slowdown the convection and started downdraft around the eyewall during the period from the figure the model simulated srh is higher than the era5 on 0 1 km layer fig 11a throughout the life span of the storm except in ic02 and ic03 based runs in contrast to fig 11a the value of srh fig 11b from era5 is higher than the model simulated srh value upto ic29 based runs whereas the model value of srh increased afterward it is worth to mention that the srh values from model and era5 at 0 3 km layer are relatively higher than the corresponding values of srh obtained from 0 to 1 km layer molinari and vollaro 2008 also found similar results from their observational study using dropsound datasets around the eyewall of the hurricane bonnie 1998 that the srh values were higher in the upper layer than the srh values in lower layer based on the results of this study they suggested that large value of srh plays an important role for favoring strong convection the presence of large srh grew the deep and long lasting cells in the vicinity of the storm from the figure it is clearly inferred that the model is able to predict the srh reasonably well at different stages of the storm and the values are comparable with the era5 the area and time averaged like srh potential thermal instability pi calculated from different ics based runs and verified with the corresponding era5 reanalyses is described in fig 11c the low value of pi corresponds to the higher thermal instability unstable of atmosphere from the figure it is clearly seen that the pi values are higher during early stages of the storm and gradually decreased as the storm intensified further it shows that the pi values slowly increase as the storm move towards dissipation stage the minimum values of pi is simulated by the model with ic30 4 02 c and ic01 4 14 c based runs during this period the cyclone was fully matured mainly ic30 based run whereas the tc entered into the dissipation stage after 48 h in ic01 based run i e 03 april 2019 as a result the model simulated pi value slightly increased in the ic01 as compared to the ic30 based runs the era5 is also showing in similar trends with high values of pi during the dissipating period it is clear that the increased convective instability during the periods with maximum intensification and wind speeds the feature is plausible well matched with the pdi and ace fig 10 the high thermal instability triggered the eyewall convection contributing to strong updraft of the cells that enhance the srh fig 11a and b the pi values from era5 are slightly higher in the early stages of the tc upto ic28 and further increased and comparable to the model simulated pi values the pattern of distribution of model simulated pi values is correlated reasonably well with the era5 during the life span of the storm 5 2 4 time series of thermodynamical parameters the area averaged 2 2 time variations of thermodynamical variables such as vimt lhf gpp and vertically integrated moisture convergence vimc from the model simulations at different stages of cyclone and its comparison with era5 reanalyses are represented in fig 12 a b c d e f and g h respectively the various model simulations upto 72 h are obtained from the ic27 dd ic29 cs ic30 vscs ic01 escs and ic02 24 h before landfall and the corresponding era5 reanalyses 5 2 4 1 vertical integrated moisture transport vimt the model simulated vimt fig 12a is progressively increased with the increase of the forecast length in ic27 based run dd stage during this period the storm intensified from dd to vscs stage as per imd report it shows that the simulated moisture transport clearly associated with the intensity of the storm during the period the model simulated vimt is little higher at initial forecast hours upto 24 h and decreased afterward as compared to the era5 sd27 fig 12b in both ic29 and ic30 based simulations it is clearly seen that the storm is rapidly intensified as the value of vimt shot up from 600 to 1500 kg m 1 s 1 during the period the features are reasonably well matched with the imd and simulated msw in fig 9b and c it is also seen that the high thermal instability fig 11c is noticed during the period which certainly enhanced the transport of moisture from the underlying ocean into the vicinity of the storm core from era5 reanalyses sd30 fig 12b it is observed that the temporally variation of vimt occurred several times during the intensification of the storm it means that the era5 reanalyses are not properly maintained the rapid intensification of the storm the rapid intensification of the tc is appropriately represented by the model simulation based on ic29 and ic30 runs it is evident that the strong moisture transport is simulated in ic30 run compared to the ic29 runs in ic01 simulation the slow increment of vimt is observed during the mature phase of the storm it is also known that the intensity of the storm does not vary much during the mature phase and gradually entered into the dissipation stage hence the variation of model simulated vimt is relatively less among the forecast hours during the mature stage as compared to the developing phase of the storm however the value of vimt is higher in this run than the preceding runs another indication is that the weakening of the storm is simulated by the model i e decreased of vimt after 48 h forecast 03 may 2019 these features are also noticed in the era5 sd01 with the fluctuation of the vimt during the period in ic02 run the value of vimt after 12 h forecast is gradually decreased with increase of the forecast length it meant that the storm is slowly dissipated which captured by the model on the other hand at pick phase the vimt at 12 h is lower than the initial time in era5 sd02 which disagrees with the imd best track data the pattern of vimt during dissipation stage of the storm is well comparable with the era5 reanalyses however the model simulated little stronger vimt during the dissipation period 5 2 4 2 latent heat flux lhf the lhf from model simulations based on various ics and era5 are depicted in fig 12c and d respectively from the era5 sd27 fig 12d the lhf is varying from the range 153 to 157 w m 2 in the early phase of the storm dd stage upto 12 h the lhf increased significantly in subsequent hours while the tc intensified at initial time 00 utc of 27 april 2019 the tc was dd stage after 12 h the storm became cs continued upto 54 h and further intensified from scs to vscs stage as per imd best track data from the ic27 based run fig 12c the lhf values are steadily increased upto 36 h and further increased significantly the lhf value is increased from initial time to 12 h forecast dd to cs stage by 27 w m 2 while the era5 sd27 decreased by 5 w m 2 during the period the era5 is showing the early intensification of the tc about 30 h as compared to the model simulation 18 h the intensification of the tc in this model simulation ic27 is reasonably well correlated with the imd best track data the maximum minimum value of lhf is predicted by the model 310 154 w m 2 as compared to the lhf from era5 around 362 153 w m 2 during the period it is important to mention that the lhf value changes associated with the storm are consistent with the time series of central pressure fig 9a during 24 72 h forecast during this period the high value of lhf 310 w m 2 is predicted at 72 h forecast as the tc deepened to vscs stage at the same time the model predicted the minimum mslp 953 hpa from sd29 it is clearly seen that the lhf values are considerably increased with the increase of analyses hours while the tc intensified from cs to escs stage during the period the distribution pattern of the lhf from sd29 is well matched with the time series of the msw and mslp fig 9b during the period however the model simulated lhf is gradually increased without much variation during the period as compared to the era5 the model predicted lhf values are lesser than the era5 in ic30 based run the lhf is increased with forecast hours upto 48 h the maximum values of the lhf are found at 36 h 391 w m 2 and 48 h 496 w m 2 forecasts however the era5 sd30 shows the increase of lhf upto 36 h with the maximum value 573 w m 2 and gradually decreased afterward the decrease trend of lhf is noticed at the peak intensity time of tc in sd30 the lhf value is significantly raised by 110 w m 2 from 24 h to 36 h forecast time whereas 62 w m 2 of lhf increase in sd30 during the period the rapid intensification of the storm is clearly represented by the model as compared to sd30 the pattern of the lhf is closely followed the simulated pattern of the msw in fig 9c as per imd best track data the tc attained the peak intensity at 60 h 12 utc 02 may 2019 with msw 115 kts the ic30 and sd30 showed the occurrence of peak intensity of the tc i e high values of lhf 12 and 24 h earlier than the actual occurrence respectively the simulated lhf increased substantially in ic30 based run consistent with the increase of the moisture transport during the period fig 12a the considerable increase of moisture transport to core of the tc leads to intensification of the storm through enhance of latent heating from ic01 based run escs stage the lhf value increased gradually upto 24 h and peak value 456 w m 2 simulated at 36 h forecast the model is able to simulate the peak phase of the storm with high value of lhf the peak phase of the tc was observed at 12 utc 02 may 2019 with maximum msw 115 kts and central pressure drop about 66 hpa however the high value of lhf 573 w m 2 is noticed at 12 h in the era5 sd01 during dissipation stage the model simulated lhf drastically reduced after 48 h forecast the sd01 followed the similar trend of sudden fall of the lhf after 48 h the evolution of lhf from the model is closely followed the time variations of the vimt fig 12a during the period it is essential to discuss that the shrink of moisture transport fig 12a into the storm is systematically reduced the lhf fig 12c thus causing the attenuated intensity of the tc it is also observed that the evolution of the lhf is strongly correlated with the mslp and msw fig 9d during the period in ic02 based run 24 h before landfall the storm starts dissipate with decreased of the lhf after landfall 24 h 00 utc 03 may 2019 the sd02 is also showing the dissipation of the storm after 24 h the time variations of lhf from model and era5 are well correlated with the msw and mslp pattern from the figure it is deduced that the model initialized at different stages of storm is able to produce the lhf around the tc and established a strong correlation between the lhf and msw as well as with the mslp 5 2 4 3 genesis potential parameter gpp the gpp from model simulations based on different ics run and era5 reanalyses are illustrated in fig 12e and f respectively the sd27 fig 12f is showing the substantial increase of analyzed gpp throughout the analysis time clearly indicate that the storm have potential to intensify further during the developing phase in similar fashion the model simulated gpp ic27 fig 12e is also increased throughout the forecast hours however the values of gpp are higher in the era5 as compared to ic27 from the ic29 the steady growth of gpp is simulated by the model during the period whereas the rise and fall pattern of the gpp is seen in the sd29 during the period the simulated values of gpp are lesser than the era5 it is suggested that the sd29 restrain high potential to intensify the storm during the period from ic30 based runs the gpp is increased slowly upto 24 h forecast and rise significantly afterward as the tc intensified in contrast the gpp values sd30 are decreased upto 24 h while the increase trend of the gpp is observed afterward it is noticed that the gpp values are higher at the peak phase of the tc the gpp is determining the potential for intensification of the storm the time variations of gpp from the model are relative well correlated with the pattern of the lhf fig 12c the increase of gpp is evidently caused due to the large transport of moisture flux into the vicinity of the storm fig 12a it substantially leads to the intensification of the tc through enhance of the lhf goswami et al 2015 fujiwara et al 2017 from ic01 the quite slow growth of gpp is simulated by the model during the mature stage of the tc it is also noticed that the dip of the gpp value is simulated by the model during weakening phase of tc however the gpp from sd01 is significantly increased upto 48 h and sudden decreased afterward the value of gpp from the sd01 is higher than the ic01 throughout forecast hours the high value of gpp is noticed upto 12 h and 24 h from model simulation and era5 respectively both the ic02 and sd02 are showing sudden decrease of gpp during the dissipation phase of the tc it infers from the figure that the pattern of gpp is strongly correlated with the pattern of the vimt and lhf 5 2 4 4 vertical integrated moisture convergence vimc fig 12g and h demonstrated the vimc from model simulations based on various ics runs and era5 reanalyses the rising trend of the vimc is observed in the early to developing stages of the storm in ic27 based run however the era5 sd27 is showing the variation of the vimc values during the period this contradict is due to the low resolution of the era5 in compared to model simulation the strong moisture convergence around the tc is simulated by the model than the era5 the increase of vimc is evidently caused by the large moisture transport from underlying ocean fig 12a into the vicinity of the tc during the period the pattern of the vimc from era5 is not well matched with the vimt fig 12b the vimc is increased throughout the forecast hours in both ic29 and ic30 based runs the similar trend is also noticed in the era5 reanalyses but the value of vimc decreased at 60 and 72 h in sd30 the result inferred that the evolution of vimc from the model is closely associated with the intensity of the cyclone during the period from ic01 and ic02 the magnitude of the vimc is higher in the mature stage of the tc and gradually decreased during the weakening phase of the tc however the ic01 and sd01 are shown early dissipation of the storm with time lag 24 h as the value of vimc decreases after 24 h it is seen from the figure the time variations of the vimc from model simulations and era5 are considerably well correlated with vimt yoshida and itoh 2012 the study by chansaengkrachang et al 2018 established a relationship between precipitation and vimc over thailand region during rainy and summer seasons from the years 1999 to 2013 they found that a large positive correlation between precipitation and vimc we have calculated the rainrate from different ics based runs figure not provided it is observed that a strong correlation is also noticed in the evolution of both rainrate and vimc 5 2 5 track and its errors the predicted tracks 12hrly from various ics based runs and imd best track data are shown in fig 13 a the initial position error and mean direct position errors dpes from the model simulations from different sets of ics and era5 are depicted in fig 13b and c respectively the errors are calculated with respect to the imd best track data the imd best track shows that the tc initially moved northwestwards upto 30th april 2019 and then recurved northeastwards from 01st may 2019 the cyclone crossed the odisha coast between 03 and 05 utc of 03rd may 2019 it is observed that all the predicted tracks from different ics based run coincide comparatively well with the imd best track although the movement of the simulated tc is somewhat too fast during early phases upto ic28 during developing and mature stages the migrating speed of the predicted cyclone is closely matched with the observed track in the ic26 and ic29 it is seen that there is a northeastward deviation in the initial position of the tc from the observation hence the initial position errors fig 13b are appreciably large during this period the initial position errors from era5 are also considerably high during the period the forecasted position of the tc is diverged from the observed track after 24 h forecast in ic26 based run as well as the movement of tc is fast to some extent therefore the model simulated mean dpe fig 13c is about 171 km in this run the initial position errors from ic27 ic28 are higher lower than the era5 respectively subsequently the mean dpes are higher lower in the ic27 ic28 as compared to the era5 the simulated track from the ic29 coincides relatively well with the observed track in all the forecast hours which is clearly reflected in the mean dpe about 86 km it is noted that the model is able to predict the recurvature of the storm after 48 h forecast 01 may 2019 and moved northeastward along the observed track the time of the recurvature is exactly matched with the imd best track data in similar fashion the ic30 is able to predict the recurvature of the tc 12 h early the simulated track is considerably drifted away from the observed track throughout the forecast hours therefore the mean dpe is higher 193 km during this period even if the initial position is less than 50 km the initial error and mean dpe from era5 are lesser than the ncum r it is clearly seen from the fig 13b the initial position errors are notably reduced in ic01 39 km ic02 35 km and ic03 24 km as compared to the era5 i e 40 17 and 19 km respectively consequently the model simulated position and migrating speed of the tc are remarkably matched overlapped with the imd best track data during these periods hence the mean dpes are reduced to 66 72 and 72 km in ic01 ic02 and ic03 as compared to era5 i e 28 29 and 35 km respectively it is worth mentioning that the mean dpes are less than 100 km predicted by the model in 05 instants out of 08 during the life span of the tc it is manifested that the mean dpes are decreased with increase of the forecast lengths except in ic30 it means that the prediction of the track is improved when the model initialized as the tc intensity is greater than cs category routray et al 2017 2019 the landfall position and time errors are calculated from the ic01 ic02 and ic03 based model runs the landfall position error is reduced to 15 km in the ic02 based runs in comparison to the ic01 97 km and ic03 29 km however the error at the time of landfall is delayed by 04 h 30 min in the ic02 it is suggested that the simulated speed of the tc is lower than the observed during the landfall time in the case of ic01 and ic03 the landfall time error is 02 h 30 min ahead and 30 min delay respectively the mean rmse of dpe cross track ct and along track at is provided in fig 13d the mean rmse of dpe and ct are shown the increasing tendency as the forecast length increased however the mean rmses of at are showing mix results throughout the forecast hours it is interesting to mention that the ic29 and ic30 based runs show the recurvature of the tc after 00 utc 01 may 2019 and moved north northeastward however the ic30 simulated track deviated more northeastward as compared to the ic29 simulated track hence the high value of mean dpe is noticed in the ic30 fig 13c even if less initial position error fig 13b it is necessary to understand the possible reasons for deviation of the track in the ic30 based run it is well known that the movement of the storm is generally steered by the environmental large scale flows as well as interact with the tcs environment holland 1983 wu and wang 2000 osuri et al 2017 etc fig 14 a b and c d provides the simulated streamline at 500 hpa and total precipitable water tpw mm from ic29 and ic30 based runs valid at 00 utc of 01 and 02 may 2019 respectively as shown in the fig 14a i e day 2 forecast valid at 00 utc 01 may 2019 of ic29 the land ridge over southwestern part of india ridge axis running from 120 to 190n thick black line and subtropical ridge extended from 220 to 350n do not permit the tc to move northwestward direction hence the tc recurved towards the north northeastward unlike in the ic29 the land ridge became stronger axis of ridge extended to higher latitude and longitude and leaning more towards the northeast as well as close to the vortex of the storm in the ic30 fig 14b therefore the tc is pushed more towards northeast direction as compared to the ic29 the maximum tpw is also simulated by ic30 in the eastern sector of the tc as compared to the ic29 the orientation of the tpw distribution clearly suggested that the tc intends to move more towards northeast direction fig 14b in the fig 14c i e day 3 forecast valid at 00 utc 02 may 2019 ic29 it is clearly seen that the storm is trapped in between the diverged flow of streamline around central part of india and an elongated ridge black curved line from southeastern to northern sectors of the tc so the tc maintained the recurvature and did not drift away from the observed track during the period in contrast to ic29 the features of diverged streamline flow are more closed to the east coast of india in the ic30 based run fig 14d it is also seen that a spurious ridge developed in the northern sector as well as high values of tpw and strong south westerlies in the northeast sector of the storm simulated by the ic30 run it is also observed in this particular run the south westerlies became purely strong westerlies after crossed the myanmar coast which drag the tc more towards northeastward these aforesaid features may be responsible to push the tc more towards northeast direction in ic30 as compared to the ic29 many previous studies suggested that the storm moved towards the maximum area of pv wu and wang 2000 osuri et al 2017 etc the spatial distribution of pv of day 1 and day 2 from ic29 and the difference plots day 1 minus day 2 and day 2 minus day 3 of pv valid at 00 utc 01 and 02 may 2019 from ic30 and ic29 represented in fig 15 a b and c d respectively from the fig 15a and b it is clearly seen that the orientation of positive pv distribution is more towards north northwest direction in ic29 run however in the difference plots fig 15c and d the distribution of positive pv is east northeast direction it is clearly inferred that the ic30 based run is showing positive tendency of pv towards the northeast direction hence the deviation of the track of the tc is more in the ic30 run as compared to the ic29 track the steering flow environmental flow plays a significant role for movement of the system by advecting vorticity to the front of the storm chan and gray 1982 osuri et al 2015 similar to fig 15 a b and c d the composite deep layer 850 200 hpa mean wind m s 1 is calculated and presented in fig 15 e f and g h there is a clear difference in northeastward steering flow in the fig 15g and h which caused the storm to move further northeastward in ic30 based run it is evident that the environmental flow is considerably strong in ic30 than the ic29 and makes the tc to move along the flow similar results were also obtained by osuri et al 2015 2017 the latitudinally 09 16on averaged vertical cross section time and longitude of upper air divergence field 10 5s 1 and wind between 300 and 100 hpa layers are analyzed in fig 15i and j from the ic29 and ic30 based runs respectively in the ic29 based run fig 15i the wind pattern clearly shows that the storm moved northwestward upto 48 h forecast 00 utc 01 may 2019 then moved north northeast direction therefore the upper air divergence field follows the correct path with the forecast time the feature is well correlated with the predicted track fig 13a and also imd best estimated track in contrast to ic29 the wind pattern from the ic30 shows the northwestward flow in early forecast hours upto 18 utc 30 april 2019 subsequently the high magnitude of northeastward wind is seen in higher forecast hours fig 15j the vertical cross section of the divergence field and the wind pattern distinctly depicts a preferential northeastward movement with time in the ic30 based run fig 15j which steered the tc northeastward with the forecast lead time 6 summary and conclusion the present study investigated the predictive capability of the ncum r for pre and post genesis characteristics associated with the escs fani occurred over bob during 26 april 04 may 2019 to examine the pre genesis of the storm we considered the model analyses and forecasts of ncum r three days prior to the genesis i e 26th april 2019 of the tc the study also further examined the prediction of the tc based on dynamic thermodynamic parameters intensity track and its errors and various indexes the model simulated results during pre and post genesis period are verified with the era5 reanalyses the spatial distribution of the wind fields at 850 hpa is able to predict the pre genesis of the storm three days advance the model simulated wind fields are shown that the cyclonic circulation is more prominent as the forecast lengths increased the model analyses are clearly showed the evolution of the storm during pre genesis period the model simulated and analyzed pattern of the wind fields are well correlated with the era5 reanalyses during the period we further examined the positive feedback process between the intensification of the tc and moisture transport over the underlying ocean through the spatial distribution of vimt during the pre genesis period from the ncum r analyses and forecasts it is clearly seen that the moist westerly flows over the indian ocean and southeast of bob region are gradually increased as the day progress which formed a mcb over the region the strong magnitude more than 550 kg m 1 s 1 of eastward moisture flow through mcb is consistently churning around the storm over the regions as the storm moved northwestward it is clearly suggested that a large scale transport of moisture into the inner region of the cyclonic system from the ocean through mcb further enhanced the intensity of the tc the time evolution of mcb is reasonably well predicted by the model the results from ncum r are well correlated with the previous results obtained from the regional atmospheric models by hegde et al 2016 fujiwara et al 2017 makarieva et al 2017 etc the magnitude of vimt and pattern of mcb over indian ocean is considerably well matched with the era5 reanalyses during the pre genesis period however the magnitude of the vimt from ncum r is slightly higher than the era5 reanalyses the establishment and reinforcement of well organized mcb over the oceanic region facilitate to import moisture into the inner core of the system resulting in the increase of latent heat within the inner vicinity of the tc generally the lhf plays an important role in genesis and intensification of the tc it is noticed in the ncum r analyses and forecasts that the lhf occurs in the outer region during early developing stage and gradually incursion into the inner region of the tc the feature has been suggested by many previous researches chen et al 2014 gao et al 2019 it is worth to mention that the model predicted lhfs are increased noticeably after the genesis of the tc it is also seen that the co evolution of the moisture fluxes and lhfs are quite similar the high resolution ncum r model is able to predict systematically the time evolution of the large scale vapour transport over oceanic region and lhf in the vicinity of the storm during early stages of the system the intensity of the pv from model analyses and simulations is gradually increased around inner region of the tc from early stages to developed stage the low value of pv is also noticed around the southwest part of the cyclonic disturbance the gradient of the pv surrounding the tc is to establish a strong transport of moisture fluxes from the oceanic region into the vicinity of inner core of the storm consequently the intensity of the tc is gradually increased with lead time the model analyses and simulations are clearly shown that the storm retains the intensity and structure during early stage of the tc the features are well correlated with the era5 reanalyses with high magnitude of pv the spatial distribution of θe and moisture fluxes are well simulated by ncum r at different stages of tc dd cs vscs escs and 24 h before landfall and the magnitude gradually increased whenever the tc move from one stage to another stage during life span the evolution of intensity based on mslp and msw clearly shows the rapid intensification and dissipation of the storm in ncum r as compare to imd observations the averaged pdi and ace clearly suggested that the model is predicted more low intense storm when the model initialized at the cs lower matured stage however the evolution pattern of the pdi and ace of the storm from the model is reasonably well correlated with the observed pattern during different stages of the tc the averaged srh at 0 1 km and 0 3 km as well as pi from different ics based runs are well simulated by the model the pattern is also well correlated with the pdi and ace the pattern is also well matched with the era5 the evolution of the area averaged time variations of thermodynamical variables is properly simulated by the ncum r at different stages of cyclone the pattern is well compared with the era5 and also with the imd best track data however it is noticed that the era5 reanalyses having temporal variations in certain parameters these features sometimes disagree with the imd best track data the predicted tracks from different ics based run coincide comparatively well with the imd best track although the movement of the modeled tc is somewhat too fast during early phases the recurvature of the tc is well simulated by the model in ic29 and ic30 based runs and moved northeastward along with the observed track however the simulated track from the ic30 is more diverged from the observed track therefore the dpes are higher in ic30 even if low initial position error as compared to the ic29 the possible reasons for deviation of the track in the ic30 based run are investigated by considering environmental large scale flows which interact with the tcs environment it is noticed that the intense land ridge over indian continent and strong south westerlies in the northeast sector of the storm became strong westerlies after it crossed the myanmar coast are simulated in the ic30 these features may be responsible to drag the storm more towards eastward as compared to the ic29 the orientation of the tpw distribution is clearly suggested that the tc intends to move more towards northeast direction in ic30 the high values of positive pv and strong steering flow over east northeast sector is simulated in the ic30 which caused the storm to move further northeastward the results are well correlated with the previous studies osuri et al 2015 2017 the vertical cross section of the upper air divergence field and the wind pattern distinctly depicts a preferential northeastward movement with time in the ic30 based run which steered the tc northeastward along with the forecast times the study clearly suggested that the ncum r model is able to predict the early genesis genesis and post genesis of the storm the model results show high intensification during early stage of the storm however the rapid intensification and dissipation of the storm are well captured by the model and evolution pattern is reasonably well matched with the imd observations to further support of the conclusion drawn from the present case study more cyclone cases over nio region arabian sea and bob during pre

5204,recent intensification in climate change have resulted in the rise of hydrological extreme events this demands modeling of hydrological processes at high temporal resolution to better understand flow patterns in catchments to model surface and sub surface flows in a catchment we utilized a physically based model called hydrological simulated program fortran and two deep learning based models one deep learning model consisted of only one long short term memory simple lstm whereas the other model simulated processes in each hydrological response unit hru by defining one separate lstm for each hru hru based lstm the models use environmental time series data and two dimensional spatial data to predict surface and sub surface flows at 6 minute time step simultaneously we tested our models in a tropical humid headwater catchment in northern lao pdr and compared their performances our results showed that the simple lstm model outperformed the other models on surface runoff prediction with the lowest mse 7 4e 5 m3 s 1 whereas hru based lstm model better predicted patterns and slopes in sub surface flow in comparison with the other models by having the smallest mse value 3 2e 4 m3 s 1 this study demonstrated the performance of a deep learning model when simulating hydrological cycle with high temporal resolution keywords deep learning model long short term memory lstm sub surface flow surface runoff hydrological simulated program fortran 1 introduction recently increase in precipitation extreme events has been witnessed at global scale papalexiou and montanari 2019 roxy et al 2017 documented threefold increase in rainfall events from 1950 to 2017 in central india the international disaster database noted global annual loss of over 30 billion as a result of floods in last decade roxy et al 2017 to understand the hydrological complexity of flash floods we need to model hydrological phenomena at sub daily time step jodar abellan et al 2019 reynolds et al 2017 has also stressed the need for streamflow prediction at a sub daily time step for flood forecasting in medium sized 10 1000 km2 catchments due to small concentration time the identification of water components contributing to total streamflow plays a key role in understanding bio geochemical cycles and transport processes at catchment scale burns and kendall 2002 accurate estimation of sub surface water flow is critical in time continuous models in comparison with event based models due to the dominance of groundwater in continuous rainfall runoff models huang et al 2016 guse et al 2014 several research groups have developed catchment scale modeling tools such as the soil water assessment tool swat arnold and fohrer 2005 the stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 2001 however most of these hydrological models are used for a single rainfall event or daily simulation because sub hourly simulation is complex and time consuming bennett et al 2016 jeong et al 2010 improved the swat model to simulate stream discharge at a sub hourly time step however some processes in their improved model such as baseflow and lateral flow are still modeled with daily time step the output of these processes modeled at daily time step is then distributed equally at the sub hourly time step this improved swat model has been used to perform sub daily rainfall runoff simulations boithias et al 2017 ficchì et al 2016 modeled streamflow using a four parameter lumped gr4 modified from gr4j which stands for modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier model at different time steps ranging from 6 min to 1 day and studied the impact of frequency on model performance however their study did not model continuous streamflow rather they simulated individual storm events their study found a mixed model response i e both increase 0 7 to 0 8 and decrease 0 8 to 0 69 in kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 for model with increases in temporal resolution temporal resolution of input data also affects simulation results in a catchment model numerous studies have shown that the use of input data with higher temporal frequency improves model accuracy huang et al 2019 wang et al 2009 pang et al 2018 on the other hand simulating model output at a shorter time step causes a reduction in model accuracy gassman et al 2007 boithias et al 2017 bressiani et al 2015 a data driven model is considered as an alternative approach to overcome these complexities and such models have higher predictive accuracy pascual et al 2013 park et al 2019 numerous studies have been conducted to simulate hydrological processes using neural networks nns which is one of the popular types of data driven models ilunga and stephenson 2005 ogwueleka and ogwueleka 2009 several review papers besaw et al 2010 yaseen et al 2015 mosavi et al 2018 have shown that most data driven rainfall runoff models have used daily time steps and very few studies have been conducted using an hourly time step no study mentioned in these reviews showed any data driven model using sub hourly time step for continuous streamflow prediction or estimating both surface and sub surface outflows simultaneously granata et al 2016 also employed a machine learning methodology for sub hourly streamflow simulation however this study focused only on individual hydrographs and not on continuous streamflow prediction long short term memory lstm cell constitute a special type of nn which has also been used for streamflow simulation kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 yan et al 2019 campos et al 2019 the special feature of lstm is its ability to learn time dependent features using its memory thereby it is regarded as an adequate nn for modeling hydrological cycles shen 2018 greff et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge no studies have been published so far that discuss the use of lstms to simulate surface and sub surface flow simultaneously at a sub hourly time step however such a study is required because modeling hydrological response of catchments at minutes scale temporal resolution can enhance the capacity of hydrological models to simulate contaminants whose concentrations vary at logarithmic scale within short span of time such as fecal bacteria in this study we developed two different data driven models based on lstm neural networks and compared their performance with a physical model hspf using sub hourly data collected at the outlet of a highly responsive headwater catchment in northern laos where land use dramatically changed over the past 20 year annual crops was replaced by teak tree plantations managed without understorey as different landuses have different flow patterns change in landuse can affect soil loss or stream water quality ribolzi et al 2017 the specific objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the models ability to perform simulations of surface runoff and sub surface flow at high temporal resolution of 6 min 2 to conduct sensitivity analysis of the models developed in this study and 3 to predict hru level surface and sub surface responses from lstm based models and to analyze whether hru level discretization in lstm based model can yield better result as compared to non hru based lstm model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a 0 6 km2 houay pano headwater catchment located 10 km south of luang prabang city in northern lao p d r it is a sub basin of the houay xon river basin which is a tributary of the mekong river fig 1 the experimental site is part of the critical zone observatories network named multiscale tropical catchments m tropics which belongs to the french research infrastructure ozcar gaillardet et al 2018 this catchment can be considered as being representative of the montane agro ecosystems of south east asia the bedrock is made up of siltstone and fine grained sandstones of permian to upper carboniferous age soils are entisol ultisol and alfisol covering 20 30 and 50 of the catchment respectively chaplot et al 2005 the slope in the area varies from 0 to 171 with an average slope of 54 ribolzi et al 2016 the climate is sub tropical humid the mean annual rainfall is 1500 mm per year however the rainfall pattern is highly seasonal as the monsoon season which runs from mid may to mid october constitutes 77 of the rainfall the average monthly temperature at the site lies between 12 and 35 c with the highest temperature in april just at the beginning of the wet season the humidity level varies from 17 to 100 the catchment experiences several storms during the rainy season with heavy rainfall up to 100 mm h 1 a phenomenon which is characteristic of tropical regions ribolzi et al 2016 we measured hourly temperature celsius relative humidity wind speed m s and solar radiation j m 2 the precipitation electrical conductivity of stream water surface and sub surface flow were measured at 6 minute time step at the study site moreover a survey is conducted every year to ascertain landuse changes in study area more details on data acquisition are given in supplementary information text s1 the area consists of four major land use types consisting of annual crops teak fallow and forests fig s1 recently the area has undergone major land use changes with an increasing number of teak tree plantations ribolzi et al 2017 several studies have been conducted to understand the impact of land use changes on hydrological responses in the area ribolzi et al 2018 patin et al 2018 kim et al 2018 we observed that the increase in teak tree plantations from 2002 onwards has resulted in a decrease of infiltration and consequently an increase in overland flow and sediment yield ribolzi et al 2017 2 2 hydrological simulation program fortran model setup hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is a lumped model for water quality and quantity modeling at catchment scale developed during the 1970s johanson and davis 1980 the steps used to build the hspf model are summarized in fig 2 a we used basins 4 1 kinerson et al 2009 software to prepare the input file for hspf this software pre processes land use shapefiles digital elevation models dem and timeseries data of environmental variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature to prepare an input file for hspf post processing steps were carried out on the input file and input data to incorporate the impact of changing land use details of which are given in the supplementary information text s2 furthermore we performed morris oat morris 1991 sensitivity analysis to find out the most sensitive parameters for the model we chose 13 parameters for each of the four land uses present in the study area for sensitivity analysis table s1 thus the total number of parameters chosen for sensitivity analysis were 52 these 52 parameters are used in equations which control the movement of water on pervious land segments in hspf details on the implementation of the sensitivity analysis can be found in the supplementary information text s3 after sensitivity analysis we calibrated the model by reducing the mean square error mse between observed and predicted outflows which was calculated using the following equation 1 mse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where p i and o i are simulated and observed data respectively and n represents the number of points in the data set we used a truncated newton algorithm nash 1984 provided by the python library scipy jones et al 2001 to minimize the loss function 2 3 long short term memory lstm neural networks nn are a group of algorithms which work similar to how the human neural system is thought to work and are used to recognize patterns fukushima 1980 they consist of a stack of layers of neurons where each neuron is associated with weights and activations nns can be calibrated to learn a non linear function through backpropagation in which the weights and biases in each layer of the nn are optimized by reducing the error loss between observed and predicted output from the network rumelhart et al 1988 the calibrated network which is commonly known as a trained network is then used to predict output from unseen data during validation rumelhart et al 1988 such models based on nns are also considered as black box models where we only deal with input and output while the model itself finds relationships between the input and output data benítez et al 1997 recurrent neural networks rnn are a special kind of neural networks which are designed to work with time series data because of their ability to capture long term temporal dependencies in data rumelhart et al 1988 simple rnns suffer from the problem of vanishing gradient in deep neural networks where they fail to capture long range dependencies hochreiter 1998 one solution to this problem is known as the gated recurrent unit gru and was proposed by cho et al 2014 they introduced the concept of gates which control the flow of information within the recurrent unit another solution to the problem of vanishing gradient was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which is known as long short term memory lstm lstm uses three gates namely forget update and output gates to control the flow of information the current candidate cell state c c t depends on previous activation the current cell state c t is calculated using update and forget gate and then the output gate is used to decide the activations at current time step 2 c c t t a n h w c a t 1 x t b c 3 γ f σ w f c t 1 x t b f 4 γ o σ w o c t 1 x t b o 5 γ u σ w u c t 1 x t b u 6 c t γ u c c t γ f c t 1 7 a t γ o t a n h c t in these equations w and b are weights and biases whose values are calibrated when the model is trained the model is fed with inputs x at time step t and the activation at time step t which is calculated using eq 7 is taken as the output in rainfall runoff modeling model output has strong time dependence there is time delay in the stream response to precipitation talei and chua 2012 and this lag time depends on catchment features singh 1988 lstms have the ability to learn this behavior because of their ability to learn patterns in time series data lin hsu et al 1997 in this study we developed two nn based models the steps to develop a simple lstm model are briefly described in fig 2 b while the steps for a detailed more complex hru based lstm model are summarized in fig 2 c 2 3 1 setup for simple lstm model the simple lstm model fig 2 b consists of only a single lstm layer we chose the parameters to build this nn based on a trial and error procedure this simple lstm model is considered our baseline model and was used to compare the performance of the hru based lstm model the lstm layer takes all input data and is calibrated to produce two outputs which are considered representative of surface and sub surface flow fig 3 although the same lstm layer generates two outputs it does not know which one is surface and which one is sub surface flow however this distinction is made by comparing one first output of the model with observed surface flow and the second output of model with sub surface flow this comparison is done by calculating the mse and then the model adjusts the weights and biases of the lstm layer by back propagation in such a way that it tries to reduce the value of the mse in this way the model learns implicitly that its first output must correspond to surface flow and the second output has to correspond to sub surface flow 2 3 2 setup for hru based lstm model the second structure of lstm model is the hru based structure consisting of 36 parallel nns fig 4 each of these parallel networks is similar to a simple lstm structure however it represents one hydrological response unit hru instead of the whole catchment each parallel nn consists of layered lstm cells with 128 hidden units we chose the number of hidden units based upon hyper parameter optimization results the input to lstm at each time step consists of a 2 dimensional array of shape sequence length input features the sequence length and input features are given in table 1 the output from lstm at each time step is equal to the number of hidden units a fully connected layer was used to convert the output from lstm into the specific dimension however the multiple fully connected layer can increase computation time as well as the model complexity in order to avoid this we used a single fully connected layer instead of a deep neural network after lstm several studies also showed a single fully connected layers for developing hydrological models kratzert et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 kratzert et al 2019a b li et al 2020 the fully connected layer in this study generates two outputs surface runoff and sub surface flow fig 3 within an hru the number of layers in each of the parallel nn and the number of hidden units were decided by hyper parameter optimization and are given in table 1 an hru is defined here as a distinguished land use in a distinguished sub basin this means land uses present in different sub basins were considered as separate hrus this is different from hspf where similar land uses in different sub basis are considered are merged into one hru thus if a land use type e g grass is present in a catchment with 9 sub basins and all the sub basins have this type of land use we will have 9 hrus for this land use and nine separate nns are assigned to simulate processes in these hrus similarly if a forest land use is present in 5 sub basins in the catchment this will result in 5 other hrus in the model this is further illustrated in fig s2 where a catchment consists of 5 sub basins a b c d e and four land use types i ii iii iv and 15 hrus each of the parallel nns in fig 4 shares hru invariant input data such as solar radiation air temperature etc the hru specific input data such as precipitation received by each hru was also prepared and was fed only to the corresponding nns the environmental data such as air temperature and solar radiation is experienced equally by the whole area of the catchment thus all nns share this environmental data on the other hand parameters which depend on hru characteristics such as its area and distance to the outlet were calculated for each hru these hru specific parameters were only fed to the nns representing the corresponding hrus in the model precipitation data was measured for the whole catchment and then precipitation received by each hru was calculated based on the area of that hru this hru specific data can be viewed in figs s7 and s8 as the land use in the study area varies with time this implies that the locations of hrus also vary with time thus all the hru specific data i e distance to outlet area and volume of precipitation received was also calculated accordingly this time varying hru specific data can be viewed in figs s7 and s8 one implication of this is that we considered all possible hrus in the study area for example if the land use grass is not present in sub basin 1 in year 2011 it may appear in 2012 and then disappear again thus we considered the hru grass in sub basin 1 for the whole simulation period though the input values for year 2011 and 2013 will be zeros in this case the catchment area consisted of 9 sub basins and 4 types of land uses thus implying 36 possible hrus as the land use inside a sub basin is distributed and no specific distance from an hru to the catchment outlet can be measured we used the distance of the sub basin from the outlet as representative of all land uses inside that sub basin this means all the land uses hrus inside a sub basin were considered to have the same distance from the outlet as that sub basin this generalization results in certain hrus having the same distance from the outlet however it still maintains hru specific information each of the parallel nns in fig 4 produces two outputs which are considered as representative of hru specific surface and sub surface flow corresponding values of surface and sub surface flow are added in cumulative order this order of addition is the same as the stream filling order in the catchment this cumulative and ordered filling of outputs is similar to realistic stream routing the final values of surface and sub surface flow are considered as model outputs and are compared with observed values to calculate the mean square error using eq 1 this structure allows us to build a detailed model of the catchment where outflow from each land use is simulated separately and instead of one value of total streamflow the surface and subsurface outflow from the catchment are simulated more details on the implementation of this nn in the computer program are given in text s4 of the supplementary information the motivation for hru based lstm model was drawn from physically based models such as swat or hspf where the study area is discretized into smaller hrus all processes are modeled at hru level in these models in order to compare results of lstm based model with hspf the study area was discretized into hrus another purpose of discretizing study area for hru based lstm was to assess the impact of increase in spatial resolution on model performance 2 3 3 hyper parameter optimization hpo based on window size the performance of a nn model is mainly governed by a set of parameters which are used to build the nn such as length of input data fed to it at each time step and number of nodes in a layer hutter et al 2015 these parameters are called hyper parameters and their description and possible ranges are presented in table s3 to achieve the best performance with calibration we need to optimize these parameters because a slight change in any of these parameters can worsen or improve the performance of the model different derivative free optimization algorithms are those which aim to solve problems given as black box lakhmiri et al 2019 direct search and bayesian are one of such methods direct search is an a priori method where the decision maker articulates preferences before optimization bayesian optimization is one of a posteriori methods which aims to generate a representative set of pareto optimal solutions and then the best among them is chosen chen and li 2018 we selected bayesian optimization approach because of it being a popular approach to optimize hyper parameters in machine learning models shahriari et al 2015 snoek et al 2015 frazier 2018 the details about implementation of bayesian optimization are given in text s5 several open source libraries are available for implementing bayesian optimization method in python programming language such as hyperopt bergstra et al 2015 and scikit optimize kumar and head 2017 we used scikit optimize library because it allows the use of gaussian processes as surrogate function implementation of bayesian in hyperopt can be done by making use of tree parzen estimator bergstra et al 2011 the advantage of gaussian processes is that it can consider the interaction between hyper parameters during the optimization dewancker et al 2015 the surrogate function is the probability model of objection function and it calculates the probability of loss with respect of input values in bayesian optimization method this surrogate function is optimized instead of actual objective function the methodology of selecting the new parameter from parameter space was expected improvement to the surrogate function the expected improvement algorithm mockus et al 1978 jones et al 1998 considers the size of the improvement we used default parameters used by scikit optimize kumar and head 2017 library in using gaussian processes these parameters include optimizer kaapa and xi and are described in following sentences the optimizer minimizes the acquisition function we used limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno andrew and gao 2007 as optimizer the parameter kappa controls variance in predicted values and was set to 1 96 the parameter xi determines how much improvement should be taken into consideration over previous best values and was set to 0 01 the computation time of hpo depends upon the number of epochs to train a single model and the number of iterations used for optimization furthermore it also depends upon the complexity of model being built at a specific iteration the computation time in general increased by increasing the sequence length we performed 50 iterations for each sequence length fig s5 the model was trained for 100 epochs during each of these iterations the computation time taken for optimizing hyper parameters was 15 19 25 40 and 45 h for sequence lengths of 20 30 40 50 and 60 respectively although hpo needs considerable computation power this method can improve the model performance by finding the optimal hyperparameter set the model performance depending on the iteration is showed in fig s5 2 4 performance metrics and data splitting the performance of each model was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean squared error mse and percentage bias pbias the mse was calculated according to equation 1 and the equation used to calculate nse and pbias are 8 nse 1 p i o i 2 o i o 2 9 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 where p i is simulated data o i is observed data and n is the number of points in the data set values of mse indicate how closely the predictions follow the observed values in model training 70 of the input data corresponding from january 2011 to january 2013 was applied 15 of the data were used as validation and test respectively all three models produced two outputs surface and sub surface flow and during optimization of parameters an average error of the surface and sub surface flow was calculated this averaged error was then considered as the objective function which each model tries to minimize predicted total discharge is thus the sum of surface and sub surface flows in each case in order to avoid overfitting in lstm based models we used a mild regularization technique namely early stopping goodfellow et al 2016 we checked the performance of the models after each epoch on validation data the model had not processed this data during calibration we stopped calibrating the model when validation loss reached a plateau even if calibration loss kept on decreasing 3 results 3 1 hspf results 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis we carried out sensitivity analysis for sub surface flow and total discharge separately based on the results of sensitivity analysis we selected 12 parameters for baseflow and for total discharge which had the strongest impact on these outflows for calibration not all parameters for baseflow and total discharge are different rather there are some common parameters which had a strong impact on both sub surface flow and total discharge table 2 both sub surface flow and total discharge were highly sensitive to infilt which describes infiltration capacity bicknell et al 2001 while only sub surface flow was sensitive to agwetp basetp and deepfr the parameters agwetp and basetp control the amount of evapotranspiration that can be taken from active groundwater storage and baseflow respectively bicknell et al 2001 as the definitions of these two variables suggest they are closely associated with baseflow thus sensitivity analysis showed these parameters to be more important for sub surface flow which is the sum of groundwater flow and interflow these results are consistent with the similar studies xie and lian 2013 baek et al 2017 diaz ramirez et al 2013 which also demonstrated that intfw ifilt deepfr and agwetp are among the most important parameters for streamflow 3 1 2 estimation of surface and sub surface flow using hspf figs 5 and 6 shows predictions from the hspf model for the calibration validation and test periods we evaluated the performance of the model by measuring the mse and nse for the calibration and test periods separately values of these errors for surface sub surface and total flow are given in table 3 the predicted sub surface flow in figs 5 and 6 is often underestimated while the surface flow simulated by hspf is mostly overestimated this is the reason there is large positive pbias for surface flow and large negative pbias for sub surface flow table 3 although the predicted sub surface flow is very low the predicted total discharge is higher the predicted total discharge is higher because of the large amount of input in the form of surface runoff overestimation of surface flow and under estimation of sub surface flow was also observed by hoang et al 2014 after the application of the swat model to a watershed in denmark this research attributed this behavior to the inadequacy of the model structure for simulating these processes uzsn represents the storage capacity of the upper zone in the hspf model bicknell et al 2001 which is a soil zone table 2 a higher value of uzsn means that the soil has a higher storage capacity and thus more water will be retained in the upper zone which becomes available for evapotranspiration bicknell et al 2001 our calibrated uzsn values are closer to the upper limits which means more water is being retained in the soil zone eventually leading to higher evapotranspiration in other words this means more water is available for evapotranspiration from upper zone we observed that predicted sub surface flow was higher in 2013 as compared to 2011 while it was the lowest in 2012 we observed this trend because of changes in land use during these years fig s9 the rise of sub surface flow in 2013 can be attributed to an increase in fallow land use and a decrease in annual crop land use in 2013 a recent study by ribolzi et al 2017 found a correlation between higher sub surface flow and the increase in teak plantations in this catchments although teak and annual crop land use result in higher surface flow the joint contribution of teak and annual crop decreased in 2013 and the contribution of fallow land use increased the smaller sub surface flow observed during 2012 could be due to the relatively higher teak and annual crop land use during this year as compared to other years 3 2 estimation of surface and sub surface flow using deep learning 3 2 1 simple lstm the simple lstm model consisted of a single lstm layer and was built using the hyper parameters given in table 1 we then used the model calibrated with these hyper parameters for evaluation during the test period the performance of the model during calibration and test for surface sub surface and total flow can be seen in figs 7 8 and table 3 the nse values for surface runoff prediction during calibration and test were 0 43 and 0 64 respectively these nse values categorize the model performance unsatisfactory and satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2015 however pbias which measures average tendency of model to predict flow larger or smaller than observed is mostly between very good 3 2 and good 5 6 table 3 despite this the model captured most of the peaks in surface runoff during both the calibration and test periods however the predicted peaks are mostly lower than the observed peaks this discrepancy can be attributed to the use of mse for model calibration because mse focused to reduce the average error between observation and simulation the inability of model to capture peaks is also evident from flow duration curves for surface sub surface and total discharge fig s13 the percentage exceedance of predicted flows is below the observed in areas of high flows fig s13 for sub surface flow this model predicted almost all the peaks yet failed to follow the trend of rising and falling limbs which resulted in lower nse values another important aspect of simple lstm model is its ability to perform better for surface runoff as compared to sub surface runoff this is evident from table 3 which shows all performance metrics for surface runoff better than those of sub surface flow 3 2 2 hru based lstm model we built the hru based lstm model using information obtained from hpo we used information about the activation function normalization and loss calculation methods and cell type from hpo the choice of activation function affects the kind of non linearity applied options for the loss calculation method were normal or weighted in the weighted loss calculation method the loss value is more sensitive to peak flows the choices for cell type in order to build nn were gru and lstm the hpo was then allowed to decide which of these two cells perform best the hpo algorithm varied the values of these hyper parameters during the optimization process until it found the best combination of hyper parameters this optimization was performed for five different sequence lengths fig s5 shows the results of optimization where the plot for each sequence length indicates how the loss value was reduced it shows how the optimization algorithm attempted to obtain the best hyper parameters for a specific sequence length table 4 enlists configuration of models which resulted in maximum reduction in loss value for each sequence length it can be seen that the best hpo results were mostly obtained using a rectified linear unit relu performing normalization of input data before using it using an lstm cell instead of a gru cell and using the weighted loss calculation method table 4 the values of sequence length and batch size were not optimized using hpo because increasing them is equivalent to increasing the amount of input data being fed to the nn this exponentially increases the amount of computation which requires greater processing and memory resources in this regard we used a trial and error method to obtain better optimum values for other hyper parameters such as sequence length batch size etc the optimized set of hyper parameters which were used to build the hru based lstm model are given in table 1 plots for surface sub surface and total flow for calibration validation and test data are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the performance metrics obtained for this model are given in table 3 we observed underestimation of surface runoff which is similar to what we observed in predicted surface runoff from the simple lstm model however in this case there was more under estimation as compared to the simple lstm this is the reason that the mse value which is the average error for the whole simulation range was higher during calibration and test as compared to the mse value of the simple lstm model the nse values which measure the accuracy of prediction were 0 66 and 0 63 for calibration and test of sub surface flow respectively which makes the model performance satisfactory moriasi et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 overall comparison of three models by comparing the mse and nse values of all three models from table 3 we can conclude that the simple model performed better for surface flow prediction the simple lstm model showed an nse value of 0 64 and mse value of 8 3 5 m3 s 1 for surface runoff prediction which are the best values obtained among all three models although the simple lstm model was meant to serve as a baseline model the more complex hru based lstm model could not perform better for surface flow prediction it is interesting to note that in this case increasing model complexity has not resulted in improved model performance it has already been reported that adding complexity to an nn does not necessarily imply that it will outperform its simpler counterpart makridakis et al 2018 overall performance of all models range from satisfactory to not satisfactory as per criteria set by moriasi et al 2015 one of reasons for this lower accuracy can be attributed to a finer time step of simulation indeed several studies have reported deterioration in model performance for streamflow estimation with increase in simulation time step stern et al 2016 gassman et al 2007 especially in smaller catchments spruill et al 2000 in an extensive review of over 100 swat applications in brazil bressiani et al 2015 found that only 6 of studies with monthly simulations resulted in nse values of less than 0 5 on the other hand when daily time step was used 25 of studies rendered nse value below 0 5 boithias et al 2017 reported degradation of validation nse from 0 66 to 0 49 when streamflow was first simulated at a daily time step and then at an hourly time step the reason for lower accuracy at shorter time steps can be the use of sparsely distributed rainfall gauges which are unable to capture the spatial details of rainfall inputs gassman et al 2007 similarly another explanation for higher model accuracy when using longer time steps is that longer time steps integrate the variability at smaller time steps boithias et al 2017 for sub surface flow although the hspf model performed best in terms of nse the predicted sub surface flow was much lower than the observed sub surface flow the sub surface flow predicted by hspf in figs 5 and 6 is much lower than the observed flow this is the reason we see large negative values of pbias from the flow duration curves for predicted sub surface flow is much below the observed fig s12 the simple lstm model was able to predict most of the peaks for sub surface flow however the value of nse is lower as compared to that of the hru based lstm model the better values of nse for sub surface flow from the hru based lstm model can be attributed to the better prediction of recession in peaks the slopes in the falling limbs of predicted peaks from the hru based lstm model in fig s10 which are absent in the peaks predicted by the simple lstm model if we consider mse values the hru based lstm model outperformed hspf for both surface flow as well as sub surface flow during calibration period in all models the predicted flow peaks were lower than the observed peaks for both surface and sub surface flow except the predicted surface flow from hspf however in hspf the number of predicted storm events were much more than the observed which resulted in a negative nse value in the case of the hru based lstm model although it predicted most of the storm events it still under predicted surface flow the discrepancy between train and test mse was caused by the difference in data distribution during these periods the train data set had larger standard deviation than the validation and test data set table s4 the dataset with larger variance can have large mse munna et al 2015 grams et al 2006 if the training performance of a model is significantly larger than that of test data this indicates overfitting on the other hand better performance for test data set in our case indicates different distribution of training and test data sets 4 2 advantages and limitations of hspf as the hspf is a process driven model thus simulations resulting from it give insights about behavior and condition of catchment the higher values of a variable such as uzsn translate into large storage potential in upper zone of soil however simulation results from hspf are greatly influenced by calculated potential evapotranspiration which itself can vary based on the method of evapotranspiration calculation used our hspf results showed that major portion of the rainfall is evapotranspirated in the hspf model the amount of actual evapotranspiration is increased until the requirement created by the potential evapotranspiration is satisfied if potential evapotranspiration is very high the model allows more available water from storage to return to the environment as actual evapotranspiration in our simulations lower predicted flows from the hspf model may also be due to the overestimation of potential evapotranspiration table s2 as has been the case in the studies of yeh 2017 and prudhomme and williamson 2013 in this study we calculated daily evapotranspiration and then distributed to 6 min by calculating daily sunshine hours this interpolation of daily evapotranspiration to 6 min time step can also be a reason of poor hspf performance there have been several studies showing that using evapotranspiration values calculated at a higher temporal resolution results in better model performance debele et al 2009 the conceptual physically based models can render poor performance if one of the model variable is incorrectly calculated ouellet proulx et al 2019 compared the performance of five different et and evaporation models for rainfall runoff modeling and showed that the choice of et model affects streamflow by 3 to 24 percent on the other hand the deep learning models are less likely to suffer from these errors because they are not explicitly process driven 4 3 advantages of lstm model one of the key characteristics in surface runoff simulations is the lag time between rainfall and surface runoff talei and chua 2012 the lag time between observed surface runoff and incoming rainfall for two storm events of september 2013 can be seen in fig s11 this figure also compares the results of lag time for all three models these storm events are in the test period thus this figure is a good representation of the ability of models to simulate lag time it can be observed in the figure that hspf predicts surface runoff as soon as there is a rainfall event while both our nn models show a lag time although the peaks predicted by the hru based lstm model are lower than those predicted by the other models the model showed responses to both storm events with lag time the simple lstm model takes much less computing time as compared to the hru based lstm model this is self evident because the hru based lstm model has 36 times more parameters to calibrate as compared to the simple model the number of calibration parameters for each nn model can be calculated from the hyper parameters given in table 1 for the simple lstm model there were 258 parameters to calibrate 128 weights and biases for an lstm with 128 hidden units and one weight and bias for the fully connected layer similarly the number of parameters calibrated by the hru based lstm model were 9288 the computation time of hru based lstm model did not scale with number of parameters we observed an average time of 4 min per epoch for hru based lstm while 0 5 min per epoch for simple lstm model we used intel core i7 8700 processor with graphic card of nvidia geforce gtx 1060 having 6 gigabytes of dedicated gpu memory along with 32 gigabytes of random access memory the parallel computing power of tensorflow abadi et al 2016 prevented the scaling of training time with model parameters adie and pradana 2018 the total training time however depends upon the number of training epochs used the hru based lstm model took 262 min for 66 epochs while it took approximately 100 min for simple lstm to train for 214 epochs the results of the lstm based models show that total streamflow was mainly governed by sub surface flow while the surface flow only contributed to flood peaks during rainfall events it can be observed that the predicted flow patterns for sub surface flow and total discharge are the same except for peak heights figs 7 10 the peaks are higher in total discharge which means that surface flow only contributes to increases in peak heights this can also be seen in flow duration curves for all three models figs s12 s13 and s14 where the predicted flow duration curve is always below observed in high flow regions this result is consistent with a previous study within houay pano catchment that showed the larger contribution of baseflow to streamflow during floods ribolzi et al 2018 in our study the total surface and sub surface flow from simple lstm model was 78 and 2160 mm similarly the hru based lstm model also showed dominance of sub surface flow in the catchment the total simulated surface and sub surface flow for three years using hru based lstm model was 32 and 1913 mm respectively the large gap between two values is because of absence of surface runoff during most of the days in year when there is no rainfall under estimation of peak flows using lumped physically based models is a frequent drawback which has been observed in several studies boithias et al 2014 bieger et al 2014 fohrer et al 2014 loukas and vasiliades 2014 we observed a similar trend in sub surface flow predicted by hspf however in our lstm based models this problem is partially solved we can observe large gap between predicted and observed flow duration curve in fig s12 while this gap is smaller for lstm based models figs s13 and s14 the simple lstm model captured peaks in surface runoff more accurately as compared to those predicted by the hru based lstm model this trend was also found in the total estimated discharge from each model when peaks in surface runoff are underestimated peaks in total discharge are also underestimated figs 9 and 10 and when peaks in surface runoff are better estimated peaks in total discharge are also better estimated figs 7 and 8 this means that the predicted surface runoff mainly contributes to peaks in streamflow while the sub surface flow makes up the baseflow portion this makes our lstm based models closer to real observations 4 4 challenges and limitations of lstm models calibrating nn for surface flow is extremely challenging the reason for this is that 96 of the surface flow data consists of zeros because discernable surface runoff only happens during rainfall events this problem is similar to anomaly detection or rare event detection where less than 5 10 of the total data is positively labeled we observed during hpo iterations that total surface flow did not change once it became zero upon further calibration of model it can be argued that as 96 of surface flow has one unique value i e zero the network learns to predict zeros the matching of the surface flow curve became more challenging because surface flow does not always coincide with rainfall events indeed during the hot and dry season generally from january to april the soil is dry and evapotranspiration is high indeed the potential evapotranspiration is higher than rainfall during this period table s2 for small rainfall events during this hot and dry season rainfall is either evapotranspirated or infiltrated however it is not transferred to the stream by surface runoff precipitation absorbed by the soil may later become part of sub surface flow calibrating a nn to learn this behavior is the most difficult part and if hyper parameters are not chosen appropriately the model fails to generalize the surface flow patterns surface and sub surface flows obtained for each of the 36 hrus using hru based lstm model are plotted in fig s6 by comparing these hru specific surface and sub surface responses with the hru specific input data figs s7 and s8 we cannot draw a one to one correspondence between hru specific input data and the corresponding output in certain cases an lstm produces no outflow even when it receives precipitation thus all lstms in our hru specific model are not necessarily representative of hru specific inputs this can be because nns act as black box models and the inner workings of these networks are random karpatne et al 2017 thus we cannot draw a simple link between the weights of a nn and the function being approximated another reason for these unpredictable hru specific outputs could be that we used separate nn for each hru this means that each of these nns have separate weights and biases thus if one network gets higher input values of curve number or precipitation it is completely independent of what the other networks receive as input thus each network forms its own context when it calibrates its weights and biases by looking at the total output of the whole model the interest of model interpretability has increased in the field of machine learning samek 2019 several studies have proposed the ways to incorporate scientific knowledge into deep learning karpatne et al 2017a b wang et al 2020 the suggested method in our study the neural network down into sub models for each hru would be a way to introduce more interpretability into a data driven models in that this approach can analyze sub models in the neural network 5 conclusions in this study we modeled the surface and sub surface flow using three models one lumped model called hspf and two deep learning models one deep learning model consisted of a single lstm representing the whole catchment whereas the second model consisted of lstms representing each hru all three models predicted total flow surface and sub surface flow separately the following conclusions were then derived from the results by replacing the constant values of the area factors in the hspf model with time series values we were able to model land use changes in a catchment although hspf was able to estimate surface and sub surface flow simultaneously it over estimated surface runoff and under estimated sub surface flow contrary to this our deep learning models were more consistent in predicting surface and sub surface flow therefore deep learning models are more suitable when prediction of both surface and sub surface flow is required simultaneously the simple lstm model where one lstm layer is used to represent the whole catchment performed best for surface runoff prediction during both calibration and test period the hru based lstm model performed better than simple lstm model for sub surface flow prediction during both test and calibration period it has the best performance for total streamflow simulation during test period understanding the combined impact of climate change and land use changes on the catchment by modeling surface and sub surface flows at a very high temporal resolution of 6 min can help assessing extreme low and extreme high discharge and improve water resource management this would allow more accurate modeling of pollutants e g fecal bacteria whose concentrations vary exponentially with time this study presents a methodology for incorporating land use changes into hydrological models of surface and sub surface flow at catchment scale this study also demonstrates that deep learning can be an alternative to physically based or conceptual models by taking in account model complexity at spatial and temporal scales credit authorship contribution statement ather abbas conceptualization data curation methodology visualization writing original draft writing

5204,recent intensification in climate change have resulted in the rise of hydrological extreme events this demands modeling of hydrological processes at high temporal resolution to better understand flow patterns in catchments to model surface and sub surface flows in a catchment we utilized a physically based model called hydrological simulated program fortran and two deep learning based models one deep learning model consisted of only one long short term memory simple lstm whereas the other model simulated processes in each hydrological response unit hru by defining one separate lstm for each hru hru based lstm the models use environmental time series data and two dimensional spatial data to predict surface and sub surface flows at 6 minute time step simultaneously we tested our models in a tropical humid headwater catchment in northern lao pdr and compared their performances our results showed that the simple lstm model outperformed the other models on surface runoff prediction with the lowest mse 7 4e 5 m3 s 1 whereas hru based lstm model better predicted patterns and slopes in sub surface flow in comparison with the other models by having the smallest mse value 3 2e 4 m3 s 1 this study demonstrated the performance of a deep learning model when simulating hydrological cycle with high temporal resolution keywords deep learning model long short term memory lstm sub surface flow surface runoff hydrological simulated program fortran 1 introduction recently increase in precipitation extreme events has been witnessed at global scale papalexiou and montanari 2019 roxy et al 2017 documented threefold increase in rainfall events from 1950 to 2017 in central india the international disaster database noted global annual loss of over 30 billion as a result of floods in last decade roxy et al 2017 to understand the hydrological complexity of flash floods we need to model hydrological phenomena at sub daily time step jodar abellan et al 2019 reynolds et al 2017 has also stressed the need for streamflow prediction at a sub daily time step for flood forecasting in medium sized 10 1000 km2 catchments due to small concentration time the identification of water components contributing to total streamflow plays a key role in understanding bio geochemical cycles and transport processes at catchment scale burns and kendall 2002 accurate estimation of sub surface water flow is critical in time continuous models in comparison with event based models due to the dominance of groundwater in continuous rainfall runoff models huang et al 2016 guse et al 2014 several research groups have developed catchment scale modeling tools such as the soil water assessment tool swat arnold and fohrer 2005 the stormwater management model swmm rossman 2010 and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 2001 however most of these hydrological models are used for a single rainfall event or daily simulation because sub hourly simulation is complex and time consuming bennett et al 2016 jeong et al 2010 improved the swat model to simulate stream discharge at a sub hourly time step however some processes in their improved model such as baseflow and lateral flow are still modeled with daily time step the output of these processes modeled at daily time step is then distributed equally at the sub hourly time step this improved swat model has been used to perform sub daily rainfall runoff simulations boithias et al 2017 ficchì et al 2016 modeled streamflow using a four parameter lumped gr4 modified from gr4j which stands for modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier model at different time steps ranging from 6 min to 1 day and studied the impact of frequency on model performance however their study did not model continuous streamflow rather they simulated individual storm events their study found a mixed model response i e both increase 0 7 to 0 8 and decrease 0 8 to 0 69 in kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 for model with increases in temporal resolution temporal resolution of input data also affects simulation results in a catchment model numerous studies have shown that the use of input data with higher temporal frequency improves model accuracy huang et al 2019 wang et al 2009 pang et al 2018 on the other hand simulating model output at a shorter time step causes a reduction in model accuracy gassman et al 2007 boithias et al 2017 bressiani et al 2015 a data driven model is considered as an alternative approach to overcome these complexities and such models have higher predictive accuracy pascual et al 2013 park et al 2019 numerous studies have been conducted to simulate hydrological processes using neural networks nns which is one of the popular types of data driven models ilunga and stephenson 2005 ogwueleka and ogwueleka 2009 several review papers besaw et al 2010 yaseen et al 2015 mosavi et al 2018 have shown that most data driven rainfall runoff models have used daily time steps and very few studies have been conducted using an hourly time step no study mentioned in these reviews showed any data driven model using sub hourly time step for continuous streamflow prediction or estimating both surface and sub surface outflows simultaneously granata et al 2016 also employed a machine learning methodology for sub hourly streamflow simulation however this study focused only on individual hydrographs and not on continuous streamflow prediction long short term memory lstm cell constitute a special type of nn which has also been used for streamflow simulation kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 yan et al 2019 campos et al 2019 the special feature of lstm is its ability to learn time dependent features using its memory thereby it is regarded as an adequate nn for modeling hydrological cycles shen 2018 greff et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge no studies have been published so far that discuss the use of lstms to simulate surface and sub surface flow simultaneously at a sub hourly time step however such a study is required because modeling hydrological response of catchments at minutes scale temporal resolution can enhance the capacity of hydrological models to simulate contaminants whose concentrations vary at logarithmic scale within short span of time such as fecal bacteria in this study we developed two different data driven models based on lstm neural networks and compared their performance with a physical model hspf using sub hourly data collected at the outlet of a highly responsive headwater catchment in northern laos where land use dramatically changed over the past 20 year annual crops was replaced by teak tree plantations managed without understorey as different landuses have different flow patterns change in landuse can affect soil loss or stream water quality ribolzi et al 2017 the specific objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the models ability to perform simulations of surface runoff and sub surface flow at high temporal resolution of 6 min 2 to conduct sensitivity analysis of the models developed in this study and 3 to predict hru level surface and sub surface responses from lstm based models and to analyze whether hru level discretization in lstm based model can yield better result as compared to non hru based lstm model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a 0 6 km2 houay pano headwater catchment located 10 km south of luang prabang city in northern lao p d r it is a sub basin of the houay xon river basin which is a tributary of the mekong river fig 1 the experimental site is part of the critical zone observatories network named multiscale tropical catchments m tropics which belongs to the french research infrastructure ozcar gaillardet et al 2018 this catchment can be considered as being representative of the montane agro ecosystems of south east asia the bedrock is made up of siltstone and fine grained sandstones of permian to upper carboniferous age soils are entisol ultisol and alfisol covering 20 30 and 50 of the catchment respectively chaplot et al 2005 the slope in the area varies from 0 to 171 with an average slope of 54 ribolzi et al 2016 the climate is sub tropical humid the mean annual rainfall is 1500 mm per year however the rainfall pattern is highly seasonal as the monsoon season which runs from mid may to mid october constitutes 77 of the rainfall the average monthly temperature at the site lies between 12 and 35 c with the highest temperature in april just at the beginning of the wet season the humidity level varies from 17 to 100 the catchment experiences several storms during the rainy season with heavy rainfall up to 100 mm h 1 a phenomenon which is characteristic of tropical regions ribolzi et al 2016 we measured hourly temperature celsius relative humidity wind speed m s and solar radiation j m 2 the precipitation electrical conductivity of stream water surface and sub surface flow were measured at 6 minute time step at the study site moreover a survey is conducted every year to ascertain landuse changes in study area more details on data acquisition are given in supplementary information text s1 the area consists of four major land use types consisting of annual crops teak fallow and forests fig s1 recently the area has undergone major land use changes with an increasing number of teak tree plantations ribolzi et al 2017 several studies have been conducted to understand the impact of land use changes on hydrological responses in the area ribolzi et al 2018 patin et al 2018 kim et al 2018 we observed that the increase in teak tree plantations from 2002 onwards has resulted in a decrease of infiltration and consequently an increase in overland flow and sediment yield ribolzi et al 2017 2 2 hydrological simulation program fortran model setup hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is a lumped model for water quality and quantity modeling at catchment scale developed during the 1970s johanson and davis 1980 the steps used to build the hspf model are summarized in fig 2 a we used basins 4 1 kinerson et al 2009 software to prepare the input file for hspf this software pre processes land use shapefiles digital elevation models dem and timeseries data of environmental variables such as precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature to prepare an input file for hspf post processing steps were carried out on the input file and input data to incorporate the impact of changing land use details of which are given in the supplementary information text s2 furthermore we performed morris oat morris 1991 sensitivity analysis to find out the most sensitive parameters for the model we chose 13 parameters for each of the four land uses present in the study area for sensitivity analysis table s1 thus the total number of parameters chosen for sensitivity analysis were 52 these 52 parameters are used in equations which control the movement of water on pervious land segments in hspf details on the implementation of the sensitivity analysis can be found in the supplementary information text s3 after sensitivity analysis we calibrated the model by reducing the mean square error mse between observed and predicted outflows which was calculated using the following equation 1 mse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where p i and o i are simulated and observed data respectively and n represents the number of points in the data set we used a truncated newton algorithm nash 1984 provided by the python library scipy jones et al 2001 to minimize the loss function 2 3 long short term memory lstm neural networks nn are a group of algorithms which work similar to how the human neural system is thought to work and are used to recognize patterns fukushima 1980 they consist of a stack of layers of neurons where each neuron is associated with weights and activations nns can be calibrated to learn a non linear function through backpropagation in which the weights and biases in each layer of the nn are optimized by reducing the error loss between observed and predicted output from the network rumelhart et al 1988 the calibrated network which is commonly known as a trained network is then used to predict output from unseen data during validation rumelhart et al 1988 such models based on nns are also considered as black box models where we only deal with input and output while the model itself finds relationships between the input and output data benítez et al 1997 recurrent neural networks rnn are a special kind of neural networks which are designed to work with time series data because of their ability to capture long term temporal dependencies in data rumelhart et al 1988 simple rnns suffer from the problem of vanishing gradient in deep neural networks where they fail to capture long range dependencies hochreiter 1998 one solution to this problem is known as the gated recurrent unit gru and was proposed by cho et al 2014 they introduced the concept of gates which control the flow of information within the recurrent unit another solution to the problem of vanishing gradient was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which is known as long short term memory lstm lstm uses three gates namely forget update and output gates to control the flow of information the current candidate cell state c c t depends on previous activation the current cell state c t is calculated using update and forget gate and then the output gate is used to decide the activations at current time step 2 c c t t a n h w c a t 1 x t b c 3 γ f σ w f c t 1 x t b f 4 γ o σ w o c t 1 x t b o 5 γ u σ w u c t 1 x t b u 6 c t γ u c c t γ f c t 1 7 a t γ o t a n h c t in these equations w and b are weights and biases whose values are calibrated when the model is trained the model is fed with inputs x at time step t and the activation at time step t which is calculated using eq 7 is taken as the output in rainfall runoff modeling model output has strong time dependence there is time delay in the stream response to precipitation talei and chua 2012 and this lag time depends on catchment features singh 1988 lstms have the ability to learn this behavior because of their ability to learn patterns in time series data lin hsu et al 1997 in this study we developed two nn based models the steps to develop a simple lstm model are briefly described in fig 2 b while the steps for a detailed more complex hru based lstm model are summarized in fig 2 c 2 3 1 setup for simple lstm model the simple lstm model fig 2 b consists of only a single lstm layer we chose the parameters to build this nn based on a trial and error procedure this simple lstm model is considered our baseline model and was used to compare the performance of the hru based lstm model the lstm layer takes all input data and is calibrated to produce two outputs which are considered representative of surface and sub surface flow fig 3 although the same lstm layer generates two outputs it does not know which one is surface and which one is sub surface flow however this distinction is made by comparing one first output of the model with observed surface flow and the second output of model with sub surface flow this comparison is done by calculating the mse and then the model adjusts the weights and biases of the lstm layer by back propagation in such a way that it tries to reduce the value of the mse in this way the model learns implicitly that its first output must correspond to surface flow and the second output has to correspond to sub surface flow 2 3 2 setup for hru based lstm model the second structure of lstm model is the hru based structure consisting of 36 parallel nns fig 4 each of these parallel networks is similar to a simple lstm structure however it represents one hydrological response unit hru instead of the whole catchment each parallel nn consists of layered lstm cells with 128 hidden units we chose the number of hidden units based upon hyper parameter optimization results the input to lstm at each time step consists of a 2 dimensional array of shape sequence length input features the sequence length and input features are given in table 1 the output from lstm at each time step is equal to the number of hidden units a fully connected layer was used to convert the output from lstm into the specific dimension however the multiple fully connected layer can increase computation time as well as the model complexity in order to avoid this we used a single fully connected layer instead of a deep neural network after lstm several studies also showed a single fully connected layers for developing hydrological models kratzert et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 kratzert et al 2019a b li et al 2020 the fully connected layer in this study generates two outputs surface runoff and sub surface flow fig 3 within an hru the number of layers in each of the parallel nn and the number of hidden units were decided by hyper parameter optimization and are given in table 1 an hru is defined here as a distinguished land use in a distinguished sub basin this means land uses present in different sub basins were considered as separate hrus this is different from hspf where similar land uses in different sub basis are considered are merged into one hru thus if a land use type e g grass is present in a catchment with 9 sub basins and all the sub basins have this type of land use we will have 9 hrus for this land use and nine separate nns are assigned to simulate processes in these hrus similarly if a forest land use is present in 5 sub basins in the catchment this will result in 5 other hrus in the model this is further illustrated in fig s2 where a catchment consists of 5 sub basins a b c d e and four land use types i ii iii iv and 15 hrus each of the parallel nns in fig 4 shares hru invariant input data such as solar radiation air temperature etc the hru specific input data such as precipitation received by each hru was also prepared and was fed only to the corresponding nns the environmental data such as air temperature and solar radiation is experienced equally by the whole area of the catchment thus all nns share this environmental data on the other hand parameters which depend on hru characteristics such as its area and distance to the outlet were calculated for each hru these hru specific parameters were only fed to the nns representing the corresponding hrus in the model precipitation data was measured for the whole catchment and then precipitation received by each hru was calculated based on the area of that hru this hru specific data can be viewed in figs s7 and s8 as the land use in the study area varies with time this implies that the locations of hrus also vary with time thus all the hru specific data i e distance to outlet area and volume of precipitation received was also calculated accordingly this time varying hru specific data can be viewed in figs s7 and s8 one implication of this is that we considered all possible hrus in the study area for example if the land use grass is not present in sub basin 1 in year 2011 it may appear in 2012 and then disappear again thus we considered the hru grass in sub basin 1 for the whole simulation period though the input values for year 2011 and 2013 will be zeros in this case the catchment area consisted of 9 sub basins and 4 types of land uses thus implying 36 possible hrus as the land use inside a sub basin is distributed and no specific distance from an hru to the catchment outlet can be measured we used the distance of the sub basin from the outlet as representative of all land uses inside that sub basin this means all the land uses hrus inside a sub basin were considered to have the same distance from the outlet as that sub basin this generalization results in certain hrus having the same distance from the outlet however it still maintains hru specific information each of the parallel nns in fig 4 produces two outputs which are considered as representative of hru specific surface and sub surface flow corresponding values of surface and sub surface flow are added in cumulative order this order of addition is the same as the stream filling order in the catchment this cumulative and ordered filling of outputs is similar to realistic stream routing the final values of surface and sub surface flow are considered as model outputs and are compared with observed values to calculate the mean square error using eq 1 this structure allows us to build a detailed model of the catchment where outflow from each land use is simulated separately and instead of one value of total streamflow the surface and subsurface outflow from the catchment are simulated more details on the implementation of this nn in the computer program are given in text s4 of the supplementary information the motivation for hru based lstm model was drawn from physically based models such as swat or hspf where the study area is discretized into smaller hrus all processes are modeled at hru level in these models in order to compare results of lstm based model with hspf the study area was discretized into hrus another purpose of discretizing study area for hru based lstm was to assess the impact of increase in spatial resolution on model performance 2 3 3 hyper parameter optimization hpo based on window size the performance of a nn model is mainly governed by a set of parameters which are used to build the nn such as length of input data fed to it at each time step and number of nodes in a layer hutter et al 2015 these parameters are called hyper parameters and their description and possible ranges are presented in table s3 to achieve the best performance with calibration we need to optimize these parameters because a slight change in any of these parameters can worsen or improve the performance of the model different derivative free optimization algorithms are those which aim to solve problems given as black box lakhmiri et al 2019 direct search and bayesian are one of such methods direct search is an a priori method where the decision maker articulates preferences before optimization bayesian optimization is one of a posteriori methods which aims to generate a representative set of pareto optimal solutions and then the best among them is chosen chen and li 2018 we selected bayesian optimization approach because of it being a popular approach to optimize hyper parameters in machine learning models shahriari et al 2015 snoek et al 2015 frazier 2018 the details about implementation of bayesian optimization are given in text s5 several open source libraries are available for implementing bayesian optimization method in python programming language such as hyperopt bergstra et al 2015 and scikit optimize kumar and head 2017 we used scikit optimize library because it allows the use of gaussian processes as surrogate function implementation of bayesian in hyperopt can be done by making use of tree parzen estimator bergstra et al 2011 the advantage of gaussian processes is that it can consider the interaction between hyper parameters during the optimization dewancker et al 2015 the surrogate function is the probability model of objection function and it calculates the probability of loss with respect of input values in bayesian optimization method this surrogate function is optimized instead of actual objective function the methodology of selecting the new parameter from parameter space was expected improvement to the surrogate function the expected improvement algorithm mockus et al 1978 jones et al 1998 considers the size of the improvement we used default parameters used by scikit optimize kumar and head 2017 library in using gaussian processes these parameters include optimizer kaapa and xi and are described in following sentences the optimizer minimizes the acquisition function we used limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno andrew and gao 2007 as optimizer the parameter kappa controls variance in predicted values and was set to 1 96 the parameter xi determines how much improvement should be taken into consideration over previous best values and was set to 0 01 the computation time of hpo depends upon the number of epochs to train a single model and the number of iterations used for optimization furthermore it also depends upon the complexity of model being built at a specific iteration the computation time in general increased by increasing the sequence length we performed 50 iterations for each sequence length fig s5 the model was trained for 100 epochs during each of these iterations the computation time taken for optimizing hyper parameters was 15 19 25 40 and 45 h for sequence lengths of 20 30 40 50 and 60 respectively although hpo needs considerable computation power this method can improve the model performance by finding the optimal hyperparameter set the model performance depending on the iteration is showed in fig s5 2 4 performance metrics and data splitting the performance of each model was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean squared error mse and percentage bias pbias the mse was calculated according to equation 1 and the equation used to calculate nse and pbias are 8 nse 1 p i o i 2 o i o 2 9 pbias i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 100 where p i is simulated data o i is observed data and n is the number of points in the data set values of mse indicate how closely the predictions follow the observed values in model training 70 of the input data corresponding from january 2011 to january 2013 was applied 15 of the data were used as validation and test respectively all three models produced two outputs surface and sub surface flow and during optimization of parameters an average error of the surface and sub surface flow was calculated this averaged error was then considered as the objective function which each model tries to minimize predicted total discharge is thus the sum of surface and sub surface flows in each case in order to avoid overfitting in lstm based models we used a mild regularization technique namely early stopping goodfellow et al 2016 we checked the performance of the models after each epoch on validation data the model had not processed this data during calibration we stopped calibrating the model when validation loss reached a plateau even if calibration loss kept on decreasing 3 results 3 1 hspf results 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis we carried out sensitivity analysis for sub surface flow and total discharge separately based on the results of sensitivity analysis we selected 12 parameters for baseflow and for total discharge which had the strongest impact on these outflows for calibration not all parameters for baseflow and total discharge are different rather there are some common parameters which had a strong impact on both sub surface flow and total discharge table 2 both sub surface flow and total discharge were highly sensitive to infilt which describes infiltration capacity bicknell et al 2001 while only sub surface flow was sensitive to agwetp basetp and deepfr the parameters agwetp and basetp control the amount of evapotranspiration that can be taken from active groundwater storage and baseflow respectively bicknell et al 2001 as the definitions of these two variables suggest they are closely associated with baseflow thus sensitivity analysis showed these parameters to be more important for sub surface flow which is the sum of groundwater flow and interflow these results are consistent with the similar studies xie and lian 2013 baek et al 2017 diaz ramirez et al 2013 which also demonstrated that intfw ifilt deepfr and agwetp are among the most important parameters for streamflow 3 1 2 estimation of surface and sub surface flow using hspf figs 5 and 6 shows predictions from the hspf model for the calibration validation and test periods we evaluated the performance of the model by measuring the mse and nse for the calibration and test periods separately values of these errors for surface sub surface and total flow are given in table 3 the predicted sub surface flow in figs 5 and 6 is often underestimated while the surface flow simulated by hspf is mostly overestimated this is the reason there is large positive pbias for surface flow and large negative pbias for sub surface flow table 3 although the predicted sub surface flow is very low the predicted total discharge is higher the predicted total discharge is higher because of the large amount of input in the form of surface runoff overestimation of surface flow and under estimation of sub surface flow was also observed by hoang et al 2014 after the application of the swat model to a watershed in denmark this research attributed this behavior to the inadequacy of the model structure for simulating these processes uzsn represents the storage capacity of the upper zone in the hspf model bicknell et al 2001 which is a soil zone table 2 a higher value of uzsn means that the soil has a higher storage capacity and thus more water will be retained in the upper zone which becomes available for evapotranspiration bicknell et al 2001 our calibrated uzsn values are closer to the upper limits which means more water is being retained in the soil zone eventually leading to higher evapotranspiration in other words this means more water is available for evapotranspiration from upper zone we observed that predicted sub surface flow was higher in 2013 as compared to 2011 while it was the lowest in 2012 we observed this trend because of changes in land use during these years fig s9 the rise of sub surface flow in 2013 can be attributed to an increase in fallow land use and a decrease in annual crop land use in 2013 a recent study by ribolzi et al 2017 found a correlation between higher sub surface flow and the increase in teak plantations in this catchments although teak and annual crop land use result in higher surface flow the joint contribution of teak and annual crop decreased in 2013 and the contribution of fallow land use increased the smaller sub surface flow observed during 2012 could be due to the relatively higher teak and annual crop land use during this year as compared to other years 3 2 estimation of surface and sub surface flow using deep learning 3 2 1 simple lstm the simple lstm model consisted of a single lstm layer and was built using the hyper parameters given in table 1 we then used the model calibrated with these hyper parameters for evaluation during the test period the performance of the model during calibration and test for surface sub surface and total flow can be seen in figs 7 8 and table 3 the nse values for surface runoff prediction during calibration and test were 0 43 and 0 64 respectively these nse values categorize the model performance unsatisfactory and satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2015 however pbias which measures average tendency of model to predict flow larger or smaller than observed is mostly between very good 3 2 and good 5 6 table 3 despite this the model captured most of the peaks in surface runoff during both the calibration and test periods however the predicted peaks are mostly lower than the observed peaks this discrepancy can be attributed to the use of mse for model calibration because mse focused to reduce the average error between observation and simulation the inability of model to capture peaks is also evident from flow duration curves for surface sub surface and total discharge fig s13 the percentage exceedance of predicted flows is below the observed in areas of high flows fig s13 for sub surface flow this model predicted almost all the peaks yet failed to follow the trend of rising and falling limbs which resulted in lower nse values another important aspect of simple lstm model is its ability to perform better for surface runoff as compared to sub surface runoff this is evident from table 3 which shows all performance metrics for surface runoff better than those of sub surface flow 3 2 2 hru based lstm model we built the hru based lstm model using information obtained from hpo we used information about the activation function normalization and loss calculation methods and cell type from hpo the choice of activation function affects the kind of non linearity applied options for the loss calculation method were normal or weighted in the weighted loss calculation method the loss value is more sensitive to peak flows the choices for cell type in order to build nn were gru and lstm the hpo was then allowed to decide which of these two cells perform best the hpo algorithm varied the values of these hyper parameters during the optimization process until it found the best combination of hyper parameters this optimization was performed for five different sequence lengths fig s5 shows the results of optimization where the plot for each sequence length indicates how the loss value was reduced it shows how the optimization algorithm attempted to obtain the best hyper parameters for a specific sequence length table 4 enlists configuration of models which resulted in maximum reduction in loss value for each sequence length it can be seen that the best hpo results were mostly obtained using a rectified linear unit relu performing normalization of input data before using it using an lstm cell instead of a gru cell and using the weighted loss calculation method table 4 the values of sequence length and batch size were not optimized using hpo because increasing them is equivalent to increasing the amount of input data being fed to the nn this exponentially increases the amount of computation which requires greater processing and memory resources in this regard we used a trial and error method to obtain better optimum values for other hyper parameters such as sequence length batch size etc the optimized set of hyper parameters which were used to build the hru based lstm model are given in table 1 plots for surface sub surface and total flow for calibration validation and test data are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the performance metrics obtained for this model are given in table 3 we observed underestimation of surface runoff which is similar to what we observed in predicted surface runoff from the simple lstm model however in this case there was more under estimation as compared to the simple lstm this is the reason that the mse value which is the average error for the whole simulation range was higher during calibration and test as compared to the mse value of the simple lstm model the nse values which measure the accuracy of prediction were 0 66 and 0 63 for calibration and test of sub surface flow respectively which makes the model performance satisfactory moriasi et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 overall comparison of three models by comparing the mse and nse values of all three models from table 3 we can conclude that the simple model performed better for surface flow prediction the simple lstm model showed an nse value of 0 64 and mse value of 8 3 5 m3 s 1 for surface runoff prediction which are the best values obtained among all three models although the simple lstm model was meant to serve as a baseline model the more complex hru based lstm model could not perform better for surface flow prediction it is interesting to note that in this case increasing model complexity has not resulted in improved model performance it has already been reported that adding complexity to an nn does not necessarily imply that it will outperform its simpler counterpart makridakis et al 2018 overall performance of all models range from satisfactory to not satisfactory as per criteria set by moriasi et al 2015 one of reasons for this lower accuracy can be attributed to a finer time step of simulation indeed several studies have reported deterioration in model performance for streamflow estimation with increase in simulation time step stern et al 2016 gassman et al 2007 especially in smaller catchments spruill et al 2000 in an extensive review of over 100 swat applications in brazil bressiani et al 2015 found that only 6 of studies with monthly simulations resulted in nse values of less than 0 5 on the other hand when daily time step was used 25 of studies rendered nse value below 0 5 boithias et al 2017 reported degradation of validation nse from 0 66 to 0 49 when streamflow was first simulated at a daily time step and then at an hourly time step the reason for lower accuracy at shorter time steps can be the use of sparsely distributed rainfall gauges which are unable to capture the spatial details of rainfall inputs gassman et al 2007 similarly another explanation for higher model accuracy when using longer time steps is that longer time steps integrate the variability at smaller time steps boithias et al 2017 for sub surface flow although the hspf model performed best in terms of nse the predicted sub surface flow was much lower than the observed sub surface flow the sub surface flow predicted by hspf in figs 5 and 6 is much lower than the observed flow this is the reason we see large negative values of pbias from the flow duration curves for predicted sub surface flow is much below the observed fig s12 the simple lstm model was able to predict most of the peaks for sub surface flow however the value of nse is lower as compared to that of the hru based lstm model the better values of nse for sub surface flow from the hru based lstm model can be attributed to the better prediction of recession in peaks the slopes in the falling limbs of predicted peaks from the hru based lstm model in fig s10 which are absent in the peaks predicted by the simple lstm model if we consider mse values the hru based lstm model outperformed hspf for both surface flow as well as sub surface flow during calibration period in all models the predicted flow peaks were lower than the observed peaks for both surface and sub surface flow except the predicted surface flow from hspf however in hspf the number of predicted storm events were much more than the observed which resulted in a negative nse value in the case of the hru based lstm model although it predicted most of the storm events it still under predicted surface flow the discrepancy between train and test mse was caused by the difference in data distribution during these periods the train data set had larger standard deviation than the validation and test data set table s4 the dataset with larger variance can have large mse munna et al 2015 grams et al 2006 if the training performance of a model is significantly larger than that of test data this indicates overfitting on the other hand better performance for test data set in our case indicates different distribution of training and test data sets 4 2 advantages and limitations of hspf as the hspf is a process driven model thus simulations resulting from it give insights about behavior and condition of catchment the higher values of a variable such as uzsn translate into large storage potential in upper zone of soil however simulation results from hspf are greatly influenced by calculated potential evapotranspiration which itself can vary based on the method of evapotranspiration calculation used our hspf results showed that major portion of the rainfall is evapotranspirated in the hspf model the amount of actual evapotranspiration is increased until the requirement created by the potential evapotranspiration is satisfied if potential evapotranspiration is very high the model allows more available water from storage to return to the environment as actual evapotranspiration in our simulations lower predicted flows from the hspf model may also be due to the overestimation of potential evapotranspiration table s2 as has been the case in the studies of yeh 2017 and prudhomme and williamson 2013 in this study we calculated daily evapotranspiration and then distributed to 6 min by calculating daily sunshine hours this interpolation of daily evapotranspiration to 6 min time step can also be a reason of poor hspf performance there have been several studies showing that using evapotranspiration values calculated at a higher temporal resolution results in better model performance debele et al 2009 the conceptual physically based models can render poor performance if one of the model variable is incorrectly calculated ouellet proulx et al 2019 compared the performance of five different et and evaporation models for rainfall runoff modeling and showed that the choice of et model affects streamflow by 3 to 24 percent on the other hand the deep learning models are less likely to suffer from these errors because they are not explicitly process driven 4 3 advantages of lstm model one of the key characteristics in surface runoff simulations is the lag time between rainfall and surface runoff talei and chua 2012 the lag time between observed surface runoff and incoming rainfall for two storm events of september 2013 can be seen in fig s11 this figure also compares the results of lag time for all three models these storm events are in the test period thus this figure is a good representation of the ability of models to simulate lag time it can be observed in the figure that hspf predicts surface runoff as soon as there is a rainfall event while both our nn models show a lag time although the peaks predicted by the hru based lstm model are lower than those predicted by the other models the model showed responses to both storm events with lag time the simple lstm model takes much less computing time as compared to the hru based lstm model this is self evident because the hru based lstm model has 36 times more parameters to calibrate as compared to the simple model the number of calibration parameters for each nn model can be calculated from the hyper parameters given in table 1 for the simple lstm model there were 258 parameters to calibrate 128 weights and biases for an lstm with 128 hidden units and one weight and bias for the fully connected layer similarly the number of parameters calibrated by the hru based lstm model were 9288 the computation time of hru based lstm model did not scale with number of parameters we observed an average time of 4 min per epoch for hru based lstm while 0 5 min per epoch for simple lstm model we used intel core i7 8700 processor with graphic card of nvidia geforce gtx 1060 having 6 gigabytes of dedicated gpu memory along with 32 gigabytes of random access memory the parallel computing power of tensorflow abadi et al 2016 prevented the scaling of training time with model parameters adie and pradana 2018 the total training time however depends upon the number of training epochs used the hru based lstm model took 262 min for 66 epochs while it took approximately 100 min for simple lstm to train for 214 epochs the results of the lstm based models show that total streamflow was mainly governed by sub surface flow while the surface flow only contributed to flood peaks during rainfall events it can be observed that the predicted flow patterns for sub surface flow and total discharge are the same except for peak heights figs 7 10 the peaks are higher in total discharge which means that surface flow only contributes to increases in peak heights this can also be seen in flow duration curves for all three models figs s12 s13 and s14 where the predicted flow duration curve is always below observed in high flow regions this result is consistent with a previous study within houay pano catchment that showed the larger contribution of baseflow to streamflow during floods ribolzi et al 2018 in our study the total surface and sub surface flow from simple lstm model was 78 and 2160 mm similarly the hru based lstm model also showed dominance of sub surface flow in the catchment the total simulated surface and sub surface flow for three years using hru based lstm model was 32 and 1913 mm respectively the large gap between two values is because of absence of surface runoff during most of the days in year when there is no rainfall under estimation of peak flows using lumped physically based models is a frequent drawback which has been observed in several studies boithias et al 2014 bieger et al 2014 fohrer et al 2014 loukas and vasiliades 2014 we observed a similar trend in sub surface flow predicted by hspf however in our lstm based models this problem is partially solved we can observe large gap between predicted and observed flow duration curve in fig s12 while this gap is smaller for lstm based models figs s13 and s14 the simple lstm model captured peaks in surface runoff more accurately as compared to those predicted by the hru based lstm model this trend was also found in the total estimated discharge from each model when peaks in surface runoff are underestimated peaks in total discharge are also underestimated figs 9 and 10 and when peaks in surface runoff are better estimated peaks in total discharge are also better estimated figs 7 and 8 this means that the predicted surface runoff mainly contributes to peaks in streamflow while the sub surface flow makes up the baseflow portion this makes our lstm based models closer to real observations 4 4 challenges and limitations of lstm models calibrating nn for surface flow is extremely challenging the reason for this is that 96 of the surface flow data consists of zeros because discernable surface runoff only happens during rainfall events this problem is similar to anomaly detection or rare event detection where less than 5 10 of the total data is positively labeled we observed during hpo iterations that total surface flow did not change once it became zero upon further calibration of model it can be argued that as 96 of surface flow has one unique value i e zero the network learns to predict zeros the matching of the surface flow curve became more challenging because surface flow does not always coincide with rainfall events indeed during the hot and dry season generally from january to april the soil is dry and evapotranspiration is high indeed the potential evapotranspiration is higher than rainfall during this period table s2 for small rainfall events during this hot and dry season rainfall is either evapotranspirated or infiltrated however it is not transferred to the stream by surface runoff precipitation absorbed by the soil may later become part of sub surface flow calibrating a nn to learn this behavior is the most difficult part and if hyper parameters are not chosen appropriately the model fails to generalize the surface flow patterns surface and sub surface flows obtained for each of the 36 hrus using hru based lstm model are plotted in fig s6 by comparing these hru specific surface and sub surface responses with the hru specific input data figs s7 and s8 we cannot draw a one to one correspondence between hru specific input data and the corresponding output in certain cases an lstm produces no outflow even when it receives precipitation thus all lstms in our hru specific model are not necessarily representative of hru specific inputs this can be because nns act as black box models and the inner workings of these networks are random karpatne et al 2017 thus we cannot draw a simple link between the weights of a nn and the function being approximated another reason for these unpredictable hru specific outputs could be that we used separate nn for each hru this means that each of these nns have separate weights and biases thus if one network gets higher input values of curve number or precipitation it is completely independent of what the other networks receive as input thus each network forms its own context when it calibrates its weights and biases by looking at the total output of the whole model the interest of model interpretability has increased in the field of machine learning samek 2019 several studies have proposed the ways to incorporate scientific knowledge into deep learning karpatne et al 2017a b wang et al 2020 the suggested method in our study the neural network down into sub models for each hru would be a way to introduce more interpretability into a data driven models in that this approach can analyze sub models in the neural network 5 conclusions in this study we modeled the surface and sub surface flow using three models one lumped model called hspf and two deep learning models one deep learning model consisted of a single lstm representing the whole catchment whereas the second model consisted of lstms representing each hru all three models predicted total flow surface and sub surface flow separately the following conclusions were then derived from the results by replacing the constant values of the area factors in the hspf model with time series values we were able to model land use changes in a catchment although hspf was able to estimate surface and sub surface flow simultaneously it over estimated surface runoff and under estimated sub surface flow contrary to this our deep learning models were more consistent in predicting surface and sub surface flow therefore deep learning models are more suitable when prediction of both surface and sub surface flow is required simultaneously the simple lstm model where one lstm layer is used to represent the whole catchment performed best for surface runoff prediction during both calibration and test period the hru based lstm model performed better than simple lstm model for sub surface flow prediction during both test and calibration period it has the best performance for total streamflow simulation during test period understanding the combined impact of climate change and land use changes on the catchment by modeling surface and sub surface flows at a very high temporal resolution of 6 min can help assessing extreme low and extreme high discharge and improve water resource management this would allow more accurate modeling of pollutants e g fecal bacteria whose concentrations vary exponentially with time this study presents a methodology for incorporating land use changes into hydrological models of surface and sub surface flow at catchment scale this study also demonstrates that deep learning can be an alternative to physically based or conceptual models by taking in account model complexity at spatial and temporal scales credit authorship contribution statement ather abbas conceptualization data curation methodology visualization writing original draft writing
