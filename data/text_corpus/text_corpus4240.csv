21200,as the world strives to remove its reliance on fossil fuels wave energy presents a reliable source of renewable energy with a very high potential numerical simulations offer an inexpensive alternative in comparison to physical modelling for the development of wave energy converters in this paper a computational fluid dynamics model of the ceco wave energy converter wec has been developed using the commercial software ansys cfx in order to reduce on the computational resources required a 2 dimensional model of this sloped combination of heave and surge motion wec has been developed and then successfully validated with experimental results from physical model tests demonstrating the capability of such models to accurately describe the response of wecs the validated numerical model was then used to investigate the non linear effects on the motions of ceco and to obtain more insights in relation to wave loading during a wave cycle and the viscous effects associated to the dissipation of energy in the flow around its floaters the water particle velocity and vorticity around ceco and the heave and surge loadings on ceco while it is in operation are analysed and discussed the numerical model not only aid in the development of a new and enhanced geometry for ceco but also it can be used to model and analyse similar wecs keywords ansys cfx marine ranse modelling viscous effects wave energy wave structure interaction 1 introduction ocean wave energy is one of the world s most powerful forms of energy and the energy density in ocean waves is the highest among renewable energy sources clément et al 2002 in addition falnes 2007 shows that the power flow intensity of ocean waves is up to five times larger than for the wind that creates them being therefore an indirect form of solar power furthermore ocean wave energy is available up to 90 of the time which makes it a far more dependable source of energy when compared to the other renewable energy resources where solar and wind are available 20 30 of the time another advantage of ocean wave energy is since most of these waves travel long distances being usually out of phase with wind energy and consequently wave energy converters wecs may easily and efficiently be integrated with other renewable energy harvesting technologies such as offshore wind turbines however as with any form of energy there is a number of drawbacks when trying to harness it in turn one of the main reasons why this major natural resource has remained unexploited is that it is very variable and largely random over several time scales from wave to wave with sea state and seasonal variations falcão 2010 another challenge in harnessing this form of energy is the harsh and secluded environment where the most power dense waves exist that is in deep waters generally more than 40 m that are several kilometres offshore kempener and neumann 2014 the concept of harnessing ocean wave energy is by no means a new idea however the topic only gained international interest in the 1970 s with the publication of stephen salter s ground breaking paper on his wave energy duck salter 1974 since then over a thousand patents have been issued for wave energy converters wecs the united states patent incorporating a variety of methods however as of yet no winning wec design has been established and several concepts are presently being developed and optimized the ceco wave energy converter is a sloped motion concept which is illustrated in fig 1 being developed at the faculty of engineering of the university of porto feup portugal since 2012 the experimental proof of concept of this wec showed quite promising efficiencies converting ocean wave energy rosa santos et al 2015 and since then it has undergone a significant number of developments most of them using numerical models based on the boundary element method bem comprehensively validated with data from experimental tests for example lópez et al 2017a 2017b 2018a b rodríguez et al 2018 2019 those studies assessed for instance the influence of the power take off pto damping characteristics lópez et al 2017b pto inclination lópez et al 2018a b local water depth ramos et al 2018 and wave climate seasonality ramos et al 2017 on the performance of ceco and important insights were obtained for the subsequent improvement of this technology a detailed overview of the experimental and numerical work carried so far is presented in rosa santos et al 2019 the use of bem models is frequent up to intermediate stages of development of wecs for example in pastor et al pastor and liu 2014 day et al 2015 and sjokvist et al sjökvist et al 2017 in particular to analyse their performance under typical operational conditions due to the large number of variables parameters that should be investigated at those stages to maximize power harvesting capabilities for low to moderate sea states since these models are able to provide a sufficiently accurate solution and simultaneously present a very good compromise between accuracy and computational time however at more advanced stages of wec development the need to include viscous and other non linear effects as well as phenomena like wave splash overtopping and flow separation may impose the use of more advanced and computationally demanding modelling tools this is especially valid for the analysis of the survivability of wecs under extreme wave events in recent years with the development in computational power the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd for modelling offshore structures such as wecs has grown in popularity a number of early studies elangovan 2011 hadzic et al 2005 lal and elangovan 2008 liang et al 2010 sriram et al 2006 used numerical wave tanks which were based on cfd to explore the interaction of ocean waves with floating structures consequently a methodology for simulating linear regular waves and wave structure interaction in a numerical wave tank was developed by finnegan and goggins 2012 and this study was subsequently advanced to explore linear irregular waves in finnegan and goggins 2015 there are a number of examples where cfd models have been used to assess the performance of wecs for example lou et al luo et al 2014a used a 2 dimensional cfd analysis to explore the efficiency of a fixed oscillating water column wec using a fully nonlinear wave tank with the fluent cfd software this study was then advanced in lou et al luo et al 2014b to investigate the performance of a heave only oscillating water column wec similarly anbarsooz et al 2016 used the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 15 0 to explore the interaction of steep waves on a fixed oscillating water column wec chen et al 2017 developed a 3 dimensional mathematical model based on the navier stokes equations for the hydrodynamics and structural dynamics of a floating point absorbing wec and compared the results to a bem analysis and it was found that the difference in behaviour can be significant and vary considerably depending on wave height a detailed and comprehensive review of cfd based numerical wave tanks for wec experiments has been compiled by windt et al 2018 where the existing literature was categorised in order to present the current best practice guidelines and give recommendations for any deficits in the current state of the art in this study the ansys cfx package was used to implement a full scale rans vof numerical model of ceco which was then validated using experimental results in a two step approach qualitatively by comparing the motions of ceco and the disturbance induced in the water mass both in the physical and numerical models and quantitatively by comparing the motion time series and motion raos of ceco once validated the numerical model was used to carry out a broad study of the hydrodynamic behaviour of ceco and analyse the effect of non linear wave structure interaction between the ocean waves and this wec aiming at a better understanding of wave energy dissipation mechanisms and the assessment of its efficiency and dynamics namely under extreme wave conditions the wave input on one side of the model was a numerical input using airy s linear wave theory as opposed to the paddles used in the wave tank and the waves were damped at the other side of the model using numerical damping by manipulating the fluid viscosity as opposed to a beach that is used in the wave tank during the investigation an intermediate water depth 16 m which corresponds to the water depth tested in the wave tank in prototype values was explored as the action of the wind over the ocean surface can generate oscillation in the range of circa 3 s to around 20 or 25 s the range of wave conditions analysed had to be narrowed hence in this paper only the periods that are more frequent and have a higher contribution to the local energy resource were considered which are wind generated waves in the period 8 14 s regular wave conditions were used but both the height and period of the waves were varied in the simulations the response of the device was then normalised with respect to the wave height to calculate the response amplitude operator rao for the device and investigate its variance with wave period the rao from the numerical model were then compared to the monitored results from the physical model testing of a lowly damped ceco wave energy converter and found to be in good agreement for a wave period range of 8 14 s this paper is structured as follows the ceco concept and the methodology used to develop the cfd model is described in section 2 a model validation for the cfd model against experimental trials is presented in section 3 1 the model is then used to analyse and characterize the performance of ceco in operation sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 finally the summary and conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 aim and objectives the primary aim of this study is to investigate the interaction of ocean waves on the ceco wave energy converter during operation especially under energetic sea states for which the approaches based on bem models become inappropriate this study is performed by developing a 2 dimensional numerical wave tank model of ceco using cfd however in order to achieve this aim the following objectives must be achieved to develop a 2 dimensional numerical wave tank model of ceco using the methodology specified in finnegan et al finnegan and goggins 2012 to validate the results of the analysis against experimental data marinheiro et al 2015 to investigate the performance of ceco during operation in deep water conditions to evaluate the interaction of the water waves on ceco during operation with a focus on the more extreme sea states 2 2 ceco wave energy converter the ceco wave energy converter is a floating point wave energy absorber that oscillates due to the wave force on its floaters along a straight sloped path at a given inclination usually 45⁰ defined by the inclination of the guiding rods on the sliding frame fig 1 b ceco is made up of two main components a fixed supporting structure and two lateral floaters which are the moving parts that are excited by the incoming waves the fixed supporting structure is in place perpendicular to the translational direction of the floaters in operation and they are connected by a central frame fig 1 the unique design of ceco allows for both the surge horizontal and heave vertical motions induced by the incoming ocean waves to be converted into a single degree of freedom translational motion by the two floaters which is then transformed into useable electrical energy using a pto system that is installed inside the supporting structure the pto system includes a rack attached to the central frame pinion mechanism connected to the generator shaft and a dc generator the possibility of tuning the natural frequency of ceco motion with the angle of its translation path is also a distinctive characteristic for the nominal inclination and submergence volume of the floaters 45 and 60 respectively the free oscillation frequency of ceco is approximately 8 s table 1 presents the main dimensions of ceco further details on ceco can be found in rosa santos et al 2019 which details the development of ceco from the initial concept to its current state 2 3 governing equations the analysis presented in this study has been performed using the commercial cfd software ansys cfx where the solver is based on the finite volume technique nc and rel 2009 this technique divides the computational domains into sub regions of finite volume and discretises the governing equations in order to solve them iteratively over each sub region therefore an approximation of the value of each variable at points throughout the domain is achieved the governing equations that need to be solved by the ansys cfx solver are the mass continuity equation which is given as 1 ρ t ρ u 1 x ρ u 2 y 0 and the reynold s averaged navier stokes equations which are given as 2 ρ u 1 t u 1 u 1 x u 2 u 1 y p x 2 μ 2 u 1 x 2 y μ u 1 y u 2 x f 1 3 ρ u 2 t u 1 u 2 x u 2 u 2 y p y 2 μ 2 u 2 y 2 x μ u 1 y u 2 x f 2 ρ g where t is time ρ is the water density x is the horizontal distance from the wavemaker y is the vertical height from the still water level swl and increases with depth u 1 is the horizontal flow velocity u 2 is the vertical flow velocity f 1 is the body force on the fluid in the horizontal direction f 2 ρ g is the body force on the fluid in the vertical direction p is pressure and μ is dynamic viscosity in this study the volume of fluid vof method which enables multi phase modelling has been applied in conjunction with numerical wave probes to determine the position of the free surface this method which was also employed by liang et al 2010 adds another governing equation given by 4 q i t u 1 q i x u 2 q i y 0 i 1 2 where q i is the volume fraction of the fluid i with i 1 2 q i 1 where 1 denotes air and 2 water the free surface is then approximated as at the position of the minimum of value q 1 q 2 along the model 2 4 cfd model development 2 4 1 model geometry the ceco wave energy converter is comprised of two structural parts the support structure and the floaters which have been detailed in section 2 2 in order to reduce the computational cost of the simulation and subsequently investigate the accuracy of the model a 2 dimensional representation of ceco s floater has been modelled see fig 2 therefore the support structure and the sliding frame which are shown in fig 2 are not considered in this study the computational domain has been dived into two parts the working domain and the wave dissipation zone and the structure has been modelled as a rigid body with wall boundaries in the computational domain the overall length of the model is 250 m and the overall height is 40 m where the swl is 16 m full scale values in addition the ceco structure is located at a distance greater than 3 times the water depth from the wave inflow dean and dalrymple 1984 which allows reflected waves to dissipate in order to minimise their effect the generated wave 2 4 2 mesh development the mesh for the computational domain has been created based on the methodology developed in finnegan and goggins 2012 which includes a comprehensive convergence study for generating a mesh for a numerical wave tanks mesh refinement was performed using two methods which are specific to ansys cfx the body of influence method and the sphere of influence method that allow refinement at specific regions within the mesh the mesh has been refined along the swl from 4 m below to 4 m above the swl along the length of the model using the body of influence method and around the structure using the sphere of influence method where the maximum element size in both cases has been defined as 300 mm a maximum element size has also been defined in the remainder of the domain as 1000 mm therefore the mesh contains 44 400 elements which have 87 100 nodes and is shown in fig 3 that includes a close up of the mesh around the ceco structure the average aspect ratio of the mesh is 8 5 which has a maximum aspect ratio of 77 2 4 3 cfd setup the 2 dimensional numerical wave tank model of ceco has predominantly been developed in line with the methodology specified in finnegan and goggins 2012 along with incorporating aspects developed in finnegan and goggins 2015 for specifying the input wave elevation specifying the input water particle velocities and creating a numerical dissipation zone which are discussed in this section a numerical wavemaker has been used similar to finnegan and goggins 2015 where the wave has been specified at the wave inflow boundary shown in fig 3 which uses the opening boundary type with specified fluid velocities in ansys cfx this is similar to the technique used by mousaviraad et al 2010 who specified a linear potential solution at the input boundary in order to generate linear input waves the wave elevation η t is defined using the following equation from airy s linear wave theory 5 η t h 2 cos ω t ε where h is the wave height ω is the angular frequency of the wave t is time and ε is the phase angle the associated water particle velocities are defined using the following equations from airy s linear wave theory 6 u 1 t h 2 ω cosh k 0 y sinh k 0 d cos ω t ε and 7 u 2 t h 2 ω sinh k 0 y sinh k 0 d sin ω t ε where k 0 is the wavenumber y is the vertical distance from the base of the model and d is the water depth in addition a numerical method for dissipating the waves at the end of the numerical wave tank was applied similar to finnegan and goggins 2015 where the viscosity of the water increases towards the end of the computational domain using the following equation 8 μ 8 899 x 10 4 kg ms x 150 m 8 899 x 10 4 kg ms x 150 m 100 m 125000 kg ms x 150 m in operation the floater of ceco oscillates at a 45⁰ angle to the free surface in order to reproduce this movement in the numerical model a local coordinate system is set up so the floater moves in a single degree of motion where the structure moves in the x direction detailed in fig 4 the ceco structure is defined as a rigid body using the wall boundary type in ansys cfx where the body motion is accounted for through deformation of the mesh around the rigid body 2 5 regular wave cases for the purpose of validating the accuracy of the numerical cfd model of ceco 8 regular wave cases were used whose characteristics are detailed in table 2 these cases have been selected from the experimental data available for the purpose of validation while providing adequate representation within the wave period range from 8 to 14 s where two wave heights were taken at each wave period 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation firstly the behaviour of ceco observed in the cfd numerical model is qualitatively analysed using as reference the experimental model tests following this in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the numerical model that has been developed in this study the results of the numerical cfd simulations have been compared to the results from the experimental testing for the eight regular wave cases detailed in table 2 no damping is included in the ceco numerical model and therefore the experimental results for the least damping cases i e cases where no external damping is applied to the system only the inherent damping due to the movement of ceco on the sliding frame are used to validate the numerical model a graphical summary of this comparison is shown in fig 5 which presents the response amplitude operator rao as a function of the wave period which is calculated using the following equation 9 rao ζ a where ζ is half of the peak to peak amplitude of ceco response motion along its single degree of freedom in the x direction and a is the amplitude of the regular wave in addition to the eight regular wave cases the obtained numerical model results have also been compared to a summary of the bem results presented in lópez et al 2017a overall it can be seen that the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is quite satisfactory and that there is no clear trend defined when the raos obtained from the bem in lópez et al 2017a and cfd approaches are compared fig 5 it should also be mentioned that the best agreement between experimental and cfd numerical results was observed for the case t 14s and h 4m which is the most extreme sea state considered although generalization of this conclusion is counter productive due to the limited amount of cases considered in this study the cfd model validation also includes the comparison of the numerical results to the results from experimental testing for the 8 regular wave cases detailed in table 2 in the time domain therefore the dynamic response of the ceco floater in the x direction see fig 4 was compared for both the numerical model and experimental tests in the time domain fig 6 the free surface wave elevation is also included at the location of ceco which has been modelled with no structure present in the numerical wave tank in order to compare quantitatively the two responses from the numerical cfd and experimental tests which are presented in fig 6 the normalised root mean square error rmse method is used in this analysis the rmse is normalised against the amplitude of the response of ceco in the experimental tests where the rmse is calculated as follows 10 rmse n 1 n f e x p n f c f d n 2 n where n is the number of sample points f e x p n and f c f d n is the response of the experimental test and the numerical cfd test at sample point n respectively the normalised rmse for this comparison are given in table 3 for each of the 8 regular wave cases examined for the regular wave cases 1 and 4 t 8 10 s the results from the numerical model are in very good agreement with the experimental ones which can be seen qualitatively in fig 6 as the normalised rmse of the comparison is 0 07 and 0 17 table 3 respectively the comparison for regular wave cases 2 3 5 and 7 have reasonable agreement where the comparison between the experimental and numerical cfd results have a normalised rmse of between 0 25 and 0 28 which can be seen in table 3 the agreement is much less satisfactory for the other regular wave cases where the comparison for regular wave cases 6 and 8 have a normalised rmse of 0 33 and 0 57 respectively although for case 8 the peak to peak amplitudes of motion have been well reproduced numerically it is also worth mentioning that the numerical time series show some non linear patterns for the higher wave periods but those do not correspond exactly to what is observed in their experimental counterparts differences between the experimental and the numerical results are expected due to the simplifications introduced in the modelling 2 dimensional representation of one ceco s floater and the non consideration of the reference supporting structure and of the sliding frame 3 2 interaction of waves with ceco a single case study regular wave case 4 where the wave height is 3 m and the wave period is 10 s is used to examine the movement of the water particles around ceco as it oscillates under the action of incident waves this regular wave case is selected as it is close to the desired operating period of ceco while in operation fig 7 shows snapshots of ceco s floater moving as it oscillates in operation from its highest position in the left three images to its mean position in the middle three images to its lowest position in the right three images the top three images in fig 8 show the position of ceco s floater during the numerical simulation at 32 s 40 6 s and 48 s which shows ceco at its highest position at its mean position and at its lowest position the middle set of images in fig 8 shows the corresponding water particle velocities around the floater as it oscillates where high velocities can be seen in its front and at the sharp corners at the top and bottom of the floater high velocities can also be observed in the back of the floater when ceco is at its mean position of approximately 4 m s the corresponding vorticity caused by these water particle velocities is shown in the bottom three images in fig 8 where the magnitude of the water vorticity has been calculated it is evident from the lower six images that there are non linear effects on the structure as it interacts with the incoming waves these non linear effects are not accounted for in frequency and time domain analysis of wave structure interactions based on bem therefore the use of cfd gives a greater insight into these effects and their potential impact in real world operation the results summarised in fig 7 also give an indication of how to improve the structural geometry of ceco s floaters there is an increase in the velocity of the water particles around the sharp corners at the top and bottom of floater which is evident in the middle three images of fig 7 along with a higher absolute vorticity at these points in the corresponding figures in the bottom three images of fig 7 this would suggest that the turbulence and the corresponding energy dissipation caused by ceco due to these geometric features could be significantly reduced by smoothing the corners this may lead to an improved performance of ceco due to a reduction in losses due to viscous effects or viscous forces around the wave energy converter when in operation especially for the most energy sea states 3 3 characterization of wave loading as discussed in section 2 2 ceco is a sloped motion wec that operates along an oblique direction that is a combination of surge and heave motions however the wave induced loads acting in the floaters were never analysed in detailed the loads presented in this section are for a full scale ceco in which each floater is 4 5 m wide and therefore since the 2 dimensional numerical cfd model is only 0 05 m wide the resulting forces have been scaled up by a factor of 90 in order to demonstrate the insights that may be gained from using the 2 dimensional cfd numerical model the regular wave case 4 is used again to characterize wave loading on one of ceco s floaters the heave force in the y direction surge force in the x direction and the force in the oscillating direction in the x direction fig 4 on the floater as it operates is shown in fig 9 it is evident from fig 9 that in terms of magnitude the heave force on ceco is the dominant force acting in the floater when ceco is stationary at t 0 s in the cfd model the heave force on a single floater due to archimedes principle is approximately 663 kn nevertheless it is important to mention that the peak to peak amplitude of both surge and heave forces is of the same order of magnitude and therefore the oscillations of ceco along the x direction are the result of both components although slightly dominated by the heave force for the current water depth of 16 m the heave and surge forces on ceco s floater are presented in fig 10 at 32 s 40 6 s and 48 s during its oscillation similar to the positions detailed in fig 8 when ceco is at its highest position within its oscillation it experiences relatively low heave force approximately 100 kn compared to when ceco is at its lowest position where it experiences a much higher heave force of just over 1000 kn when ceco is at its highest position within its oscillation a similar surge force is seen of approximately 100 kn as with the heave force in this position however a negative surge force is observed when ceco is at its lowest position of approximately 200 kn related to the full submergence of the floater this is partially due to archimedes principle as ceco attempts to return to the surface in summary the heave force applied in the floater is closely linked with its submergence level at each time step which is to be expected however the surge force is associated with the submerged area of the floater and its direction depends on the direction of the water particles motions paths the main advantage of using this energy extraction system is that ceco floaters utilise the wave forces in both the heave and surge direction allowing for more efficient extraction of the available energy in the incoming waves 3 4 varying incoming wave heights as the wave height of the linear waves is increased the motion of the waves stops from obeying the rules of airy s linear wave theory as they become higher order non linear waves the effect of this change can be seen by examining the response or rao of ceco as the wave height changes in this subsection the wave period is kept constant at 10 s and the wave height is varied from 2 m to 3 m and then to 4 m where the corresponding wave steepness h λ are 0 018 0 027 and 0 036 respectively where λ is the wavelength and is 111 8 m for a wave period of 10 s at a water depth of 16 m the results of varying the wave height can be seen in fig 11 where the rao of ceco is compared for the three wave heights in order to compare the response of ceco to the incoming linear waves of differing wave heights the rao which normalises that response against the wave height is used of the three wave heights when the incoming regular wave height is 2 m the rao is the highest and when the incoming regular wave height is 4 m the rao is the lowest which can be seen infig 11 this is due to the waves no longer being linear in nature this shows that the response of the structure is no longer directly proportional to the amplitude or height of the incoming waves as what is assumed in some hydrodynamic bem models which have a much lower computational cost small amplitude waves are defined by the steepness relation h λ 0 03 where in this study wave heights on each side of this limit are explored this result is important for the developers of wave energy harvesting technologies when they are predicting the performance of wecs and justifies the use of more computationally demanding tools such as the cfd models as opposed to some linear bem methods at least when it is of upmost importance to accurately model the dynamic response of wecs for high amplitude waves 4 conclusions the ansys cfx commercial package was used to implement a rans numerical model of the ceco wave energy converter once validated using data from experimental tests the numerical model was used first to carry out an in depth study of ceco interaction with incident waves and to characterize the forces action on its floaters during operation the validation followed a two stage approach first the dynamics of ceco were qualitatively analysed having as reference the experimental model tests after that the quantitative validation using the normalised rmse method is performed to compare the time series of the ceco motion in its single degree of freedom using the results from both physical and numerical cfd models under selected regular wave conditions this analysis showed a reasonably good matching between the physical and numerical models in spite of the simplifications that were introduced in the cfd numerical model some numerically obtained motion time series showed non linear patterns but not corresponding exactly to what was seen in the experimental tests the results of this study give an indication of how to improve the geometric shape of ceco s floaters where the identified non linear viscous damping effects could be minimised by changing its geometry at strategic locations reducing the amount of energy that is dissipated in each motion cycle on the other hand and for the first time the time evolution of the wave induced loads acting on the floaters of this sloped motion wave energy converter were characterized it is clear that absolute heave forces related to buoyancy dominate but surge forces are not negligible changing their direction according to the wave phase the analysis presented in this paper builds on previous work of the authors and could be applied to a wide variety of marine structures though it was primarily developed for analysing the non linear interactions of ocean waves with wave energy converters the next phase of the model development will be to explore new geometries of ceco using cfd and to examine the interaction of larger waves with ceco as it operates in deep sea conditions credit authorship contribution statement

21200,as the world strives to remove its reliance on fossil fuels wave energy presents a reliable source of renewable energy with a very high potential numerical simulations offer an inexpensive alternative in comparison to physical modelling for the development of wave energy converters in this paper a computational fluid dynamics model of the ceco wave energy converter wec has been developed using the commercial software ansys cfx in order to reduce on the computational resources required a 2 dimensional model of this sloped combination of heave and surge motion wec has been developed and then successfully validated with experimental results from physical model tests demonstrating the capability of such models to accurately describe the response of wecs the validated numerical model was then used to investigate the non linear effects on the motions of ceco and to obtain more insights in relation to wave loading during a wave cycle and the viscous effects associated to the dissipation of energy in the flow around its floaters the water particle velocity and vorticity around ceco and the heave and surge loadings on ceco while it is in operation are analysed and discussed the numerical model not only aid in the development of a new and enhanced geometry for ceco but also it can be used to model and analyse similar wecs keywords ansys cfx marine ranse modelling viscous effects wave energy wave structure interaction 1 introduction ocean wave energy is one of the world s most powerful forms of energy and the energy density in ocean waves is the highest among renewable energy sources clément et al 2002 in addition falnes 2007 shows that the power flow intensity of ocean waves is up to five times larger than for the wind that creates them being therefore an indirect form of solar power furthermore ocean wave energy is available up to 90 of the time which makes it a far more dependable source of energy when compared to the other renewable energy resources where solar and wind are available 20 30 of the time another advantage of ocean wave energy is since most of these waves travel long distances being usually out of phase with wind energy and consequently wave energy converters wecs may easily and efficiently be integrated with other renewable energy harvesting technologies such as offshore wind turbines however as with any form of energy there is a number of drawbacks when trying to harness it in turn one of the main reasons why this major natural resource has remained unexploited is that it is very variable and largely random over several time scales from wave to wave with sea state and seasonal variations falcão 2010 another challenge in harnessing this form of energy is the harsh and secluded environment where the most power dense waves exist that is in deep waters generally more than 40 m that are several kilometres offshore kempener and neumann 2014 the concept of harnessing ocean wave energy is by no means a new idea however the topic only gained international interest in the 1970 s with the publication of stephen salter s ground breaking paper on his wave energy duck salter 1974 since then over a thousand patents have been issued for wave energy converters wecs the united states patent incorporating a variety of methods however as of yet no winning wec design has been established and several concepts are presently being developed and optimized the ceco wave energy converter is a sloped motion concept which is illustrated in fig 1 being developed at the faculty of engineering of the university of porto feup portugal since 2012 the experimental proof of concept of this wec showed quite promising efficiencies converting ocean wave energy rosa santos et al 2015 and since then it has undergone a significant number of developments most of them using numerical models based on the boundary element method bem comprehensively validated with data from experimental tests for example lópez et al 2017a 2017b 2018a b rodríguez et al 2018 2019 those studies assessed for instance the influence of the power take off pto damping characteristics lópez et al 2017b pto inclination lópez et al 2018a b local water depth ramos et al 2018 and wave climate seasonality ramos et al 2017 on the performance of ceco and important insights were obtained for the subsequent improvement of this technology a detailed overview of the experimental and numerical work carried so far is presented in rosa santos et al 2019 the use of bem models is frequent up to intermediate stages of development of wecs for example in pastor et al pastor and liu 2014 day et al 2015 and sjokvist et al sjökvist et al 2017 in particular to analyse their performance under typical operational conditions due to the large number of variables parameters that should be investigated at those stages to maximize power harvesting capabilities for low to moderate sea states since these models are able to provide a sufficiently accurate solution and simultaneously present a very good compromise between accuracy and computational time however at more advanced stages of wec development the need to include viscous and other non linear effects as well as phenomena like wave splash overtopping and flow separation may impose the use of more advanced and computationally demanding modelling tools this is especially valid for the analysis of the survivability of wecs under extreme wave events in recent years with the development in computational power the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd for modelling offshore structures such as wecs has grown in popularity a number of early studies elangovan 2011 hadzic et al 2005 lal and elangovan 2008 liang et al 2010 sriram et al 2006 used numerical wave tanks which were based on cfd to explore the interaction of ocean waves with floating structures consequently a methodology for simulating linear regular waves and wave structure interaction in a numerical wave tank was developed by finnegan and goggins 2012 and this study was subsequently advanced to explore linear irregular waves in finnegan and goggins 2015 there are a number of examples where cfd models have been used to assess the performance of wecs for example lou et al luo et al 2014a used a 2 dimensional cfd analysis to explore the efficiency of a fixed oscillating water column wec using a fully nonlinear wave tank with the fluent cfd software this study was then advanced in lou et al luo et al 2014b to investigate the performance of a heave only oscillating water column wec similarly anbarsooz et al 2016 used the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 15 0 to explore the interaction of steep waves on a fixed oscillating water column wec chen et al 2017 developed a 3 dimensional mathematical model based on the navier stokes equations for the hydrodynamics and structural dynamics of a floating point absorbing wec and compared the results to a bem analysis and it was found that the difference in behaviour can be significant and vary considerably depending on wave height a detailed and comprehensive review of cfd based numerical wave tanks for wec experiments has been compiled by windt et al 2018 where the existing literature was categorised in order to present the current best practice guidelines and give recommendations for any deficits in the current state of the art in this study the ansys cfx package was used to implement a full scale rans vof numerical model of ceco which was then validated using experimental results in a two step approach qualitatively by comparing the motions of ceco and the disturbance induced in the water mass both in the physical and numerical models and quantitatively by comparing the motion time series and motion raos of ceco once validated the numerical model was used to carry out a broad study of the hydrodynamic behaviour of ceco and analyse the effect of non linear wave structure interaction between the ocean waves and this wec aiming at a better understanding of wave energy dissipation mechanisms and the assessment of its efficiency and dynamics namely under extreme wave conditions the wave input on one side of the model was a numerical input using airy s linear wave theory as opposed to the paddles used in the wave tank and the waves were damped at the other side of the model using numerical damping by manipulating the fluid viscosity as opposed to a beach that is used in the wave tank during the investigation an intermediate water depth 16 m which corresponds to the water depth tested in the wave tank in prototype values was explored as the action of the wind over the ocean surface can generate oscillation in the range of circa 3 s to around 20 or 25 s the range of wave conditions analysed had to be narrowed hence in this paper only the periods that are more frequent and have a higher contribution to the local energy resource were considered which are wind generated waves in the period 8 14 s regular wave conditions were used but both the height and period of the waves were varied in the simulations the response of the device was then normalised with respect to the wave height to calculate the response amplitude operator rao for the device and investigate its variance with wave period the rao from the numerical model were then compared to the monitored results from the physical model testing of a lowly damped ceco wave energy converter and found to be in good agreement for a wave period range of 8 14 s this paper is structured as follows the ceco concept and the methodology used to develop the cfd model is described in section 2 a model validation for the cfd model against experimental trials is presented in section 3 1 the model is then used to analyse and characterize the performance of ceco in operation sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 finally the summary and conclusions are given in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 aim and objectives the primary aim of this study is to investigate the interaction of ocean waves on the ceco wave energy converter during operation especially under energetic sea states for which the approaches based on bem models become inappropriate this study is performed by developing a 2 dimensional numerical wave tank model of ceco using cfd however in order to achieve this aim the following objectives must be achieved to develop a 2 dimensional numerical wave tank model of ceco using the methodology specified in finnegan et al finnegan and goggins 2012 to validate the results of the analysis against experimental data marinheiro et al 2015 to investigate the performance of ceco during operation in deep water conditions to evaluate the interaction of the water waves on ceco during operation with a focus on the more extreme sea states 2 2 ceco wave energy converter the ceco wave energy converter is a floating point wave energy absorber that oscillates due to the wave force on its floaters along a straight sloped path at a given inclination usually 45⁰ defined by the inclination of the guiding rods on the sliding frame fig 1 b ceco is made up of two main components a fixed supporting structure and two lateral floaters which are the moving parts that are excited by the incoming waves the fixed supporting structure is in place perpendicular to the translational direction of the floaters in operation and they are connected by a central frame fig 1 the unique design of ceco allows for both the surge horizontal and heave vertical motions induced by the incoming ocean waves to be converted into a single degree of freedom translational motion by the two floaters which is then transformed into useable electrical energy using a pto system that is installed inside the supporting structure the pto system includes a rack attached to the central frame pinion mechanism connected to the generator shaft and a dc generator the possibility of tuning the natural frequency of ceco motion with the angle of its translation path is also a distinctive characteristic for the nominal inclination and submergence volume of the floaters 45 and 60 respectively the free oscillation frequency of ceco is approximately 8 s table 1 presents the main dimensions of ceco further details on ceco can be found in rosa santos et al 2019 which details the development of ceco from the initial concept to its current state 2 3 governing equations the analysis presented in this study has been performed using the commercial cfd software ansys cfx where the solver is based on the finite volume technique nc and rel 2009 this technique divides the computational domains into sub regions of finite volume and discretises the governing equations in order to solve them iteratively over each sub region therefore an approximation of the value of each variable at points throughout the domain is achieved the governing equations that need to be solved by the ansys cfx solver are the mass continuity equation which is given as 1 ρ t ρ u 1 x ρ u 2 y 0 and the reynold s averaged navier stokes equations which are given as 2 ρ u 1 t u 1 u 1 x u 2 u 1 y p x 2 μ 2 u 1 x 2 y μ u 1 y u 2 x f 1 3 ρ u 2 t u 1 u 2 x u 2 u 2 y p y 2 μ 2 u 2 y 2 x μ u 1 y u 2 x f 2 ρ g where t is time ρ is the water density x is the horizontal distance from the wavemaker y is the vertical height from the still water level swl and increases with depth u 1 is the horizontal flow velocity u 2 is the vertical flow velocity f 1 is the body force on the fluid in the horizontal direction f 2 ρ g is the body force on the fluid in the vertical direction p is pressure and μ is dynamic viscosity in this study the volume of fluid vof method which enables multi phase modelling has been applied in conjunction with numerical wave probes to determine the position of the free surface this method which was also employed by liang et al 2010 adds another governing equation given by 4 q i t u 1 q i x u 2 q i y 0 i 1 2 where q i is the volume fraction of the fluid i with i 1 2 q i 1 where 1 denotes air and 2 water the free surface is then approximated as at the position of the minimum of value q 1 q 2 along the model 2 4 cfd model development 2 4 1 model geometry the ceco wave energy converter is comprised of two structural parts the support structure and the floaters which have been detailed in section 2 2 in order to reduce the computational cost of the simulation and subsequently investigate the accuracy of the model a 2 dimensional representation of ceco s floater has been modelled see fig 2 therefore the support structure and the sliding frame which are shown in fig 2 are not considered in this study the computational domain has been dived into two parts the working domain and the wave dissipation zone and the structure has been modelled as a rigid body with wall boundaries in the computational domain the overall length of the model is 250 m and the overall height is 40 m where the swl is 16 m full scale values in addition the ceco structure is located at a distance greater than 3 times the water depth from the wave inflow dean and dalrymple 1984 which allows reflected waves to dissipate in order to minimise their effect the generated wave 2 4 2 mesh development the mesh for the computational domain has been created based on the methodology developed in finnegan and goggins 2012 which includes a comprehensive convergence study for generating a mesh for a numerical wave tanks mesh refinement was performed using two methods which are specific to ansys cfx the body of influence method and the sphere of influence method that allow refinement at specific regions within the mesh the mesh has been refined along the swl from 4 m below to 4 m above the swl along the length of the model using the body of influence method and around the structure using the sphere of influence method where the maximum element size in both cases has been defined as 300 mm a maximum element size has also been defined in the remainder of the domain as 1000 mm therefore the mesh contains 44 400 elements which have 87 100 nodes and is shown in fig 3 that includes a close up of the mesh around the ceco structure the average aspect ratio of the mesh is 8 5 which has a maximum aspect ratio of 77 2 4 3 cfd setup the 2 dimensional numerical wave tank model of ceco has predominantly been developed in line with the methodology specified in finnegan and goggins 2012 along with incorporating aspects developed in finnegan and goggins 2015 for specifying the input wave elevation specifying the input water particle velocities and creating a numerical dissipation zone which are discussed in this section a numerical wavemaker has been used similar to finnegan and goggins 2015 where the wave has been specified at the wave inflow boundary shown in fig 3 which uses the opening boundary type with specified fluid velocities in ansys cfx this is similar to the technique used by mousaviraad et al 2010 who specified a linear potential solution at the input boundary in order to generate linear input waves the wave elevation η t is defined using the following equation from airy s linear wave theory 5 η t h 2 cos ω t ε where h is the wave height ω is the angular frequency of the wave t is time and ε is the phase angle the associated water particle velocities are defined using the following equations from airy s linear wave theory 6 u 1 t h 2 ω cosh k 0 y sinh k 0 d cos ω t ε and 7 u 2 t h 2 ω sinh k 0 y sinh k 0 d sin ω t ε where k 0 is the wavenumber y is the vertical distance from the base of the model and d is the water depth in addition a numerical method for dissipating the waves at the end of the numerical wave tank was applied similar to finnegan and goggins 2015 where the viscosity of the water increases towards the end of the computational domain using the following equation 8 μ 8 899 x 10 4 kg ms x 150 m 8 899 x 10 4 kg ms x 150 m 100 m 125000 kg ms x 150 m in operation the floater of ceco oscillates at a 45⁰ angle to the free surface in order to reproduce this movement in the numerical model a local coordinate system is set up so the floater moves in a single degree of motion where the structure moves in the x direction detailed in fig 4 the ceco structure is defined as a rigid body using the wall boundary type in ansys cfx where the body motion is accounted for through deformation of the mesh around the rigid body 2 5 regular wave cases for the purpose of validating the accuracy of the numerical cfd model of ceco 8 regular wave cases were used whose characteristics are detailed in table 2 these cases have been selected from the experimental data available for the purpose of validation while providing adequate representation within the wave period range from 8 to 14 s where two wave heights were taken at each wave period 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation firstly the behaviour of ceco observed in the cfd numerical model is qualitatively analysed using as reference the experimental model tests following this in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the numerical model that has been developed in this study the results of the numerical cfd simulations have been compared to the results from the experimental testing for the eight regular wave cases detailed in table 2 no damping is included in the ceco numerical model and therefore the experimental results for the least damping cases i e cases where no external damping is applied to the system only the inherent damping due to the movement of ceco on the sliding frame are used to validate the numerical model a graphical summary of this comparison is shown in fig 5 which presents the response amplitude operator rao as a function of the wave period which is calculated using the following equation 9 rao ζ a where ζ is half of the peak to peak amplitude of ceco response motion along its single degree of freedom in the x direction and a is the amplitude of the regular wave in addition to the eight regular wave cases the obtained numerical model results have also been compared to a summary of the bem results presented in lópez et al 2017a overall it can be seen that the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is quite satisfactory and that there is no clear trend defined when the raos obtained from the bem in lópez et al 2017a and cfd approaches are compared fig 5 it should also be mentioned that the best agreement between experimental and cfd numerical results was observed for the case t 14s and h 4m which is the most extreme sea state considered although generalization of this conclusion is counter productive due to the limited amount of cases considered in this study the cfd model validation also includes the comparison of the numerical results to the results from experimental testing for the 8 regular wave cases detailed in table 2 in the time domain therefore the dynamic response of the ceco floater in the x direction see fig 4 was compared for both the numerical model and experimental tests in the time domain fig 6 the free surface wave elevation is also included at the location of ceco which has been modelled with no structure present in the numerical wave tank in order to compare quantitatively the two responses from the numerical cfd and experimental tests which are presented in fig 6 the normalised root mean square error rmse method is used in this analysis the rmse is normalised against the amplitude of the response of ceco in the experimental tests where the rmse is calculated as follows 10 rmse n 1 n f e x p n f c f d n 2 n where n is the number of sample points f e x p n and f c f d n is the response of the experimental test and the numerical cfd test at sample point n respectively the normalised rmse for this comparison are given in table 3 for each of the 8 regular wave cases examined for the regular wave cases 1 and 4 t 8 10 s the results from the numerical model are in very good agreement with the experimental ones which can be seen qualitatively in fig 6 as the normalised rmse of the comparison is 0 07 and 0 17 table 3 respectively the comparison for regular wave cases 2 3 5 and 7 have reasonable agreement where the comparison between the experimental and numerical cfd results have a normalised rmse of between 0 25 and 0 28 which can be seen in table 3 the agreement is much less satisfactory for the other regular wave cases where the comparison for regular wave cases 6 and 8 have a normalised rmse of 0 33 and 0 57 respectively although for case 8 the peak to peak amplitudes of motion have been well reproduced numerically it is also worth mentioning that the numerical time series show some non linear patterns for the higher wave periods but those do not correspond exactly to what is observed in their experimental counterparts differences between the experimental and the numerical results are expected due to the simplifications introduced in the modelling 2 dimensional representation of one ceco s floater and the non consideration of the reference supporting structure and of the sliding frame 3 2 interaction of waves with ceco a single case study regular wave case 4 where the wave height is 3 m and the wave period is 10 s is used to examine the movement of the water particles around ceco as it oscillates under the action of incident waves this regular wave case is selected as it is close to the desired operating period of ceco while in operation fig 7 shows snapshots of ceco s floater moving as it oscillates in operation from its highest position in the left three images to its mean position in the middle three images to its lowest position in the right three images the top three images in fig 8 show the position of ceco s floater during the numerical simulation at 32 s 40 6 s and 48 s which shows ceco at its highest position at its mean position and at its lowest position the middle set of images in fig 8 shows the corresponding water particle velocities around the floater as it oscillates where high velocities can be seen in its front and at the sharp corners at the top and bottom of the floater high velocities can also be observed in the back of the floater when ceco is at its mean position of approximately 4 m s the corresponding vorticity caused by these water particle velocities is shown in the bottom three images in fig 8 where the magnitude of the water vorticity has been calculated it is evident from the lower six images that there are non linear effects on the structure as it interacts with the incoming waves these non linear effects are not accounted for in frequency and time domain analysis of wave structure interactions based on bem therefore the use of cfd gives a greater insight into these effects and their potential impact in real world operation the results summarised in fig 7 also give an indication of how to improve the structural geometry of ceco s floaters there is an increase in the velocity of the water particles around the sharp corners at the top and bottom of floater which is evident in the middle three images of fig 7 along with a higher absolute vorticity at these points in the corresponding figures in the bottom three images of fig 7 this would suggest that the turbulence and the corresponding energy dissipation caused by ceco due to these geometric features could be significantly reduced by smoothing the corners this may lead to an improved performance of ceco due to a reduction in losses due to viscous effects or viscous forces around the wave energy converter when in operation especially for the most energy sea states 3 3 characterization of wave loading as discussed in section 2 2 ceco is a sloped motion wec that operates along an oblique direction that is a combination of surge and heave motions however the wave induced loads acting in the floaters were never analysed in detailed the loads presented in this section are for a full scale ceco in which each floater is 4 5 m wide and therefore since the 2 dimensional numerical cfd model is only 0 05 m wide the resulting forces have been scaled up by a factor of 90 in order to demonstrate the insights that may be gained from using the 2 dimensional cfd numerical model the regular wave case 4 is used again to characterize wave loading on one of ceco s floaters the heave force in the y direction surge force in the x direction and the force in the oscillating direction in the x direction fig 4 on the floater as it operates is shown in fig 9 it is evident from fig 9 that in terms of magnitude the heave force on ceco is the dominant force acting in the floater when ceco is stationary at t 0 s in the cfd model the heave force on a single floater due to archimedes principle is approximately 663 kn nevertheless it is important to mention that the peak to peak amplitude of both surge and heave forces is of the same order of magnitude and therefore the oscillations of ceco along the x direction are the result of both components although slightly dominated by the heave force for the current water depth of 16 m the heave and surge forces on ceco s floater are presented in fig 10 at 32 s 40 6 s and 48 s during its oscillation similar to the positions detailed in fig 8 when ceco is at its highest position within its oscillation it experiences relatively low heave force approximately 100 kn compared to when ceco is at its lowest position where it experiences a much higher heave force of just over 1000 kn when ceco is at its highest position within its oscillation a similar surge force is seen of approximately 100 kn as with the heave force in this position however a negative surge force is observed when ceco is at its lowest position of approximately 200 kn related to the full submergence of the floater this is partially due to archimedes principle as ceco attempts to return to the surface in summary the heave force applied in the floater is closely linked with its submergence level at each time step which is to be expected however the surge force is associated with the submerged area of the floater and its direction depends on the direction of the water particles motions paths the main advantage of using this energy extraction system is that ceco floaters utilise the wave forces in both the heave and surge direction allowing for more efficient extraction of the available energy in the incoming waves 3 4 varying incoming wave heights as the wave height of the linear waves is increased the motion of the waves stops from obeying the rules of airy s linear wave theory as they become higher order non linear waves the effect of this change can be seen by examining the response or rao of ceco as the wave height changes in this subsection the wave period is kept constant at 10 s and the wave height is varied from 2 m to 3 m and then to 4 m where the corresponding wave steepness h λ are 0 018 0 027 and 0 036 respectively where λ is the wavelength and is 111 8 m for a wave period of 10 s at a water depth of 16 m the results of varying the wave height can be seen in fig 11 where the rao of ceco is compared for the three wave heights in order to compare the response of ceco to the incoming linear waves of differing wave heights the rao which normalises that response against the wave height is used of the three wave heights when the incoming regular wave height is 2 m the rao is the highest and when the incoming regular wave height is 4 m the rao is the lowest which can be seen infig 11 this is due to the waves no longer being linear in nature this shows that the response of the structure is no longer directly proportional to the amplitude or height of the incoming waves as what is assumed in some hydrodynamic bem models which have a much lower computational cost small amplitude waves are defined by the steepness relation h λ 0 03 where in this study wave heights on each side of this limit are explored this result is important for the developers of wave energy harvesting technologies when they are predicting the performance of wecs and justifies the use of more computationally demanding tools such as the cfd models as opposed to some linear bem methods at least when it is of upmost importance to accurately model the dynamic response of wecs for high amplitude waves 4 conclusions the ansys cfx commercial package was used to implement a rans numerical model of the ceco wave energy converter once validated using data from experimental tests the numerical model was used first to carry out an in depth study of ceco interaction with incident waves and to characterize the forces action on its floaters during operation the validation followed a two stage approach first the dynamics of ceco were qualitatively analysed having as reference the experimental model tests after that the quantitative validation using the normalised rmse method is performed to compare the time series of the ceco motion in its single degree of freedom using the results from both physical and numerical cfd models under selected regular wave conditions this analysis showed a reasonably good matching between the physical and numerical models in spite of the simplifications that were introduced in the cfd numerical model some numerically obtained motion time series showed non linear patterns but not corresponding exactly to what was seen in the experimental tests the results of this study give an indication of how to improve the geometric shape of ceco s floaters where the identified non linear viscous damping effects could be minimised by changing its geometry at strategic locations reducing the amount of energy that is dissipated in each motion cycle on the other hand and for the first time the time evolution of the wave induced loads acting on the floaters of this sloped motion wave energy converter were characterized it is clear that absolute heave forces related to buoyancy dominate but surge forces are not negligible changing their direction according to the wave phase the analysis presented in this paper builds on previous work of the authors and could be applied to a wide variety of marine structures though it was primarily developed for analysing the non linear interactions of ocean waves with wave energy converters the next phase of the model development will be to explore new geometries of ceco using cfd and to examine the interaction of larger waves with ceco as it operates in deep sea conditions credit authorship contribution statement

21201,previous studies indicated that the occurrence of freak wave has a significant impact on the time domain characteristics of a moored floater dynamic response in this study extensive investigations have been performed to figure out further dynamic response characteristics of a moored square cylinder under freak wave in frequency domain in the experiments the wave sequences with and without the freak wave are defined as freak and random waves respectively the results show that the freak wave parameter α 1 and spectral peak period have significant impacts on the dynamic response characteristics of the moored floater in frequency domain the effect of freak wave on surge and mooring tension of the floater is figured out through the low frequency components 0 0 5f p which leads to significant increase with α 1 followed the occurrence of freak wave surge increases sharply and oscillates for longer than 20 wave periods in low frequency without the occurrence of freak wave however both amplitude and oscillating of surge is significantly weaker the mooring tension response is subjected to surge and hence the trend of variation is similar to surge keywords hydrodynamic characteristics square cylinder freak wave random wave frequency domain 1 introduction in the recent decades more and more occurrences of freak wave have been recorded and reported in the oceanographic observations globally in the meantime many maritime accidents demonstrate that freak wave is a serious hazard to offshore vessels and structures therefore it is worth to investigate the security of marine structures under freak wave progresses have been made on freak wave generation mechanism numerical and physical simulation as well as the interaction with structures thus far the techniques of generating freak wave in both numerical and physical ways have been well developed osborne 2001 and slunyaev et al 2002 used nls nonlinear schrodinger equation to simulate freak wave numerically pei et al 2007 generated freak wave at a target location in wave tank by superposing a random wave train with two transient wave trains cui et al 2012 applied the vof volume of fluid method to establish fully nonlinear wave numerical model with the governing equation of reynolds averaged navier stokes equation and k ε equation as well as adopted the model to simulate the generation of freak wave evolution process and the effect of water bottom on the freak wave propagation there are extensive numerical investigations on the interaction between freak wave and structures moctar et al 2007 investigated the freak wave impacts on a mobile jack up drilling platform with cfd computational fluid dynamic and fem finite element method methods and established a numerical model to predict freak wave load on self elevating drilling platform the model solved the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations applying the vof interface capturing technique rudman and cleary 2013 adopted the sph smoothed particle hydrodynamic method to simulate fully non linear interactions between a tlp tension leg platform and freak wave they considered the effect of incident angle and mooring line pre tension on the subsequent motions of the platform zhao et al 2014 developed a cip constraint interpolation profile based numerical model to simulate large amplitude motions of a floater under freak wave gao et al 2016 numerically investigated the interaction between deterministic freak wave and fixed cylinders submerged in different depths the results indicated that the most critical vertical loads were observed during the freak wave approaching which may cause severe vertical responses on the fixed horizontal structures in terms of model experiments clauss et al 2003 investigated the motions behavior and splitting forces of a semi submersible under freak wave through the experimental measurements and time domain simulation it was found that the maximum response is subjected to the freak wave height schmittner 2005 investigated the motions and bending moments of a fpso floating production storage and offloading and a heavy lift vessel as well as the motions and splitting forces of a semi submersible under freak wave the results show that the vertical bending moments heave and pitch of fpso and heavy lift vessel as well as the airgap and splitting forces of semi submersible under freak wave are larger than the maximum values predicted by codes and frequency domain analysis shen and yang 2013 compared the motion response of semi submersible under two predetermined extreme wave sequences and analyzed the impacts of freak wave and three sisters wave three huge waves in succession on platform motions the results showed that the peak value of wave height is the key parameter in determining the dynamic response of the platform which should be a concern in front end engineering design study the adjacent effect in the three sisters wave has impacts on the platform motion the surge and heave of the platform are both increased with the adjacent wave heights deng et al 2015 investigated the effect of mooring stiffness on the motion behaviors and mooring tensions of a semi submersible platform the measurements showed that the freak wave can lead to critical horizontal motions on the flexible mooring system and extremely large mooring tensions on the tight mooring system with the identical wave spectra pan et al 2018 compared the motion response of a moored square cylinder under freak and random waves and quantified the effects of relative wave height relative period and freak wave parameters on motion response of the floater based on time domain measurements the above researches show that the effect of freak wave on various structures is more critical than the random wave however the existing researches mainly focus on the time domain statistical characteristics investigation of the interaction between freak wave and structures few researches investigated the frequency domain characteristics on the dynamic response of the floaters through frequency domain analysis it is convenient to obtain energy distribution peak frequency total energy and each order spectral moment etc but the frequency spectrum cannot provide the variation of energy in time series for a stationary process the local frequency characteristics in time series probably is not so important however as a spike in a random wave series the local characteristics of freak wave in time domain are exactly our concerns compared to fourier transfer wavelet analysis method is effective in obtaining the energy spectral density and the energy distribution of each frequency in time domain especially the instantaneous physical change under freak wave hence the wavelet analysis method is adopted in this study based on the work of pan et al 2018 the present study compared the frequency domain dynamic response of a moored square cylinder under freak and random waves with identical wave spectra through experimental measurements which are designed to determine the variation of frequency domain characteristics of dynamic response and the quantitative relationship with the freak wave parameter to further investigate the significant impact on the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response of the floater under freak wave the time frequency spectra of the dynamic response under freak and random waves were calculated by wavelet analysis to investigate the time frequency structure characteristics and variation 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup the tests were carried out in a wave flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology the flume is 60 0 m long 4 0 m wide and 2 5 m deep the wave generation system is hydro servo random wave maker system and can generate waves with periods ranging from 0 5s to 5 0s at the other end of the flume an absorbing beach is installed for wave dissipation effectively the motion of moored square cylinder were measured by a non contact 6dof degree of freedom measurement system consisting of dual ccd charge coupled device cameras and a data acquisition system three light markers were arranged in a plane and fixed on top of the cylinder to track the motion behaviors by the dual ccd cameras the

significant wave height and the average period calculated from the spectral moment respectively to figure out the effect of various parameters two types of random wave sequences have been designed and generated for the experiments in the tests the constant wave height and period generated has minor variation within 3 to the target values which is allowable table 2 2 3 2 experiment methods in the present study the freak wave was generated at the target location using a random wave train combined with two transient wave trains which was proposed and used by pei et al 2007 with the linear superposition method the wave surface can be expressed as 5 η x t η 1 x t η 2 x t η 3 x t i 1 m a 1 i cos k i x w i t ε i i 1 m a 2 i cos k i x x c w i t t c ε i i 1 m a 2 i cos k i x x c w i t t c ε i where η denotes the elevation of water surface above the mean water level a 1i is amplitude of the random wave a 2i and a 3i are amplitudes of the transient waves the model was installed and moored with pre tension of 1 1 2 n under hydrostatic status and collected 0 point at equilibrium position the decay test was then performed by applying an artificial displacement rotation on the floater and releasing the decay curve of motion process had been completely collected until the floater resumed to static state rao test the time history of the motion responses were recorded with a frequency of 30 hz under the regular wave sequence iii in table 2 the measurements for each test typically lasted for more than 10 waves freak wave test the freak wave was generated using a random wave train combined with two transient wave trains with p m spectrum the measurement for each test typically lasted for more than 100 waves and were performed 2 or 3 times to ensure the repeatability during each test the motions and mooring tensions were recorded synchronously with a frequency of 30 hz random wave test to compare the experimental results measured under freak and random waves the same spectrum with identical spectral parameters to the freak wave were applied and the measurement was similar to the freak wave test based on the measured time histories spectral analyses were performed to obtain the frequency domain characteristics of the motions and mooring tensions of the floating square cylinder i e the spectral pattern spectral peak 0th 1st 2nd order moments and other statistics 2 3 3 wavelet analysis method wavelet analysis method is adopted to compute the time frequency spectra of the dynamic responses under freak and random waves the variation of the time frequency energy structure has been investigated the morlet wavelet is selected as the mother wavelet that can be expressed as 6 ψ t π 1 4 e t 2 2 e i w 0 t where ω 0 is the non dimensional frequency here taken to be 6 to satisfy the admissibility condition torrencr and compo 1998 the continuous wavelet transform of a discrete sequence x n is defined as the convolution of x n with a scaled and translated version of ψ t 7 w n s n n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where the superscript is the complex conjugate s is the wavelet scale and n is the time index it is more efficient to do the calculations in fourier space by the convolution theorem the wavelet transform is the inverse fourier transform of the product 8 w n s k 0 n 1 x ˆ k ψ ˆ s w k e i w k n δ t where k 0 n 1 is the frequency index the spectral density s f t of the wavelet energy spectrum can be defined as 9 s f t w s t 2 the spectral density s f t describes the variation of a physical parameter from time domain and frequency domain for surge heave and pitch of moored square cylinder we can determine the variation of time frequency domain characteristics followed the occurrence of the freak wave and the maximum wave of random wave in order to investigate the variation quantitatively the following parameters are defined 1 generalized energy spectrum e t the time frequency spectrum wavelet spectrum of a physical quantity integrated in the frequency at any time and the result can be regarded as a time history of generalized energy spectrum which is denoted as e t 10 e t j s i j δ f j the generalized total energy of each frequency component of a physical quantity when the freak wave or the maximum wave of random wave occurred is denoted as e c e t t c 11 e c j s c j δ f j 2 time distribution parameter of energy concentration δt e the problem we focus on is the variation of dynamic response of a moored square cylinder under freak and random waves the maximum value of the generalized energy spectrum e t of a physical quantity under random wave is denoted as e imax for the freak wave t emin is the starting time of e t e imax after the occurrence of freak wave t emax is the ending time of e t e imax the response time of the freak wave is defined as δ t e 12 δt e t emax t emin 3 analysis of experiments results it is known that the dynamic response of the floater is affected by the natural period and rao characteristics significantly therefore the experimental results of natural period and rao response are presented firstly based on the motion responses and mooring tensions of the floating cylinder measured synchronously the spectra of motion responses and mooring tensions under freak and random waves are analyzed and the characteristics in frequency domain of each motion component and mooring tension are discussed also the effect of spectral peak period and freak wave parameter on the dynamic response are discussed and the difference in dynamic response under freak and random waves is analyzed in frequency domain 3 1 decay tests and response amplitude operators raos after performing decay tests of the moored floater in still water the natural periods of surge heave and pitch were obtained t 0s 10 0s t 0h 1 4s and t 0p 2 0s respectively the response amplitude operators rao of the floater were obtained through regular wave test sequence iii in table 2 fig 3 illustrates that heave and pitch increase with the relative period and reach the local peak at the natural periods the maximum heave can be up to 0 9h h 10 cm at the natural period t t 0h with further increasing of the wave period heave oscillates in the range of 0 4 0 6h close to the wave amplitude which is consistent with the variation range of conventional moored floaters the maximum pitch occurs at the natural period t t 0p with further increasing of the wave period pitch varies in the range of θ 1 3 1 2θ max in addition the amplitudes of heave and pitch are approximately symmetrical in the positive and negative components due to the limitation of the wave maker the test period cannot cover the natural period of surge therefore the test curve may not show the completed characteristics of surge rao in the test ranges of wave period the positive amplitude of surge is larger than the negative one in the wave propagating direction the maximum surge occurs at t t 0p 0 7 t t 0h 1 0 the natural period of heave it implies that the maximum surge is affected by the resonance of heave when the wave period is smaller than the natural period of pitch t t 0p 1 the surge shows a considerable value which has been addressed by song et al 2018 in the experimental study on motions of tunnel element this is related to the fact that the larger relative motion of the floater under short waves due to stronger diffraction effects and larger mean 2nd order horizontal forces i e pinkster 1979 3 2 comparison of frequency domain characteristics of moored floater under freak and random waves the dynamic response of moored square cylinder includes the motion response mooring tension and wave load the frequency domain characteristics of motion response and mooring tension are discussed in this study the wave loads on square cylinder including the total wave force and wave pressures will be discussed in a separate study 3 2 1 effect of spectral peak period the same wave spectrum can generate various random wave series by applying different random seeds to compare the experimental results measured under freak and random waves the identical spectrum were applied and the measurement was similar for the freak and random wave tests in fig 4 the comparison shows that the measured freak and random wave spectra match well with the target spectrum under freak and random waves generated by the same spectra the frequency domain characteristics of motion response with various spectral peak periods were shown in fig 5 two wave series were generated with the identical wave height of h s 8 cm and relative periods of t p t 0h 0 81 2 21 t p t 0p 0 57 1 55 the freak wave series are generated with the characteristics of 2 01 α 1 2 20 fig 5 shows 1 the surge spectra of the floater are consisted of low frequency and wave frequency components the surge spectra show the similar trends under freak and random waves with various relative wave period 2 the variation of surge in frequency domain is subjected to the relative wave period with respect to the relative wave period there are three typical scenarios on surge spectra firstly with small relative wave period 0 57 t p t 0p 0 92 the surge spectra show significant low frequency characteristics and the wave frequency component can be neglected secondly when the relative wave period is close to the natural pitch period t 0p 0 92 t p t 0p 1 08 the surge spectra are mainly low frequency but the wave frequency cannot be neglected thirdly with large relative wave period 1 08 t p t 0p 1 55 the surge spectra are bimodal and the wave frequency component of surge has the same order of magnitude as the low frequency component 3 the spectral characteristics of heave and pitch of the floater are basically identical under freak and random waves and both are subjected to the relative wave period 4 with relative wave period small 0 81 t p t 0h 1 11 the heave spectra are unimodal the peak frequency is observed at the natural frequency of heave however with the relative wave period larger than the natural period of heave t p t 0h 1 11 the heave spectra show dual peaks at spectral peak frequency and natural frequency of heave with the wave period increasing the spectral peak frequency deviates from the natural frequency of heave gradually as a consequence the peak of heave spectrum at the wave frequency increases gradually until reaches the peak in this case the heave is dominated by wave frequency and the effect of natural frequency of heave is weaken with the wave period gradually 5 the pitch spectra are unimodal and the peak occurs at the natural frequency of pitch in the test range when the wave spectral peak frequency is close to the natural frequency of pitch the critical pitch spectrum was observed it implies that the pitch of moored square cylinder is dominated by the natural period which is different to the pitch of a moored ship the characteristics of mooring tension in frequency domain are addressed in fig 6 the same wave conditions are adopted in motion response analysis the results indicate 1 with respect to the relative wave period there are two typical scenarios on frequency response of mooring tension firstly with small relative wave period 0 57 t p t 0p 0 78 the peak of the mooring tension spectra under freak wave is larger than that under random wave the frequency response of mooring tension is dominated by the 2ndorder drift force under both freak and random waves in other words the mooring tension is dominated by the low frequency component and the wave frequency component is minor with relative wave period increasing 0 92 t p t 0p 1 55 the variation of mooring tension between the freak and random waves becomes minor since the 2nd order drift force decreases with the relative period and the wave frequency component of mooring tension has the same order of magnitude as the low frequency component in summary the dynamic response of surge and mooring tension in frequency domain is dominated by the first order wave force wave frequency and second order drift force far lower than wave frequency the response of heave in frequency domain is dominated by the resonant effect of the natural frequency and wave spectral peak period however the response of pitch in frequency domain is subjected to the natural frequency only in general the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic responses show the similar trends under freak and random waves with the relative wave period 3 2 2 effect of freak wave parameter to investigate the effect of the freak wave parameter α 1 the freak wave were generated with various α 1 α 1 1 71 2 83 all wave series were generated under constant relative wave height is h s d 0 057 relative period is t p t 0h 1 14 and t p t 0p 0 8 fig 7 shows the motion responses spectra of the floater under various freak wave parameter α 1 the results indicate 1 when the freak wave parameter α 1 is small α 1 2 07 the surge spectrum under freak wave is basically identical with the random wave when the freak wave parameter α 1 is large α 1 2 32 the low frequency component of surge under freak wave is significantly larger than that under random wave and the variation increases with α 1 however the wave frequency component of surge are basically identical under freak and random waves 2 with respect to the heave and pitch the spectral characteristics of heave and pitch are basically identical under freak and random waves and the variation is insignificant with freak wave parameter α 1 the characteristics of mooring tension in frequency domain are addressed in fig 8 the variation of the frequency domain characteristics of the mooring tension with α 1 is similar to the surge of moored floater under freak and random waves in general the freak wave parameter α 1 has significant impact on the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response which leads to significant increase of surge and mooring tension in low frequency component such variation increases rapidly with the freak wave parameter α 1 but has seldom impact on heave and pitch 3 3 the effect of freak wave parameter on dynamic response in frequency domain the above discussion shows that the freak wave parameter α 1 has direct impact on the surge and mooring tension of the floating body in frequency domain in this section the effect of the freak wave parameter α 1 on the dynamic response are analyzed quantitatively in frequency domain under freak wave 3 3 1 quantitative analysis of the effect of freak wave parameter fig 9 shows the test results of the dynamic responses spectral parameters varying with the freak wave parameter α 1 all wave series were generated under constant relative wave height is h s d 0 057 relative period is t p t 0h 1 14 and t p t 0p 0 8 the freak wave parameter varies at α 1 1 71 2 83 the results indicate 1 compared with the random wave of same spectrum the 0th 1st order moments of surge increase with α 1 significantly m 0f m 0i 0 89 2 63 m 1f m 1i 1 0 1 42 but the 2nd order moments vary not significantly m 2f m 2i 1 0 1 07 2 the 0th 1st 2nd order moments of heave and pitch are basically unchanged with α 1 it indicates that the effect of the freak wave parameter α 1 on the heave and pitch are weaker than that on surge 3 the variation of the 0th 1st 2nd order moments of mooring tension with α 1 is similar to the surge of floating body the 0th 1st order moments increase with α 1 significantly m 0f m 0i 1 05 2 81 m 1f m 1i 1 04 1 53 the variation of 2nd order moments is insignificant with freak wave parameter α 1 m 2f m 2i 0 99 1 17 3 3 2 analysis on the key factor for the frequency response of the floater it is found in the previous discussion that with α 1 1 71 2 83 the 0th order moment of surge and mooring tension under freak wave are 0 89 2 63 and 1 05 2 81 times of those under random waves as a solo extreme wave in a random wave series the freak wave makes substantial change to the spectral characteristics of surge and mooring tension to figure out the reason the synchronous time history and time frequency spectra of surge and mooring tension calculated by wavelet analysis under freak and random waves are compared in fig 12 under various α 1 respectively the wavelet analysis provides the energy spectral density and energy distribution of each frequency in time domain especially in capturing instantaneous changes of each spectrum in fig 10 the amplitude of surge increases shapely after the occurrence of the freak wave and oscillates for longer than 20 wave periods in low frequency during the oscillating the wave frequency component of surge is minor and can be neglected under the random wave the surge component in low frequency is also significant but the amplitude is significantly smaller than that under freak wave which is a substantial difference to freak wave the low frequency surge responses is significantly enlarged with the freak wave action this is because the freak wave provide an extra impulse driving the floater further away before pulling it back by the restoring forces the mooring tension response is similar to the surge there is a significant variation in the time frequency spectra of the surge and mooring tension under freak and random waves with the occurrence of freak wave the time frequency spectra of the surge and mooring tension increase significantly and show a concentrated distribution of the energy it is also shown that the peak value of time frequency spectra increases significantly with the freak wave parameter α 1 to further investigate the significant impact on the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response of the moored floater under freak wave the generalized energy spectrum e t of the dynamic response surge and mooring tension are illustrated in fig 11 under freak and random waves respectively it is observed that the critical generalized energy spectrum e t and the time distribution parameter of energy concentration δt e of surge and mooring tension under freak wave is significant larger than that under random wave it is also observed from fig 11 that the freak wave parameter α 1 has direct impact on the e t andδt e which both increase with the freak wave parameter α 1 for further investigating the variation of the low frequency and wave frequency components of the dynamic responses under freak wave the normalized spectral moment m 0f m 0i subscript 0 represents the 0 order spectral moment f and i represent freak and random waves are plotted in fig 12 which shows the comparison of the low frequency and wave frequency components of the surge and mooring tension spectra versus α 1 under freak and random waves it is defined the frequency of 0 0 5f p and 0 5f p as low frequency and wave frequency respectively f p is the wave spectral peak frequency with α 1 increases from 1 71 to 2 83 the low frequency component of surge increases rapidly under freak wave the ratio of low frequency component of surge under freak wave to that under random wave increase from 0 83 to 3 61 but the ratio of wave frequency components of surge has minor variation within 0 94 1 0 it implies that the key effect of freak wave on the motion response of the floater is subjected to the low frequency component of surge also the variation of mooring tension with α 1 is similar to the surge of floating body the low frequency component of the mooring tension under freak wave is larger than that under random wave with α 1 1 71 2 83 the ratio of low frequency component of mooring tension under freak wave to that under random wave increase from 0 92 to 5 34 the ratio of wave frequency components has minor variation within 1 04 1 44 respectively the results show that the effect of freak wave on the mooring tension of the floater is also realized through the low frequency component 4 conclusion based on the experimental measurements in time domain the dynamic response of a moored square cylinder under freak wave has been investigated in frequency domain given identical wave spectrum the dynamic response of moored square cylinder in frequency domain and time frequency energy structure are substantially different under freak and random waves extensive analyses have been conducted to quantify the effect of relative wave period and freak wave parameter and main conclusions can be drawn 1 the freak wave has direct effect on the frequency domain characteristics of surge and mooring tension of the floater but seldom impact on heave and pitch the freak wave parameter α 1 leads to significant variation on surge and mooring tension 2 the effect of freak wave on the surge and mooring tension of the floater is figured out through the low frequency components which leads to significant increase with α 1 this is because the freak wave provides an extra impulse for driving the floater further away before pulling it back by the restoring forces the mooring tension response is similar to the surge 3 the amplitude of surge increases shapely after the occurrence of freak wave and oscillates for longer than 20 wave periods in low frequency in random waves however both amplitude and oscillation of surge are significantly weaker the response of mooring tension is subjected to the surge response 4 the wavelet analysis is effective in investigating the dynamic response of moored floater under freak wave compared with statistical or spectral analysis wavelet analysis can outstandingly demonstrate the typical characteristics of dynamic response on the floater under freak wave it can obtain the energy spectral density and the energy distribution of each frequency in time domain especially the instantaneous physical change with the occurrence of freak wave it is found that the freak wave have significant effect on the time frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response than the random wave with the same wave spectrum with the occurrence of freak wave the time frequency spectra of the dynamic responses increase significantly and show a concentrated distribution of the energy this implies that the occurrence of freak wave imposes serious potential risks on marine structures and vessels 5 the freak wave parameter α 1 has direct impact on the time frequency spectra characteristics of surge and mooring tension the peak value of time frequency spectra of surge and mooring tension increases significantly with the freak wave parameter α 1 the critical generalized energy spectra e t and the time distribution parameter of energy concentration δt e of surge and mooring tension under freak wave also increase with the freak wave parameter α 1

21201,previous studies indicated that the occurrence of freak wave has a significant impact on the time domain characteristics of a moored floater dynamic response in this study extensive investigations have been performed to figure out further dynamic response characteristics of a moored square cylinder under freak wave in frequency domain in the experiments the wave sequences with and without the freak wave are defined as freak and random waves respectively the results show that the freak wave parameter α 1 and spectral peak period have significant impacts on the dynamic response characteristics of the moored floater in frequency domain the effect of freak wave on surge and mooring tension of the floater is figured out through the low frequency components 0 0 5f p which leads to significant increase with α 1 followed the occurrence of freak wave surge increases sharply and oscillates for longer than 20 wave periods in low frequency without the occurrence of freak wave however both amplitude and oscillating of surge is significantly weaker the mooring tension response is subjected to surge and hence the trend of variation is similar to surge keywords hydrodynamic characteristics square cylinder freak wave random wave frequency domain 1 introduction in the recent decades more and more occurrences of freak wave have been recorded and reported in the oceanographic observations globally in the meantime many maritime accidents demonstrate that freak wave is a serious hazard to offshore vessels and structures therefore it is worth to investigate the security of marine structures under freak wave progresses have been made on freak wave generation mechanism numerical and physical simulation as well as the interaction with structures thus far the techniques of generating freak wave in both numerical and physical ways have been well developed osborne 2001 and slunyaev et al 2002 used nls nonlinear schrodinger equation to simulate freak wave numerically pei et al 2007 generated freak wave at a target location in wave tank by superposing a random wave train with two transient wave trains cui et al 2012 applied the vof volume of fluid method to establish fully nonlinear wave numerical model with the governing equation of reynolds averaged navier stokes equation and k ε equation as well as adopted the model to simulate the generation of freak wave evolution process and the effect of water bottom on the freak wave propagation there are extensive numerical investigations on the interaction between freak wave and structures moctar et al 2007 investigated the freak wave impacts on a mobile jack up drilling platform with cfd computational fluid dynamic and fem finite element method methods and established a numerical model to predict freak wave load on self elevating drilling platform the model solved the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations applying the vof interface capturing technique rudman and cleary 2013 adopted the sph smoothed particle hydrodynamic method to simulate fully non linear interactions between a tlp tension leg platform and freak wave they considered the effect of incident angle and mooring line pre tension on the subsequent motions of the platform zhao et al 2014 developed a cip constraint interpolation profile based numerical model to simulate large amplitude motions of a floater under freak wave gao et al 2016 numerically investigated the interaction between deterministic freak wave and fixed cylinders submerged in different depths the results indicated that the most critical vertical loads were observed during the freak wave approaching which may cause severe vertical responses on the fixed horizontal structures in terms of model experiments clauss et al 2003 investigated the motions behavior and splitting forces of a semi submersible under freak wave through the experimental measurements and time domain simulation it was found that the maximum response is subjected to the freak wave height schmittner 2005 investigated the motions and bending moments of a fpso floating production storage and offloading and a heavy lift vessel as well as the motions and splitting forces of a semi submersible under freak wave the results show that the vertical bending moments heave and pitch of fpso and heavy lift vessel as well as the airgap and splitting forces of semi submersible under freak wave are larger than the maximum values predicted by codes and frequency domain analysis shen and yang 2013 compared the motion response of semi submersible under two predetermined extreme wave sequences and analyzed the impacts of freak wave and three sisters wave three huge waves in succession on platform motions the results showed that the peak value of wave height is the key parameter in determining the dynamic response of the platform which should be a concern in front end engineering design study the adjacent effect in the three sisters wave has impacts on the platform motion the surge and heave of the platform are both increased with the adjacent wave heights deng et al 2015 investigated the effect of mooring stiffness on the motion behaviors and mooring tensions of a semi submersible platform the measurements showed that the freak wave can lead to critical horizontal motions on the flexible mooring system and extremely large mooring tensions on the tight mooring system with the identical wave spectra pan et al 2018 compared the motion response of a moored square cylinder under freak and random waves and quantified the effects of relative wave height relative period and freak wave parameters on motion response of the floater based on time domain measurements the above researches show that the effect of freak wave on various structures is more critical than the random wave however the existing researches mainly focus on the time domain statistical characteristics investigation of the interaction between freak wave and structures few researches investigated the frequency domain characteristics on the dynamic response of the floaters through frequency domain analysis it is convenient to obtain energy distribution peak frequency total energy and each order spectral moment etc but the frequency spectrum cannot provide the variation of energy in time series for a stationary process the local frequency characteristics in time series probably is not so important however as a spike in a random wave series the local characteristics of freak wave in time domain are exactly our concerns compared to fourier transfer wavelet analysis method is effective in obtaining the energy spectral density and the energy distribution of each frequency in time domain especially the instantaneous physical change under freak wave hence the wavelet analysis method is adopted in this study based on the work of pan et al 2018 the present study compared the frequency domain dynamic response of a moored square cylinder under freak and random waves with identical wave spectra through experimental measurements which are designed to determine the variation of frequency domain characteristics of dynamic response and the quantitative relationship with the freak wave parameter to further investigate the significant impact on the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response of the floater under freak wave the time frequency spectra of the dynamic response under freak and random waves were calculated by wavelet analysis to investigate the time frequency structure characteristics and variation 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup the tests were carried out in a wave flume at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology the flume is

absorbing beach is installed for wave dissipation effectively the motion of moored square cylinder were measured by a non contact 6dof degree of freedom measurement system consisting of dual ccd charge coupled device cameras and a data acquisition system three light markers were arranged in a plane and fixed on top of the cylinder to track the motion behaviors by the dual ccd cameras the

wave parameters the significant wave height h s the maximum wave height h max spectral peak period t p freak wave parameters α n α n includes α 1 h max h s α 2 h max h max 1 α 3 h max h max 1 α 4 η max h max where h max 1 is the wave height before the maximum wave height h max 1 is the wave height after the maximum wave height η max is surface elevation of the maximum wave height in the random wave sequence mooring configuration water depth etc in the experiments p m spectrum yu 2000 was applied as 2 s w a w 5 e x p b w 4 3 a 173 h s 2 t 0 1 4 4 b 691 t 0 1 4 where hs and t 0 1 are the significant wave height and the average period calculated from the spectral moment respectively to figure out the effect of various parameters two types of random wave sequences have been designed and generated for the experiments in the tests the constant wave height and period generated has minor variation within 3 to the target values which is allowable table 2 2 3 2 experiment methods in the present study the freak wave was generated at the target location using a random wave train combined with two transient wave trains which was proposed and used by pei et al 2007 with the linear superposition method the wave surface can be expressed as 5 η x t η 1 x t η 2 x t η 3 x t i 1 m a 1 i cos k i x w i t ε i i 1 m a 2 i cos k i x x c w i t t c ε i i 1 m a 2 i cos k i x x c w i t t c ε i where η denotes the elevation of water surface above the mean water level a 1i is amplitude of the random wave a 2i and a 3i are amplitudes of the transient waves the model was installed and moored with pre tension of 1 1 2 n under hydrostatic status and collected 0 point at equilibrium position the decay test was then performed by applying an artificial displacement rotation on the floater and releasing the decay curve of motion process had been completely collected until the floater resumed to static state rao test the time history of the motion responses were recorded with a frequency of 30 hz under the regular wave sequence iii in table 2 the measurements for each test typically lasted for more than 10 waves freak wave test the freak wave was generated using a random wave train combined with two transient wave trains with p m spectrum the measurement for each test typically lasted for more than 100 waves and were performed 2 or 3 times to ensure the repeatability during each test the motions and mooring tensions were recorded synchronously with a frequency of 30 hz random wave test to compare the experimental results measured under freak and random waves the same spectrum with identical spectral parameters to the freak wave were applied and the measurement was similar to the freak wave test based on the measured time histories spectral analyses were performed to obtain the frequency domain characteristics of the motions and mooring tensions of the floating square cylinder i e the spectral pattern spectral peak 0th 1st 2nd order moments and other statistics 2 3 3 wavelet analysis method wavelet analysis method is adopted to compute the time frequency spectra of the dynamic responses under freak and random waves the variation of the time frequency energy structure has been investigated the morlet wavelet is selected as the mother wavelet that can be expressed as 6 ψ t π 1 4 e t 2 2 e i w 0 t where ω 0 is the non dimensional frequency here taken to be 6 to satisfy the admissibility condition torrencr and compo 1998 the continuous wavelet transform of a discrete sequence x n is defined as the convolution of x n with a scaled and translated version of ψ t 7 w n s n n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where the superscript is the complex conjugate s is the wavelet scale and n is the time index it is more efficient to do the calculations in fourier space by the convolution theorem the wavelet transform is the inverse fourier transform of the product 8 w n s k 0 n 1 x ˆ k ψ ˆ s w k e i w k n δ t where k 0 n 1 is the frequency index the spectral density s f t of the wavelet energy spectrum can be defined as 9 s f t w s t 2 the spectral density s f t describes the variation of a physical parameter from time domain and frequency domain for surge heave and pitch of moored square cylinder we can determine the variation of time frequency domain characteristics followed the occurrence of the freak wave and the maximum wave of random wave in order to investigate the variation quantitatively the following parameters are defined 1 generalized energy spectrum e t the time frequency spectrum wavelet spectrum of a physical quantity integrated in the frequency at any time and the result can be regarded as a time history of generalized energy spectrum which is denoted as e t 10 e t j s i j δ f j the generalized total energy of each frequency component of a physical quantity when the freak wave or the maximum wave of random wave occurred is denoted as e c e t t c 11 e c j s c j δ f j 2 time distribution parameter of energy concentration δt e the problem we focus on is the variation of dynamic response of a moored square cylinder under freak and random waves the maximum value of the generalized energy spectrum e t of a physical quantity under random wave is denoted as e imax for the freak wave t emin is the starting time of e t e imax after the occurrence of freak wave t emax is the ending time of e t e imax the response time of the freak wave is defined as δ t e 12 δt e t emax t emin 3 analysis of experiments results it is known that the dynamic response of the floater is affected by the natural period and rao characteristics significantly therefore the experimental results of natural period and rao response are presented firstly based on the motion responses and mooring tensions of the floating cylinder measured synchronously the spectra of motion responses and mooring tensions under freak and random waves are analyzed and the characteristics in frequency domain of each motion component and mooring tension are discussed also the effect of spectral peak period and freak wave parameter on the dynamic response are discussed and the difference in dynamic response under freak and random waves is analyzed in frequency domain 3 1 decay tests and response amplitude operators raos after performing decay tests of the moored floater in still water the natural periods of surge heave and pitch were obtained t 0s 10 0s t 0h 1 4s and t 0p 2 0s respectively the response amplitude operators rao of the floater were obtained through regular wave test sequence iii in table 2 fig 3 illustrates that heave and pitch increase with the relative period and reach the local peak at the natural periods the maximum heave can be up to 0 9h h 10 cm at the natural period t t 0h with further increasing of the wave period heave oscillates in the range of 0 4 0 6h close to the wave amplitude which is consistent with the variation range of conventional moored floaters the maximum pitch occurs at the natural period t t 0p with further increasing of the wave period pitch varies in the range of θ 1 3 1 2θ max in addition the amplitudes of heave and pitch are approximately symmetrical in the positive and negative components due to the limitation of the wave maker the test period cannot cover the natural period of surge therefore the test curve may not show the completed characteristics of surge rao in the test ranges of wave period the positive amplitude of surge is larger than the negative one in the wave propagating direction the maximum surge occurs at t t 0p 0 7 t t 0h 1 0 the natural period of heave it implies that the maximum surge is affected by the resonance of heave when the wave period is smaller than the natural period of pitch t t 0p 1 the surge shows a considerable value which has been addressed by song et al 2018 in the experimental study on motions of tunnel element this is related to the fact that the larger relative motion of the floater under short waves due to stronger diffraction effects and larger mean 2nd order horizontal forces i e pinkster 1979 3 2 comparison of frequency domain characteristics of moored floater under freak and random waves the dynamic response of moored square cylinder includes the motion response mooring tension and wave load the frequency domain characteristics of motion response and mooring tension are discussed in this study the wave loads on square cylinder including the total wave force and wave pressures will be discussed in a separate study 3 2 1 effect of spectral peak period the same wave spectrum can generate various random wave series by applying different random seeds to compare the experimental results measured under freak and random waves the identical spectrum were applied and the measurement was similar for the freak and random wave tests in fig 4 the comparison shows that the measured freak and random wave spectra match well with the target spectrum under freak and random waves generated by the same spectra the frequency domain characteristics of motion response with various spectral peak periods were shown in fig 5 two wave series were generated with the identical wave height of h s 8 cm and relative periods of t p t 0h 0 81 2 21 t p t 0p 0 57 1 55 the freak wave series are generated with the characteristics of 2 01 α 1 2 20 fig 5 shows 1 the surge spectra of the floater are consisted of low frequency and wave frequency components the surge spectra show the similar trends under freak and random waves with various relative wave period 2 the variation of surge in frequency domain is subjected to the relative wave period with respect to the relative wave period there are three typical scenarios on surge spectra firstly with small relative wave period 0 57 t p t 0p 0 92 the surge spectra show significant low frequency characteristics and the wave frequency component can be neglected secondly when the relative wave period is close to the natural pitch period t 0p 0 92 t p t 0p 1 08 the surge spectra are mainly low frequency but the wave frequency cannot be neglected thirdly with large relative wave period 1 08 t p t 0p 1 55 the surge spectra are bimodal and the wave frequency component of surge has the same order of magnitude as the low frequency component 3 the spectral characteristics of heave and pitch of the floater are basically identical under freak and random waves and both are subjected to the relative wave period 4 with relative wave period small 0 81 t p t 0h 1 11 the heave spectra are unimodal the peak frequency is observed at the natural frequency of heave however with the relative wave period larger than the natural period of heave t p t 0h 1 11 the heave spectra show dual peaks at spectral peak frequency and natural frequency of heave with the wave period increasing the spectral peak frequency deviates from the natural frequency of heave gradually as a consequence the peak of heave spectrum at the wave frequency increases gradually until reaches the peak in this case the heave is dominated by wave frequency and the effect of natural frequency of heave is weaken with the wave period gradually 5 the pitch spectra are unimodal and the peak occurs at the natural frequency of pitch in the test range when the wave spectral peak frequency is close to the natural frequency of pitch the critical pitch spectrum was observed it implies that the pitch of moored square cylinder is dominated by the natural period which is different to the pitch of a moored ship the characteristics of mooring tension in frequency domain are addressed in fig 6 the same wave conditions are adopted in motion response analysis the results indicate 1 with respect to the relative wave period there are two typical scenarios on frequency response of mooring tension firstly with small relative wave period 0 57 t p t 0p 0 78 the peak of the mooring tension spectra under freak wave is larger than that under random wave the frequency response of mooring tension is dominated by the 2ndorder drift force under both freak and random waves in other words the mooring tension is dominated by the low frequency component and the wave frequency component is minor with relative wave period increasing 0 92 t p t 0p 1 55 the variation of mooring tension between the freak and random waves becomes minor since the 2nd order drift force decreases with the relative period and the wave frequency component of mooring tension has the same order of magnitude as the low frequency component in summary the dynamic response of surge and mooring tension in frequency domain is dominated by the first order wave force wave frequency and second order drift force far lower than wave frequency the response of heave in frequency domain is dominated by the resonant effect of the natural frequency and wave spectral peak period however the response of pitch in frequency domain is subjected to the natural frequency only in general the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic responses show the similar trends under freak and random waves with the relative wave period 3 2 2 effect of freak wave parameter to investigate the effect of the freak wave parameter α 1 the freak wave were generated with various α 1 α 1 1 71 2 83 all wave series were generated under constant relative wave height is h s d 0 057 relative period is t p t 0h 1 14 and t p t 0p 0 8 fig 7 shows the motion responses spectra of the floater under various freak wave parameter α 1 the results indicate 1 when the freak wave parameter α 1 is small α 1 2 07 the surge spectrum under freak wave is basically identical with the random wave when the freak wave parameter α 1 is large α 1 2 32 the low frequency component of surge under freak wave is significantly larger than that under random wave and the variation increases with α 1 however the wave frequency component of surge are basically identical under freak and random waves 2 with respect to the heave and pitch the spectral characteristics of heave and pitch are basically identical under freak and random waves and the variation is insignificant with freak wave parameter α 1 the characteristics of mooring tension in frequency domain are addressed in fig 8 the variation of the frequency domain characteristics of the mooring tension with α 1 is similar to the surge of moored floater under freak and random waves in general the freak wave parameter α 1 has significant impact on the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response which leads to significant increase of surge and mooring tension in low frequency component such variation increases rapidly with the freak wave parameter α 1 but has seldom impact on heave and pitch 3 3 the effect of freak wave parameter on dynamic response in frequency domain the above discussion shows that the freak wave parameter α 1 has direct impact on the surge and mooring tension of the floating body in frequency domain in this section the effect of the freak wave parameter α 1 on the dynamic response are analyzed quantitatively in frequency domain under freak wave 3 3 1 quantitative analysis of the effect of freak wave parameter fig 9 shows the test results of the dynamic responses spectral parameters varying with the freak wave parameter α 1 all wave series were generated under constant relative wave height is h s d 0 057 relative period is t p t 0h 1 14 and t p t 0p 0 8 the freak wave parameter varies at α 1 1 71 2 83 the results indicate 1 compared with the random wave of same spectrum the 0th 1st order moments of surge increase with α 1 significantly m 0f m 0i 0 89 2 63 m 1f m 1i 1 0 1 42 but the 2nd order moments vary not significantly m 2f m 2i 1 0 1 07 2 the 0th 1st 2nd order moments of heave and pitch are basically unchanged with α 1 it indicates that the effect of the freak wave parameter α 1 on the heave and pitch are weaker than that on surge 3 the variation of the 0th 1st 2nd order moments of mooring tension with α 1 is similar to the surge of floating body the 0th 1st order moments increase with α 1 significantly m 0f m 0i 1 05 2 81 m 1f m 1i 1 04 1 53 the variation of 2nd order moments is insignificant with freak wave parameter α 1 m 2f m 2i 0 99 1 17 3 3 2 analysis on the key factor for the frequency response of the floater it is found in the previous discussion that with α 1 1 71 2 83 the 0th order moment of surge and mooring tension under freak wave are 0 89 2 63 and 1 05 2 81 times of those under random waves as a solo extreme wave in a random wave series the freak wave makes substantial change to the spectral characteristics of surge and mooring tension to figure out the reason the synchronous time history and time frequency spectra of surge and mooring tension calculated by wavelet analysis under freak and random waves are compared in fig 12 under various α 1 respectively the wavelet analysis provides the energy spectral density and energy distribution of each frequency in time domain especially in capturing instantaneous changes of each spectrum in fig 10 the amplitude of surge increases shapely after the occurrence of the freak wave and oscillates for longer than 20 wave periods in low frequency during the oscillating the wave frequency component of surge is minor and can be neglected under the random wave the surge component in low frequency is also significant but the amplitude is significantly smaller than that under freak wave which is a substantial difference to freak wave the low frequency surge responses is significantly enlarged with the freak wave action this is because the freak wave provide an extra impulse driving the floater further away before pulling it back by the restoring forces the mooring tension response is similar to the surge there is a significant variation in the time frequency spectra of the surge and mooring tension under freak and random waves with the occurrence of freak wave the time frequency spectra of the surge and mooring tension increase significantly and show a concentrated distribution of the energy it is also shown that the peak value of time frequency spectra increases significantly with the freak wave parameter α 1 to further investigate the significant impact on the frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response of the moored floater under freak wave the generalized energy spectrum e t of the dynamic response surge and mooring tension are illustrated in fig 11 under freak and random waves respectively it is observed that the critical generalized energy spectrum e t and the time distribution parameter of energy concentration δt e of surge and mooring tension under freak wave is significant larger than that under random wave it is also observed from fig 11 that the freak wave parameter α 1 has direct impact on the e t andδt e which both increase with the freak wave parameter α 1 for further investigating the variation of the low frequency and wave frequency components of the dynamic responses under freak wave the normalized spectral moment m 0f m 0i subscript 0 represents the 0 order spectral moment f and i represent freak and random waves are plotted in fig 12 which shows the comparison of the low frequency and wave frequency components of the surge and mooring tension spectra versus α 1 under freak and random waves it is defined the frequency of 0 0 5f p and 0 5f p as low frequency and wave frequency respectively f p is the wave spectral peak frequency with α 1 increases from 1 71 to 2 83 the low frequency component of surge increases rapidly under freak wave the ratio of low frequency component of surge under freak wave to that under random wave increase from 0 83 to 3 61 but the ratio of wave frequency components of surge has minor variation within 0 94 1 0 it implies that the key effect of freak wave on the motion response of the floater is subjected to the low frequency component of surge also the variation of mooring tension with α 1 is similar to the surge of floating body the low frequency component of the mooring tension under freak wave is larger than that under random wave with α 1 1 71 2 83 the ratio of low frequency component of mooring tension under freak wave to that under random wave increase from 0 92 to 5 34 the ratio of wave frequency components has minor variation within 1 04 1 44 respectively the results show that the effect of freak wave on the mooring tension of the floater is also realized through the low frequency component 4 conclusion based on the experimental measurements in time domain the dynamic response of a moored square cylinder under freak wave has been investigated in frequency domain given identical wave spectrum the dynamic response of moored square cylinder in frequency domain and time frequency energy structure are substantially different under freak and random waves extensive analyses have been conducted to quantify the effect of relative wave period and freak wave parameter and main conclusions can be drawn 1 the freak wave has direct effect on the frequency domain characteristics of surge and mooring tension of the floater but seldom impact on heave and pitch the freak wave parameter α 1 leads to significant variation on surge and mooring tension 2 the effect of freak wave on the surge and mooring tension of the floater is figured out through the low frequency components which leads to significant increase with α 1 this is because the freak wave provides an extra impulse for driving the floater further away before pulling it back by the restoring forces the mooring tension response is similar to the surge 3 the amplitude of surge increases shapely after the occurrence of freak wave and oscillates for longer than 20 wave periods in low frequency in random waves however both amplitude and oscillation of surge are significantly weaker the response of mooring tension is subjected to the surge response 4 the wavelet analysis is effective in investigating the dynamic response of moored floater under freak wave compared with statistical or spectral analysis wavelet analysis can outstandingly demonstrate the typical characteristics of dynamic response on the floater under freak wave it can obtain the energy spectral density and the energy distribution of each frequency in time domain especially the instantaneous physical change with the occurrence of freak wave it is found that the freak wave have significant effect on the time frequency domain characteristics of the dynamic response than the random wave with the same wave spectrum with the occurrence of freak wave the time frequency spectra of the dynamic responses increase significantly and show a concentrated distribution of the energy this implies that the occurrence of freak wave imposes serious potential risks on marine structures and vessels 5 the freak wave parameter α 1 has direct impact on the time frequency spectra characteristics of surge and mooring tension the peak value of time frequency spectra of surge and mooring tension increases significantly with the freak wave parameter α 1 the critical generalized energy spectra e t and the time distribution parameter of energy concentration δt e of surge and mooring tension under freak wave also increase with the freak wave parameter α 1

21202,the demand for resilient infrastructure located in marine environments is expected to increase in the coming decade as rapid urbanization of coastal areas continues and industries such as oil and gas renewable energy generation or aquaculture move further offshore to utilize the extensive amount of resources and space available on the open ocean increasing environmental concerns global scarcity of various materials as well as dwindling resource stocks have made sustainability considerations a major issue for the construction of such infrastructure metal alloys as one of the most commonly used materials for marine construction are often the focus of discussions on criticality and are associated with a high environmental impact if produced from virgin mineral resources in this paper we analyze the long term potential of five metal types commonly used in marine construction carbon steels stainless steels aluminum alloys titanium alloys and nickel copper alloys by evaluating and ranking these materials performance according to 27 precisely defined attributes related to durability economics sustainability and future availability we provide a detailed comparison of each material s strengths and weakness additionally by focusing on the identified weaknesses of the individual materials we discuss promising areas of research which support the sustainable use of these metals for marine construction in the long term keywords marine alloys sustainable construction research prioritization multi criteria decision making economics resource availability 1 introduction ocean based industries and activities are major contributors to global economic output and employment as a key provider of a multitude of societal needs such as transport leisure food energy and minerals they are essential for the future welfare of mankind driven by global megatrends such as population growth increasing rates of urbanization and climate change adaption economic activity in the ocean is increasing at a rapid pace through expansion of existing shipping fisheries conventional oil and gas coastal tourism and establishment of new offshore renewable energy generation deep sea oil and gas marine aquaculture seabed mining sectors oecd 2016 european ocean energy association 2009 hein et al 2013 jansen et al 2016 kappenthuler and seeger 2019a in line with the expansion of ocean based activities the demand for infrastructure to support these activities will increase significantly in the coming decades the selection of suitable material for these constructions will be paramount to ensure an efficient economic and environmentally friendly expansion as the physical and chemical properties of a material greatly influence the overall sustainability of a structure harris 1999 huberman and pearlmutter 2008 thormark 2006 metals have played an important role in marine construction in the past due to their high toughness stiffness and strength they were used extensively for the production of not only large scale structural components such as ship hulls support columns for off shore platforms and pressure vessels but also for pipelines tethering attachments and reinforcement of concrete structures reuben 1994 reddy and swamidas 2013 valdez et al 2016 despite the emergence of newer material classes such as ceramics or fiber reinforced polymer composites in the past decades metals will remain exceedingly important materials for marine infrastructure in the future many frameworks have been developed to assess the most optimal materials for the construction of specific components used in marine environments igwemezie et al 2018 thakker et al 2008 cicek and celik 2009 giaccobi et al 2010 rashedi et al 2012 these frameworks evaluate the detailed technical and to a certain extent economic potential of a given material for a specific application however the production of metals is associated with large environmental impacts further exacerbating global challenges such as climate change norgate et al 2007 furthermore the raw materials for various metal alloys are non renewable and can be highly geographically concentrated graedel et al 2015 gordon et al 2007 tilton and lagos 2007 considering the impact a lack of availability of central alloys required in marine construction could have on the development of the industry and the time for new alternative material compositions to be developed tested and introduced into the market it is essential to identify such supply risks early on and to begin developing mitigation strategies long before supply shortages occur these issues are almost completely neglected in existing material selection frameworks as they focus solely on material selection in the present and lack a consideration of long term developments to enable a holistic evaluation of a material s suitability not only today but also in the long term future an alternative framework was developed consisting of 27 attributes designed to rate a specific material s technical economic and environmental performance as well as the availability and distribution of the raw material resources required for its production kappenthuler and seeger 2019b in this paper the mentioned framework is applied to evaluate the potential of different types of metals and alloys for long term use in marine construction and to identify the issues as well as potential solutions which need to be addressed to enable an environmentally and economically sustainable expansion of marine activities in the future the rest of the paper is structured as follows first the methodology of the ranking applied to the specific case of marine construction is explained and the different metal categories used for the ranking are presented this is followed by the results of the ranking which was completed with experts from industry and academia based on these results we discuss research areas that may have a large impact on the overall sustainability of marine construction as well as a high potential for long term commercial applicability 2 methodology the framework applied in this paper was developed to aid in the identification and initial high level prioritization of research projects focusing on the development or improvement of materials for the use in sustainable construction the theory behind the framework is described in great detail in a previous publication by the authors kappenthuler and seeger 2019b in this section we therefor provide a short overview of the structure of the framework and then focus on the methodological issues related to the application of the framework to the presented case 2 1 short description of methodological framework as the goal of the applied framework is to identify and prioritize promising research areas for the improvement of construction materials the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated materials need to be assessed in a first step therefore the framework is based on a holistic ranking of each materials technical economic and ecological performance as this requires a large number of individual properties to be analyzed multi criteria decision analysis is employed using two hierarchical levels categories and attributes where a category consists of multiple attributes and the attributes are the criteria that are evaluated the categories covered in the framework are durability a measure of technical performance economics costs sustainability environmental impact and future availability evaluation of long term potential for use mechanical stability another measure of technical performance is included in the form a functional unit that is used to compare the performance of the different materials for each material the attributes are given a score from 1 to 5 1 being the lowest 5 the highest score for quantitatively measurable attributes values where specified for each point along the scale for attributes that need to be assessed qualitatively the lowest acceptable 1 average 3 and ideal 5 property of a material was described as precisely as possible based on expert discussions and literature data all scales are shown in appendix a the attribute scores are aggregated using a simple additive weighting process to produce a single score for each category these category scores are then aggregated again using the same process to produce a final material score the resulting ranking provides a comparison of the individual materials performance levels as well as an overview each materials strengths and weaknesses which is then used to identify areas where material improvements have a high impact on the overall score of the material kappenthuler and seeger 2019b 2 2 goal of ranking for this work the goal of the ranking is to identify the types of metals that have the highest potential to be used as structural components for sustainable marine construction in the long term future therefore the attributes developed in the original framework were adapted to measure the performance of the evaluated materials in a marine environment all attributes and their scale definitions are shown in appendix a the durability attributes are evaluated for exposure in the splash zone this is the harshest location of exposure for marine construction reuben 1994 alexander 2016 the individual metals are evaluated without considering any protection methods ex coatings the future availability attributes are evaluated for a timeframe of 50 years unless stated otherwise in appendix a disposal and recycling costs originally included in the economics costs category are left out of the ranking as they vary greatly from country to country are highly process specific and thus cannot be realistically estimated frijia et al 2012 2 3 category and attribute weights all categories and attributes are given a weighting factor reflective of their importance for achieving the stated goal 1 low importance 2 medium importance 3 high importance these weights were defined together with industry experts and are shown in fig 1 since the focus is on sustainable marine construction in the long term future immediate economic considerations were seen as less important while future availability was determined to be the most central category 2 4 definition of functional unit the functional unit fu chosen to compare the different metals according to their performance as structural components was related to the materials tensile strengths thus it was calculated for each metal how much material would be required for the production of a 1 m long beam with a square cross section that is able to withstand a tensile load of 5000 kn consequently the tensile strength of each metal determines the area of the cross section and thus also the amount of material required i e the fu 2 5 material selection for ranking for material selection existing categorizations of metals used in marine construction were analyzed reuben 1994 ashby 2016 dexter 1979 powell and francis 2012 this led to a first selection of broad metal categories which each include the pure metals as well as the plethora of individual alloys of the specific metal type the categories commonly used in literature are carbon steels cs stainless steels ss aluminum alloys aa titanium alloys tia nickel copper alloys ni cu magnesium alloys and zinc alloys after discussion with industry experts it was decided to exclude magnesium and zinc alloys from the ranking magnesium and zinc are extremely low on the galvanic series and corrode rapidly in seawater consequently they cannot be used as structural materials in these environments for each of the remaining metal categories one specific alloy was chosen to represent the entire category this choice was based on discussions with experts and literature review to identify the alloy that commonly provides a good performance in the marine environment for the cs s355j2 1 0553 was chosen as the representative material as it is a versatile structural steel specified for marine use by various codes such as bs en 10225 2009 the most commonly used ss are austenitic steels since they are also the cheapest however these steels may still corrode in aggressive environments as can be found offshore in the splash zone therefore to reflect more precisely the material used for marine construction duplex stainless steel grade 1 4462 x2crnimon22 5 3 was selected to represent the category as it combines the advantages of both austenitic and ferritic stainless steel and is the most suitable material for the use in corrosive environments baddoo and burgan 2001 for the aa the 5xxx series containing magnesium as the main alloying element are mainly used for structural applications due to their increased corrosion resistance davis and davis 2001 alloy 5083 almg4 5mn was chosen as the representative material for this group the most used tia for marine environments is grade 5 titanium 3 7165 ti6al 4v this alloy accounts for around 50 of global titanium alloy production titanex gmbh 2017 finally for ni cu monel k500 2 4375 nicu30al is used as the representative material 2 6 data collection data for each attribute of all evaluated metals was gathered through discussions with experts and from technical reports material databases and scientific literature the experts were asked to complete the ranking and to explain the reason for each individual score all scores are discussed in detail in the next section for each metal at least 3 experts completed the ranking in general the average score was chosen as the final score however if the scores given by different experts varied by more than 1 point further investigation into the literature was conducted which allowed a well informed decision on which score was appropriate overall a total of 10 experts from academia and industry participated in the ranking 3 results discussion the individual attribute and category scores are shown in table 1 providing an overview of each metal s strengths values 4 5 and weaknesses values 1 2 as mentioned the applied framework evaluates the technical performance of the metals in the form of their durability i e resistance to external physical and chemical impacts their commercial potential according to their usage costs and anticipated price developments their overall sustainability based on renewability environmental impact ei of production and recyclability and finally the future availability of the raw materials required for their production which is determined by the global supply and demand situation for more details see kappenthuler and seeger 2019b the highest durability scores are achieved by the corrosion resistant tia and ni cu followed by ss aa and finally cs the economics scores show almost the exact opposite ranking cs aa ss tia ni cu as the less alloyed metals are cheaper to produce and somewhat easier to manufacture the same ranking resulted for the sustainability category while all metals are non renewable and highly recyclable the mining and processing of more specialized alloying elements leads to significantly higher ei of production per fu for ss ni cu and to a lesser extent tia despite their higher tensile strengths appendix b concerning future availability the most critical materials are nickel chromium and molybdenite leading to low scores for ss and ni cu in the longer term these alloys as well as tia will furthermore see strongly increasing demand from other industries beside construction exacerbating potential supply concerns for aa competition may also be an issue but this is less certain no competition or availability shortage is expected for cs combining the individual scores of each metal using the weighting factors presented in fig 1 leads to the total scores shown at the bottom of table 1 despite having a lower durability than all the other metals the low cost and ei of production on a relative scale the impact is still rather high when compared with other materials such as timber or concrete as well as the high future availability results in cs achieving the highest overall score the second highest ranked material is tia mainly due to its high durability this is followed by aa ni cu and finally ss the performance of the individual metals will be discussed in detail in the following subsections 3 1 durability with the exception of cs all analyzed metals have a very high durability rating all metals are immune to damage from uv radiation and are not affected by moisture excluding corrosive effects thus achieving the highest score in these categories tia and ni cu are furthermore considered as inherently corrosion resistant ni cu is often used as protective cladding for marine steel structures and are also not susceptible to biological degradation and stress corrosion cracking scc see definition in appendix a dexter 1979 de 1993 in fact the only attribute where these metals do not achieve the maximum score is fatigue resistance all metals are susceptible to fatigue damage nevertheless their fatigue behavior is well understood and can be predicted rather precisely therefore for metals with a fatigue limit cs ss tia structures with an infinite fatigue life can theoretically be designed if the loads a component will be exposed to during its service life are known score 3 this is not possible for metals without a fatigue limit aa ni cu which is why these metals have a lower fatigue score i e 2 the next best metals concerning durability are ss and aa duplex ss perform very well in the marine environment however they can still suffer from pitting corrosion it has been shown that the depth of these pits increases rapidly after initiation but remains constant after a period of several years krouse et al 2014 therefore for thicker ss components this pitting corrosion can be seen as mostly superficial affecting the visual aspects and not the mechanical ones a lifetime of 50 100 years should be achievable baddoo and burgan 2001 nevertheless since the initiation of corrosion can under certain circumstance lead to failure of a component a score of 4 was assigned the same score was assigned for aa which are corrosion resistant due to the formation of a passive oxide layer on their surface if this layer is damaged localized pitting corrosion can also occur for both ss and aa biological attack presents an issue in the form of microbially induced corrosion mic certain microorganisms can become attached to ss and aa components and give rise to slimy biofilms on the surface these films can accelerate the initiation of pitting corrosion which can lead to sudden failure of a component score 3 liengen et al 2014 concerning scc duplex ss perform better than aa both are generally not susceptible to scc for aa however certain tempers as well as defects during manufacture can strongly increase scc susceptibility jones and jones 2017 due to this possible susceptibility a score of 3 was assigned duplex ss do not exhibit this behavior but are still not completely immune to scc score 4 cs as the lowest ranking metals readily corrode in seawater score 1 are also susceptible to biological attack in the form of mic score 3 and in the past have commonly failed due to scc mechanisms when used in marine structures without the appropriate maintenance or protection score of 2 moan 2011 3 2 economics and costs concerning economics and costs all metals perform well the main weaknesses are fire resistance and increasing prices in the future the ranking of the total economic scores is the same as that of material costs per fu cs are the cheapest of the analyzed materials followed by aa which cost about 100 more per fu the more complex duplex ss tia and ni cu are significantly more expensive due in part to the higher content of specialized alloying elements such as chromium molybdenum or vanadium and achieved scores of 3 2 and 1 respectively the costs per fu for each metal are shown in appendix b concerning ease of manufacture all metals have similar properties larger components such as sheets rods and bars are produced in a factory for all analyzed metals theoretically any shape or size can be produced for cs and ni cu components can easily be resized and joined on site with simple welding equipment to a certain extent these components can also be reshaped nevertheless the main design of the component produced in the factory largely determines the final shape that is used on site score 4 aa achieved the same score despite the fact that on site welding of al components is more difficult than for cs or ni cu as this disadvantage is compensate by the lower stiffness of aa making it easier to reshape components on site ss and tia were given a lower score as welding and reshaping on site is not easily completed score 3 for ss more caution needs to be given when handling components to make sure the surface isn t damaged or contaminated which would reduce corrosion resistance baddoo and burgan 2001 thus the environment needs to be carefully controlled during casting and also welding jointing and cutting necessitating more specialized equipment and better trained personnel especially the welding of duplex ss is a big challenge even for trained personnel making factory conditions much more suitable for manufacture than on site ones for tia the primary and secondary fabrication processes are up to 18 times more costly than when using cs this is due to the hardness and reactivity of titanium which wears down tools very quickly and requires a slow fabrication process sŏng et al 2009 thus it requires expensive specialized equipment for manufacture furthermore it is very difficult to shape tia components on site making factory production of the complete final components a necessity the ease of manufacture of the different metals has a direct consequence on their repairability as cs and ni cu can be rather easily be welded the repair of damaged components is possible on site even to the extent of restoring original mechanical properties score 5 the same can be done with aa and ss components although more sophisticated equipment and specially trained personnel is required score 4 for tia the hardness of the material makes it very difficult to cut out a damaged area before welding on site thus removal of the entire component and repair in a factory are a more feasible approach score 2 fire resistance is an issue for all unprotected metals except tia which have an excellent heat resistance score of 5 the high thermal conductivity of metals leads to a rapid temperature increase throughout the entire component in the case of a fire if unprotected they lose their mechanical strength at lower temperatures than those present in an average fire and thus fail under standard service loads nevertheless for any given load it is possible to calculate the time it will take for a specific component to fail in a fire making the failing behavior predictable score 2 all analyzed metals have been used for decades in marine construction and thus have a low performance uncertainty the difference in individual scores is due to the fact that some metals have been used extensively for larger structural components cs tia score 5 while others are more commonly used for non structural uses such as pipes valves cladding or handrails ss aa ni cu score 4 finally in the long term for all metals except cs a significant price increase is expected in the foreseeable future the main drivers for these increases differ from metal to metal for instance global aluminum prices are expected to increase by over 30 by 2030 compared with 2016 world bank 2017 this will have a large effect on the future prices of aa and to a certain extent also for tia as aluminum is used as an alloying element the prices for titanium minerals ilmenite rutile are also predicted to increase in the range of 5 15 from 2017 to 2020 it is expected that suppliers will aim to keep price increases steady but moderate hope 2017 a critical point for tia is vanadium in the near term a price spike is expected for vanadium as demand exceeded supply in 2017 however as new capacity comes online these prices are expected to stabilize ametek 2017 perles 2013 overall vanadium is only added as an alloying element in small amounts 4 of mass but will nevertheless influence the final price of grade 5 titanium for duplex ss rising prices for raw materials excl iron ore are seen as one of the main restraints for future growth of the industry increased use of scrap which will occur if prices are high could limit these increases asd reports 2021 the highest increase in price is expected for nickel an alloying element in ss and the main component of ni cu due to decreasing production levels and increasing demand from green technologies such as batteries turbines or electric motors an increase of up to 100 is expected from 2016 to 2030 furthermore copper prices are also expected to increase by around 40 in the same timeframe world bank 2017 thus the lowest value was assigned for ni cu 3 3 sustainability and environmental impact concerning sustainability the only positive aspects of the analyzed metals is their high recyclability the recycling rates are above 60 for all metals which corresponds to the highest score united nations environment programme 2011 bowyer et al 2015 polmear et al 2017 however none of the raw materials required for production of the individual alloys are from renewable sources translating into the lowest score for renewability the individual eis were calculated for the production of 1 fu of the specific metal from 100 virgin materials using data from the ecoinvent 3 3 database the individual scores are shown in appendix b information on the individual calculations can be found in appendix c cs have the lowest ei for all three categories analyzed human health ecosystems resources and thus the highest score for these attributes this is once again due to the low content of alloying elements for instance ss and ni cu with the overall highest impact require nickel and for ss also molybdenum both of which are largely mined as sulfide minerals the hydrometallurgical processing of these minerals leads to large impact scores from emissions and leaching of the sulfide tailings overall these direct impacts are larger than the indirect impacts from energy production which are significant for the energy intensive production of aa and tia norgate et al 2007 liu et al 2013 it must be kept in mind that the ei rankings are based on the relative values of the analyzed material and thus cannot be directly translated into environmental friendliness of production 3 4 future availability the future availability scores for all materials are determined by the raw materials required for their production table 2 describes the elemental composition of the individual alloys while table 3 shows the raw materials from which each element is produced as well as their availability and concentration values the overall future availability score for cs stands out from those of the other metals the raw material resources of all raw materials required for the production of carbon steel fe c cu are large and geographically well distributed furthermore the construction industry is the main user of steel and the only competition could potentially come from the automotive industry which is predicted to grow strongly in the coming decades due to increased demand from developing nations however the automotive industry is moving strongly towards more lightweight materials such as aluminum or composites therefore the demand for steel from the automotive industry will very likely be significantly lower than the demand from the construction industry concerning manganese the main alloying element in low carbon steels the steel industry is the major consumer responsible for around 90 of global demand and therefore this should not lead to a shortage in supply for the construction industry score 5 finally demand growth for steel is slowing down after a period of very strong growth driven largely by china many steel producers already have or may soon have significant overcapacities some facilities have even been shut down to improve the carbon footprint of producing companies therefore a certain increase in production volumes should be possible with existing facilities the past surge in demand for steel by china demonstrated that significant production capacity can be added in a very short period of time score 5 morfeldt et al 2013 oecd 2011 world steel association 2017 in comparison the score for ss the lowest ranking metal type concerning future availability is greatly affected by the use of nickel chromium and molybdenum as alloying elements all three elements either have a limited short or long term availability score 1 and 2 respectively while chromium and molybdenum reserves are also highly concentrated score 1 furthermore government regulations which have an impact on the production of ss are already in effect for instance the government of indonesia restricted the export of unprocessed nickel ore in order to ensure that the value increasing refining processes are completed in the country in 2014 furthermore in the philippines the government issued an order in 2016 to audit all existing mines in the country to check for environmental compliance and to clamp down on non sustainable mining practices reducing output and even shutting down critical operations these two countries together account for 31 of global nickel production and thus these developments have limited the supply of this crucial raw material on the global market and created substantial uncertainty glencore 2016 selby 2017 further export restrictions exist for other essential raw materials of ss such as chromium and even ss scrap these export restrictions have a high potential to limit but not completely restrict supply of raw materials especially for the european union which is responsible for around 20 of global ss production and a much larger percentage of global duplex grade production score 2 pothen et al 2013 to add to these issues the construction industry is only responsible for around 12 of total stainless steel demand this includes all grades and demand from competing industries is expected to increase strongly score 1 the major concern comes from a strong expected growth of the renewable energy and electro mobility sectors that would lead to large demand increases for nickel and also molybdenum kleijn et al estimated the increased metal supply that would be required under different energy scenarios and came to the conclusion that nickel output would have to increase by 50 250 and molybdenum output by 30 100 to meet the rising demand from the energy sector alone kleijn et al 2011 even if supply security can be achieved increasing the production of duplex ss will only be possible with large capital investments score 3 as most facilities which currently produce duplex ss do not have large overcapacities new facilities will need to be constructed if these facilities are to be built in countries that are currently not yet producing duplex ss careful technology transfer will be required as the process for producing these high quality materials is significantly more complicated than those used to produce austenitic ss or cs for aa the main bottleneck concerning availability are globally highly concentrated chromium reserves score 1 combined with existing export restrictions mentioned before as it is only a minor alloying element in the 5xx series a value of 4 was assigned to potential for government regulation for the production of the aa themselves there is no real competition for raw materials as 95 of globally produced bauxite is used for metallurgical processes flook 2015 however next to construction transport is a major end use sector for the globally produced aa both sectors account for around 25 of total demand increase in demand from the construction of lighter weight vehicles is expected to outweigh the increase in demand from the construction sector currently global aa production is more or less at full capacity and further investments in new mines and production facilities are ongoing if production increase can keep up with demand growth competition for supply should be limited due to the uncertainty a value of 3 was assigned liu et al 2013 fog 2016 concerning ease of production increase the mentioned high level of capacity at which global aluminum production is currently running means that new mines and processing facilities would need to be built requiring large long term investments in order to increase global production levels score 3 the future availability of tia suffers mainly from the high concentration of vanadium resources score 1 as well as demand from competing industries score 1 and to a lesser extent the high investments required to increase global production levels score 2 the main competing industry for the production of tia is the use of titanium in pigments 91 of mineral supply is consumed for production of tio2 pigments while only around 6 are used for the production of metallic products as the construction industry is also only a minor user of tia the number and size of competing industries is significant the largest end use sectors for tia are aerospace chemical processing and power generation demand from the aerospace industry is expected to increase significantly due to increasing production of commercial aircraft and also increasing titanium content of new aircraft however future titanium prices are still expected to be determined largely by the level of demand from pigment producers as the largest users of this element mccoy 2017 gehler 2017 hohne sparboth 2017 another issue is the use of high purity vanadium as a major alloying element in ti 6al 4v only around 4 of global vanadium production is used in titanium alloy production the major user is the steel industry responsible for 93 of vanadium consumption the demand for these steels is expected to grow due to increasing construction activities specifically in china ametek 2017 furthermore growth in the green technology sector is expected to drive demand for vanadium redox batteries specifically renewable energy and electric vehicles by 2020 it is expected that the production of such batteries could consume about 30 of global vanadium production perles 2013 concerning ease of production increase the global titanium sponge production is currently running at around 70 capacity due to an oversupply in the last years as well as environmental concerns some plants were closed down or decreased production rates gehler 2017 consequently to a certain extent it would be possible to increase titanium production by reactivating plants that were shut down and running existing ones at full capacity however for an increase to significantly higher production levels large investments will be required as titanium production is a very expensive process were return on capital is measured in decades and not years verkhnaya salda metallurg 2006 furthermore new primary mines will most likely also be required not only for titanium but also for vanadium which requires further investments along the entire value chain currently the global high purity vanadium production required for the use in titanium alloys is running at full capacity and demand is expected to exceed supply already in 2017 ametek 2017 ni cu as the second lowest ranked metals concerning future availability suffer from the same issues as the ss due to the use of nickel as the main material component low short and long term availability government regulation restricting supply and high competition from other industries a significant advantage ni cu have over ss is that they don t require chromium or molybdenum as an alloying element and thus have a relatively well distributed resource base score 4 concerning the competition from competing industries score 1 the main use of nickel is for ss production 67 and the main use of ni cu is for the aerospace industry future demand is expected to increase substantially due to growing demand from energy generation transport and food processing as nickel producers are currently decreasing production capacity in reaction to a strong oversupply in the past years increasing production would to a certain extent be possible by reopening closed facilities and increasing capacity of running ones however a ramp up of the mostly old and deep mines would require a long time and significant investments furthermore it is expected that existing capacity even with reopening of mines will need to be significantly expanded to meet future demand as no new high grade deposits have been discovered in a long time lower grade deposits will need to be developed mostly in more remote regions requiring significant investments and having higher environmental concerns kleijn et al 2011 mistry 2012 3 5 improving material performance by analyzing the weaknesses of each material discussed in the previous sections in combination with its overall future availability it is possible to roughly determine the research areas and approaches that have the highest probability of providing long term benefits to the industry for this the low ranked attributes scores 1 2 in table 1 which have a high weight are analyzed and where possible existing approaches are discussed for carbon steels the main weak points are corrosion resistance weight 3 to a certain extent fire resistance weight 2 and the high ei of production weight 2 for all other metals the high ei of production also presents a reason for concern however the main weak points lie in a low long term availability weight 3 for ss ni cu or high concentration weight 3 for ss aa and tia of specific alloying elements as well as strong competition from other growing industries weight 2 for ss tia and ni cu further a factor reducing the overall attractiveness of tia and ni cu is price weight 3 concerning cs multiple approaches are already broadly employed to increase their corrosion resistance such as sacrificial anodes or various kinds of organic and inorganic coatings further research in this area is well warranted as carbon steel presents the best option from the sustainability and availability perspectives for all the metals and an increase in corrosion resistance would significantly increase the durability and overall score of this material however it is essential to evaluate the economics sustainability and future availability of the desired protection method to ensure that the addition of a coating or anode does not significantly decrease individual scores of the carbon steel most coatings contain an organic component which has been produced either from petroleum or natural gas the use of these non renewable resources will slightly reduce the resources to production ratio score i e long term availability from 5 to 4 bp 2018 as for all products containing petroleum derived organic substances the development of bio based alternatives presents an interesting option for ensuring long term availability and potentially increasing sustainability of production another aspect to consider for protective coatings is that they often contain active substances which prevent the initiation of corrosion if the barrier formed by the coating is damaged the future availability as well as the potential environmental impact of large scale use of these substances also needs to be taken into account prior to investing in the development of new coatings for instance coatings containing cerium nanoparticles have been shown to provide significant corrosion inhibition to steel substrates montemor 2014 cerium reserves are however geographically highly concentrated hhi of ca 2250 and the use of such coatings would reduce this score for steel components from 5 to 2 u s geological survey 2017 furthermore the extraction of cerium from mined ore is complicated and cost intensive leading to a number of severe environmental issues zhou et al 2017 finally it must also be taken into account that a certain amount of cerium will leach into the environment during the lifetime of the coated component the toxicity of cerium oxide nanoparticles is a topic of intensive investigation and initial results currently point towards the possibility of adverse effects on multiple organisms koehlé divo et al 2018 sendra et al 2018 therefore it may be the case that extensive use of these particles in sensitive marine environments is prohibited by governments in the future further reducing the overall score of this improvement strategy a more promising approach from a resource and environmental perspective are thermally sprayed aluminum coatings which are often employed for corrosion protection of submerged steel components momber et al 2015 lópez ortega et al 2018 looking at the availability scores for aluminum the element produced from bauxite in table 3 it can be seen that availability or concentration does not present an issue the ei of aluminum production still needs to be taken into account as well as the potential impact of aluminum leaching into the environment although higher aluminum concentration have been found to have adverse effects on certain marine organisms it is suspected that the increase in dissolved aluminum caused by leaching from offshore structures will remain well below this level due to dilution effects golding et al 2015 kirchgeorg et al 2018 as mentioned another main weakness of all analyzed metals is the high ei of production the sources of these impacts are direct solid liquid and gaseous emissions occurring during mining and processing as well as indirect emissions stemming from the production of energy and reagents required for these steps norgate et al 2007 concerning the process of resource extraction i e mining and separation of metals from minerals there are a number of possibilities to reduce these impacts for instance the energy required for the mining operations could be provided from renewable sources such as bio based fuels or electricity from wind solar power etc another approach is the development of more environmentally friendly bio based or biodegradable chemicals as well as the use of specialized microbes for the extraction of the desired metals behera and mulaba bafubiandi 2017 hidalgo et al 2018 laitinen et al 2016 norgate and jahanshahi 2011 however the only true solution to decreasing the ei of metal production is to eliminate the need for mining and processing of new virgin raw materials by significantly increasing recycling rates and moving further towards to a closed loop economy united nations environment programme 2011 increasing recycling rates will furthermore also mitigate the availability concerns of essential alloying elements for aa tia and ni cu such as chromium nickel or vanadium a major challenge in the recycling of metal alloys is the efficient separation of the individual alloy types and alloying elements as well as complete removal of contaminants from the scrap metal capuzzi and timelli 2018 nakamura et al 2017 reijnders 2016 takeda and okabe 2018 nakajima et al 2016 technologies that efficiently separate different scrap automatically according to various physical and chemical properties present promising improvements for the recycling of all metals examples are near infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction fluorescence laser induced breakdown spectroscopy or 3d imaging techniques capuzzi and timelli 2018 cesetti and nicolosi 2016 these technologies are essential as a proper separation of individual alloys before the actual recycling step minimizes the amount of different elements i e impurities in the scrap metal greatly improving the quality of the recycled alloys lu et al 2016 ohno et al 2017 nevertheless for certain impurities are almost impossible to separate completely and thus need to be removed as part of the recycling process for example for aa the main contaminant which reduces the quality of the recycled alloy is iron iron content can be managed by mixing end of life scrap with less contaminated scrap obtained during the manufacture of aa products cut offs shavings etc or primary aluminum capuzzi and timelli 2018 also for tia the removal of iron fe and oxygen o impurities in scrap material presents the largest barrier to improving the recycling rate again higher quality scrap containing lower concentrations of fe and o is diluted with highly pure titanium sponge which is produced from virgin materials to ensure sufficient quality of the recycled alloy lower quality scrap is used to produce ferrotitanium an alloying element used for the production of certain steels takeda and okabe 2018 thus by reducing the fe and especially o content of tia scrap the need for additional virgin material and down cycling could be reduced technologies for removal of these contaminants are mostly still in the fundamental stage of research fang et al 2013 moon et al 2017 taninouchi et al 2016 okabe et al 2016 reitz et al 2011 kang and okabe 2016 if further development proves successfully they could have a high commercial potential consequently the development of recycling processes which remove certain contaminants along with on line analytical methods for the separation of different metal alloys present high potential research areas which could greatly improve the economics and sustainability of metal recycling 4 conclusion in this paper a newly developed material selection framework is applied to analyze the long term potential of different metal types for use in sustainable marine construction the results provide a detailed overview of each material s strengths and weaknesses related to their durability economics sustainability and future availability overall carbon steels achieved the highest score followed by titanium alloys aluminum alloys nickel copper alloys and finally stainless steels for the lower ranked alloy types the higher durability scores could not compensate for the future availability concerns of various specialized alloying elements ex ni cr v mo the main weakness of carbon steels is their low corrosion resistance which however is compensated by a low price and high availability based on these results a number of research areas which may improve the performance of these materials in the future could be identified the critical research areas identified were the development of environmentally friendly protective coatings for carbon steels and improved separation and recycling technologies in order to minimize contaminants in the recycled materials for all metal alloys while many such technologies already exist they are currently still uneconomical on a large scale further investments into their development may in the long term enable a significantly more sustainable use of metals not only in marine construction but also for all other areas of application funding this research did not receive

place and strongly limit the availability of raw materials uncertain whether regulations limiting access to raw materials will be implemented but the possibility exists no realistic reason for governments to regulate usage of material or raw material in the foreseeable future development of recycling infrastructure recycling infrastructure will not develop significantly in the next 50 years leaving landfilling or incineration as the main disposal option for material recycling infrastructure will develop to a certain extent increasing recycling rates however downcycling is expected to remain the only viable option infrastructure will develop strongly in the next 50 years leading to high recycling rates 75 of material that can replace virgin material or recycling rate is already at this level today projected growth of competing industries construction is only responsible for a small share of material s total demand and demand from competing industries is expected to exceed current supply levels in the next 50 years along with other industries the construction industry is a major consumer of the material as demand increases it is possible that competition for resources between these industries increases the construction industry is the largest driver of demand for the material and demand from competing industries will become remain insignificant compared to supply levels in the next 50 years ease of production increase increase in production would require extensive investments into new facilities and the development of new production or manufacturing

21202,the demand for resilient infrastructure located in marine environments is expected to increase in the coming decade as rapid urbanization of coastal areas continues and industries such as oil and gas renewable energy generation or aquaculture move further offshore to utilize the extensive amount of resources and space available on the open ocean increasing environmental concerns global scarcity of various materials as well as dwindling resource stocks have made sustainability considerations a major issue for the construction of such infrastructure metal alloys as one of the most commonly used materials for marine construction are often the focus of discussions on criticality and are associated with a high environmental impact if produced from virgin mineral resources in this paper we analyze the long term potential of five metal types commonly used in marine construction carbon steels stainless steels aluminum alloys titanium alloys and nickel copper alloys by evaluating and ranking these materials performance according to 27 precisely defined attributes related to durability economics sustainability and future availability we provide a detailed comparison of each material s strengths and weakness additionally by focusing on the identified weaknesses of the individual materials we discuss promising areas of research which support the sustainable use of these metals for marine construction in the long term keywords marine alloys sustainable construction research prioritization multi criteria decision making economics resource availability 1 introduction ocean based industries and activities are major contributors to global economic output and employment as a key provider of a multitude of societal needs such as transport leisure food energy and minerals they are essential for the future welfare of mankind driven by global megatrends such as population growth increasing rates of urbanization and climate change adaption economic activity in the ocean is increasing at a rapid pace through expansion of existing shipping fisheries conventional oil and gas coastal tourism and establishment of new offshore renewable energy generation deep sea oil and gas marine aquaculture seabed mining sectors oecd 2016 european ocean energy association 2009 hein et al 2013 jansen et al 2016 kappenthuler and seeger 2019a in line with the expansion of ocean based activities the demand for infrastructure to support these activities will increase significantly in the coming decades the selection of suitable material for these constructions will be paramount to ensure an efficient economic and environmentally friendly expansion as the physical and chemical properties of a material greatly influence the overall sustainability of a structure harris 1999 huberman and pearlmutter 2008 thormark 2006 metals have played an important role in marine construction in the past due to their high toughness stiffness and strength they were used extensively for the production of not only large scale structural components such as ship hulls support columns for off shore platforms and pressure vessels but also for pipelines tethering attachments and reinforcement of concrete structures reuben 1994 reddy and swamidas 2013 valdez et al 2016 despite the emergence of newer material classes such as ceramics or fiber reinforced polymer composites in the past decades metals will remain exceedingly important materials for marine infrastructure in the future many frameworks have been developed to assess the most optimal materials for the construction of specific components used in marine environments igwemezie et al 2018 thakker et al 2008 cicek and celik 2009 giaccobi et al 2010 rashedi et al 2012 these frameworks evaluate the detailed technical and to a certain extent economic potential of a given material for a specific application however the production of metals is associated with large environmental impacts further exacerbating global challenges such as climate change norgate et al 2007 furthermore the raw materials for various metal alloys are non renewable and can be highly geographically concentrated graedel et al 2015 gordon et al 2007 tilton and lagos 2007 considering the impact a lack of availability of central alloys required in marine construction could have on the development of the industry and the time for new alternative material compositions to be developed tested and introduced into the market it is essential to identify such supply risks early on and to begin developing mitigation strategies long before supply shortages occur these issues are almost completely neglected in existing material selection frameworks as they focus solely on material selection in the present and lack a consideration of long term developments to enable a holistic evaluation of a material s suitability not only today but also in the long term future an alternative framework was developed consisting of 27 attributes designed to rate a specific material s technical economic and environmental performance as well as the availability and distribution of the raw material resources required for its production kappenthuler and seeger 2019b in this paper the mentioned framework is applied to evaluate the potential of different types of metals and alloys for long term use in marine construction and to identify the issues as well as potential solutions which need to be addressed to enable an environmentally and economically sustainable expansion of marine activities in the future the rest of the paper is structured as follows first the methodology of the ranking applied to the specific case of marine construction is explained and the different metal categories used for the ranking are presented this is followed by the results of the ranking which was completed with experts from industry and academia based on these results we discuss research areas that may have a large impact on the overall sustainability of marine construction as well as a high potential for long term commercial applicability 2 methodology the framework applied in this paper was developed to aid in the identification and initial high level prioritization of research projects focusing on the development or improvement of materials for the use in sustainable construction the theory behind the framework is described in great detail in a previous publication by the authors kappenthuler and seeger 2019b in this section we therefor provide a short overview of the structure of the framework and then focus on the methodological issues related to the application of the framework to the presented case 2 1 short description of methodological framework as the goal of the applied framework is to identify and prioritize promising research areas for the improvement of construction materials the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated materials need to be assessed in a first step therefore the framework is based on a holistic ranking of each materials technical economic and ecological performance as this requires a large number of individual properties to be analyzed multi criteria decision analysis is employed using two hierarchical levels categories and attributes where a category consists of multiple attributes and the attributes are the criteria that are evaluated the categories covered in the framework are durability a measure of technical performance economics costs sustainability environmental impact and future availability evaluation of long term potential for use mechanical stability another measure of technical performance is included in the form a functional unit that is used to compare the performance of the different materials for each material the attributes are given a score from 1 to 5 1 being the lowest 5 the highest score for quantitatively measurable attributes values where specified for each point along the scale for attributes that need to be assessed qualitatively the lowest acceptable 1 average 3 and ideal 5 property of a material was described as precisely as possible based on expert discussions and literature data all scales are shown in appendix a the attribute scores are aggregated using a simple additive weighting process to produce a single score for each category these category scores are then aggregated again using the same process to produce a final material score the resulting ranking provides a comparison of the individual materials performance levels as well as an overview each materials strengths and weaknesses which is then used to identify areas where material improvements have a high impact on the overall score of the material kappenthuler and seeger 2019b 2 2 goal of ranking for this work the goal of the ranking is to identify the types of metals that have the highest potential to be used as structural components for sustainable marine construction in the long term future therefore the attributes developed in the original framework were adapted to measure the performance of the evaluated materials in a marine environment all attributes and their scale definitions are shown in appendix a the durability attributes are evaluated for exposure in the splash zone this is the harshest location of exposure for marine construction reuben 1994 alexander 2016 the individual metals are evaluated without considering any protection methods ex coatings the future availability attributes are evaluated for a timeframe of 50 years unless stated otherwise in appendix a disposal and recycling costs originally included in the economics costs category are left out of the ranking as they vary greatly from country to country are highly process specific and thus cannot be realistically estimated frijia et al 2012 2 3 category and attribute weights all categories and attributes are given a weighting factor reflective of their importance for achieving the stated goal 1 low importance 2 medium importance 3 high importance these weights were defined together with industry experts and are shown in fig 1 since the focus is on sustainable marine construction in the long term future immediate economic considerations were seen as less important while future availability was determined to be the most central category 2 4 definition of functional unit the functional unit fu chosen to compare the different metals according to their performance as structural components was related to the materials tensile strengths thus it was calculated for each metal how much material would be required for the production of a 1 m long beam with a square cross section that is able to withstand a tensile load of 5000 kn consequently the tensile strength of each metal determines the area of the cross section and thus also the amount of material required i e the fu 2 5 material selection for ranking for material selection existing categorizations of metals used in marine construction were analyzed reuben 1994 ashby 2016 dexter 1979 powell and francis 2012 this led to a first selection of broad metal categories which each include the pure metals as well as the plethora of individual alloys of the specific metal type the categories commonly used in literature are carbon steels cs stainless steels ss aluminum alloys aa titanium alloys tia nickel copper alloys ni cu magnesium alloys and zinc alloys after discussion with industry experts it was decided to exclude magnesium and zinc alloys from the ranking magnesium and zinc are extremely low on the galvanic series and corrode rapidly in seawater consequently they cannot be used as structural materials in these environments for each of the remaining metal categories one specific alloy was chosen to represent the entire category this choice was based on discussions with experts and literature review to identify the alloy that commonly provides a good performance in the marine environment for the cs s355j2 1 0553 was chosen as the representative material as it is a versatile structural steel specified for marine use by various codes such as bs en 10225 2009 the most commonly used ss are austenitic steels since they are also the cheapest however these steels may still corrode in aggressive environments as can be found offshore in the splash zone therefore to reflect more precisely the material used for marine construction duplex stainless steel grade 1 4462 x2crnimon22 5 3 was selected to represent the category as it combines the advantages of both austenitic and ferritic stainless steel and is the most suitable material for the use in corrosive environments baddoo and burgan 2001 for the aa the 5xxx series containing magnesium as the main alloying element are mainly used for structural applications due to their increased corrosion resistance davis and davis 2001 alloy 5083 almg4 5mn was chosen as the representative material for this group the most used tia for marine environments is grade 5 titanium 3 7165 ti6al 4v this alloy accounts for around 50 of global titanium alloy production titanex gmbh 2017 finally for ni cu monel k500 2 4375 nicu30al is used as the representative material 2 6 data collection data for each attribute of all evaluated metals was gathered through discussions with experts and from technical reports material databases and scientific literature the experts were asked to complete the ranking and to explain the reason for each individual score all scores are discussed in detail in the next section for each metal at least 3 experts completed the ranking in general the average score was chosen as the final score however if the scores given by different experts varied by more than 1 point further investigation into the literature was conducted which allowed a well informed decision on which score was appropriate overall a total of 10 experts from academia and industry participated in the ranking 3 results discussion the individual attribute and category scores are shown in table 1 providing an overview of each metal s strengths values 4 5 and weaknesses values 1 2 as mentioned the applied framework evaluates the technical performance of the metals in the form of their durability i e resistance to external physical and chemical impacts their commercial potential according to their usage costs and anticipated price developments their overall sustainability based on renewability environmental impact ei of production and recyclability and finally the future availability of the raw materials required for their production which is determined by the global supply and demand situation for more details see kappenthuler and seeger 2019b the highest durability scores are achieved by the corrosion resistant tia and ni cu followed by ss aa and finally cs the economics scores show almost the exact opposite ranking cs aa ss tia ni cu as the less alloyed metals are cheaper to produce and somewhat easier to manufacture the same ranking resulted for the sustainability category while all metals are non renewable and highly recyclable the mining and processing of more specialized alloying elements leads to significantly higher ei of production per fu for ss ni cu and to a lesser extent tia despite their higher tensile strengths appendix b concerning future availability the most critical materials are nickel chromium and molybdenite leading to low scores for ss and ni cu in the longer term these alloys as well as tia will furthermore see strongly increasing demand from other industries beside construction exacerbating potential supply concerns for aa competition may also be an issue but this is less certain no competition or availability shortage is expected for cs combining the individual scores of each metal using the weighting factors presented in fig 1 leads to the total scores shown at the bottom of table 1 despite having a lower durability than all the other metals the low cost and ei of production on a relative scale the impact is still rather high when compared with other materials such as timber or concrete as well as the high future availability results in cs achieving the highest overall score the second highest ranked material is tia mainly due to its high durability this is followed by aa ni cu and finally ss the performance of the individual metals will be discussed in detail in the following subsections 3 1 durability with the exception of cs all analyzed metals have a very high durability rating all metals are immune to damage from uv radiation and are not affected by moisture excluding corrosive effects thus achieving the highest score in these categories tia and ni cu are furthermore considered as inherently corrosion resistant ni cu is often used as protective cladding for marine steel structures and are also not susceptible to biological degradation and stress corrosion cracking scc see definition in appendix a dexter 1979 de 1993 in fact the only attribute where these metals do not achieve the maximum score is fatigue resistance all metals are susceptible to fatigue damage nevertheless their fatigue behavior is well understood and can be predicted rather precisely therefore for metals with a fatigue limit cs ss tia structures with an infinite fatigue life can theoretically be designed if the loads a component will be exposed to during its service life are known score 3 this is not possible for metals without a fatigue limit aa ni cu which is why these metals have a lower fatigue score i e 2 the next best metals concerning durability are ss and aa duplex ss perform very well in the marine environment however they can still suffer from pitting corrosion it has been shown that the depth of these pits increases rapidly after initiation but remains constant after a period of several years krouse et al 2014 therefore for thicker ss components this pitting corrosion can be seen as mostly superficial affecting the visual aspects and not the mechanical ones a lifetime of 50 100 years should be achievable baddoo and burgan 2001 nevertheless since the initiation of corrosion can under certain circumstance lead to failure of a component a score of 4 was assigned the same score was assigned for aa which are corrosion resistant due to the formation of a passive oxide layer on their surface if this layer is damaged localized pitting corrosion can also occur for both ss and aa biological attack presents an issue in the form of microbially induced corrosion mic certain microorganisms can become attached to ss and aa components and give rise to slimy biofilms on the surface these films can accelerate the initiation of pitting corrosion which can lead to sudden failure of a component score 3 liengen et al 2014 concerning scc duplex ss perform better than aa both are generally not susceptible to scc for aa however certain tempers as well as defects during manufacture can strongly increase scc susceptibility jones and jones 2017 due to this possible susceptibility a score of 3 was assigned duplex ss do not exhibit this behavior but are still not completely immune to scc score 4 cs as the lowest ranking metals readily corrode in seawater score 1 are also susceptible to biological attack in the form of mic score 3 and in the past have commonly failed due to scc mechanisms when used in marine structures without the appropriate maintenance or protection score of 2 moan 2011 3 2 economics and costs concerning economics and costs all metals perform well the main weaknesses are fire resistance and increasing prices in the future the ranking of the total economic scores is the same as that of material costs per fu cs are the cheapest of the analyzed materials followed by aa which cost about 100 more per fu the more complex duplex ss tia and ni cu are significantly more expensive due in part to the higher content of specialized alloying elements such as chromium molybdenum or vanadium and achieved scores of 3 2 and 1 respectively the costs per fu for each metal are shown in appendix b concerning ease of manufacture all metals have similar properties larger components such as sheets rods and bars are produced in a factory for all analyzed metals theoretically any shape or size can be produced for cs and ni cu components can easily be resized and joined on site with simple welding equipment to a certain extent these components can also be reshaped nevertheless the main design of the component produced in the factory largely determines the final shape that is used on site score 4 aa achieved the same score despite the fact that on site welding of al components is more difficult than for cs or ni cu as this disadvantage is compensate by the lower stiffness of aa making it easier to reshape components on site ss and tia were given a lower score as welding and reshaping on site is not easily completed score 3 for ss more caution needs to be given when handling components to make sure the surface isn t damaged or contaminated which would reduce corrosion resistance baddoo and burgan 2001 thus the environment needs to be carefully controlled during casting and also welding jointing and cutting necessitating more specialized equipment and better trained personnel especially the welding of duplex ss is a big challenge even for trained personnel making factory conditions much more suitable for manufacture than on site ones for tia the primary and secondary fabrication processes are up to 18 times more costly than when using cs this is due to the hardness and reactivity of titanium which wears down tools very quickly and requires a slow fabrication process sŏng et al 2009 thus it requires expensive specialized equipment for manufacture furthermore it is very difficult to shape tia components on site making factory production of the complete final components a necessity the ease of manufacture of the different metals has a direct consequence on their repairability as cs and ni cu can be rather easily be welded the repair of damaged components is possible on site even to the extent of restoring original mechanical properties score 5 the same can be done with aa and ss components although more sophisticated equipment and specially trained personnel is required score 4 for tia the hardness of the material makes it very difficult to cut out a damaged area before welding on site thus removal of the entire component and repair in a factory are a more feasible approach score 2 fire resistance is an issue for all unprotected metals except tia which have an excellent heat resistance score of 5 the high thermal conductivity of metals leads to a rapid temperature increase throughout the entire component in the case of a fire if unprotected they lose their mechanical strength at lower temperatures than those present in an average fire and thus fail under standard service loads nevertheless for any given load it is possible to calculate the time it will take for a specific component to fail in a fire making the failing behavior predictable score 2 all analyzed metals have been used for decades in marine construction and thus have a low performance uncertainty the difference in individual scores is due to the fact that some metals have been used extensively for larger structural components cs tia score 5 while others are more commonly used for non structural uses such as pipes valves cladding or handrails ss aa ni cu score 4 finally in the long term for all metals except cs a significant price increase is expected in the foreseeable future the main drivers for these increases differ from metal to metal for instance global aluminum prices are expected to increase by over 30 by 2030 compared with 2016 world bank 2017 this will have a large effect on the future prices of aa and to a certain extent also for tia as aluminum is used as an alloying element the prices for titanium minerals ilmenite rutile are also predicted to increase in the range of 5 15 from 2017 to 2020 it is expected that suppliers will aim to keep price increases steady but moderate hope 2017 a critical point for tia is vanadium in the near term a price spike is expected for vanadium as demand exceeded supply in 2017 however as new capacity comes online these prices are expected to stabilize ametek 2017 perles 2013 overall vanadium is only added as an alloying element in small amounts 4 of mass but will nevertheless influence the final price of grade 5 titanium for duplex ss rising prices for raw materials excl iron ore are seen as one of the main restraints for future growth of the industry increased use of scrap which will occur if prices are high could limit these increases asd reports 2021 the highest increase in price is expected for nickel an alloying element in ss and the main component of ni cu due to decreasing production levels and increasing demand from green technologies such as batteries turbines or electric motors an increase of up to 100 is expected from 2016 to 2030 furthermore copper prices are also expected to increase by around 40 in the same timeframe world bank 2017 thus the lowest value was assigned for ni cu 3 3 sustainability and environmental impact concerning sustainability the only positive aspects of the analyzed metals is their high recyclability the recycling rates are above 60 for all metals which corresponds to the highest score united nations environment programme 2011 bowyer et al 2015 polmear et al 2017 however none of the raw materials required for production of the individual alloys are from renewable sources translating into the lowest score for renewability the individual eis were calculated for the production of 1 fu of the specific metal from 100 virgin materials using data from the ecoinvent 3 3 database the individual scores are shown in appendix b information on the individual calculations can be found in appendix c cs have the lowest ei for all three categories analyzed human health ecosystems resources and thus the highest score for these attributes this is once again due to the low content of alloying elements for instance ss and ni cu with the overall highest impact require nickel and for ss also molybdenum both of which are largely mined as sulfide minerals the hydrometallurgical processing of these minerals leads to large impact scores from emissions and leaching of the sulfide tailings overall these direct impacts are larger than the indirect impacts from energy production which are significant for the energy intensive production of aa and tia norgate et al 2007 liu et al 2013 it must be kept in mind that the ei rankings are based on the relative values of the analyzed material and thus cannot be directly translated into environmental friendliness of production 3 4 future availability the future availability scores for all materials are determined by the raw materials required for their production table 2 describes the elemental composition of the individual alloys while table 3 shows the raw materials from which each element is produced as well as their availability and concentration values the overall future availability score for cs stands out from those of the other metals the raw material resources of all raw materials required for the production of carbon steel fe c cu are large and geographically well distributed furthermore the construction industry is the main user of steel and the only competition could potentially come from the automotive industry which is predicted to grow strongly in the coming decades due to increased demand from developing nations however the automotive industry is moving strongly towards more lightweight materials such as aluminum or composites therefore the demand for steel from the automotive industry will very likely be significantly lower than the demand from the construction industry concerning manganese the main alloying element in low carbon steels the steel industry is the major consumer responsible for around 90 of global demand and therefore this should not lead to a shortage in supply for the construction industry score 5 finally demand growth for steel is slowing down after a period of very strong growth driven largely by china many steel producers already have or may soon have significant overcapacities some facilities have even been shut down to improve the carbon footprint of producing companies therefore a certain increase in production volumes should be possible with existing facilities the past surge in demand for steel by china demonstrated that significant production capacity can be added in a very short period of time score 5 morfeldt et al 2013 oecd 2011 world steel association 2017 in comparison the score for ss the lowest ranking metal type concerning future availability is greatly affected by the use of nickel chromium and molybdenum as alloying elements all three elements either have a limited short or long term availability score 1 and 2 respectively while chromium and molybdenum reserves are also highly concentrated score 1 furthermore government regulations which have an impact on the production of ss are already in effect for instance the government of indonesia restricted the export of unprocessed nickel ore in order to ensure that the value increasing refining processes are completed in the country in 2014 furthermore in the philippines the government issued an order in 2016 to audit all existing mines in the country to check for environmental compliance and to clamp down on non sustainable mining practices reducing output and even shutting down critical operations these two countries together account for 31 of global nickel production and thus these developments have limited the supply of this crucial raw material on the global market and created substantial uncertainty glencore 2016 selby 2017 further export restrictions exist for other essential raw materials of ss such as chromium and even ss scrap these export restrictions have a high potential to limit but not completely restrict supply of raw materials especially for the european union which is responsible for around 20 of global ss production and a much larger percentage of global duplex grade production score 2 pothen et al 2013 to add to these issues the construction industry is only responsible for around 12 of total stainless steel demand this includes all grades and demand from competing industries is expected to increase strongly score 1 the major concern comes from a strong expected growth of the renewable energy and electro mobility sectors that would lead to large demand increases for nickel and also molybdenum kleijn et al estimated the increased metal supply that would be required under different energy scenarios and came to the conclusion that nickel output would have to increase by 50 250 and molybdenum output by 30 100 to meet the rising demand from the energy sector alone kleijn et al 2011 even if supply security can be achieved increasing the production of duplex ss will only be possible with large capital investments score 3 as most facilities which currently produce duplex ss do not have large overcapacities new facilities will need to be constructed if these facilities are to be built in countries that are currently not yet producing duplex ss careful technology transfer will be required as the process for producing these high quality materials is significantly more complicated than those used to produce austenitic ss or cs for aa the main bottleneck concerning availability are globally highly concentrated chromium reserves score 1 combined with existing export restrictions mentioned before as it is only a minor alloying element in the 5xx series a value of 4 was assigned to potential for government regulation for the production of the aa themselves there is no real competition for raw materials as 95 of globally produced bauxite is used for metallurgical processes flook 2015 however next to construction transport is a major end use sector for the globally produced aa both sectors account for around 25 of total demand increase in demand from the construction of lighter weight vehicles is expected to outweigh the increase in demand from the construction sector currently global aa production is more or less at full capacity and further investments in new mines and production facilities are ongoing if production increase can keep up with demand growth competition for supply should be limited due to the uncertainty a value of 3 was assigned liu et al 2013 fog 2016 concerning ease of production increase the mentioned high level of capacity at which global aluminum production is currently running means that new mines and processing facilities would need to be built requiring large long term investments in order to increase global production levels score 3 the future availability of tia suffers mainly from the high concentration of vanadium resources score 1 as well as demand from competing industries score 1 and to a lesser extent the high investments required to increase global production levels score 2 the main competing industry for the production of tia is the use of titanium in pigments 91 of mineral supply is consumed for production of tio2 pigments while only around 6 are used for the production of metallic products as the construction industry is also only a minor user of tia the number and size of competing industries is significant the largest end use sectors for tia are aerospace chemical processing and power generation demand from the aerospace industry is expected to increase significantly due to increasing production of commercial aircraft and also increasing titanium content of new aircraft however future titanium prices are still expected to be determined largely by the level of demand from pigment producers as the largest users of this element mccoy 2017 gehler 2017 hohne sparboth 2017 another issue is the use of high purity vanadium as a major alloying element in ti 6al 4v only around 4 of global vanadium production is used in titanium alloy production the major user is the steel industry responsible for 93 of vanadium consumption the demand for these steels is expected to grow due to increasing construction activities specifically in china ametek 2017 furthermore growth in the green technology sector is expected to drive demand for vanadium redox batteries specifically renewable energy and electric vehicles by 2020 it is expected that the production of such batteries could consume about 30 of global vanadium production perles 2013 concerning ease of production increase the global titanium sponge production is currently running at around 70 capacity due to an oversupply in the last years as well as environmental concerns some plants were closed down or decreased production rates gehler 2017 consequently to a certain extent it would be possible to increase titanium production by reactivating plants that were shut down and running existing ones at full capacity however for an increase to significantly higher production levels large investments will be required as titanium production is a very expensive process were return on capital is measured in decades and not years verkhnaya salda metallurg 2006 furthermore new primary mines will most likely also be required not only for titanium but also for vanadium which requires further investments along the entire value chain currently the global high purity vanadium production required for the use in titanium alloys is running at full capacity and demand is expected to exceed supply already in 2017 ametek 2017 ni cu as the second lowest ranked metals concerning future availability suffer from the same issues as the ss due to the use of nickel as the main material component low short and long term availability government regulation restricting supply and high competition from other industries a significant advantage ni cu have over ss is that they don t require chromium or molybdenum as an alloying element and thus have a relatively well distributed resource base score 4 concerning the competition from competing industries score 1 the main use of nickel is for ss production 67 and the main use of ni cu is for the aerospace industry future demand is expected to increase substantially due to growing demand from energy generation transport and food processing as nickel producers are currently decreasing production capacity in reaction to a strong oversupply in the past years increasing production would to a certain extent be possible by reopening closed facilities and increasing capacity of running ones however a ramp up of the mostly old and deep mines would require a long time and significant investments furthermore it is expected that existing capacity even with reopening of mines will need to be significantly expanded to meet future demand as no new high grade deposits have been discovered in a long time lower grade deposits will need to be developed mostly in more remote regions requiring significant investments and having higher environmental concerns kleijn et al 2011 mistry 2012 3 5 improving material performance by analyzing the weaknesses of each material discussed in the previous sections in combination with its overall future availability it is possible to roughly determine the research areas and approaches that have the highest probability of providing long term benefits to the industry for this the low ranked attributes scores 1 2 in table 1 which have a high weight are analyzed and where possible existing approaches are discussed for carbon steels the main weak points are corrosion resistance weight 3 to a certain extent fire resistance weight 2 and the high ei of production weight 2 for all other metals the high ei of production also presents a reason for concern however the main weak points lie in a low long term availability weight 3 for ss ni cu or high concentration weight 3 for ss aa and tia of specific alloying elements as well as strong competition from other growing industries weight 2 for ss tia and ni cu further a factor reducing the overall attractiveness of tia and ni cu is price weight 3 concerning cs multiple approaches are already broadly employed to increase their corrosion resistance such as sacrificial anodes or various kinds of organic and inorganic coatings further research in this area is well warranted as carbon steel presents the best option from the sustainability and availability perspectives for all the metals and an increase in corrosion resistance would significantly increase the durability and overall score of this material however it is essential to evaluate the economics sustainability and future availability of the desired protection method to ensure that the addition of a coating or anode does not significantly decrease individual scores of the carbon steel most coatings contain an organic component which has been produced either from petroleum or natural gas the use of these non renewable resources will slightly reduce the resources to production ratio score i e long term availability from 5 to 4 bp 2018 as for all products containing petroleum derived organic substances the development of bio based alternatives presents an interesting option for ensuring long term availability and potentially increasing sustainability of production another aspect to consider for protective coatings is that they often contain active substances which prevent the initiation of corrosion if the barrier formed by the coating is damaged the future availability as well as the potential environmental impact of large scale use of these substances also needs to be taken into account prior to investing in the development of new coatings for instance coatings containing cerium nanoparticles have been shown to provide significant corrosion inhibition to steel substrates montemor 2014 cerium reserves are however geographically highly concentrated hhi of ca 2250 and the use of such coatings would reduce this score for steel components from 5 to 2 u s geological survey 2017 furthermore the extraction of cerium from mined ore is complicated and cost intensive leading to a number of severe environmental issues zhou et al 2017 finally it must also be taken into account that a certain amount of cerium will leach into the environment during the lifetime of the coated component the toxicity of cerium oxide nanoparticles is a topic of intensive investigation and initial results currently point towards the possibility of adverse effects on multiple organisms koehlé divo et al 2018 sendra et al 2018 therefore it may be the case that extensive use of these particles in sensitive marine environments is prohibited by governments in the future further reducing the overall score of this improvement strategy a more promising approach from a resource and environmental perspective are thermally sprayed aluminum coatings which are often employed for corrosion protection of submerged steel components momber et al 2015 lópez ortega et al 2018 looking at the availability scores for aluminum the element produced from bauxite in table 3 it can be seen that availability or concentration does not present an issue the ei of aluminum production still needs to be taken into account as well as the potential impact of aluminum leaching into the environment although higher aluminum concentration have been found to have adverse effects on certain marine organisms it is suspected that the increase in dissolved aluminum caused by leaching from offshore structures will remain well below this level due to dilution effects golding et al 2015 kirchgeorg et al 2018 as mentioned another main weakness of all analyzed metals is the high ei of production the sources of these impacts are direct solid liquid and gaseous emissions occurring during mining and processing as well as indirect emissions stemming from the production of energy and reagents required for these steps norgate et al 2007 concerning the process of resource extraction i e mining and separation of metals from minerals there are a number of possibilities to reduce these impacts for instance the energy required for the mining operations could be provided from renewable sources such as bio based fuels or electricity from wind solar power etc another approach is the development of more environmentally friendly bio based or biodegradable chemicals as well as the use of specialized microbes for the extraction of the desired metals behera and mulaba bafubiandi 2017 hidalgo et al 2018 laitinen et al 2016 norgate and jahanshahi 2011 however the only true solution to decreasing the ei of metal production is to eliminate the need for mining and processing of new virgin raw materials by significantly increasing recycling rates and moving further towards to a closed loop economy united nations environment programme 2011 increasing recycling rates will furthermore also mitigate the availability concerns of essential alloying elements for aa tia and ni cu such as chromium nickel or vanadium a major challenge in the recycling of metal alloys is the efficient separation of the individual alloy types and alloying elements as well as complete removal of contaminants from the scrap metal capuzzi and timelli 2018 nakamura et al 2017 reijnders 2016 takeda and okabe 2018 nakajima et al 2016 technologies that efficiently separate different scrap automatically according to various physical and chemical properties present promising improvements for the recycling of all metals examples are near infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction fluorescence laser induced breakdown spectroscopy or 3d imaging techniques capuzzi and timelli 2018 cesetti and nicolosi 2016 these technologies are essential as a proper separation of individual alloys before the actual recycling step minimizes the amount of different elements i e impurities in the scrap metal greatly improving the quality of the recycled alloys lu et al 2016 ohno et al 2017 nevertheless for certain impurities are almost impossible to separate completely and thus need to be removed as part of the recycling process for example for aa the main contaminant which reduces the quality of the recycled alloy is iron iron content can be managed by mixing end of life scrap with less contaminated scrap obtained during the manufacture of aa products cut offs shavings etc or primary aluminum capuzzi and timelli 2018 also for tia the removal of iron fe and oxygen o impurities in scrap material presents the largest barrier to improving the recycling rate again higher quality scrap containing lower concentrations of fe and o is diluted with highly pure titanium sponge which is produced from virgin materials to ensure sufficient quality of the recycled alloy lower quality scrap is used to produce ferrotitanium an alloying element used for the production of certain steels takeda and okabe 2018 thus by reducing the fe and especially o content of tia scrap the need for additional virgin material and down cycling could be reduced technologies for removal of these contaminants are mostly still in the fundamental stage of research fang et al 2013 moon et al 2017 taninouchi et al 2016 okabe et al 2016 reitz et al 2011 kang and okabe 2016 if further development proves successfully they could have a high commercial potential consequently the development of recycling processes which remove certain contaminants along with on line analytical methods for the separation of different metal alloys present high potential research areas which could greatly improve the economics and sustainability of metal recycling 4 conclusion in this paper a newly developed material selection framework is applied to analyze the long term potential of different metal types for use in sustainable marine construction the results provide a detailed overview of each material s strengths and weaknesses related to their durability economics sustainability and future availability overall carbon steels achieved the highest score followed by titanium alloys aluminum alloys nickel copper alloys and finally stainless steels for the lower ranked alloy types the higher durability scores could not compensate for the future availability concerns of various specialized alloying elements ex ni cr v mo the main weakness of carbon steels is their low corrosion resistance which however is compensated by a low price and high availability based on these results a number of research areas which may improve the performance of these materials in the future could be identified the critical research areas identified were the development of environmentally friendly protective coatings for carbon steels and improved separation and recycling technologies in order to minimize contaminants in the recycled materials for all metal alloys while many such technologies already exist they are currently still uneconomical on a large scale further investments into their development may in the long term enable a significantly more sustainable use of metals not only in marine construction but also for all other areas of application funding this research did not receive

place and strongly limit the availability of raw materials uncertain whether regulations limiting access to raw materials will be implemented but the possibility exists no realistic reason for governments to regulate usage of material or raw material in the foreseeable future development of recycling infrastructure recycling infrastructure will not develop significantly in the next 50 years leaving landfilling or incineration as the main disposal option for material recycling infrastructure will develop to a certain extent increasing recycling rates however downcycling is expected to remain the only viable option infrastructure will develop strongly in the next 50 years leading to high recycling rates 75 of material that can replace virgin material or recycling rate is already at this level today projected growth of competing industries construction is only responsible for a small share of material s total demand and demand from competing industries is expected to exceed current supply levels in the next 50 years along with other industries the construction industry is a major consumer of the material as demand increases it is possible that competition for resources between these industries increases the construction industry is the largest driver of demand for the material and demand from competing industries will become remain insignificant compared to supply

21203,the majority of present marine finfish production is conducted in flexible net cages which can deform when they are subjected to water movements generated by currents the ability to monitor net deformation is important for performing cage operations and evaluation of fish health and welfare under changing environment this paper presents a new method for real time monitoring of net cage deformations that is based on an integrated approach where positioning sensor data is incorporated into a numerical model an underwater positioning system was deployed at a full scale fish farm site with three acoustic sensors mounted on a cage measuring positions of the net at different depths a novel numerical model with an adaptive current field was used to simulate net cage deformations where the magnitude and direction of the current could be adapted by continuously assessing deviations between the simulated and the measured positions of the net this method was found to accurately predict the pre defined current velocity profiles in a set of simulated experiments in the field experiment a good agreement was also obtained between the simulated positions of the net and the acoustic sensor data the integrated approach was shown to be well suited for in situ real time monitoring of net cage deformations by using a significantly reduced number of sensors keywords aquaculture net cages real time monitoring numerical model acoustic positioning system 1 introduction atlantic salmon salmo salar is currently one of the most significant farmed finish species in marine aquaculture the majority of the salmon production cycle is conducted in flexible net cages that are placed in floating fish farms moored to the seabed or the shore see e g in fig 1 these cages can deform when subjected to water movements generated by currents altering the available volume for the fish and influencing cage management and operations the loss of cage volume has been shown to affect fish growth and mortality rates due to reduced oxygen flow and increased stress levels in the fish particularly when the stocking density is high turnbull et al 2005 water current in itself can also cause stress to the fish as the fish have to swim faster and expend more energy to avoid contact with the net enclosure and other fish remen et al 2016 real time detection of net deformation could act as a useful early warning system for fish farm operators to prevent uncontrolled reduction of cage volume lader et al 2008 the ability to monitor net deformation is also essential for the automation of inspection maintenance and repair operations in fish farms this harmonises with the precision fish farming pff concept which outlines how innovative technologies and automation principles may be used to improve the ability to monitor control and document aquaculture productions føre et al 2018 the deformation of net cages in current and waves has been extensively studied by means of numerical modelling e g aarsnes et al 1990 lader et al 2003 tsukrov et al 2003 fredheim 2005 huang et al 2007 zhao et al 2007 berstad et al 2014 endresen et al 2014 moe føre et al 2016 shen 2018 and model testing e g lader and enerhaug 2005 huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 the current and wave forces acting on a net structure are typically calculated by using morison type approach and experimentally based screen models løland 1991 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 due to the detailed and flexible geometry of the net consisting of millions of slender twines a complete fluid structure interaction analysis is not feasible today a more common practice for modelling the interaction between current and cage is to consider the net as a porous medium e g zhao et al 2013 bi et al 2014 yao et al 2016 although computational requirements in such simulations may be reduced by not resolving or simplifying the representation of the resulting fluid flow around the net the simulation model of a full scale net cage considering the influence on or from the fish e g filgueira et al 2017 tang et al 2017 can still be computationally intensive for real time implementations full scale field measurements of net cage deformations are challenging the ones that exist have used pressure depth tags lader et al 2008 klebert et al 2015 and acoustic sensor data decew et al 2013 to estimate cage volumes under various current conditions by using positioning sensors mounted on the cage at several depths these studies achieved good approximations of cage volume but relied on a considerable number of sensors and were not used for real time monitoring furthermore the volume approximation techniques could not provide detailed information about the deformed net geometry that can be used for operational tasks such as autonomous net inspection operations for which it is essential to instantaneously track the travelled path of an underwater vehicle relative to a net pen rundtop and frank 2016 arnesen et al 2018 in this study a real time numerical model was developed for the simulation and monitoring of net cage deformations positioning data obtained from three acoustic sensors mounted on a full scale net cage were incorporated into the numerical model by continuously altering and adapting the magnitude and direction of the current used in the simulation dependent on differences between the simulated and the measured positions of the net this method was implemented as a part of a general control framework for autonomous operations in fish farms that considers interactions with fish and flexible structures su et al 2019 in addition to the deformed net geometry the integrated approach was able to provide estimated values of the current as inputs for the evaluation of environmental disturbances to the fish and autonomous navigation kelasidi et al 2017 2 materials and methods the proposed approach for the monitoring of net cage deformation is implemented in a software framework fhsim which allows a high degree of flexibility to combine different mathematical models numerical solvers and estimation techniques for time domain representation of a complex system reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 in the following the numerical simulation model of net cage the underwater positioning system and the integrated approach for cage monitoring are introduced respectively 2 1 numerical simulation model because the number of net twines for a net cage is typically in the order of 10 million complete structural modelling is not feasible in a model designed for real time applications fig 2 shows a simplified model of net cage structure which is set up with a netting material knotless with square meshes and negligible bending stiffness that is widely used in the aquaculture industry equivalent truss elements with only axial stiffness are used by keeping the same solidity ratio sn defined as the ratio of the projected netting material area to the total area of a net panel as the selected netting material across all elements a typical net cage system also consists of a floating collar a sinker tube weights and various mooring components the corresponding simulation models in fhsim have been described in detail by endresen et al 2014 along with a more sophisticated structural model for the net than that is used in the present study the simplified net model can be connected to other existing models e g floating collar and sinker tube in fhsim for the simulation of a complete net cage system to save simulation time it may be assumed that the net is fixed on the top while the sinker tube and bottom weight can be simplified by applying equivalent forces on the corresponding net nodes see in fig 2 2 1 1 equations of motion for the net node the deformation of the net cage structure is modelled by solving the equations of motion for each net node as shown in fig 2 constrained by the interconnected truss elements and under the effect of hydrodynamic forces 1 m i x i n 1 n t k n n 1 n p f n a n where m i is the local mass of the net represented by node i x i 3 three dimensional vector is the acceleration vector of the node n t is the number of trusses connected with the node k n 3 is the constraint force from one of the trusses n p is the number of net panels surrounding the node f n 3 is the sum of drag and lift forces on one of the net panels a n 3 is the corresponding added mass force and as a first approximation n 1 n p a n m i ρ w ρ n x i shen 2018 where ρ w is the water density and ρ n is the density of the netting material 2 1 2 kinematic constraints for the truss element a truss element connecting node i and node j is characterized by a vector t i j 3 that is defined as 2 t i j x j x i where x j 3 is the position vector of node j and x i 3 is the position vector of node i the quadratic constraint for the truss length l i j is written as 3 c i j t i j 2 l i j 2 based on the baumgarte stabilization method described in johansen 2007 the quadratic constraint c i j can be incorporated into the equations of motion of the node eq 1 as the constraint force 4 k i j t i j t i j k p l c i j k d l c i j where k p l 0 and k d l 0 are the specified control gains in addition the quadratic constraint may be simplified by using the feedback linearization technique as described in johansen 2007 5 k i j t i j t i j k p l t i j l i j k d l t i j t i j t i j l i j with this simplification the axial dynamics of the truss element can be adjusted to maintain its natural frequencies by choosing k p l in accordance to 6 k p l e i j a i j l i j where e i j is the elastic modulus of the netting material and a i j is the equivalent cross sectional area of the truss element for modelling and simulation of slender elastic structures the stability requirement is often related to the courant number defined as 7 γ max i w i δ t l i 1 where l i is the length of element i w i is the material wave speed of the element and δ t is the integrator time step of the simulation for γ 1 the critical time step may be found as 8 δ t c min i l i w i considering a typical netting material e g elastic modulus e 1 0 gpa density ρ 1040 kg m used in the aquaculture industry the axial wave speed of a net twine can be approximated by 9 w i e i ρ i 10 9 pa 10 3 kg m 3 10 3 m s this indicates that if the minimum element length is in the order of 1 m which is common practice the critical time step would be in the order of 10 3 s reducing the element length i e mesh refinement would require a smaller time step which is a well known numerical challenge when considering performance versus fidelity for such simulations implicit time integration methods are usually used to solve such problems although the criterion defined by eq 8 may be relaxed for some implicit solvers the computational time would still be a problem because of the iterative nature of such approaches to reduce the courant number the control gains k p l and k d l in eq 4 and eq 5 may be chosen to appropriate values according to the integrator time step johansen 2007 by doing this the elastic modes of the truss elements will be exchanged by the kinematic constraints which provide the desired structural properties e g the tensions of all the truss elements in the present study the high frequency axial dynamics of each truss element are filtered out based on the baumgarte stabilization method since it is the transversal dynamics which dominate net deformations and a steady state of net configuration is of interest 2 1 3 hydrodynamic model the experimentally based screen type of force model proposed by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 is used to calculate the hydrodynamic viscous forces acting on the net the screen force model was originally developed for steady flow and it was shown to give clear improvements in calculating the drag and lift forces on the net cages in current as compared with a morison type of force model cheng et al 2020 considering the high keulegan carpenter number with respect to the twine diameter the flow in waves can be assumed as quasi steady thus the screen force model is considered to be also applicable in waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 the screen force model divides the netting structure into a number of flat net panels or screens as shown in fig 2 each net panel is assumed to experience a viscous normal force f n 3 due to a pressure drop proportional to the square of the instantaneous relative fluid velocity u r e l 3 and a tangential force f t 3 due to the flow deflection by the net twines the resultant force can be alternatively decomposed into the drag force f d 3 and the lift force f l 3 as shown in fig 3 the non dimensional drag and lift force coefficients are defined as 10 c d f d 0 5 ρ w a u r e l 2 11 c l f l 0 5 ρ w a u r e l 2 where ρ w is the water density and a is the panel area the instantaneous relative fluid velocity u r e l is defined as 12 u r e l r u u w x i where u 3 is the incoming current velocity r is the velocity reduction wake factor u w 3 is the incident wave particle velocity at the position of the node and x i 3 is the velocity of node i the practical importance of the velocity reduction is that the rear part of the cage will experience a reduced inflow as described in løland 1991 13 r 1 0 46 c d where c d is the calculated drag coefficient for a vertical net panel the wake effect for the oscillatory flow is difficult to be incorporated thus it is often assumed that only the steady part of the flow i e the current is reduced shen 2018 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 used the experimental data from goldstein 1965 to represent the drag coefficient of a circular cylinder c d c i r c y l as a seventh order polynomial of log 10 rn for the reynolds number range 10 3 2 rn 10 4 14 c d c i r c y l 78 46675 254 73873 log 10 rn 327 8864 log 10 rn 2 223 64577 log 10 rn 3 87 92234 log 10 rn 4 20 00769 log 10 rn 5 2 44894 log 10 rn 6 0 12479 log 10 rn 7 for a flat net panel the reynolds number is defined as 15 rn u r e l d w ν 1 sn where d w is the net twine diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water the drag and lift coefficients may formally be represented by the fourier series of θ which is the angle between u r e l and the normal of the net panel one approximation is to keep the first two terms in each series i e 16 c d θ c d 0 9 cos θ 0 1 cos 3 θ 17 c l θ c l 1 0 sin 2 θ 0 1 sin 4 θ where 18 c d c d 0 c d c i r c y l sn 2 sn 2 1 sn 2 19 c l c l π 4 0 5 c d 2 π c d 32 2 c d 2 eq 16 to eq 19 relate the drag and lift coefficients of a net panel to the reynolds number dependent drag coefficient of a circular cylinder which are applicable for 10 3 2 rn 10 4 sn 0 5 and 0 θ π 2 a thorough description of these formulations and the corresponding parametric studies can be found in kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 2 1 4 cage volume calculation a generalized method based on rohmer et al 2009 is also implemented for the calculation of the enclosed volume of the net herein the netting structure is represented by a closed manifold triangle surface s and its vertex positions are denoted by p i x i y i z i 3 i 1 n the enclosed volume of s is then given by 20 v face l m n s z l z m z n 6 x m x l y m y l x n x l y n y l where face l m n δ p l p m p n is a surface triangle of s this trilinear expression as described in rohmer et al 2009 corresponds to the sum of the signed volumes of the prisms spanned by the surface triangles and their projections onto the x y plane see fig 4 2 2 underwater positioning system a short baseline sbl acoustic positioning system milne 1983 determines the position of an underwater target by acoustically measuring the distance from a transponder locator mounted on the tracked target to three or more baseline transducers receiver mounted on boats or ships that are either anchored or under way while ultra short baseline usbl systems offer a fixed accuracy sbl positioning accuracy improves with transducer spacing this means that an sbl system can achieve a precision and position stability similar to that of the sea floor mounted long baseline lbl system when there is sufficient space making the system suitable for high accuracy survey work in the present study an sbl based positioning system was developed by water linked as with instrument size and robustness being optimized for the use in aquaculture net cages as shown in fig 5 four baseline transducers a b c d are mounted on the floating collar and one locator o is mounted on the net the baseline transducer a sends a signal which is received by the locator the locator replies and the reply is received by the four transducers the measurements of signal run time yield the distances o a o b o c and o d which are used to calculate the position of the locator by triangulation or position search algorithms the resulting target positions are relative to the location of the baseline transducers and can thus be converted to a cage referenced coordinate system which is fixed to the floating collar the acoustic signals may be subjected to scattering and damping due to the swimming fish rendering real time communications with good coverage throughout the entire cage challenging to achieve water linked as have therefore developed specialized signal processing algorithms that optimize bandwidth while ensuring stable communication in the presence of biomass and under various cage environments a remote controlled topside computer through the integrated 4g modem is used for signal processing and the real time positioning data can be accessed through a designated url uniform resource locator address 2 3 integrated approach for cage monitoring the use of the extended kalman filter kalman 1960 einicke and white 1999 is firmly entrenched in nonlinear signal processing and state estimation based on the extended kalman filter a numerical model can be combined with sensor data for a more realistic estimation of the actual system where the current state estimate is advanced forward in time through the numerical simulation and is continuously updated to the best possible fit to the sensor data the numerical simulation model of a net cage typically consists of several hundreds of interconnected nodes see in fig 2 each node has 3 degrees of freedom dofs which means the number of system states is in the order of 10 3 the numerical implementation of an extended kalman filter would need to evaluate the state vector covariance matrix which includes the system jacobian calculation of the system jacobian of a nonlinear system either needs an explicit expression as a function of the state vector or a numerical approximation using state perturbations both these approaches were found to cause too high computational requirements in a real time scenario in the present study the measured positions of the net are used to estimate the current velocity profile i e vertical profile of horizontal flow velocity that is causing the net deformations instead of evaluating and correlating the states of each net node the blue spheres in fig 6 denote measured positions and the white spheres denote simulated positions under an estimated flow condition deviations between simulated and measured positions i e position errors are used to continuously adapt the current velocity profile using a proportional integral derivative pid controller with integral saturation for each error signal at each simulation time step the implemented pid controller calculates the error value e t 3 as the difference between simulated and measured positions and applies a correction to the magnitude and direction of the incoming current velocity based on the proportional integral and derivative terms as illustrated in fig 6 the position error e i t is used to estimate the incoming current velocity u i t at a certain depth d i i 1 2 n 21 u i t k p e i t k i 0 t e i t d t k d d e i t d t where k p k i and k d denote the coefficients for the proportional integral and derivative terms respectively the pid controller is set with integral saturation for preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre defined bounds and an upper limit for the estimated magnitude of current velocity the incoming current velocity u t at an arbitrary depth d is then calculated as 22 u t u 1 t 0 d d 1 u 1 t u 2 t u 1 t d d 1 d 2 d 1 d 1 d d 2 u n 1 t u n t u n 1 t d d n 1 d n d n 1 d n 1 d d n u n t d n d d m a x which is a piecewise linear approximation of the current velocity profile herein the depth d i does not need to be same as the depth of each locator for instance a locator deployed at 5 m depth can be used to estimate the incoming current velocity at 0 m depth the piecewise linear approximation does not need to satisfy the flow condition at the bottom boundary layer d m a x since it has no effect on the simulated net deformation if the last depth layer d n is set to be larger than the total depth of the cage however if the measured net position e g position error e 3 t as shown in fig 6 is affected by the alteration of the flow beneath the cage e g due to the interaction with the bottom of the sea as reported by klebert et al 2015 the estimation result of the current velocity beneath the cage i e u n t will also be affected furthermore the alteration of the flow due to the interaction with the cage can to a certain extent be reflected in the estimated current velocities as they are determined by the measured actual net positions as mentioned in section 2 2 the measurements made by the sbl system are relative to the positions of the baseline transducers mounted on the floating collar in practice this means that the measurements provided by the locators placed at three different depths will be relative to the surface implying that eventual dynamics exhibited by the floating collar or mooring components will have little impact on the position measurements this further suggests that the numerical model does not need to represent these components a simplification of the cage model as shown in fig 6 enables its use in real time simulations where online measurement data are incorporated through the implemented tcp ip transmission control protocol internet protocol interface at each moment e g every 0 1 s a piecewise linear current velocity profile is estimated and simultaneously applied in the simulation of net cage deformations resulting in a gradual convergence towards the best possible fit to the measurement data 3 convergence studies and model validations two numerical case studies were conducted to evaluate the convergence and accuracy of the numerical simulation model the simulated hydrodynamic forces and cage deformations were compared with existing model scale experimental data he et al 2018 and full scale measurements klebert et al 2015 simulated positioning data were also used to verify the proposed integrated approach for cage monitoring by comparing estimated current velocity profiles with those provided in the simulations 3 1 hydrodynamic forces and resultant mooring loads fig 7 shows the main dimensions of the net cage used by he et al 2018 in the model scale 1 25 experiments which were conducted according to froude scaling corresponding full scale dimensions were used in the numerical simulations as the main objective of using these data was to check the convergence of the numerical simulation model with respect to full scale mesh resolutions and integrator time steps it should also be mentioned that the net twine diameter was 0 6 0 8 mm in the model scale experiments which implies that the reynolds number with twine diameter as characteristic length was not properly scaled this effect was considered to be secondary if the correct solidity ratio was used he et al 2018 in the present paper the experimental data are scaled up for the comparison with the numerical simulation results while the scaling effect is not further discussed the time steps used in the simulations based on he et al 2018 ranged from 0 001 to 0 1 s and a combined current and wave condition was applied current velocity u 0 5 m s significant wave height h s 2 m mean wave period t p 6 s for testing the convergence of the net model alone the net was assumed to be fixed on top see in fig 8 without including other structural components such as a floating collar fig 9 shows the simulated time series of the total drag forces on the net where different time steps were used δ t 0 001 0 1 s the corresponding mean and significant i e the mean of the highest one third peaks values of the drag forces are shown in fig 10 by comparing these results it is evident that the net model has good convergence abilities especially when looking at the mean values with a maximum of 4 deviation for all tested time steps the convergence of the significant values is also considered to be good when a time step of 0 001 s was used the implemented kinematic constraints as described in section 2 12 were close to the elastic stiffness of the truss elements thus the elastic modes of the truss elements were maintained resulting in accurate estimations of structural response and hydrodynamic forces when a time step of 0 1 s was used the high frequency axial dynamics of the truss elements were filtered out due to the stability requirement this caused about 16 overestimation of the significant forces but also resulted in a positive effect that the simulation was more than 10 times faster than real time when a time step of 0 01 s was used the simulation was still about 1 5 times faster than real time while giving good estimates of both the mean 3 deviation and significant 7 deviation forces fig 11 shows three different mesh resolutions of the net cage that were used in the convergence study with respect to the mooring loads where n h n v denote the number of truss elements in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively a floating collar and a simple mooring system were also included in these simulations according to the experimental setup he et al 2018 in fig 12 the simulation results i e mooring loads versus current velocities are shown to be insensitive to the mesh configuration and agree well with the up scaled experimental data using froude scaling as previously validated kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 2015 shen 2018 the screen force model with the velocity reduction factor suggested by løland 1991 can together provide a very good estimation of the steady flow i e current forces acting on the net 3 2 cage deformations fig 13 shows the main dimensions of the net cage used by klebert et al 2015 in full scale experiments where cage deformations were measured using 19 pressure tags attached around the net at different depths and 6 around the sinker tube cage volume reductions under different flow conditions were calculated based on the measurement data and simulations using a sophisticated model of the net endresen et al 2014 in the present simulations the simplified net cage model described above was used and the calculated volume reductions were compared with the full scale measurements and the simulation results given in klebert et al 2015 as shown in fig 14 the overall comparison is good but the present simulations seem to underestimate the volume reductions for low current velocities 0 2 0 3 m s as mentioned in klebert et al 2015 some fouling on the net was observed in the full scale experiments which was corresponding to the low current velocities and could lead to larger deformations due to the increased forces during the full scale experiments the force on the cage was not measured but the result from the simulation was reported fig 15 compares the present simulation with the result shown in klebert et al 2015 where a morison type of force model was used for the net herein the morison model is found to predict higher forces than the present model especially for highly deformed nets while the present simulation shows larger volume reduction than the morison model the same findings have been reported by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 when the screen force model was introduced for the calculation of the force on the net and the estimation of volume reduction in the present paper the improved accuracy for the simulation of net cage deformation via the screen force model and the comparison with the morison type of force model are not further discussed 3 3 instantaneous current velocity profiles before considering the field deployments the integrated approach for cage monitoring as described in section 2 3 was tested using a pair of experiments simulating the full scale net cage structure in klebert et al 2015 the first simulation was set up with a known current velocity profile resulting in cage deformations that were considered the real world simulation the second simulation was then set up without a pre defined current velocity profile and rather set up to use the positions of three selected nodes from the former simulation as inputs to the integrated current estimation structure the selected nodes 1 2 and 3 were located at 4 m 12 m and 20 m depths and they were distributed along the x axis i e x 1 20 37 m x 2 20 37 m and x 3 0 m while y 1 2 3 0 m as shown in fig 6 the x and y components of the calculated position errors i e e 1 t e 2 t and e 3 t were used to estimate the x and y components of current velocities at different depths this enabled real time estimation of the vertical profile of horizontal flow velocity and comparison with the real world setup when the real world simulation was set up with a uniform current velocity profile i e 0 5 m s throughout the depth the magnitude and direction i e along the x axis of the current were correctly estimated based on the input real world positions from one of the selected nodes and the accuracy of the estimation result was unaffected by the location of the node i e 1 2 or 3 as shown in fig 16 the position error of node 1 located at 4 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 0 m depth and the position error of node 2 located at 12 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 50 m depth the estimation results at 0 m and 50 m depths were found to be the same and coincide with the real world setup when the position errors converged to zero as shown in fig 17 the estimation results also converged to the real world values when the current direction was altered by 90 i e along the y axis but more computational efforts were required i e the estimation results took more time to converge this indicates that the efficiency of the estimation model will depend on the configuration of the positioning sensors if there is a main flow direction at the fish farm site it will be more efficient to deploy the positioning sensors along this direction see e g in fig 6 when the real world simulation was set up with a one layer linear current velocity profile current velocity at 0 m depth 0 5 m s along the x axis current velocity at 24 m depth 0 2 m s oriented at 45 to the x axis the current velocities at the two different depths were correctly estimated even with disturbances from the waves irregular waves h s 1 m t p 5 s as shown in fig 18 the position error of node 1 located at 4 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 0 m depth and the position error of node 3 located at 20 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 24 m depth the mean values of the estimated positions and current velocities were found to coincide with the real world setup and the transient position errors were below 0 4 m which was attributed to the disturbances from the waves fig 19 shows the estimation results for the real world setup with a two layer linear current velocity profile where the first depth layer 0 12 m was set in accordance with the cylindrical part of the cage and the second depth layer 12 24 m was set to cover the conical bottom of the cage the position errors of the three selected nodes 1 2 and 3 were used to estimate the current velocities at 0 m 12 m and 24 m depths respectively this was found to be an optimal setup for the integrated estimation structure considering both the accuracy and the computational effort a more representative current velocity profile could be predicted by use of more positioning sensors however as shown in figs 18 and 19 it could also result in a significant increase in convergence time due to the increased number of interdependent states in the estimation model 4 field deployments and monitoring results the sbl based positioning system was deployed at a full scale fish farm site fig 20 with three locators mounted on a cage at 6 3 m lower edge of the shielding skirt 16 m connection to the sinker tube and 32 m connection to the bottom weight depths measuring the horizontal positions of the net fig 21 shows the trajectories of the locators and the calculated mean positions and standard deviations during a selected tidal period i e 12 h the diameter of this cage was approximately 50 m which is marked by the dashed line circle corresponding time series 1 hz logging rate for the measured locator positions fig 22 do not show large variations except for possible disturbances from water waves and measurement noise not handled by the signal processing algorithms the calculated mean positions of locator 1 and locator 2 during this period were used to determine the actual cage diameter at the two different depths for the setup of the numerical simulation model the main dimensions of the net cage that were used in the simulation model and the corresponding configuration of the locators are shown in fig 23 and fig 24 respectively the half mesh width of the net was 17 5 mm with a twine diameter of 2 5 mm effective net solidity was set to 0 3 to account for possible fouling on the net since only steady flow forces and the resultant net deformations were of interest a simulation time step of 0 1 s and moderate mesh resolution n h n v 48 12 were used there was also a shielding skirt for preventing sea lice installed at 0 6 3 m depth in the cage as the screen force model is only applicable for sn 0 5 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the shielding skirt were calculated by assuming c d 1 in eq 16 to eq 19 fig 25 shows the time series of the measured positions during the selected three tidal periods when the locators had largest displacements smoothed using 10 min moving average to limit the effects of transient disturbances and measurement noise the 10 min steady state data were incorporated into the numerical simulation model for the estimation of current velocities and cage deformations fig 26 shows the estimation results when two locators locator 1 and locator 3 were used and fig 27 shows the estimation results when all the three locators were used while the maximum position error was about 1 7 m when two locators were used it was lower at about 0 6 m when using three locators this was because using three locators improved the current velocity profile estimation from a one layer profile fig 26b to two layer profile fig 27b cage volume estimations were also quite different with three locators fig 27c than when using two fig 26c maximum volume reduction was about 12 when the cage encountered a 0 4 m s tidal flow between the 6th and 8th hour fig 27c the shape of the cage during this period indicated a significant variation of current directions and magnitudes along the two depth layers 0 16 m and 16 32 m fig 28 this variation could be attributed to the complex interactions between the current flow and the cage lader et al 2008 and other influences such as local topography and the layout of the fish farm site klebert et al 2015 as shown in fig 20 when the current was coming from the right hand side i e along the positive y axis there was a shielding effect due to the cages on the upstream side fig 20 while there was no shielding when the current was coming from the left hand side i e along the negative y axis this can explain why the magnitudes of the estimated current velocities were about 25 lower when they were positive fig 27b the estimated current velocities at 0 m depth also correlated with the three tidal periods and were comparable to the measured flow conditions at this fish farm site klebert and su 2020 however there was no directly available data for the validation of present estimation results when the positioning data were further smoothed using a 1 h moving average the instantaneous estimation errors were below 0 3 m during the three tidal periods fig 29 and fig 30 compared with the maximum estimation errors when using raw data at 1 hz about 3 m and when using a 10 min moving average about 0 6 m this demonstrates how transient disturbances e g waves and fish farm operations and measurement noise can affect the monitoring and estimation results since the present positioning system could not capture these transient states only the steady state data could be used in the integrated estimation model furthermore the requirements for real time communication and long term data acquisition restrict the number of acoustic sensors that can be used at a full scale fish farm site the setup of three locators in accordance with the cylindrical conical shape as shown in fig 24 of the cage is shown to be able to predict a two layer linear current velocity profile and the resulting cage deformation this is considered to be sufficient for general purpose monitoring and well suited for real time applications 5 conclusions in the present study an integrated approach that combines a numerical model and positioning sensor data was developed for real time monitoring of net cage deformations an

21203,the majority of present marine finfish production is conducted in flexible net cages which can deform when they are subjected to water movements generated by currents the ability to monitor net deformation is important for performing cage operations and evaluation of fish health and welfare under changing environment this paper presents a new method for real time monitoring of net cage deformations that is based on an integrated approach where positioning sensor data is incorporated into a numerical model an underwater positioning system was deployed at a full scale fish farm site with three acoustic sensors mounted on a cage measuring positions of the net at different depths a novel numerical model with an adaptive current field was used to simulate net cage deformations where the magnitude and direction of the current could be adapted by continuously assessing deviations between the simulated and the measured positions of the net this method was found to accurately predict the pre defined current velocity profiles in a set of simulated experiments in the field experiment a good agreement was also obtained between the simulated positions of the net and the acoustic sensor data the integrated approach was shown to be well suited for in situ real time monitoring of net cage deformations by using a significantly reduced number of sensors keywords aquaculture net cages real time monitoring numerical model acoustic positioning system 1 introduction atlantic salmon salmo salar is currently one of the most significant farmed finish species in marine aquaculture the majority of the salmon production cycle is conducted in flexible net cages that are placed in floating fish farms moored to the seabed or the shore see e g in fig 1 these cages can deform when subjected to water movements generated by currents altering the available volume for the fish and influencing cage management and operations the loss of cage volume has been shown to affect fish growth and mortality rates due to reduced oxygen flow and increased stress levels in the fish particularly when the stocking density is high turnbull et al 2005 water current in itself can also cause stress to the fish as the fish have to swim faster and expend more energy to avoid contact with the net enclosure and other fish remen et al 2016 real time detection of net deformation could act as a useful early warning system for fish farm operators to prevent uncontrolled reduction of cage volume lader et al 2008 the ability to monitor net deformation is also essential for the automation of inspection maintenance and repair operations in fish farms this harmonises with the precision fish farming pff concept which outlines how innovative technologies and automation principles may be used to improve the ability to monitor control and document aquaculture productions føre et al 2018 the deformation of net cages in current and waves has been extensively studied by means of numerical modelling e g aarsnes et al 1990 lader et al 2003 tsukrov et al 2003 fredheim 2005 huang et al 2007 zhao et al 2007 berstad et al 2014 endresen et al 2014 moe føre et al 2016 shen 2018 and model testing e g lader and enerhaug 2005 huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 the current and wave forces acting on a net structure are typically calculated by using morison type approach and experimentally based screen models løland 1991 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 due to the detailed and flexible geometry of the net consisting of millions of slender twines a complete fluid structure interaction analysis is not feasible today a more common practice for modelling the interaction between current and cage is to consider the net as a porous medium e g zhao et al 2013 bi et al 2014 yao et al 2016 although computational requirements in such simulations may be reduced by not resolving or simplifying the representation of the resulting fluid flow around the net the simulation model of a full scale net cage considering the influence on or from the fish e g filgueira et al 2017 tang et al 2017 can still be computationally intensive for real time implementations full scale field measurements of net cage deformations are challenging the ones that exist have used pressure depth tags lader et al 2008 klebert et al 2015 and acoustic sensor data decew et al 2013 to estimate cage volumes under various current conditions by using positioning sensors mounted on the cage at several depths these studies achieved good approximations of cage volume but relied on a considerable number of sensors and were not used for real time monitoring furthermore the volume approximation techniques could not provide detailed information about the deformed net geometry that can be used for operational tasks such as autonomous net inspection operations for which it is essential to instantaneously track the travelled path of an underwater vehicle relative to a net pen rundtop and frank 2016 arnesen et al 2018 in this study a real time numerical model was developed for the simulation and monitoring of net cage deformations positioning data obtained from three acoustic sensors mounted on a full scale net cage were incorporated into the numerical model by continuously altering and adapting the magnitude and direction of the current used in the simulation dependent on differences between the simulated and the measured positions of the net this method was implemented as a part of a general control framework for autonomous operations in fish farms that considers interactions with fish and flexible structures su et al 2019 in addition to the deformed net geometry the integrated approach was able to provide estimated values of the current as inputs for the evaluation of environmental disturbances to the fish and autonomous navigation kelasidi et al 2017 2 materials and methods the proposed approach for the monitoring of net cage deformation is implemented in a software framework fhsim which allows a high degree of flexibility to combine different mathematical models numerical solvers and estimation techniques for time domain representation of a complex system reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 in the following the numerical simulation model of net cage the underwater positioning system and the integrated approach for cage monitoring are introduced respectively 2 1 numerical simulation model because the number of net twines for a net cage is typically in the order of 10 million complete structural modelling is not feasible in a model designed for real time applications fig 2 shows a simplified model of net cage structure which is set up with a netting material knotless with square meshes and negligible bending stiffness that is widely used in the aquaculture industry equivalent truss elements with only axial stiffness are used by keeping the same solidity ratio sn defined as the ratio of the projected netting material area to the total area of a net panel as the selected netting material across all elements a typical net cage system also consists of a floating collar a sinker tube weights and various mooring components the corresponding simulation models in fhsim have been described in detail by endresen et al 2014 along with a more sophisticated structural model for the net than that is used in the present study the simplified net model can be connected to other existing models e g floating collar and sinker tube in fhsim for the simulation of a complete net cage system to save simulation time it may be assumed that the net is fixed on the top while the sinker tube and bottom weight can be simplified by applying equivalent forces on the corresponding net nodes see in fig 2 2 1 1 equations of motion for the net node the deformation of the net cage structure is modelled by solving the equations of motion for each net node as shown in fig 2 constrained by the interconnected truss elements and under the effect of hydrodynamic forces 1 m i x i n 1 n t k n n 1 n p f n a n where m i is the local mass of the net represented by node i x i 3 three dimensional vector is the acceleration vector of the node n t is the number of trusses connected with the node k n 3 is the constraint force from one of the trusses n p is the number of net panels surrounding the node f n 3 is the sum of drag and lift forces on one of the net panels a n 3 is the corresponding added mass force and as a first approximation n 1 n p a n m i ρ w ρ n x i shen 2018 where ρ w is the water density and ρ n is the density of the netting material 2 1 2 kinematic constraints for the truss element a truss element connecting node i and node j is characterized by a vector t i j 3 that is defined as 2 t i j x j x i where x j 3 is the position vector of node j and x i 3 is the position vector of node i the quadratic constraint for the truss length l i j is written as 3 c i j t i j 2 l i j 2 based on the baumgarte stabilization method described in johansen 2007 the quadratic constraint c i j can be incorporated into the equations of motion of the node eq 1 as the constraint force 4 k i j t i j t i j k p l c i j k d l c i j where k p l 0 and k d l 0 are the specified control gains in addition the quadratic constraint may be simplified by using the feedback linearization technique as described in johansen 2007 5 k i j t i j t i j k p l t i j l i j k d l t i j t i j t i j l i j with this simplification the axial dynamics of the truss element can be adjusted to maintain its natural frequencies by choosing k p l in accordance to 6 k p l e i j a i j l i j where e i j is the elastic modulus of the netting material and a i j is the equivalent cross sectional area of the truss element for modelling and simulation of slender elastic structures the stability requirement is often related to the courant number defined as 7 γ max i w i δ t l i 1 where l i is the length of element i w i is the material wave speed of the element and δ t is the integrator time step of the simulation for γ 1 the critical time step may be found as 8 δ t c min i l i w i considering a typical netting material e g elastic modulus e 1 0 gpa density ρ 1040 kg m used in the aquaculture industry the axial wave speed of a net twine can be approximated by 9 w i e i ρ i 10 9 pa 10 3 kg m 3 10 3 m s this indicates that if the minimum element length is in the order of 1 m which is common practice the critical time step would be in the order of 10 3 s reducing the element length i e mesh refinement would require a smaller time step which is a well known numerical challenge when considering performance versus fidelity for such simulations implicit time integration methods are usually used to solve such problems although the criterion defined by eq 8 may be relaxed for some implicit solvers the computational time would still be a problem because of the iterative nature of such approaches to reduce the courant number the control gains k p l and k d l in eq 4 and eq 5 may be chosen to appropriate values according to the integrator time step johansen 2007 by doing this the elastic modes of the truss elements will be exchanged by the kinematic constraints which provide the desired structural properties e g the tensions of all the truss elements in the present study the high frequency axial dynamics of each truss element are filtered out based on the baumgarte stabilization method since it is the transversal dynamics which dominate net deformations and a steady state of net configuration is of interest 2 1 3 hydrodynamic model the experimentally based screen type of force model proposed by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 is used to calculate the hydrodynamic viscous forces acting on the net the screen force model was originally developed for steady flow and it was shown to give clear improvements in calculating the drag and lift forces on the net cages in current as compared with a morison type of force model cheng et al 2020 considering the high keulegan carpenter number with respect to the twine diameter the flow in waves can be assumed as quasi steady thus the screen force model is considered to be also applicable in waves kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 the screen force model divides the netting structure into a number of flat net panels or screens as shown in fig 2 each net panel is assumed to experience a viscous normal force f n 3 due to a pressure drop proportional to the square of the instantaneous relative fluid velocity u r e l 3 and a tangential force f t 3 due to the flow deflection by the net twines the resultant force can be alternatively decomposed into the drag force f d 3 and the lift force f l 3 as shown in fig 3 the non dimensional drag and lift force coefficients are defined as 10 c d f d 0 5 ρ w a u r e l 2 11 c l f l 0 5 ρ w a u r e l 2 where ρ w is the water density and a is the panel area the instantaneous relative fluid velocity u r e l is defined as 12 u r e l r u u w x i where u 3 is the incoming current velocity r is the velocity reduction wake factor u w 3 is the incident wave particle velocity at the position of the node and x i 3 is the velocity of node i the practical importance of the velocity reduction is that the rear part of the cage will experience a reduced inflow as described in løland 1991 13 r 1 0 46 c d where c d is the calculated drag coefficient for a vertical net panel the wake effect for the oscillatory flow is difficult to be incorporated thus it is often assumed that only the steady part of the flow i e the current is reduced shen 2018 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 used the experimental data from goldstein 1965 to represent the drag coefficient of a circular cylinder c d c i r c y l as a seventh order polynomial of log 10 rn for the reynolds number range 10 3 2 rn 10 4 14 c d c i r c y l 78 46675 254 73873 log 10 rn 327 8864 log 10 rn 2 223 64577 log 10 rn 3 87 92234 log 10 rn 4 20 00769 log 10 rn 5 2 44894 log 10 rn 6 0 12479 log 10 rn 7 for a flat net panel the reynolds number is defined as 15 rn u r e l d w ν 1 sn where d w is the net twine diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water the drag and lift coefficients may formally be represented by the fourier series of θ which is the angle between u r e l and the normal of the net panel one approximation is to keep the first two terms in each series i e 16 c d θ c d 0 9 cos θ 0 1 cos 3 θ 17 c l θ c l 1 0 sin 2 θ 0 1 sin 4 θ where 18 c d c d 0 c d c i r c y l sn 2 sn 2 1 sn 2 19 c l c l π 4 0 5 c d 2 π c d 32 2 c d 2 eq 16 to eq 19 relate the drag and lift coefficients of a net panel to the reynolds number dependent drag coefficient of a circular cylinder which are applicable for 10 3 2 rn 10 4 sn 0 5 and 0 θ π 2 a thorough description of these formulations and the corresponding parametric studies can be found in kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 2 1 4 cage volume calculation a generalized method based on rohmer et al 2009 is also implemented for the calculation of the enclosed volume of the net herein the netting structure is represented by a closed manifold triangle surface s and its vertex positions are denoted by p i x i y i z i 3 i 1 n the enclosed volume of s is then given by 20 v face l m n s z l z m z n 6 x m x l y m y l x n x l y n y l where face l m n δ p l p m p n is a surface triangle of s this trilinear expression as described in rohmer et al 2009 corresponds to the sum of the signed volumes of the prisms spanned by the surface triangles and their projections onto the x y plane see fig 4 2 2 underwater positioning system a short baseline sbl acoustic positioning system milne 1983 determines the position of an underwater target by acoustically measuring the distance from a transponder locator mounted on the tracked target to three or more baseline transducers receiver mounted on boats or ships that are either anchored or under way while ultra short baseline usbl systems offer a fixed accuracy sbl positioning accuracy improves with transducer spacing this means that an sbl system can achieve a precision and position stability similar to that of the sea floor mounted long baseline lbl system when there is sufficient space making the system suitable for high accuracy survey work in the present study an sbl based positioning system was developed by water linked as with instrument size and robustness being optimized for the use in aquaculture net cages as shown in fig 5 four baseline transducers a b c d are mounted on the floating collar and one locator o is mounted on the net the baseline transducer a sends a signal which is received by the locator the locator replies and the reply is received by the four transducers the measurements of signal run time yield the distances o a o b o c and o d which are used to calculate the position of the locator by triangulation or position search algorithms the resulting target positions are relative to the location of the baseline transducers and can thus be converted to a cage referenced coordinate system which is fixed to the floating collar the acoustic signals may be subjected to scattering and damping due to the swimming fish rendering real time communications with good coverage throughout the entire cage challenging to achieve water linked as have therefore developed specialized signal processing algorithms that optimize bandwidth while ensuring stable communication in the presence of biomass and under various cage environments a remote controlled topside computer through the integrated 4g modem is used for signal processing and the real time positioning data can be accessed through a designated url uniform resource locator address 2 3 integrated approach for cage monitoring the use of the extended kalman filter kalman 1960 einicke and white 1999 is firmly entrenched in nonlinear signal processing and state estimation based on the extended kalman filter a numerical model can be combined with sensor data for a more realistic estimation of the actual system where the current state estimate is advanced forward in time through the numerical simulation and is continuously updated to the best possible fit to the sensor data the numerical simulation model of a net cage typically consists of several hundreds of interconnected nodes see in fig 2 each node has 3 degrees of freedom dofs which means the number of system states is in the order of 10 3 the numerical implementation of an extended kalman filter would need to evaluate the state vector covariance matrix which includes the system jacobian calculation of the system jacobian of a nonlinear system either needs an explicit expression as a function of the state vector or a numerical approximation using state perturbations both these approaches were found to cause too high computational requirements in a real time scenario in the present study the measured positions of the net are used to estimate the current velocity profile i e vertical profile of horizontal flow velocity that is causing the net deformations instead of evaluating and correlating the states of each net node the blue spheres in fig 6 denote measured positions and the white spheres denote simulated positions under an estimated flow condition deviations between simulated and measured positions i e position errors are used to continuously adapt the current velocity profile using a proportional integral derivative pid controller with integral saturation for each error signal at each simulation time step the implemented pid controller calculates the error value e t 3 as the difference between simulated and measured positions and applies a correction to the magnitude and direction of the incoming current velocity based on the proportional integral and derivative terms as illustrated in fig 6 the position error e i t is used to estimate the incoming current velocity u i t at a certain depth d i i 1 2 n 21 u i t k p e i t k i 0 t e i t d t k d d e i t d t where k p k i and k d denote the coefficients for the proportional integral and derivative terms respectively the pid controller is set with integral saturation for preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre defined bounds and an upper limit for the estimated magnitude of current velocity the incoming current velocity u t at an arbitrary depth d is then calculated as 22 u t u 1 t 0 d d 1 u 1 t u 2 t u 1 t d d 1 d 2 d 1 d 1 d d 2 u n 1 t u n t u n 1 t d d n 1 d n d n 1 d n 1 d d n u n t d n d d m a x which is a piecewise linear approximation of the current velocity profile herein the depth d i does not need to be same as the depth of each locator for instance a locator deployed at 5 m depth can be used to estimate the incoming current velocity at 0 m depth the piecewise linear approximation does not need to satisfy the flow condition at the bottom boundary layer d m a x since it has no effect on the simulated net deformation if the last depth layer d n is set to be larger than the total depth of the cage however if the measured net position e g position error e 3 t as shown in fig 6 is affected by the alteration of the flow beneath the cage e g due to the interaction with the bottom of the sea as reported by klebert et al 2015 the estimation result of the current velocity beneath the cage i e u n t will also be affected furthermore the alteration of the flow due to the interaction with the cage can to a certain extent be reflected in the estimated current velocities as they are determined by the measured actual net positions as mentioned in section 2 2 the measurements made by the sbl system are relative to the positions of the baseline transducers mounted on the floating collar in practice this means that the measurements provided by the locators placed at three different depths will be relative to the surface implying that eventual dynamics exhibited by the floating collar or mooring components will have little impact on the position measurements this further suggests that the numerical model does not need to represent these components a simplification of the cage model as shown in fig 6 enables its use in real time simulations where online measurement data are incorporated through the implemented tcp ip transmission control protocol internet protocol interface at each moment e g every 0 1 s a piecewise linear current velocity profile is estimated and simultaneously applied in the simulation of net cage deformations resulting in a gradual convergence towards the best possible fit to the measurement data 3 convergence studies and model validations two numerical case studies were conducted to evaluate the convergence and accuracy of the numerical simulation model the simulated hydrodynamic forces and cage deformations were compared with existing model scale experimental data he et al 2018 and full scale measurements klebert et al 2015 simulated positioning data were also used to verify the proposed integrated approach for cage monitoring by comparing estimated current velocity profiles with those provided in the simulations 3 1 hydrodynamic forces and resultant mooring loads fig 7 shows the main dimensions of the net cage used by he et al 2018 in the model scale 1 25 experiments which were conducted according to froude scaling corresponding full scale dimensions were used in the numerical simulations as the main objective of using these data was to check the convergence of the numerical simulation model with respect to full scale mesh resolutions and integrator time steps it should also be mentioned that the net twine diameter was 0 6 0 8 mm in the model scale experiments which implies that the reynolds number with twine diameter as characteristic length was not properly scaled this effect was considered to be secondary if the correct solidity ratio was used he et al 2018 in the present paper the experimental data are scaled up for the comparison with the numerical simulation results while the scaling effect is not further discussed the time steps used in the simulations based on he et al 2018 ranged from 0 001 to 0 1 s and a combined current and wave condition was applied current velocity u 0 5 m s significant wave height h s 2 m mean wave period t p 6 s for testing the convergence of the net model alone the net was assumed to be fixed on top see in fig 8 without including other structural components such as a floating collar fig 9 shows the simulated time series of the total drag forces on the net where different time steps were used δ t 0 001 0 1 s the corresponding mean and significant i e the mean of the highest one third peaks values of the drag forces are shown in fig 10 by comparing these results it is evident that the net model has good convergence abilities especially when looking at the mean values with a maximum of 4 deviation for all tested time steps the convergence of the significant values is also considered to be good when a time step of 0 001 s was used the implemented kinematic constraints as described in section 2 12 were close to the elastic stiffness of the truss elements thus the elastic modes of the truss elements were maintained resulting in accurate estimations of structural response and hydrodynamic forces when a time step of 0 1 s was used the high frequency axial dynamics of the truss elements were filtered out due to the stability requirement this caused about 16 overestimation of the significant forces but also resulted in a positive effect that the simulation was more than 10 times faster than real time when a time step of 0 01 s was used the simulation was still about 1 5 times faster than real time while giving good estimates of both the mean 3 deviation and significant 7 deviation forces fig 11 shows three different mesh resolutions of the net cage that were used in the convergence study with respect to the mooring loads where n h n v denote the number of truss elements in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively a floating collar and a simple mooring system were also included in these simulations according to the experimental setup he et al 2018 in fig 12 the simulation results i e mooring loads versus current velocities are shown to be insensitive to the mesh configuration and agree well with the up scaled experimental data using froude scaling as previously validated kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 2015 shen 2018 the screen force model with the velocity reduction factor suggested by løland 1991 can together provide a very good estimation of the steady flow i e current forces acting on the net 3 2 cage deformations fig 13 shows the main dimensions of the net cage used by klebert et al 2015 in full scale experiments where cage deformations were measured using 19 pressure tags attached around the net at different depths and 6 around the sinker tube cage volume reductions under different flow conditions were calculated based on the measurement data and simulations using a sophisticated model of the net endresen et al 2014 in the present simulations the simplified net cage model described above was used and the calculated volume reductions were compared with the full scale measurements and the simulation results given in klebert et al 2015 as shown in fig 14 the overall comparison is good but the present simulations seem to underestimate the volume reductions for low current velocities 0 2 0 3 m s as mentioned in klebert et al 2015 some fouling on the net was observed in the full scale experiments which was corresponding to the low current velocities and could lead to larger deformations due to the increased forces during the full scale experiments the force on the cage was not measured but the result from the simulation was reported fig 15 compares the present simulation with the result shown in klebert et al 2015 where a morison type of force model was used for the net herein the morison model is found to predict higher forces than the present model especially for highly deformed nets while the present simulation shows larger volume reduction than the morison model the same findings have been reported by kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 when the screen force model was introduced for the calculation of the force on the net and the estimation of volume reduction in the present paper the improved accuracy for the simulation of net cage deformation via the screen force model and the comparison with the morison type of force model are not further discussed 3 3 instantaneous current velocity profiles before considering the field deployments the integrated approach for cage monitoring as described in section 2 3 was tested using a pair of experiments simulating the full scale net cage structure in klebert et al 2015 the first simulation was set up with a known current velocity profile resulting in cage deformations that were considered the real world simulation the second simulation was then set up without a pre defined current velocity profile and rather set up to use the positions of three selected nodes from the former simulation as inputs to the integrated current estimation structure the selected nodes 1 2 and 3 were located at 4 m 12 m and 20 m depths and they were distributed along the x axis i e x 1 20 37 m x 2 20 37 m and x 3 0 m while y 1 2 3 0 m as shown in fig 6 the x and y components of the calculated position errors i e e 1 t e 2 t and e 3 t were used to estimate the x and y components of current velocities at different depths this enabled real time estimation of the vertical profile of horizontal flow velocity and comparison with the real world setup when the real world simulation was set up with a uniform current velocity profile i e 0 5 m s throughout the depth the magnitude and direction i e along the x axis of the current were correctly estimated based on the input real world positions from one of the selected nodes and the accuracy of the estimation result was unaffected by the location of the node i e 1 2 or 3 as shown in fig 16 the position error of node 1 located at 4 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 0 m depth and the position error of node 2 located at 12 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 50 m depth the estimation results at 0 m and 50 m depths were found to be the same and coincide with the real world setup when the position errors converged to zero as shown in fig 17 the estimation results also converged to the real world values when the current direction was altered by 90 i e along the y axis but more computational efforts were required i e the estimation results took more time to converge this indicates that the efficiency of the estimation model will depend on the configuration of the positioning sensors if there is a main flow direction at the fish farm site it will be more efficient to deploy the positioning sensors along this direction see e g in fig 6 when the real world simulation was set up with a one layer linear current velocity profile current velocity at 0 m depth 0 5 m s along the x axis current velocity at 24 m depth 0 2 m s oriented at 45 to the x axis the current velocities at the two different depths were correctly estimated even with disturbances from the waves irregular waves h s 1 m t p 5 s as shown in fig 18 the position error of node 1 located at 4 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 0 m depth and the position error of node 3 located at 20 m depth was used to estimate the current velocity at 24 m depth the mean values of the estimated positions and current velocities were found to coincide with the real world setup and the transient position errors were below 0 4 m which was attributed to the disturbances from the waves fig 19 shows the estimation results for the real world setup with a two layer linear current velocity profile where the first depth layer 0 12 m was set in accordance with the cylindrical part of the cage and the second depth layer 12 24 m was set to cover the conical bottom of the cage the position errors of the three selected nodes 1 2 and 3 were used to estimate the current velocities at 0 m 12 m and 24 m depths respectively this was found to be an optimal setup for the integrated estimation structure considering both the accuracy and the computational effort a more representative current velocity profile could be predicted by use of more positioning sensors however as shown in figs 18 and 19 it could also result in a significant increase in convergence time due to the increased number of interdependent states in the estimation model 4 field deployments and monitoring results the sbl based positioning system was deployed at a full scale fish farm site fig 20 with three locators mounted on a cage at 6 3 m lower edge of the shielding skirt 16 m connection to the sinker tube and 32 m connection to the bottom weight depths measuring the horizontal positions of the net fig 21 shows the trajectories of the locators and the calculated mean positions and standard deviations during a selected tidal period i e 12 h the diameter of this cage was approximately 50 m which is marked by the dashed line circle corresponding time series 1 hz logging rate for the measured locator positions fig 22 do not show large variations except for possible disturbances from water waves and measurement noise not handled by the signal processing algorithms the calculated mean positions of locator 1 and locator 2 during this period were used to determine the actual cage diameter at the two different depths for the setup of the numerical simulation model the main dimensions of the net cage that were used in the simulation model and the corresponding configuration of the locators are shown in fig 23 and fig 24 respectively the half mesh width of the net was 17 5 mm with a twine diameter of 2 5 mm effective net solidity was set to 0 3 to account for possible fouling on the net since only steady flow forces and the resultant net deformations were of interest a simulation time step of 0 1 s and moderate mesh resolution n h n v 48 12 were used there was also a shielding skirt for preventing sea lice installed at 0 6 3 m depth in the cage as the screen force model is only applicable for sn 0 5 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the shielding skirt were calculated by assuming c d 1 in eq 16 to eq 19 fig 25 shows the time series of the measured positions during the selected three tidal periods when the locators had largest displacements smoothed using 10 min moving average to limit the effects of transient disturbances and measurement noise the 10 min steady state data were incorporated into the numerical simulation model for the estimation of current velocities and cage deformations fig 26 shows the estimation results when two locators locator 1 and locator 3 were used and fig 27 shows the estimation results when all the three locators were used while the maximum position error was about 1 7 m when two locators were used it was lower at about 0 6 m when using three locators this was because using three locators improved the current velocity profile estimation from a one layer profile fig 26b to two layer profile fig 27b cage volume estimations were also quite different with three locators fig 27c than when using two fig 26c maximum volume reduction was about 12 when the cage encountered a 0 4 m s tidal flow between the 6th and 8th hour fig 27c the shape of the cage during this period indicated a significant variation of current directions and magnitudes along the two depth layers 0 16 m and 16 32 m fig 28 this variation could be attributed to the complex interactions between the current flow and the cage lader et al 2008 and other influences such as local topography and the layout of the fish farm site klebert et al 2015 as shown in fig 20 when the current was coming from the right hand side i e along the positive y axis there was a shielding effect due to the cages on the upstream side fig 20 while there was no shielding when the current was coming from the left hand side i e along the negative y axis this can explain why the magnitudes of the estimated current velocities were about 25 lower when they were positive fig 27b the estimated current velocities at 0 m depth also correlated with the three tidal periods and were comparable to the measured flow conditions at this fish farm site klebert and su 2020 however there was no directly available data for the validation of present estimation results when the positioning data were further smoothed using a 1 h moving average the instantaneous estimation errors were below 0 3 m during the three tidal periods fig 29 and fig 30 compared with the maximum estimation errors when using raw data at 1 hz about 3 m and when using a 10 min moving average about 0 6 m this demonstrates how transient disturbances e g waves and fish farm operations and measurement noise can affect the monitoring and estimation results since the present positioning system could not capture these transient states only the steady state data could be used in the integrated estimation model furthermore the requirements for real time communication and long term data acquisition restrict the number of acoustic sensors that can be used at a full scale fish farm site the setup of three locators in accordance with the cylindrical conical shape as shown in fig 24 of the cage is shown to be able to predict a two layer linear current velocity profile and the resulting cage deformation this is considered to be sufficient for general purpose monitoring and well suited for real time applications 5 conclusions in the present study an integrated approach that combines a numerical model and positioning sensor data was developed for real time monitoring of net cage deformations an sbl based positioning system was deployed at a full scale fish farm site and the integrated estimation model was tested with the obtained in situ measurement data the main objective of the numerical and experimental study was to demonstrate the potential use of an optimal setup of the integrated system for in situ real time monitoring the main achievements and findings of the study are as follows a real time numerical simulation model of aquaculture net cage was established based on the baumgarte stabilization method for constrained multibody dynamics the implemented screen force model was considered to in part account for fluid structure interaction and integrated flow effects on the net by using experimentally based force coefficients the accuracy and convergence performance of the numerical simulation model were verified through comparisons with existing model scale and full scale experimental data the accuracy and efficiency of the integrated estimation model were evaluated through a set of simulated experiments and they were found to be dependent on the number and configuration of the positioning sensors the in situ monitoring results were affected by transient disturbances and measurement noise only the steady state sensor data could be used in the integrated estimation model the setup of three acoustic sensors in accordance with the cylindrical conical

21204,a common practice for evaluating the nonlinear damping in ship roll motion is to perform a free decay experiment although various methods have been developed to estimate the coefficients of a nonlinear damping model these methods are limited to certain and relatively simple models in addition the performances of these methods have been greatly affected by the random noise embedded in the measured data in this article an efficient and versatile parameter identification method applicable to rather general nonlinear damping and restoring models to estimate nonlinear damping coefficients from contaminated free decay data is proposed the proposed method approximates the roll motion as complex exponentials by using the prony ss method because the prony ss method has a build in noise rejection mechanism via the usage of truncated singular value decomposition random noise in the measured data could be largely removed based on the analytical complex exponential representation of free decay data the damping coefficients can be easily estimated from the nonlinear equation of roll motion by using a least square technique numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method even when the simulated data are significantly corrupted by random noise furthermore the developed method performs well when nonlinear restoring parameters are also treated as unknown keywords nonlinear roll damping parameter identification complex exponential model noise elimination 1 introduction the damping mechanism of the roll motion of a ship in waves is nonlinear in nature the nonlinearities stem from a variety of sources such as friction on the hull vortex generation and bilge keels himeno 1981 for characterizing the roll damping several nonlinear models have been proposed and investigated dalzell 1978 cardo et al 1982 haddara 1984 while some theoretical and semi empirical methods ikeda et al 1977 1978 ikeda 2004 kawahara et al 2012 have been developed to evaluated the roll damping a common and more reliable practice has been identifying the parameters of a nonlinear model by free decay experiments bulian 2004 one of the pioneers studied the estimation of roll damping coefficients associated with a single degree of freedom equation from experimental data was froude 1872 over the years various approaches have been developed using either only the peak values dalzell 1978 cardo et al 1982 mathisen and price 1984 spouge 1990 sun and shao 2019 or the complete time history contento and francescutto 1994 bulian 2004 of the free decay data but the applicabilities of these methods have been limited to certain and relatively simple models such as the linear plus quadratic and liner plus cubic models undoubtedly a more realistic damping model should include both the roll motion and its derivative components which has been proved both theoretically kobayashi 1974 and experimentally spouge et al 1986 haddara and bennett 1989 haddara and bass 1990 although some studies have attempted to conduct damping parameters identification for more realistic nonlinear damping models they were often confronted with large errors stemming from the numerical differentiation of noisy data bass and haddara 1988 or low computational efficiency contento and francescutto 1994 measured data are inevitably corrupted by random noise arising from the measurement system the derivatives of the measured roll motion which are required in the estimation for damping coefficients will be affected even more by the noise thus it is of paramount importance to filter out the noise as much as possible indeed previous studies have indicated that noise can produce a very significant scatter in the damping coefficients estimation roberts 1985 bass and haddara 1988 in those studies the cubic spline interpolation roberts 1985 and three point moving average techniques bass and haddara 1988 have been employed to alleviate the noise embedded in the data tested with simulated data these techniques produced reasonable but not completely satisfactory estimation alternative approaches fitting the free decay data with analytical exponential decay models zhang and andrews 1999 wilson et al 2006 have also been developed for handling noise however those methods assuming the free decay oscillation had a constant frequency could not characterize the nonlinear behavior of roll motion well and thus led to doubtful estimates of the damping coefficients in this study a parameter identification method which is applicable to rather general nonlinear damping and restoring moment models to estimate nonlinear damping coefficients from free decay data is proposed the novelty of the proposed method begins with a complex exponential model for the roll motion the proposed method also has built in capability to remove random noise from the measured roll signal actually two distinct parameter identifications are involved in the proposed method including 1 identifying poles residues associated with the free decay data by using the prony ss method hu et al 2013 to approximate the roll motion and 2 identifying the damping restoring coefficients from nonlinear roll equation by using a least square technique once the analytical complex exponential representation of free decay data is known the corresponding derivatives namely velocity and acceleration are immediately obtained allowing the second parameter identification be easily conducted this paper will provide four numerical examples to evaluate the performance of the newly developed method the first two examples consider the commonly used linear plus quadratic and linear plus cubic damping models respectively detailed numerical illustration of the proposed method will be given furthermore the impact of a large initial roll angle and the effectiveness of removing signal noise are to be examined the third example considers the most sophisticated damping model available in the literature along with a quintic model for nonlinear restoring moment the last example treats not only the damping parameters but also the restoring parameters as unknown variables demonstrating the versatility of the proposed method 2 equation of roll motion the roll motion of a ship in calm water has often been characterized by a nonlinear second order differential equation as cardo et al 1982 1 i φ c φ φ k φ 0 where φ φ and φ are the roll angle angular velocity and acceleration respectively i is the total roll inertia i e the sum of the body inertia and the added inertia due to the acceleration of the fluid c φ φ is a nonlinear damping moment function of φ and φ and k φ is a nonlinear restoring moment function of φ dividing i through eq 1 leads to the normalized equation of motion 2 φ f φ φ g φ 0 where f φ φ c φ φ i and g φ k φ i in the literature g φ has often been assumed to follow an odd polynomial of the roll angle φ i e 3 g φ m 1 3 5 β m φ m where β m were presumably known coefficients although g φ could be higher degree polynomials in practice cubic and quintic polynomials have often been adopted the reason of not choosing a higher order g φ has been for avoiding cumbersome mathematics in the solution procedure taylan 2000 it has been long recognized that the nonlinear damping function f φ φ had a much higher degree of uncertainty than g φ chan et al 1995 various models for f φ φ have been proposed previously dalzell 1978 cardo et al 1982 haddara 1984 and the most sophisticated model has been bass and haddara 1988 4 f φ φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 for convenience of referring later this model is termed as the full parameter model the linear plus quadratic model is the model with μ 2 μ 3 μ 5 0 and the linear plus cubic model is that with μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 0 3 complex exponential model for roll motion in short the focus of this paper is to identify the damping coefficients in eq 4 given that β m in eq 3 are assumed to be either known or unknown to estimate those damping coefficients an analytical model for the roll motion φ t has been often assumed over the years various analytical models have been proposed including sinusoidal model with slowly varying amplitude and phase dalzell 1978 cardo et al 1982 haddara 1984 chan et al 1995 perturbation series model with a solution of the linear roll equation plus a series of smaller perturbations mathisen and price 1984 and exponential decay models with single oscillating frequency zhang and andrews 1999 bulian 2004 wilson et al 2006 in contrast this study proposes the following complex exponential form for the roll response 5 φ t ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ exp λ ℓ t 0 t t where α ℓ and λ ℓ are termed as complex coefficients residues and complex exponentials poles respectively and n ℓ is the number of components since φ t is a real valued signal λ ℓ must either be real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs let λ ℓ δ ℓ i ω ℓ then δ ℓ is the damping factor in seconds 1 and ω ℓ is the frequency in radians the coefficients α ℓ corresponding to complex numbers λ ℓ must also appear in complex conjugate pairs let α ℓ a ℓ 2 exp i θ ℓ then a ℓ is the amplitude and θ ℓ is the cosinusoidal initial phase angle in radians associated with e λ ℓ t in this study a free decay roll response has been sampled at equally spaced times the first assignment is to identify α ℓ λ ℓ and n ℓ so that using eq 5 gives a good approximation of the measured roll response to this end the prony ss method hu et al 2013 will be employed while a summarized procedure of the prony ss method is provided in appendix i the reader can refer to hu et al 2013 for detailed description in the prony ss method a first order matrix difference equation a state space model is used to replace a high order difference equation used in prony s method prony 1795 besides the advantage that it avoids the ill conditioned problem of solving the roots of a high order polynomial trefethen and david 1997 required in traditional prony s method the prony ss method also has better conditioning stability and accuracy over prony s method hu et al 2013 the merits of the proposed complex exponential model for the roll response lie in three aspects 1 it describes an exponentially decayed oscillation which meets the physics of free decay motion 2 it contains multiple components associated with multiple oscillating frequencies which properly accounts for the nonlinearities of roll motion and 3 the determination of the number of terms n ℓ in the prony ss method has been based on the concept of the principal component analysis which can effectively separate noises from the true free decay data another advantage of using eq 5 for φ t is that the first and second derivatives of free decay data can be readily obtained as 6 φ t ℓ 1 n ℓ λ ℓ α ℓ exp λ ℓ t and 7 φ t ℓ 1 n ℓ λ ℓ 2 α ℓ exp λ ℓ t note that both the roll velocity and acceleration time signals are needed for the estimation of nonlinear damping coefficients 4 estimation of nonlinear damping coefficients after the roll angle velocity and acceleration has been formulated as eqs 5 7 a straightforward procedure to estimate the nonlinear damping coefficients is developed below first substituting eq 4 into eq 2 gives 8 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 g φ 0 for now assume g φ is a known function at the discrete time instant t k k δ t eq 8 becomes 9 φ k μ 1 φ k μ 2 φ k φ k μ 3 φ k 2 φ k μ 4 φ k φ k μ 5 φ k 3 g φ k 0 where φ k φ t k φ k φ t k and φ k φ t k a set of n simultaneous linear equations can be formulated based on eq 9 for k 0 1 n 1 it can be written in the matrix form as 10 y μ y where 11 y φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 2 φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 3 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 2 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 3 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 2 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 3 12 μ μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 μ 5 t and 13 y g φ 0 φ 0 g φ 1 φ 1 g φ n 1 φ n 1 for an over determined case the linear least squares solution for μ can be obtained as 14 μ y t y 1 y t y in passing if g φ has been modeled as eq 3 with unknown β m the same least squares solution procedure could have been expanded to include β m as additional variables to improve the accuracy of the estimated μ an error correction procedure can be followed chan et al 1995 the first step of this procedure is to generate φ t from the equation of motion with the estimated μ i e 15 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 g φ 0 while working on this newly synthesized φ t we follow the same solution method to estimate μ denoted as μ to distinguish it from μ since this synthesized data and the solution procedure share the same underlying model the difference between μ and μ is largely due to the solution method let the relative discrepancy between μ i and μ i i 1 5 be defined as 16 ε i μ i μ i μ i rearranging eq 16 gives 17 μ i μ i 1 ε i by following eq 17 we write the ultimate estimation of μ i defined as μ ˆ i to be 18 μ ˆ i μ i 1 ε i the use of eq 18 is to eliminate the error due to the solution procedure recognizing that modeling errors can never be removed 5 numerical studies four numerical examples with various f φ φ models are investigated the first two examples consider the commonly used linear plus quadratic and linear plus cubic damping models respectively detailed numerical illustrations are presented in addition the influence on the damping estimation due to the initial roll angle and the signal noise level is investigated the third example considers the full parameter damping model shown in eq 4 the intention is to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to a rather general form of the nonlinear damping the fourth example estimates system coefficients when both damping and restoring coefficients are treated as unknown demonstrating the versatility of the proposed method throughout the numerical examples the system of units is the mks meter kilogram second system based on measuring lengths in meters mass in kilograms and time in seconds for conciseness explicit units for quantities are omitted in the following presentation 5 1 example 1 linear plus quadratic damping in the first example the equation of roll motion is given as 19 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ 2 25 φ φ 3 0 this equation which contains a linear plus quadratic damping function and known cubic restoring function has been numerically studied in a previous article by chan et al 1995 a purpose of this example is to illustrate the procedure of the newly proposed method another goal is to examine the method s performance especially when a large initial roll angle and signal noise contamination is considered 5 1 1 detailed numerical illustration plotted in fig 1 is a simulated free decay roll motion for a duration of 10 s which contains only three peaks of the motion this simulated motion has been generated with δ t 0 01 by running the fourth order runge kutta algorithm on eq 19 based on the target damping coefficients μ 1 0 15 and μ 2 0 2 and the initial conditions φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 the prony ss method is employed to decompose the simulated φ t which has 1001 equally spaced data points as presented in appendix i the first step of the prony ss method is to determine the model order n ℓ displayed in fig 2 are the first 50 normalized singular values of the data hankel matrix h 0 501 500 recognizing that those singular values have been ranked from the largest value equal to 1 to the smallest value three significant drops can be observed at the singular indices 2 4 and 6 as the 7th normalized singular value nsv is already less than 0 1 of the first nsv the chosen threshold for omitting negligible components of the signal is set at 6 i e n ℓ 6 the next step of the prony ss method is to compute λ ℓ referring to eq 24 with n ℓ 6 we have u 1 r 501 6 s 1 r 6 6 and v 1 r 500 6 from the truncated singular value decomposition svd of h 0 501 500 sequentially we utilize eq 26 to compute a the eigenvalues of a are denoted as z ℓ ℓ 1 6 and λ ℓ are obtained from ln z ℓ δ t in the final step of the prony ss method eq 27 is employed to compute α ℓ the three pairs of complex conjugate values of λ ℓ and α ℓ are listed in table 1 also tabulated in table 1 are the corresponding frequencies ω ℓ and damping factors δ ℓ extracted from λ ℓ δ ℓ i ω ℓ as well as the corresponding amplitudes a ℓ and initial phases θ ℓ obtained from α ℓ a ℓ 2 exp i θ ℓ the decomposed three signal components of which each component is φ ℓ t a ℓ exp δ ℓ t cos ω ℓ t θ ℓ are shown in fig 3 noticing that the amplitude of the third component is already negligibly small compared to that of the first component the reconstructed roll motion based on the three decomposed components along with the original simulated φ t is plotted in fig 4 clearly they are in excellent agreement after φ t having been approximated as the sum of six complex exponential terms the corresponding φ t and φ t are readily obtained from eqs 6 and 7 respectively then y and y are built in accordance with eqs 11 and 13 respectively finally the estimated damping coefficients computed by eq 14 are μ 1 0 1500 and μ 2 0 2003 the ultimate estimates for μ 1 and μ 2 have been denoted as μ ˆ 1 and μ ˆ 2 which are the corrections from μ 1 and μ 2 using μ 1 0 1500 and μ 2 0 2003 for μ 1 and μ 2 in eq 19 and repeating the whole computation process we obtain μ 1 0 1500 and μ 2 0 2007 after following eq 16 for computing the relative error we obtain ε 1 0 and ε 2 0 0017 respectively from eq 18 the ultimate estimates of damping coefficients are then obtained as μ ˆ 1 0 1500 and μ ˆ 2 0 2000 which match perfectly with the target damping coefficients specified earlier 5 1 2 sensitivity study on initial roll angles most traditional methods for the roll damping identification were developed under the restriction of small initial roll angle which implies weak nonlinearity of restoring moment chan et al 1995 in this section the performance of the proposed method for a variety of initial roll angles is investigated in this example as g φ 2 25 φ φ 3 φ must be less than 1 5 to have g φ 0 from g φ 0 the maximum of g φ occurs at φ 0 866 in the previous section the initial roll angle φ 0 has been chosen equal to 0 3 we repeat the same effort for 0 4 φ 0 1 4 and the resulting estimates of μ i μ i and μ ˆ i i 1 and 2 are listed in table 2 also tabulated in table 2 is the relative error η i μ ˆ i μ i μ i while the accuracy of the estimation decreases with increasing initial roll angle all estimates are still very close to their corresponding target values even for very large initial roll angles in an identical numerical case study by chan et al 1995 their perturbation method was only valid for φ 0 0 866 furthermore the results of the proposed method are more accurate than those of chan et al 1995 for any initial roll angle 5 1 3 sensitivity study on signal noise measured data are always corrupted by random noise it has been long recognized that the sensitivity of the estimates to noise is of paramount importance roberts 1985 for investigating the effect of random noise two noisy signals are simulated by adding 2 and 5 random gaussian white noise respectively to the clean signal that has been generated from eq 19 with φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 displayed in fig 5 are the simulated noisy signals for 20 s long which is about four times the dominant oscillation period the level of the additive white noise has been quantified by a stated percentage defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the white noise σ noise to that of the noise free signal σ signal σ noise σ signal 100 when the signal to noise ratio or s n ratio is defined as s n 20 log 10 σ signal σ noise 2 and 5 noisy signals are corresponding to s n 33 98 db and 26 02 db respectively following the same procedure that was implemented to obtain fig 2 we plot fig 6 for the normalized singular value nsv curves of the two noisy signals together with that of the clean signal the two nsv curves from the noisy signals become flat at the 5th singular value suggesting that n ℓ 4 should be taken for those noisy signals actually the third component of the clean signal was so weak that it has been completely buried in the added noise the reconstructed signals based on taking n ℓ 4 for the two noisy signals are compared to the clean signal in fig 7 from visual observation both the reconstructed signals agree well with the clean signal after carrying out the proposed method for the two noisy signals the corresponding ultimate estimates μ ˆ 1 and μ ˆ 2 are listed in table 3 as expected the estimated damping coefficients of the 5 noise signal are less accurate than those of the 2 noise signal however they are still close to the target values 5 2 example 2 linear plus cubic damping while the previous example considered a linear plus quadratic damping model the current example studies a linear plus cubic model for comparing the performance of the proposed method to that of a traditional method a numerical case study investigated by chan et al 1995 is chosen in this example the equation of roll motion is given as 20 φ μ 1 φ μ 3 φ 3 24 φ 24 φ 3 0 solving eq 20 with the target damping coefficients μ 1 0 2 and μ 3 0 1 by the fourth order runge kutta algorithm a test free decay roll motion see fig 8 has been generated based on initial conditions φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 for a duration of 3 s similar tasks conducted in example 1 will be repeated for the current example the following presentation however will emphasize on the results while the detailed description of the procedure will be omitted to avoid unnecessary repetition the simulated roll motion signal has 301 equally spaced data points displayed in fig 8 is the nsv diagram obtained based on h 0 151 150 from this nsv diagram n ℓ is set qual to 6 the resulting three pairs of complex conjugate values of λ ℓ and α ℓ are listed in table 4 together with the corresponding ω ℓ δ ℓ a ℓ and θ ℓ the decomposed three signal components are shown in fig 9 and the reconstructed roll motion based on the three decomposed components along with the original simulated φ t are plotted in fig 10 clearly they are in excellent agreement for φ 0 0 3 the resulting estimates for μ i μ i and μ ˆ i i 1 and i 3 are summarized in table 5 the ultimate estimates of damping coefficients are μ ˆ 1 0 2000 and μ ˆ 3 0 1000 which match perfectly with the target damping coefficients 5 2 1 sensitivity study on initial roll angles as g φ 24 φ 24 φ 3 φ must be less than 1 to have g φ 0 and the maximum of g φ occurs at φ 0 577 the values of μ i μ i and μ ˆ i i 1 and 3 for initial roll angle between 0 4 and 0 8 are also listed in table 5 all estimates are very close to their corresponding target values even for very large initial roll angles compared to the results of an identical numerical case study in chan et al 1995 the results of the proposed method are more accurate for any initial roll angle 5 2 2 sensitivity study on signal noise two 8 s noisy signals see fig 11 are simulated by adding 5 and 10 random gaussian white noise respectively to the clean signal that has been generated from eq 20 with φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 the corresponding s n ratio for the two signals are 26 02 db and 20 db respectively the nsv curves of the two noisy signals together with that of the clean signal are plotted in fig 12 after taking n ℓ 4 the reconstructed signals for the two noisy signals are compared to the clean signal in fig 13 which shows that both reconstructed signals agree well with the clean signal conducting the proposed method for these two reconstructed signals yields the ultimate estimates μ ˆ 1 and μ ˆ 3 see table 6 which are close to the target values 5 3 example 3 a rather general form of damping in example 3 the equation of roll motion is given as 21 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 2 25 φ φ 3 φ 5 0 which contains a full parameter damping model and a known quintic restoring function based on the target damping coefficients μ 1 0 2 μ 2 0 15 μ 3 0 35 μ 4 0 1 and μ 5 0 14 and the initial conditions φ 0 0 8 and φ 0 0 a simulated free decay roll motion with δ t 0 01 for a duration of 20 s see fig 14 has been generated by the same procedure used in previous examples due to strong nonlinearities in both the damping and restoring functions it is expected that more components are needed to better approximate φ t from the nsv diagram which has been obtained based on h 0 1001 1000 shown in fig 14 n ℓ is set equal to 15 shown in fig 15 is the reconstructed roll motion based on fifteen complex exponential terms together with the original simulated φ t clearly they are in good agreement implementing the proposed approach obtains the results shown in table 7 it shows that the estimated damping coefficients are very close to the target values also shown in table 7 are the results based on n ℓ 9 which are acceptable but not as good as those based on n ℓ 15 5 4 example 4 estimation on nonlinear damping and restoring coefficients the same equation of roll motion in example 1 is considered here but the coefficients of the restoring function are treated as unknown variables 22 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ β 1 φ β 3 φ 3 0 in the simulation of a free decay roll motion the initial conditions and μ 1 μ 2 β 1 and β 3 are the same as those in example 1 that is μ 1 0 15 μ 2 0 2 β 1 2 25 β 3 1 φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 referring back to example 1 the simulated φ t has been approximated by six complex exponentials see table 1 treating β m as additional variables we build y and y accordingly and obtain the estimates of the damping and restoring coefficients listed in table 8 the ultimate estimates of μ ˆ 1 μ ˆ 2 and β ˆ 1 match perfectly with the target values while β ˆ 3 is just less than 2 off its target value 6 concluding remarks for estimating nonlinear roll damping coefficients an efficient and versatile method which required only a short free decay roll motion data was developed the first step of the proposed method was to approximate the roll motion as the sum of several complex exponential components obtained by using the prony ss method because the underlying principle of the prony ss method is the principal components analysis through a truncated singular value decomposition random noise embedded in the measured roll motion could be largely removed sequentially the analytical derivatives of the roll motion could be readily obtained the proposed method was versatile in the sense that the same data driven analysis was valid for various nonlinear damping and restoring moment models numerical examples using simulated free decay data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method even under the situation that the simulated data were significantly corrupted by random noise another merit demonstrated through a numerical example was that the developed method performed well when nonlinear restoring parameters were treated as unknown

21204,a common practice for evaluating the nonlinear damping in ship roll motion is to perform a free decay experiment although various methods have been developed to estimate the coefficients of a

applicabilities of these methods have been limited to certain and relatively simple models such as the linear plus quadratic and liner plus cubic models undoubtedly a more realistic damping model should include both the roll motion and its derivative components which has been proved both theoretically kobayashi 1974 and experimentally spouge et al 1986 haddara and bennett 1989 haddara and bass 1990 although some studies have attempted to conduct damping parameters identification for more realistic nonlinear damping models they were often confronted with large errors stemming from the numerical differentiation of noisy data bass and haddara 1988 or low computational efficiency contento and francescutto 1994 measured data are inevitably corrupted by random noise arising from the measurement system the derivatives of the measured roll motion which are required in the estimation for damping coefficients will be affected even more by the noise thus it is of paramount importance to filter out the noise as much as possible indeed previous studies have indicated that noise can produce a very significant scatter in the damping coefficients estimation roberts 1985 bass and haddara 1988 in those studies the cubic spline interpolation roberts 1985 and three point moving average techniques bass and haddara 1988 have been employed to alleviate the noise embedded in the data tested with simulated data these techniques produced reasonable but not completely satisfactory estimation alternative approaches fitting the free decay data with analytical exponential decay models zhang and andrews 1999 wilson et al 2006 have also been developed for handling noise however those methods assuming the free decay oscillation had a constant frequency could not characterize the nonlinear behavior of roll motion well and thus led to doubtful estimates of the damping coefficients in this study a parameter identification method which is applicable to rather general nonlinear damping and restoring moment models to estimate nonlinear damping coefficients from free decay data is proposed the novelty of the proposed method begins with a complex exponential model for the roll motion the proposed method also has built in capability to remove random noise from the measured roll signal actually two distinct parameter identifications are involved in the proposed method including 1 identifying poles residues associated with the free decay data by using the prony ss method hu et al 2013 to approximate the roll motion and 2 identifying the damping restoring coefficients from nonlinear roll equation by using a least square technique once the analytical complex exponential representation of free decay data is known the corresponding derivatives namely velocity and acceleration are immediately obtained allowing the second parameter identification be easily conducted this paper will provide four numerical examples to evaluate the performance of the newly developed method the first two examples consider the commonly used linear plus quadratic and linear plus cubic damping models respectively detailed numerical illustration of the proposed method will be given furthermore the impact of a large initial roll angle and the effectiveness of removing signal noise are to be examined the third example considers the most sophisticated damping model available in the literature along with a quintic model for nonlinear restoring moment the last example treats not only the damping parameters but also the restoring parameters as unknown variables demonstrating the versatility of the proposed method 2 equation of roll motion the roll motion of a ship in calm water has often been characterized by a nonlinear second order differential equation as cardo et al 1982 1 i φ c φ φ k φ 0 where φ φ and φ are the roll angle angular velocity and acceleration respectively i is the total roll inertia i e the sum of the body inertia and the added inertia due to the acceleration of the fluid c φ φ is a nonlinear damping moment function of φ and φ and k φ is a nonlinear restoring moment function of φ dividing i through eq 1 leads to the normalized equation of motion 2 φ f φ φ g φ 0 where f φ φ c φ φ i and g φ k φ i in the literature g φ has often been assumed to follow an odd polynomial of the roll angle φ i e 3 g φ m 1 3 5 β m φ m where β m were presumably known coefficients although g φ could be higher degree polynomials in practice cubic and quintic polynomials have often been adopted the reason of not choosing a higher order g φ has been for avoiding cumbersome mathematics in the solution procedure taylan 2000 it has been long recognized that the nonlinear damping function f φ φ had a much higher degree of uncertainty than g φ chan et al 1995 various models for f φ φ have been proposed previously dalzell 1978 cardo et al 1982 haddara 1984 and the most sophisticated model has been bass and haddara 1988 4 f φ φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 for convenience of referring later this model is termed as the full parameter model the linear plus quadratic model is the model with μ 2 μ 3 μ 5 0 and the linear plus cubic model is that with μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 0 3 complex exponential model for roll motion in short the focus of this paper is to identify the damping coefficients in eq 4 given that β m in eq 3 are assumed to be either known or unknown to estimate those damping coefficients an analytical model for the roll motion φ t has been often assumed over the years various analytical models have been proposed including sinusoidal model with slowly varying amplitude and phase dalzell 1978 cardo et al 1982 haddara 1984 chan et al 1995 perturbation series model with a solution of the linear roll equation plus a series of smaller perturbations mathisen and price 1984 and exponential decay models with single oscillating frequency zhang and andrews 1999 bulian 2004 wilson et al 2006 in contrast this study proposes the following complex exponential form for the roll response 5 φ t ℓ 1 n ℓ α ℓ exp λ ℓ t 0 t t where α ℓ and λ ℓ are termed as complex coefficients residues and complex exponentials poles respectively and n ℓ is the number of components since φ t is a real valued signal λ ℓ must either be real numbers or occur in complex conjugate pairs let λ ℓ δ ℓ i ω ℓ then δ ℓ is the damping factor in seconds 1 and ω ℓ is the frequency in radians the coefficients α ℓ corresponding to complex numbers λ ℓ must also appear in complex conjugate pairs let α ℓ a ℓ 2 exp i θ ℓ then a ℓ is the amplitude and θ ℓ is the cosinusoidal initial phase angle in radians associated with e λ ℓ t in this study a free decay roll response has been sampled at equally spaced times the first assignment is to identify α ℓ λ ℓ and n ℓ so that using eq 5 gives a good approximation of the measured roll response to this end the prony ss method hu et al 2013 will be employed while a summarized procedure of the prony ss method is provided in appendix i the reader can refer to hu et al 2013 for detailed description in the prony ss method a first order matrix difference equation a state space model is used to replace a high order difference equation used in prony s method prony 1795 besides the advantage that it avoids the ill conditioned problem of solving the roots of a high order polynomial trefethen and david 1997 required in traditional prony s method the prony ss method also has better conditioning stability and accuracy over prony s method hu et al 2013 the merits of the proposed complex exponential model for the roll response lie in three aspects 1 it describes an exponentially decayed oscillation which meets the physics of free decay motion 2 it contains multiple components associated with multiple oscillating frequencies which properly accounts for the nonlinearities of roll motion and 3 the determination of the number of terms n ℓ in the prony ss method has been based on the concept of the principal component analysis which can effectively separate noises from the true free decay data another advantage of using eq 5 for φ t is that the first and second derivatives of free decay data can be readily obtained as 6 φ t ℓ 1 n ℓ λ ℓ α ℓ exp λ ℓ t and 7 φ t ℓ 1 n ℓ λ ℓ 2 α ℓ exp λ ℓ t note that both the roll velocity and acceleration time signals are needed for the estimation of nonlinear damping coefficients 4 estimation of nonlinear damping coefficients after the roll angle velocity and acceleration has been formulated as eqs 5 7 a straightforward procedure to estimate the nonlinear damping coefficients is developed below first substituting eq 4 into eq 2 gives 8 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 g φ 0 for now assume g φ is a known function at the discrete time instant t k k δ t eq 8 becomes 9 φ k μ 1 φ k μ 2 φ k φ k μ 3 φ k 2 φ k μ 4 φ k φ k μ 5 φ k 3 g φ k 0 where φ k φ t k φ k φ t k and φ k φ t k a set of n simultaneous linear equations can be formulated based on eq 9 for k 0 1 n 1 it can be written in the matrix form as 10 y μ y where 11 y φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 2 φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 φ 0 3 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 2 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 φ 1 3 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 2 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 φ n 1 3 12 μ μ 1 μ 2 μ 3 μ 4 μ 5 t and 13 y g φ 0 φ 0 g φ 1 φ 1 g φ n 1 φ n 1 for an over determined case the linear least squares solution for μ can be obtained as 14 μ y t y 1 y t y in passing if g φ has been modeled as eq 3 with unknown β m the same least squares solution procedure could have been expanded to include β m as additional variables to improve the accuracy of the estimated μ an error correction procedure can be followed chan et al 1995 the first step of this procedure is to generate φ t from the equation of motion with the estimated μ i e 15 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 g φ 0 while working on this newly synthesized φ t we follow the same solution method to estimate μ denoted as μ to distinguish it from μ since this synthesized data and the solution procedure share the same underlying model the difference between μ and μ is largely due to the solution method let the relative discrepancy between μ i and μ i i 1 5 be defined as 16 ε i μ i μ i μ i rearranging eq 16 gives 17 μ i μ i 1 ε i by following eq 17 we write the ultimate estimation of μ i defined as μ ˆ i to be 18 μ ˆ i μ i 1 ε i the use of eq 18 is to eliminate the error due to the solution procedure recognizing that modeling errors can never be removed 5 numerical studies four numerical examples with various f φ φ models are investigated the first two examples consider the commonly used linear plus quadratic and linear plus cubic damping models respectively detailed numerical illustrations are presented in addition the influence on the damping estimation due to the initial roll angle and the signal noise level is investigated the third example considers the full parameter damping model shown in eq 4 the intention is to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to a rather general form of the nonlinear damping the fourth example estimates system coefficients when both damping and restoring coefficients are treated as unknown demonstrating the versatility of the proposed method throughout the numerical examples the system of units is the mks meter kilogram second system based on measuring lengths in meters mass in kilograms and time in seconds for conciseness explicit units for quantities are omitted in the following presentation 5 1 example 1 linear plus quadratic damping in the first example the equation of roll motion is given as 19 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ 2 25 φ φ 3 0 this equation which contains a linear plus quadratic damping function and known cubic restoring function has been numerically studied in a previous article by chan et al 1995 a purpose of this example is to illustrate the procedure of the newly proposed method another goal is to examine the method s performance especially when a large initial roll angle and signal noise contamination is considered 5 1 1 detailed numerical illustration plotted in fig 1 is a simulated free decay roll motion for a duration of 10 s which contains only three peaks of the motion this simulated motion has been generated with δ t 0 01 by running the fourth order runge kutta algorithm on eq 19 based on the target damping coefficients μ 1 0 15 and μ 2 0 2 and the initial conditions φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 the prony ss method is employed to decompose the simulated φ t which has 1001 equally spaced data points as presented in appendix i the first step of the prony ss method is to determine the model order n ℓ displayed in fig 2 are the first 50 normalized singular values of the data hankel matrix h 0 501 500 recognizing that those singular values have been ranked from the largest value equal to 1 to the smallest value three significant drops can be observed at the singular indices 2 4 and 6 as the 7th normalized singular value nsv is already less than 0 1 of the first nsv the chosen threshold for omitting negligible components of the signal is set at 6 i e n ℓ 6 the next step of the prony ss method is to compute λ ℓ referring to eq 24 with n ℓ 6 we have u 1 r 501 6 s 1 r 6 6 and v 1 r 500 6 from the truncated singular value decomposition svd of h 0 501 500 sequentially we utilize eq 26 to compute a the eigenvalues of a are denoted as z ℓ ℓ 1 6 and λ ℓ are obtained from ln z ℓ δ t in the final step of the prony ss method eq 27 is employed to compute α ℓ the three pairs of complex conjugate values of λ ℓ and α ℓ are listed in table 1 also tabulated in table 1 are the corresponding frequencies ω ℓ and damping factors δ ℓ extracted from λ ℓ δ ℓ i ω ℓ as well as the corresponding amplitudes a ℓ and initial phases θ ℓ obtained from α ℓ a ℓ 2 exp i θ ℓ the decomposed three signal components of which each component is φ ℓ t a ℓ exp δ ℓ t cos ω ℓ t θ ℓ are shown in fig 3 noticing that the amplitude of the third component is already negligibly small compared to that of the first component the reconstructed roll motion based on the three decomposed components along with the original simulated φ t is plotted in fig 4 clearly they are in excellent agreement after φ t having been approximated as the sum of six complex exponential terms the corresponding φ t and φ t are readily obtained from eqs 6 and 7 respectively then y and y are built in accordance with eqs 11 and 13 respectively finally the estimated damping coefficients computed by eq 14 are μ 1 0 1500 and μ 2 0 2003 the ultimate estimates for μ 1 and μ 2 have been denoted as μ ˆ 1 and μ ˆ 2 which are the corrections from μ 1 and μ 2 using μ 1 0 1500 and μ 2 0 2003 for μ 1 and μ 2 in eq 19 and repeating the whole computation process we obtain μ 1 0 1500 and μ 2 0 2007 after following eq 16 for computing the relative error we obtain ε 1 0 and ε 2 0 0017 respectively from eq 18 the ultimate estimates of damping coefficients are then obtained as μ ˆ 1 0 1500 and μ ˆ 2 0 2000 which match perfectly with the target damping coefficients specified earlier 5 1 2 sensitivity study on initial roll angles most traditional methods for the roll damping identification were developed under the restriction of small initial roll angle which implies weak nonlinearity of restoring moment chan et al 1995 in this section the performance of the proposed method for a variety of initial roll angles is investigated in this example as g φ 2 25 φ φ 3 φ must be less than 1 5 to have g φ 0 from g φ 0 the maximum of g φ occurs at φ 0 866 in the previous section the initial roll angle φ 0 has been chosen equal to 0 3 we repeat the same effort for 0 4 φ 0 1 4 and the resulting estimates of μ i μ i and μ ˆ i i 1 and 2 are listed in table 2 also tabulated in table 2 is the relative error η i μ ˆ i μ i μ i while the accuracy of the estimation decreases with increasing initial roll angle all estimates are still very close to their corresponding target values even for very large initial roll angles in an identical numerical case study by chan et al 1995 their perturbation method was only valid for φ 0 0 866 furthermore the results of the proposed method are more accurate than those of chan et al 1995 for any initial roll angle 5 1 3 sensitivity study on signal noise measured data are always corrupted by random noise it has been long recognized that the sensitivity of the estimates to noise is of paramount importance roberts 1985 for investigating the effect of random noise two noisy signals are simulated by adding 2 and 5 random gaussian white noise respectively to the clean signal that has been generated from eq 19 with φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 displayed in fig 5 are the simulated noisy signals for 20 s long which is about four times the dominant oscillation period the level of the additive white noise has been quantified by a stated percentage defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the white noise σ noise to that of the noise free signal σ signal σ noise σ signal 100 when the signal to noise ratio or s n ratio is defined as s n 20 log 10 σ signal σ noise 2 and 5 noisy signals are corresponding to s n 33 98 db and 26 02 db respectively following the same procedure that was implemented to obtain fig 2 we plot fig 6 for the normalized singular value nsv curves of the two noisy signals together with that of the clean signal the two nsv curves from the noisy signals become flat at the 5th singular value suggesting that n ℓ 4 should be taken for those noisy signals actually the third component of the clean signal was so weak that it has been completely buried in the added noise the reconstructed signals based on taking n ℓ 4 for the two noisy signals are compared to the clean signal in fig 7 from visual observation both the reconstructed signals agree well with the clean signal after carrying out the proposed method for the two noisy signals the corresponding ultimate estimates μ ˆ 1 and μ ˆ 2 are listed in table 3 as expected the estimated damping coefficients of the 5 noise signal are less accurate than those of the 2 noise signal however they are still close to the target values 5 2 example 2 linear plus cubic damping while the previous example considered a linear plus quadratic damping model the current example studies a linear plus cubic model for comparing the performance of the proposed method to that of a traditional method a numerical case study investigated by chan et al 1995 is chosen in this example the equation of roll motion is given as 20 φ μ 1 φ μ 3 φ 3 24 φ 24 φ 3 0 solving eq 20 with the target damping coefficients μ 1 0 2 and μ 3 0 1 by the fourth order runge kutta algorithm a test free decay roll motion see fig 8 has been generated based on initial conditions φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 for a duration of 3 s similar tasks conducted in example 1 will be repeated for the current example the following presentation however will emphasize on the results while the detailed description of the procedure will be omitted to avoid unnecessary repetition the simulated roll motion signal has 301 equally spaced data points displayed in fig 8 is the nsv diagram obtained based on h 0 151 150 from this nsv diagram n ℓ is set qual to 6 the resulting three pairs of complex conjugate values of λ ℓ and α ℓ are listed in table 4 together with the corresponding ω ℓ δ ℓ a ℓ and θ ℓ the decomposed three signal components are shown in fig 9 and the reconstructed roll motion based on the three decomposed components along with the original simulated φ t are plotted in fig 10 clearly they are in excellent agreement for φ 0 0 3 the resulting estimates for μ i μ i and μ ˆ i i 1 and i 3 are summarized in table 5 the ultimate estimates of damping coefficients are μ ˆ 1 0 2000 and μ ˆ 3 0 1000 which match perfectly with the target damping coefficients 5 2 1 sensitivity study on initial roll angles as g φ 24 φ 24 φ 3 φ must be less than 1 to have g φ 0 and the maximum of g φ occurs at φ 0 577 the values of μ i μ i and μ ˆ i i 1 and 3 for initial roll angle between 0 4 and 0 8 are also listed in table 5 all estimates are very close to their corresponding target values even for very large initial roll angles compared to the results of an identical numerical case study in chan et al 1995 the results of the proposed method are more accurate for any initial roll angle 5 2 2 sensitivity study on signal noise two 8 s noisy signals see fig 11 are simulated by adding 5 and 10 random gaussian white noise respectively to the clean signal that has been generated from eq 20 with φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 the corresponding s n ratio for the two signals are 26 02 db and 20 db respectively the nsv curves of the two noisy signals together with that of the clean signal are plotted in fig 12 after taking n ℓ 4 the reconstructed signals for the two noisy signals are compared to the clean signal in fig 13 which shows that both reconstructed signals agree well with the clean signal conducting the proposed method for these two reconstructed signals yields the ultimate estimates μ ˆ 1 and μ ˆ 3 see table 6 which are close to the target values 5 3 example 3 a rather general form of damping in example 3 the equation of roll motion is given as 21 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ μ 3 φ 2 φ μ 4 φ φ μ 5 φ 3 2 25 φ φ 3 φ 5 0 which contains a full parameter damping model and a known quintic restoring function based on the target damping coefficients μ 1 0 2 μ 2 0 15 μ 3 0 35 μ 4 0 1 and μ 5 0 14 and the initial conditions φ 0 0 8 and φ 0 0 a simulated free decay roll motion with δ t 0 01 for a duration of 20 s see fig 14 has been generated by the same procedure used in previous examples due to strong nonlinearities in both the damping and restoring functions it is expected that more components are needed to better approximate φ t from the nsv diagram which has been obtained based on h 0 1001 1000 shown in fig 14 n ℓ is set equal to 15 shown in fig 15 is the reconstructed roll motion based on fifteen complex exponential terms together with the original simulated φ t clearly they are in good agreement implementing the proposed approach obtains the results shown in table 7 it shows that the estimated damping coefficients are very close to the target values also shown in table 7 are the results based on n ℓ 9 which are acceptable but not as good as those based on n ℓ 15 5 4 example 4 estimation on nonlinear damping and restoring coefficients the same equation of roll motion in example 1 is considered here but the coefficients of the restoring function are treated as unknown variables 22 φ μ 1 φ μ 2 φ φ β 1 φ β 3 φ 3 0 in the simulation of a free decay roll motion the initial conditions and μ 1 μ 2 β 1 and β 3 are the same as those in example 1 that is μ 1 0 15 μ 2 0 2 β 1 2 25 β 3 1 φ 0 0 3 and φ 0 0 referring back to example 1 the simulated φ t has been approximated by six complex exponentials see table 1 treating β m as additional variables we build y and y accordingly and obtain the estimates of the damping and restoring coefficients listed in table 8 the ultimate estimates of μ ˆ 1 μ ˆ 2 and β ˆ 1 match perfectly with the target values while β ˆ 3 is just less than 2 off its target value 6 concluding remarks for estimating nonlinear roll damping coefficients an efficient and versatile method which required only a short free decay roll motion data was developed the first step of the proposed method was to approximate the roll motion as the sum of several complex exponential components obtained by using the prony ss method because the underlying principle of the prony ss method is the principal components analysis through a truncated singular value decomposition random noise embedded in the measured roll motion could be largely removed sequentially the analytical derivatives of the roll motion could be readily obtained the proposed method was versatile in the sense that the same data driven analysis was valid for various nonlinear damping and restoring moment models numerical examples using simulated free decay data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method even under the situation that the simulated data were significantly corrupted by random noise another merit demonstrated through a numerical example was that the developed method performed well when nonlinear restoring parameters were treated as unknown

rank of h 0 is n ℓ mathematically the singular values should go to zero when the rank of the matrix is exceeded but for measured data involving random errors or inconsistencies some singular values will not be exactly zero but will exhibit very small quantities the determination of n ℓ could be done based on the magnitudes of the singular values having ordered sequentially from the largest to
